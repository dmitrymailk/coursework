The scientists looked at biodiversity changes over the past 200 years. Humans have seriously damaged biodiversity in over half of rivers. There are many reasons for this. One reason is new species of fish that are in rivers. Other reasons include pollution, dams and climate change.The worst-hit rivers are in the big cities of Europe and America. The lead researcher said rivers which have the most economic development near them, like the Mississippi River or River Thames, are the most strongly impacted.

It is a decimal point followed by 20 zeros and then a 1. The scientists study atomic physics. They used special tools to measure how long it takes a photon to cross a hydrogen molecule. The scientists said it took 247 zeptoseconds for this to happen. This is too fast for humans to see. In 1999, a scientist measured the speed at which molecules change their shape. He found this was one femtosecond, which is a millionth of a billionth of one second. One millisecond is a thousandth of one second. This is the time it takes a neuron in our brain to fire.

"Dog owners in Alaska and Canada are buying special vests for their pets. The vests are to protect the pets from attacks by bald eagles. In recent weeks, a number of pet dogs have been taken away by the birds of prey. The number of bald eagles has risen greatly in Alaska. There have been many conservation efforts, which has seen the bald eagle population increase. Conservationists estimate there are now around 30,000 of the eagles in Alaska. While bird lovers are happy about this, pet owners are worried. The eagles have a 2.4-metre wingspan. They are strong enough to pick up and fly away with a 6-kilogram animal. The eagles are already a nuisance for farmers as they are killing chickens.The special vest that pet owners are buying is called the CoyoteVest. It is a protective jacket that was designed to protect small dogs from coyotes. A coyote is a wild dog that is similar to a wolf. It is common across North America. The CoyoteVest has a variety of spikes and other sharp things on it to protect the pet. Some of the vests have brightly coloured whiskers that are meant to scare birds away. It is made of a material called Kevlar, which is used in bulletproof vests. The Kevlar protects a small dog from the teeth of a larger dog.

"A man who cannot move his arms or hands has used his thoughts to write on a computer screen. The man has been paralyzed from the neck down for almost a decade. Scientists from Stanford University in the USA implanted two tiny sensors into the man's brain. The scientists gave this method two names - ""brain-to-text"" and ""mindwriting"". The man wants to remain anonymous, so scientists have called him T5. He became paralyzed after suffering a spinal cord injury ten years ago. The implants have allowed T5 to use his mind to write. He can write 90 characters (about 18 words) per minute. This is five words slower than the average person writing a text message on a smartphone.The mindwriting system is very simple, but it involved a lot of advanced technology. Scientists asked T5 to imagine holding a pen and then writing a sentence on a paper. The sensors in T5's brain detected the activity in his brain as he imagined writing. A computer decoded this activity into text on a screen. The scientists used a special algorithm to do this. Professor Jaimie Henderson, a Stanford University researcher, hopes this research could help millions of paralyzed people, and those who have lost the ability to speak, to write again. He said: ""The goal is to restore their ability to communicate by text.""

Computer chip technology has advanced at a fast rate. We can now stream movies on our smartphones and store huge amounts of data. IBM has announced it has made a significant breakthrough in microchip power. It has created chips that improve performance by 45 per cent. Its new chips also use 75 per cent less energy. This is good for the environment, and means batteries will be more energy efficient. The technology could quadruple mobile phone battery life. We might only need to charge our phones every four days.IBM has greatly improved its microchips by reducing their size. The tech giant has created a two-nanometre chip. Computer engineers use nanometres to measure the size of chips. One nanometre is just a billionth of a metre. A chip that is 2nm in size is incredibly small. IBM says its 2nm processor can store 50 billion transistors on ""a chip the size of a fingernail"". Computer expert Peter Rudden said: ""We have seen semiconductor manufacturers moving from 14nm to 10nm to 7nm, with 7nm being a real challenge for some.""

"Governments, army leaders and diplomats spend months, years or even decades creating borders between countries. A farmer in Belgium did not need so long. It took him just a few minutes to change the border between Belgium and France. He made Belgium about 1,000 square meters bigger and France about 1,000 square meters smaller. How? He moved a 150-kilogram boundary stone 2.29 metres inside France. A boundary stone shows where the border between two countries or areas lies. The stone the farmer relocated was laid down in 1819 to mark the French-Belgian border. The farmer did not move the stone for political reasons. He did it to make it easier to drive his tractor around his field. Moving the border between two countries could easily create a major diplomatic incident or even lead to war. Luckily, diplomats in Belgium and France saw the funny side of this. They avoided an international crisis in a friendly manner. The mayor of the Belgian town said: ""The stone was placed there in 1819 following the defeat of Napoleon. The situation should be resolved tomorrow.

They created a special computer algorithm to find which photos attracted the most ""likes"" on the photo-sharing platform. Ornithologist Tim Snyder suggested the frogmouth was the most liked bird because of its large eyes and wide beak. He said that while most birds' eyes are positioned on the sides of their head, the frogmouth's eyes are more in the centre of its face, which makes the bird appear more ""humanlike"".

Stink bugs were accidentally introduced to the USA in the mid-1990s and are now a problem for farmers in 44 states.Stink bugs feed by piercing the surface of fruits and vegetables and then sucking out the juice. This makes the fruit rotten where the insects pierce the skin. It means farmers cannot sell the crops. The fruit quite often ends up as juice.

Zoologists from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City have found out which animal has the biggest ears relative to its body size. And the answer is... the long-eared jerboa. Not many people know about this cute, big-eared creature. It is a rodent. It lives in the deserts of China and Mongolia. It is a nocturnal creature, which means it is active at night and sleeps during the day.Zoologist Mary Ellen Holden described the jerboa. She said its body measures about 10 centimetres (not counting its long tail). Its ears are 3.8 to 5cm long. This means its ears are 40 to 50 per cent as long as its body length. The elephant's ears are just 17 per cent of its body length. Professor Holden said: ""The jerboa has the longest ears for the size of its body in the entire animal kingdom."" Professor Holden explained why some animals have large ears. They usually live in very hot areas. Large ears help an animal to keep cool in the heat.

They examined data on over 2,500 rivers around the world. They did not look at rivers in the polar regions of the Arctic and Antarctica or in deserts. The scientists looked into changes to biodiversity over the past 200 years. They discovered that biodiversity in over half of rivers has been seriously damaged by humans. The researchers said there were many reasons for this damage. A big reason is the introduction of new species of fish into rivers. Other reasons include pollution, dams, overfishing, farming and climate change.The researchers say the worst-hit rivers are in western Europe and North America. This is because these regions have large and rich towns and cities. The lead researcher said: ""Rivers which have the most economic development around them, like the Mississippi River, are the most strongly impacted."" The River Thames in London was one of the worst-affected rivers in the study. The least-impacted rivers are in Africa and Australia. The researcher said: ""This is probably due to a slower rate of industrialisation in Africa and low population density around rivers in Australia."" He added that rivers in many rich nations are unrecognisable compared with how they were 200 years ago.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2102/210221-rivers.html,breakingnewsenglish,

Professor Wang, who teaches maths, was not aware that throughout his online presentation, the microphone on his computer was switched off. This meant that none of the students attending his online class heard what professor Wang was talking about. His university switched his classes online to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. His lecture started well but then it froze. The video came back but the mic was off and professor Wang did not notice. One of his students says it might have been because the professor was using an iPad and not a computer.Students tried many times to contact professor Wang during the lesson but could not get through to him. They waved their arms and even tried calling him on his personal phone. A video of the moment he understood his mic was off has gone viral on the Internet. It has received more than 653,000 views. After realizing what happened, professor Wang appeared shocked and stressed. He said he was upset at the thought of wasting two hours of his students' time.

"Scientists say they have discovered what could be the smallest reptile in the world. It is a kind of chameleon and is the size of a sunflower seed. Chameleons are usually around 35-40cm long. Scientists found two of the tiny lizards - a male and a female - in the mountains in northern Madagascar. They are just 22mm long from nose to tail. The length of the male's body is 13.5mm. At first, the scientists thought the tiny reptiles were juveniles, but later realised they were fully-grown adults. The scientists called the miniature creatures nano-chameleons. The scientists tried to find more of the nano-chameleons, but ""despite great effort"" could not find any others. Madagascar is home to two-thirds of the world's chameleon species. Scientists believe they may have originated there. However, the chameleon's survival is threatened by deforestation on the island. One of the scientists said the nano-chameleons are lucky to survive.  He said: ""The nano-chameleon's habitat has unfortunately been subject to deforestation, but the area was placed under protection recently, so the species will survive."" A study published by the journal ""Nature Climate Change"" stated that nearly all of Madagascar's eastern rainforest could disappear by 2070 if deforestation and climate change does not slow down.

"If you have trouble sleeping at certain times of the month, it could be because of a full moon. Scientists from the University of Washington say there is a link between the lunar cycle and sleeping patterns. They say that on nights when there is a full moon, people could experience more restless sleep. The reason for this could be the Moon's changing brightness. When there is a full moon, the extra brightness in the night sky could interrupt our sleep. The scientists said: ""Moonlight is so bright to the human eye that it is entirely reasonable to imagine that, in the absence of other sources of light, this source of nocturnal light could have had a role in [changing] human nocturnal activity and sleep.""The scientists conducted a study of the sleep patterns of over 500 people. Each person wore a special wristband that tracked their sleep. The study included 98 people from an isolated village in rural Argentina. These people did not have access to electricity and other artificial light sources. Their sleep patterns were compared to 464 people living in U.S. city of Seattle, which has lots of artificial light pollution.

The bubbles are called Zorb balls. The band played two concerts in their native city of Oklahoma. All band members were also inside their own Zorb bubble. There were 100 bubbles at the shows. Some of the bubbles contained three people. The bubbles may be one way for concerts to go ahead during the pandemic. Each bubble has a special speaker, a water bottle, a battery-operated fan, a towel and an ""I gotta go pee/hot in here"" sign. Workers refill the bubble with cool air if it gets too hot.The idea for the bubble concerts came from the band's lead singer Wayne Coyne.

A big problem for electric cars is charging the battery. Some batteries in today's electric cars can take up to 12 hours to charge fully. However, a company in Israel says it has created a lithium-ion battery that people can charge in just five minutes. This is the same amount of time it takes to fill a tank of gas with petrol. The new lithium-ion batteries were developed by the Israeli company StoreDot. They are being manufactured by a Chinese company called Eve Energy.The new batteries could totally transform driving.

However, humans could not slow their metabolism like a bear. Bears can wake up after months of hibernation and their body will be the same as when they went into hibernation.

The researchers worry this could have a negative impact on Japan's tourist industry. They even say the increasing amount of unsuitable words is becoming a ""national embarrassment"" in Japan.The research team says computer software gives odd or incorrect translations for individual kanji - the Chinese characters used in Japanese writing. There are many examples of this, including ""Hello Work"" - the name for job centres, and ""Go To Travel"" a plan to help tourism in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. The team says software creates, ""unintentionally funny translations that could easily be corrected if they were just checked by an English speaker"". Businesses also create this English. The Christmas message being used by the Seibu Sogo department store has raised eyebrows. It says ""Stay Positive."" Many people believe this is the wrong thing to say during coronavirus and ""Stay Happy"" would be better.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2011/201121-japanese-english.html,breakingnewsenglish,

This could also help to protect fish and other sea life that are endangered. Researchers from the University of Queensland in Australia conducted a study of fishing around the world. They discovered that fishing nets caught 92 endangered species of seafood and 11 species of marine life classed as ""critically endangered"". The researchers said this was not illegal as the creatures were not protected. Researcher Dr Leslie Robertson said: ""Despite national and international commitments to protect threatened species, we actively fish for many of these threatened species.""The researchers warned we are eating species of fish and other sea life that are on the brink of extinction. They suggested that eating jellyfish could help protect fish that are in danger of disappearing from our seas and oceans. Jellyfish could become a common sight on menus, and we could ask for jellyfish and chips instead of fish and chips. The researchers said jellyfish could be a sustainable alternative at seafood restaurants and fish shops. Dr Robertson said seafood is ""not as sustainable as consumers would like to think"".

It is called a zeptosecond. This is a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of one second. It is a trillionth of a billionth of a second. This is a decimal point followed by 20 zeros and then a 1. The scientists study atomic physics at the Goethe University in Germany. They used special high-tech equipment to measure how long it takes a photon to cross a hydrogen molecule. The scientists said it took 247 zeptoseconds for this to happen. This is too small for the human eye to see, and the time it takes is too fast for humans to sense.In 1999, Ahmed Zewail, an Egyptian chemist won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for measuring the speed at which molecules change their shape. He found that one femtosecond equals 0.000000000000001 seconds. This is a decimal point followed by 14 zeros and then a 1, or a millionth of a billionth of one second. The zeptosecond measures things in terms of the speed of light. It is difficult for the human mind to understand these measurements. One millisecond is a thousandth of one second.

The toilet walls are transparent - you can see the white toilets and sinks from the outside. However, when the door is locked, the special film and glass walls suddenly become opaque so no one on the outside can see inside.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2008/200821-the-tokyo-toilet.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Gigantic ""terror crocodiles"" that were as large as buses once roamed the Earth. This terrifying picture comes from a study that was published this week in the ""Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology"". The study is from universities in the USA. Researchers who are experts in paleontology - the study of dinosaurs - studied ancient bones found in North America. They said that the dinosaurs lived along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of what is now Canada and the USA. The giant beasts preyed on other dinosaurs and were up to ten metres in length. The researchers discovered that the prehistoric crocodiles had razor-sharp teeth that were the size of large bananas. Co-author of the study Dr Adam Cossette gave details of how he thought the crocodiles lived. He said they lived between 75 and 82 million years ago and are the ancestors of today's crocodiles and alligators. He wrote about his research on the bone parts he studied. He said: ""Until now, the complete animal was unknown. These new specimens we've examined reveal a bizarre, monstrous predator with teeth the size of bananas."" He added that it was, ""a giant that must have terrorised other dinosaurs that came to the water's edge to drink."" Another co-author of the study described how scary the beast was. She wrote: ""It was so enormous, almost everything in its habitat was on the menu.""",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2008/200813-giant-crocodiles.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Scientists from MIT have discovered why razor blades become blunt after repeated use. They did research into why razor blades lose their sharpness. Razor blades are 50 times harder than the hairs they cut. Even though human hair is 50 times softer than the metal of a razor blade, the hair damages the edge of the blade. Razor blades are made from stainless steel. They are usually coated with tougher materials like hardened carbon. The MIT scientists said that each time a blade cuts a hair, the hair causes tiny amounts of damage. A blade usually cuts thousands of hairs in one shaving session. This means the life of a razor blade is limited and will need to be replaced regularly.The researchers used powerful microscopes to find out how hair damages a razor blade. They got a close-up view of what happens during a shave when the blade cuts a hair. The blade gets damaged in a variety of ways. One way is that a single hair creates a tiny chip on the edge of a blade. This chip becomes bigger as it cuts more hair. After more shaving, the blade loses its ability to cut cleanly and becomes blunt. A researcher said: ""We are metallurgists and want to...make better metals. In this case, it was intriguing that if you cut something very soft, like human hair, with something very hard, like steel, the hard material would fail."" He said his team is ""aiming to solve an important engineering problem"".",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2008/200809-shaving.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"The on-off talks between Microsoft and the parent company of TikTok are back on again. Microsoft has been interested in buying part of TikTok for many months. The tech giant has been in talks with the parent company ByteDance Ltd. Discussions between the two companies came to a halt last week when US President Donald Trump suggested that he might ban TikTok from the USA. He was worried that the personal details of over 100 million Americans could get into the wrong hands. President Trump changed his mind at the weekend after the CEO of Microsoft phoned him. Microsoft said it ""would ensure that all private data of TikTok's American users is transferred to and remains in the United States.""TikTok is the latest social media platform to become hugely popular around the globe. Users upload very short videos of themselves lip-syncing to well-known songs, dancing, making funny faces or doing other humorous things. TikTok's owner ByteDance is a Beijing-based Internet company founded in 2012 by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming. It now has over 800 million users worldwide. Microsoft is offering ByteDance $50 billion for the operations in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. However the business website Bloomberg disagrees with that valuation.

"Two emus have been banned from entering a hotel in Australia's Outback. The emu is the world's second-largest living bird by height and is native to Australia. The two banned emus are siblings (brother and sister). The four-room Yaraka Hotel in the state of Queensland barred the giant birds because of bad behaviour. The birds are called Kevin and Carol. They were well known at the hotel for popping in for a few biscuits or a slice of toast. However, recently, the two birds have become a nuisance to the guests staying at the hotel. Co-owner Chris Gimblett has put rope across the stairs leading up to the hotel to keep the birds out. There is also a sign for guests saying: ""Please let yourself through the emu barrier.""One of the reasons for the emu ban is that the birds have learned to climb the stairs. They have been wandering up to the hotel's bedrooms and shocking guests in the corridor. Mr Gimblett said: ""Travellers have to be very cautious with the emus because they will poke their heads in...and drink all the coffee...and steal your toast. And if you have a barbecue, watch out because they'll take everything."" He added: ""You don't want to get between an emu and its food. They've got very sharp beaks and they're a bit like a vacuum cleaner where food is concerned.""

"How many times has your heart sunk after dropping your smartphone and worrying if you smashed the glass? There may be an answer to reduce that feeling. The glass used to make the screens on many of the world's smartphones just got tougher. Corning, the company that makes the glass, has just made a stronger version. It is called Gorilla Glass and has been used in smartphones for many years. Corning has greatly improved the glass to make it more difficult to scratch, crack or smash. The new product is called Gorilla Glass Victus. It can survive drops of up to two metres without any signs of damage. It is also two times more scratch-resistant than other glass.Corning spokesperson John Bayne told reporters about the new product. He said: ""Dropped phones can result in broken phones, but as we developed better glass, phones survived more drops. However, they also showed more visible scratches, which can impact the usability of a device."" He said it was important to develop a new glass that could survive drops from greater heights and be more difficult to scratch. He added: ""Instead of...asking our technologists to focus on a single goal (making the glass better for either drop or scratch), we asked them to focus on improving both drop and scratch, and they delivered with Gorilla Glass Victus.""

"The United Nations has come up with a plan to help slow the spread of COVID-19. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) said the world's poorest people should get a basic income. It said the introduction of a ""Temporary Basic Income"" for the world's poorest people could slow the current surge in coronavirus cases. The money would allow around 2.7 billion people to stay at home. This would reduce the chances of them spreading the virus. The UNDP suggested giving the money to poor people in 132 developing countries. The cost of this would be around $199 billion per month. It said: ""Unprecedented times call for unprecedented social and economic measures.""The UNDP said the basic income would mean directing money to people instead of economies. It said: ""Bailouts and recovery plans cannot only focus on big markets and big business. A Temporary Basic Income would allow governments to give people in lockdown a financial lifeline, inject cash back into local economies to help keep small businesses afloat, and slow the devastating spread of COVID-19."" It pointed out that the poor are the hardest hit by the pandemic. There are huge numbers of people without social insurance and many workers without contracts.

The extra cash means that nurses and care workers will get an extra $208 a month in their pay packet. Doctors who work in the public sector will also get more money. France's Prime Minister said the pay rise was to recognise the efforts of health workers during the coronavirus pandemic. During the outbreak, millions of French people applauded and clapped their nurses and doctors. This caused the government to reward them with a rise in pay. The Prime Minister told reporters that: ""No one can deny that this is a historic moment for our health system.""

"Researchers say they have discovered how humans got teeth. The researchers are from Uppsala University in Sweden. They say that human teeth ""first evolved 400 million years ago"". They believe our teeth came from an ancient fish called an acanthothoracid. The researchers studied a fossil of the fish. It was difficult to study because the fish is encased in rock. The researchers had to use the strongest X-ray machine in the world to analyse it. They used the X-ray machine to ""digitally dissect"" the fish. The researchers discovered that the fish's teeth were amazingly similar to human teeth. The researchers also said humans and 60,000 species of jawed vertebrates living on Earth today come from this fish.The researchers say the acanthothoracid was one of the earliest jawed vertebrates with teeth ever to live. They were very excited at seeing how similar its teeth were to ours. A co-author of the study, Professor Per Ahlberg, said: ""These findings change our whole understanding of the origin of teeth."" He commented on the similarity to the fish, saying: ""Their jawbones resemble those of bony fish and seem to be directly ancestral to our own.

Doctors say a three-minute daily dose of the special red light for two weeks could help improve age-related vision problems. However, they say not any red light will help improve eyesight. The co-author of a study into the effects of red light and vision in older people explained why. Professor Glen Jeffery said:  ""I strongly suggest that people do not just go and buy a red light off the web. They have to produce the right wavelength and be reliable.

"A group of penguins became a tour group for the day when they visited an art museum. The penguins were from the Kansas City Zoo in the USA. The zoo teamed up with the nearby Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. Bosses of both the zoo and the art museum decided the penguins needed a change of scenery. The penguins were getting lonely because the zoo is closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. They are used to seeing many visitors every day. A zoo official said: ""Quarantine has caused everyone to go a little stir crazy, even the residents of the Kansas City Zoo. So several of the penguins decided to go on a field trip to the Nelson-Atkins, which is still closed, to get a little culture.""The zoo's executive director, Randy Wisthoff, said the penguins have missed their regular interactions with zoo visitors. He said: ""We're always looking for ways to enrich their lives and stimulate their days. During this shutdown period, our animals really miss visitors coming up to see them."" The museum director joked that the penguins liked the art of Italian artists. He said: ""They seemed to react much better to Caravaggio than to Monet."" He added: ""We are so happy today to welcome our colleagues from the zoo and they've brought special friends and we're seeing how they react to art.""

"Police from around the world have worked together to find lots of missing art. The detectives were from Interpol, Europol and many national police forces. The World Customs Organization also helped with the search. The police officers found more than 19,000 items of artwork. These include an ancient Colombian gold mask that is over 600 years old. There was also a carved Roman lion, centuries-old jewellery, and thousands of ancient coins. Many of the items the police recovered were stolen from museums and archaeological sites. A lot of them were taken from countries at war. The thieves took cultural treasures while countries were in a mess because of fighting civil wars or wars against other countries.The police arrested 101 art traffickers around the world. The art thieves were from Spain, Colombia, Latvia, Afghanistan and Turkey.  Interpol said they spent a long time monitoring online marketplaces to find the art and the thieves. Interpol's secretary-general Jürgen Stock spoke to journalists about how big the operation was. He said: ""The number of arrests and objects shows the scale and global reach of the illicit trade in cultural artefacts, where every country with a rich heritage is a potential target."" Interpol added: ""Organised crime has many faces. The trafficking of cultural goods is one of them. It is not a glamorous business run by flamboyant gentlemen forgers, but by international criminal networks.""",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2005/200511-artwork.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"There are some scary insects in this world. Few of them are as scary and as venomous as the Asian giant hornet. These fearsome creatures are common in Japan and Korea but are now moving across the Pacific Ocean to the USA and Canada. The hornets kill around 40 people a year in Japan. They also destroy and wipe out colonies of honeybees. A hornet attack can leave piles of dead bees, most of them headless, in their beehive. A few dozen hornets can kill an entire colony of 30,000 bees in a few hours. Authorities in Washington State on the west coast of the USA have warned people to look out for the hornets. Beekeepers are now worried about their beehives. The hornets are big. They measure about five centimeters in length. They also look scary. Washington bee breeder Susan Cobey said: ""They're like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face."" The sting of the hornet is extremely painful. A Vancouver beekeeper described the pain. He said: ""It was like having red-hot thumbtacks driven into my flesh."" He said the sting was ""excruciating"". The hornet's stinger is half a centimeter long. It can get through the protective clothing beekeepers wear. Another beekeeper said: ""They give a warning before they sting. They snap their jaws and make a clicking sound.

"An aquarium in Japan is asking people to help a group of eels that are getting lonely. The Sumida Aquarium in Tokyo has several tanks of garden eels. The creatures are usually very cautious and go into their holes in the sand when someone passes. However, the Sumida Aquarium eels are used to seeing visitors and stay above their holes so people can see them. The aquarium has closed because of the coronavirus emergency and staff are worried the eels are getting lonely. A staff member said the eels are forgetting what humans look like. She wants people to make video calls to the eels. The staff put special tablets in front of the eel tanks so people could make video calls to them.The lack of visitors to the aquarium means the eels have become very shy. This could make them stressed when visitors start returning after the aquarium reopens. The coronavirus emergency has also made it difficult for staff to check on the eels' health because they are now staying in their holes in the sand. The aquarium tweeted: ""They aren't seeing humans so they are forgetting about us....Here is an urgent request  -  Could you show your face to our garden eels from your home?""

The streaming giant said 15.77 million new subscribers signed up for its services in the past three months. It expected an increase of around half this number. The doubling of subscriptions is due to the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of people are staying at home and are using their free time by watching films and TV programmes. Netflix is now one of the world's most valuable companies. It is worth more than the oil giant ExxonMobil.

The company said they were surprised by the people's answers. Only nine per cent of Britons want life to return to ""normal"" after the coronavirus outbreak is over. This means 91 per cent want life to be different to how it was before the pandemic started. Over half of people (54%) said they hoped to change the way they live their lives. Lead researcher Professor Tom MacMillan said: ""This data shows there is a real appetite for change, and for the nation to learn from this crisis.""Most of the people in the survey said they noticed big changes because of the lockdown. Just over half (51%) have noticed cleaner air outdoors, and 27 per cent have seen more wildlife in the past month. This may encourage people to use cars less when the lockdown ends. Maybe more people will work from home. Many people (42%) said they value food more, and 38 per cent said they are now cooking using recipes and not buying ready-made meals.

"Archaeologists have discovered the oldest piece of string ever found. The archaeologists are very happy about their find. The first reason they are happy is that the string they found is around 50,000 years old. The second reason is that the string shows that Neanderthals were more intelligent than we previously thought they were. Neanderthals were an early species of humans that became extinct about 35,000 years ago. The string shows that Neanderthals had a good understanding of plants and textiles. The archaeologists say Neanderthals may have used the string to make clothes, bags, rope, mats and other things. This means they were probably as intelligent as modern humans.The piece of string that the archaeologists found was tiny but it reveals a lot about how people lived 50,000 years ago. Dr Marie-Helene Moncel, director of research at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, said: ""We were able to uncover details about the fibres and we observed that they're different, twisted fibres. It is not possible to find these kinds of fibres in nature."" She added: ""In my opinion, different things can be related to this discovery.

"Many of us have an opinion on what was the best year for music. Some people say it was 1824. This is when the composer Ludwig van Beethoven first performed his Symphony No. 9. Other people say the best year was 1969 because of hit songs by The Beatles, David Bowie and Elvis Presley. The UK radio station Radio X recently conducted a survey and found the best year for music was 1991. This is because of the success of bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, R.E.M., Stone Roses and Nirvana. The reason for 1991 being the Radio X survey's best year for music could be the average age of the listeners of the station. Many of the listeners were teenagers in 1991 and have great memories of that year. A psychologist believes people tend to stick to the songs they heard when they were teenagers. Dr Catherine Loveday told the BBC why we like songs we first heard in our teens throughout our life. She said: ""It is during these [developmental] years that we make many crucial life-changing decisions. We start significant long-term relationships and establish the cultural and political beliefs which form our identity."" She added that: ""Music has an intrinsic capacity to regulate emotions [so] these songs naturally become embedded in our important memories, both positive and negative.""

"Conservation experts are saying that the trade in wildlife could be greatly cut after the coronavirus pandemic has finished. They say that the virus probably started at a market selling wild animals in China. The virus came from either a bat or an animal called a pangolin. It then crossed over to infect humans. The conservation group Humane Society International said: ""The consumption of wild animals which can carry diseases that can cross the species barrier poses a real threat to human health."" The Wildlife Conservation Society called for a ban of animal markets that trade in wildlife. It said: ""Not only will this help to prevent the spread of disease, it will address one of the major drivers of species extinction.""A spokesman from the Zoological Society of London said animal markets could be ""time bombs"". He said the markets can provide perfect conditions for new viruses to start and grow. He added that if we treated animals like goods to buy and sell, we would be in trouble again in the future. Scientists say many new outbreaks of viruses start in animals. About 75 per cent of new infectious diseases come from animals. Recent examples include SARS, MERS and Ebola.

The WHO and other health organisations have recommended that people who are not sick do not need to wear masks or cover their face. However, other organisations say face masks can slow the spread of the virus. They point to countries like Singapore and South Korea, where people wear masks and reported infection rates are lower.Health experts in the USA believe that wearing a mask could reduce the risk of people spreading the virus and give a little protection to those who have not contracted it. Health officials are worried that if everyone rushes out to buy masks, there may not be enough for nurses, doctors and other key workers. They also say that a mask could make the problem worse because people might feel safe wearing one and mix more with other people.

"New materials could be used to make buildings on the Moon. Scientists from Holland, Italy, Norway and Spain say a new kind of concrete could be made with moon dust and the urine passed by astronauts. The scientists said there is a chemical compound in human urine called urea. This could help things stick together to make a kind of concrete. Scientists would use 3D printers to create the construction material. Three of the world's main space agencies could start using this technique to make buildings for a permanent moon base. NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the China National Space Administration are all interested in colonizing the Moon with research stations.Using astronaut pee and moon dust could save scientists a lot of money.

Researchers used data from 672 people born in 1972-73. They looked at records of the people's antisocial behaviour between the ages of seven and 26. At the age of 45, the researchers scanned the people's brains. Eighty of the people had a history of criminal and antisocial behaviour from being early teenagers. Researchers found that the areas of the brain linked to emotions, motivation and behaviour control were smaller in the long-term criminals' brains.Professor Terrie Moffitt, a co-author of the research, said the research could help doctors understand what is behind long-term antisocial behaviour.

A new report says that many areas of the Amazon produce more CO2 than oxygen. The reverse is meant to happen. The Amazon is often called ""the lungs"" of the planet. It plays a vital role in helping the Earth's environment as it changes CO2 into oxygen.Brazil's Justice Minister, Sergio Moro, approved the setting up of a special security force to help track down and stop illegal loggers. There was a big increase in the amount of illegal logging in 2019. This happened at the same time as damaging fires that swept across large swathes of the rainforest.

"Finland is giving new parents more time to spend with their babies. The Finnish government has decided to give mothers and fathers seven months of parental leave. This means Finland will almost double the amount of its maternity leave and paternity leave. The new Family Leave Policy will give 164 days to each parent. This is about seven months. Parents can also transfer up to 69 of their own days to their partner. This means it is possible for one parent to take nine months of parental leave. For single parents, Finland is giving all 328 days to the mother or father. Finland's current parental leave gives four months for maternity leave, and two months for fathers.Finland's government said the new rules were necessary to help young families. Finland's Minister of Social Affairs and Health explained why the country is introducing the new rules. She said: ""The model guarantees the child a place at the centre of family benefits, and it promotes wellbeing and gender equality."" It will also help to increase the country's declining birth rate. The number of babies born in Finland has dropped for the past nine years. Last year, Finland had the lowest number of babies born in the country since 1868. Finland's neighbour Sweden has the most generous leave policy, offering 240 days per parent. The USA has no national paid leave for mothers or fathers.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2002/200209-maternity-leave.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"There are many reasons why Japanese people live longer than the rest of us. One reason might be soybean products like tofu, natto and miso. Scientists from the National Institute of Health and Nutrition in Tokyo conducted a study into the health benefits of soybeans and their products. They found that people who regularly ate tofu, natto and miso were 10 per cent less likely to die from common killers than people who ate no soybean products. Researchers said eating soybean-based food lowered the risk of death from heart attacks, stroke and other cardiovascular problems. They said: ""A higher intake of fermented soy products was associated with a lower risk of mortality.""Soybeans and fermented soybean products are superfoods. They are rich in protein, fibre and unsaturated fats. They are also a source of potassium and other minerals. Soy fibre can help to lower cholesterol and boost weight loss. Soy is an important part of the cuisine of East Asia, especially in Japan. People in Asia have eaten soy since ancient times. The most common types of soy products are tofu (soybean curd), natto (fermented soybeans), miso (a fermented soybean paste added to soups) and soy sauce. Some scientists say miso is high in salt. The researchers said salt in miso does not put people at risk of high blood pressure.

"The United Kingdom officially left the European Union on January the 31st, three-and-a-half years after the British people voted to leave. The U.K. government issued a special coin to mark the occasion. However, the coin is at the centre of an argument about punctuation. The new 50-pence coin became available yesterday. It has the words: ""Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations"" on its reverse side. A famous British writer, Sir Philip Pullman, is unhappy with the punctuation. He believes the phrase is incorrectly punctuated. Mr Pullman said there should be a comma after the word ""prosperity"". Such a comma is called an Oxford comma. He said the coin, ""should be boycotted by all literate people"".The Oxford comma gets its name from the Oxford University Press, which makes common use of the punctuation mark. In the USA, it is called the serial comma. It is used before the final ""and"" or ""or"" in a written list of three or more items. Many people say there is no need for an Oxford comma in the phrase on the 50-pence coin because the meaning is very clear. Word expert Susie Dent said the Oxford comma is useful if it makes it easier to understand the writer's meaning. A U.K. citizen said the comma issue wasn't important. She tweeted: ""It doesn't matter if there is a comma or not on the 50p coin. The most important thing is that there is peace, and prosperity, and friendship with all nations."" This is an example of how the Oxford (or serial) comma can change the meaning of a sentence.  In sentence one below, the writer talked to four people - her two sisters, plus a lady called Maya, and  another lady called Hana.

"Kitchen technology has reached new heights. Astronauts on the International Space Station have made the universe's first ever space-baked cookies. The ISS residents said the chocolate chip cookies looked out of this world. The cookies mark a first in space cookery. They are the very first kind of food to be baked in space from raw ingredients. Astronauts' food is usually pre-made on Earth. The food is dehydrated or pre-packaged and is heated or warmed up on the space station. The astronauts said eating freshly baked food will make them happy while on the space station. It will be a comforting reminder of home. This will be important for astronauts going to the moon or on the long journey to Mars.Baking the space cookies was not as straightforward as the astronauts thought it would be. On Earth, cookies take about 20 minutes to bake in an oven heated to 150 degrees Celsius (302 degrees Fahrenheit). That was not long enough in space. The first cookie came out totally undercooked. It was more raw dough than cookie. The space bakers turned up the oven's temperature and baked the dough for longer until they were successful. The fifth cookie they made took 130 minutes to bake. And the big question is - how do they taste? No one knows yet. The space-baked cookies are now in a laboratory in Houston, Texas.

"Everyone knows the names of big killers like cancer, heart disease and stroke, but few people are aware of one of the biggest killers - sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition. Doctors say it is responsible for one in five deaths worldwide. Sepsis happens when our body's response to an infection injures our own organs. Our body normally releases chemicals into the blood to fight an infection. Sepsis occurs when the body releases too many of these chemicals. The chemicals overload our organs and damage them. This damage can lead to organ failure and death. Doctors have traditionally called this blood poisoning. More than half of the sepsis cases reported worldwide occur in children, many of whom are newborn babies.A study into sepsis was published on January the 16th in the medical journal ""The Lancet"". Researchers estimated that over 50 million people a year develop sepsis and over 20 per cent die from the illness. This is more than double the percentage previously estimated. The researchers said sepsis kills more people than cancer. Professor Mohsen Naghavi, a senior author of the research, said: ""We are alarmed to find sepsis deaths are much higher than previously estimated, especially as the condition is both preventable and treatable."" He said more research is needed to stop sepsis killing newborns.

Ex-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn fled Japan to Lebanon on December the 30th. Courts in Tokyo were waiting to put Mr Ghosn on trial for fraud. Ghosn escaped from Japan even though the police had his three passports. Japan's justice minister, Masako Mori, said Japan would strengthen its border departure checks.

"Doctors have a new tool to use when diagnosing breast cancer. It is called Google Health, and of course comes from Google. The tool uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to recognise anything abnormal in breast tissue. Researchers trained the AI program to detect abnormalities. It read a huge number of results from X-rays over the past few years. X-rays are currently what doctors use to detect breast cancer. The Google Health program will help doctors in reading these X-rays more accurately. The current system is that two doctors agree on whether or not an X-ray shows cancer. If they cannot agree, they ask a third doctor. Google Health will make this diagnosis quicker.Researchers from Google Health worked with experts from Imperial College London to design the AI program. They trained the program by inputting X-rays from more than 76,000 women in the U.K. and more than 15,000 in the USA into its software. The software then produced an algorithm. In hospital tests, the algorithm did better at reading X-rays than six doctors.

A new study shows that chimpanzees could appreciate music. The researchers are from Kyoto University in Japan. They say their study could help us understand how early humans developed an interest in music. Researchers Dr Yuko Hattori and professor Masaki Tomonaga conducted tests on seven chimps. They played the apes six two-minute songs on a piano for six days. The researchers said the chimps had a definite sense of rhythm and it changed their mood. The male chimpanzees seemed to respond to the melodies more than the females.The researchers wrote that chimpanzees could have passed on a liking for music and dance to early humans millions of years ago. This could have happened via a common ancestor around six million years ago. The researchers said the study suggested that our love of dancing was deep inside the earliest humans.

"An employee who works for British Airways (BA) has told newspapers about the company creating more CO2. The unnamed person is a whistleblower - someone who tells the truth about company secrets. The whistleblower said BA and many other airlines use ""fuel-tankering"" to save money. However, fuel-tankering is very bad for the environment. Scientists say it adds to global warming. Fuel-tankering is when airplanes store extra fuel to get to their destination and back. This means the airline saves money by paying for all the fuel in its home country instead of buying more expensive fuel at its destination. Scientists say fuel-tankering puts as much CO2 in the air each year as a large town.A documentary about British Airways and fuel-tankering was shown on the BBC this week. In the documentary, the CEO of BA promised to look again at how it carries fuel. He said the airline uses the fuel-tankering method and said it was ""maybe the wrong thing to do"". The money saved by fuel-tankering for each flight is very small, but there is a big cost to the environment. A recent flight from London to Italy had three tons of extra fuel. The airline saved just $50 on the flight but an extra 600kg of CO2 was put into the atmosphere. Greenpeace said this was a ""classic example of a company putting profit before planet"". It said: ""They'll happily pour extra fuel on the fire for a small boost to their profit margin.""",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1911/191113-fuel-tankering.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Ten of Japan's famous bullet trains will be scrapped. They were caught in the floods after Typhoon Hagibis hit eastern Japan in October. The typhoon caused widespread damage and loss of life in Japan. There were many photos and TV footage of the 10 shiny bullet trains lined up next to each other at a train yard near the central city of Nagano. They were deep in floodwater after the nearby Chikuma River burst its banks. The trains used to run between Tokyo and a city on the Sea of Japan coast called Kanazawa. The line is now running 80 per cent of its normal services. The bullet train company said it hopes to be running a full service again by the end of March 2020.Bullet trains are called Shinkansen in Japan. They started in 1964 in time for the Tokyo Olympics. They became an iconic symbol of Japan and were the world's fastest trains. They currently reach speeds of 320kph. The bullet train rail network has expanded to currently consist of 2,764km. People take around 350 million rides a year on the Shinkansen. A Shinkansen president, Yuji Fukasawa, spoke about the flooded trains. He said the floodwater seriously damaged their motors and braking systems. The total cost of the damage is around $135 million. He said: ""For stability and safety, we [will] replace the trains with newly built ones instead of repairing them.""",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1911/191109-shinkansen-bullet-trains.html,breakingnewsenglish,

Researchers in the study said they used DNA to find out where modern humans came from. The researchers believe we all have roots in a region of northern Botswana, south of the Zambezi River. Humans were there 200,000 years ago. They lived there for at least 70,000 years before they moved around the African continent. They then started migrating to what is now Europe and Asia. Researcher Professor Vanessa Hayes, from the University of Sydney in Australia, said: ""We've known for a long time that modern humans originated in Africa roughly 200,000 years ago.""The researchers pinpointed an area called Okavango as being the place we come from. There used to be a huge lake there but it is now salt flats. The people had access to water, hunting and farmland. Scientists analyzed DNA samples from 200 people who live near the area today. They are from the Khoisan people. The Khoisan now live in modern-day South Africa and Namibia. They had a lot of DNA called L0, which is the oldest form of DNA known to be inside humans.

"Scientists in Russia got a shock when their phone bill arrived. The bill was a lot bigger than they expected it to be. The reason was because the steppe eagle they were following in their research flew too far from Russia. The scientists were tracking the eagle as it migrated across the European and Asian continents. The bird had SMS transmitters fitted to its body. This meant that when it flew outside Russia, the transmitters used the Internet services of other countries. The scientists thus had to pay data roaming charges. These are the charges you pay to use your mobile phone in other countries. The research team ran out of money after the eagle flew to Iran and Pakistan.The team started a page on a crowdfunding site to help raise money to pay the bill. The page was called ""Top up the eagle's mobile"". Bird lovers from around the world contributed money to the page. The scientists raised $1,600 to pay the bill. Russia's mobile phone operator Megafon then heard of the scientists' problems and offered to cancel the debt. It also moved the team's phone package to one at a cheaper rate. The problem for the team started when the eagle flew outside of Russia and Kazakhstan. An SMS in Kazakhstan cost 30 US cents, but one from Iran cost 50 cents.

"Researchers from a university in the UK have found that playing soccer can damage the mental health of players. A team of experts from Glasgow University discovered that former professional football players are three and a half times more likely to die of dementia than other people. The experts looked at whether or not heading a football could lead to brain damage. The research team looked into the deaths of 7,676 ex-soccer players who played in Scotland professionally between 1900 and 1976. The team compared the deaths of the former soccer players to the deaths of 23,000 people who did not regularly play football. They found that the football players suffered from a lot more brain injuries.The research was requested by the Football Association and the Professional Footballers' Association in the UK. The two associations made the request after the death of English football player Jeff Astle in 2002. Mr Astle's family was convinced he died as a result of playing football. Doctors said his cause of death was ""repeated minor brain traumas"". The doctors said this could happen with heading a soccer ball. Researcher Dr Willie Stewart said his research showed that former football players were more likely to suffer from Alzheimer's disease, motor neurone disease and Parkinson's disease.

"Scientists have discovered the world's fastest ant. It is the Saharan silver ant. It runs at a speed of just over 3kph, but that is the same ant speed as a human running 580kph. The ant runs 108 times the length of its own body every second. This is quicker than an Olympic 100-meter runner. The world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, ran the 100 meters using 4 strides a second. The Saharan silver ant uses up to 50 strides a second. The scientists say this much movement almost breaks the limits of what is physically possible for a living thing. Each of the ants' feet makes contact with the ground for a very short time. The ants' feet touch the ground for just seven milliseconds before they take the next stride.The scientists said the Saharan silver ant runs so fast because it lives in the hot desert. The sand can reach temperatures of up to 60 degrees Celsius, so the ant wants to spend as little time as possible with its feet on the scorching ground. Another reason is that if the ants' feet spend a longer time on the sand, they will sink a little and slow the ant down. Professor Harald Wolf wrote about why the ants' feet move so fast. He said: ""These features may be related to the sand dune habitat. They could prevent the ants' feet from sinking too deeply into the soft sand."" Professor Wolf told CNN: ""We knew these ants would be fast, but nobody knew how fast exactly, and how they would achieve that speed.""",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1910/191020-worlds-fastest-ant.html,breakingnewsenglish,

"A man who is paralyzed from below his shoulders has been able to walk using a robotic suit. The 28-year-old man could not move his arms, hips and legs after an accident. Doctors fitted him with a special robotic exoskeleton - this is a machine that covered his arms, legs and body. The machine was attached to the ceiling so the man could keep his balance and not fall over. He controlled the machine using high-tech sensors that were implanted near his brain. The man used his thoughts to tell the sensors to move the machine. His brain sent messages to the machine and it moved his arms and legs. He was able to walk a few steps using the machine even though he was paralyzed.Doctors say they are in the early stages of developing this technology. They believe robotic exoskeletons will help disabled people to live better lives in the future. Technology will be able to pick up signals from the brain to control wearable robotic technology. The next stage is to remove the ceiling harness. A neurosurgeon who co-led the exoskeleton trial commented on the exoskeleton suit. He said it was the first wireless, brain-controlled system to be designed that can move all four limbs. The man was very happy with the test.

"A former prime minister of the United Kingdom, Gordon Brown, has warned that the union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is ""sleepwalking into oblivion"". He also warned of a serious economic disaster ahead after the UK leaves the European Union. He wrote about the dangers of the UK leaving the EU after Brexit. The UK will leave the European Union on October 31st (which is also Halloween). Mr Brown believes that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the four nations of the UK could be in trouble. He is blaming nationalist thinking. He said many people in each country want their independence. He said the United Kingdom is no longer a totally united kingdom. The United Kingdom consists of four countries - the three nations of Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and the fourth being Northern Ireland. The full title for all four countries is ""The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"". Gordon Brown believes that Brexit has made people in each country want independence. Most people in Scotland voted against Brexit. They want to stay in the EU. There are talks of a vote for independence for Scotland. There are also worries over a possible physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. People are talking about a possible reunited Ireland.

"Scientists have found fossils that once belonged to a giant parrot. They say the fossilized bones are from the biggest parrot that ever lived. It was probably as tall as a three-year-old child and weighed around eight kilograms. The researchers found the fossils in New Zealand. They have called the new parrot Hercules, after a strongman of ancient Greek mythology. The scientists studied the fossilized leg bones they found and said Hercules was around a metre tall. This means Hercules is twice the size of all other known parrots. The largest parrot scientists know of is the kakapo, a flightless bird that also lives in New Zealand. The kakapo is on the critically endangered species list.New Zealand is famous for its flightless birds. The kiwi is a symbol of the country. Scientists say these are vulnerable. This means they could become endangered if their environment stays the same. Another famous New Zealand bird is the 3.6-metre-tall moa. These flightless birds were the biggest birds that ever lived. They were overhunted to extinction early in the 15th century. Hercules lived about 19 million years ago. A researcher said it probably ate nuts, fruit and seeds, and ""perhaps even other parrots"".

"A dentist in Chennai, India has removed 526 miniature teeth from the mouth of a seven-year-old boy. The boy complained to his mother that he had toothaches. She took the boy to a dentist, who found the boy had hundreds of tiny teeth in a sac (a small, empty space) inside the boy's jaw. The sac was near the molar area at the back of the jaw. Professor Pratibha Ramani, the head of a dental department at the hospital, spoke to reporters about the surgery the little boy had. She told reporters: ""The teeth were of variable sizes that ranged from the smallest at 0.1mm to the largest at 3mm. They all had a small crown, enamel and a small root."" She said the boy suffered from a very rare dental problem.The operation to remove the tiny teeth from the boy's jaw took over five hours. Professor Ramani spoke about how her team of surgeons removed the teeth. She said: ""We had to drill down into the top of the lower jaw, make a window and remove the sac."" She added: ""As the sac was going deeper into the tissue, the size of the teeth was becoming very small."" Despite having over 500 teeth in his jaw, the boy did not suffer a lot of pain. Ms Ramani said: ""We had to take a lot of counseling sessions with him for him to undergo surgery. We have a very good counseling team who have expertise in dealing with kids.""

Over 2,000 fans want compensation after Ronaldo failed to play in a pre-season friendly against an all-star K League team. Juventus signed a contract to play Ronaldo for 45 minutes of the game, but he stayed on the subs bench and did not even lace up his soccer boots. Many fans at the game switched from chanting Ronaldo's name to chanting the name of his great rival Lionel Messi. There were also boos around the stadium. The fans have also been voicing their anger at Ronaldo on social media. One wrote: ""He betrayed the 60,000 audience and belittled us. I'm no longer a Ronaldo fan.""The angry fans are now seeking compensation. They have gone to a law firm in South Korea's capital city, Seoul. They want Juventus to return their $60 ticket price and pay compensation of $850 to each fan for the ""mental anguish"" they suffered because of Ronaldo's no-show. A lawyer told the Reuters news agency that normally in such cases, fans would get their money back for their tickets, but this was ""a special case since the company, through false advertising, took advantage of the football star's fans"".

"Hundreds of huge wildfires have broken out all across the Arctic Circle. Areas in the Arctic are warming twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet. There are so many fires and they are so big that the smoke from them can be seen from space. Meteorologists report that the Arctic is having its hottest June ever and is suffering its worst wildfire season on record. There are huge blazes covering large areas of Greenland, Siberia, Scandinavia and Alaska. In Alaska, there are as many as 400 fires burning out of control. In Greenland, melting on the vast Greenland ice sheet has started a month earlier than usual. The World Meteorological Organization has said the Arctic fires are ""unprecedented"".Scientists say the fires and suffocating smoke could have an effect on global warming. Meteorologist Mark Parrington explained what is causing the wildfires. He said: ""Temperatures in the Arctic have been increasing at a much faster rate than the global average, and warmer conditions encourage fires to grow and persist once they have been ignited."" Dry ground, more lightning strikes and strong winds have caused the fires to spread very quickly. A lot of ice has melted and the flames have set fire to methane-filled earth below the ice. This is releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The fires have also caused serious habitat loss and have killed uncountable numbers of animals.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1907/190728-arctic-wildfires.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"A team of rescuers is working hard to help airlift thousands of salmon in Canada to safety. The salmon are trapped in a section of the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada. They have been trapped in that part of the river since a landslide in June. The landslide blocked off the section of the river, which meant the salmon could not swim upstream to spawn (lay their eggs). Rescuers and conservationists have spent several weeks looking at ways to help the fish. They decided the best way was to fly the fish to the other side of the fallen rocks by helicopter. The fish will then be free to swim up to their breeding ground. Rescuers have been ""working around the clock"" to help the salmon.Conservationists warn that if the fish cannot lay their eggs, the entire local salmon population will be at risk. Future numbers of the fish will drop to dangerously low levels. This would have an impact on many of Canada's First Nations indigenous people. They need the salmon for food and for cultural reasons. Salmon play an important role in many traditional ceremonies of people who have lived along the Fraser River for hundreds of years. Their way of life will continue thanks to the rescuers' help. The rescuers are also looking at other ways to help the fish. One said: ""We expect over three million [salmon] to migrate north of that rockslide.

Hundreds of people gathered outside the Bent Pyramid at a special opening ceremony on Saturday. The Bent Pyramid was built 4,600 years ago. It was built for the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Sneferu. It is 101 meters high. Builders used new techniques to build it and archaeologists say it was an important step in the development of pyramid building. Tourists can also enter an 18-metre high ""side pyramid"" next to the Bent Pyramid. This was built for King Sneferu's wife Hetepheres.The two pyramids are part of the Memphis Necropolis, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Egypt hopes the opening of the pyramids will boost the country's tourism industry. Egypt was a top tourist destination but tourist numbers fell after the 2011 uprising. Ancient sites in Egypt are on the bucket lists of many people around the world. At the Bent Pyramid, tourists will be able to go through a 79-meter narrow tunnel to reach two chambers deep inside.

"New research shows that insects feel pain. The researchers say it isn't the same kind of pain that humans feel. The pain that insects feel is a sensation that is like pain. The research was conducted at the University of Sydney in Australia. Professor Greg Neely, co-author of the research report, said: ""People don't really think of insects as feeling any kind of pain, but it's already been shown in lots of different invertebrate animals that they can sense and avoid dangerous [things] that we [think of] as painful."" He added: ""We knew that insects could sense 'pain' but what we didn't know is that an injury could lead to long-lasting hyper-sensitivity...in a similar way to human patients' experiences.""The researchers looked at how fruit flies reacted to injuries. The scientists damaged one leg on the flies and allowed the leg to heal. They found that after the leg fully healed, the flies became more sensitive and tried harder to protect their legs. Professor Neely said the pain the flies felt stayed in their memory and this changed their behaviour. He said: ""After the [insect] is hurt once badly, they are hypersensitive and try to protect themselves for the rest of their lives."" Neely says he hopes to carry out more research to better understand how humans feel pain.

"Scientists are warning that people who smoke are in danger of damaging their eyes. The scientists say smokers are two times more likely to lose their vision than non-smokers. Everyone knows that smoking can damage the lungs and heart, but not many people know it could damage the eyesight. The scientists are from the Association of Optometrists (AOP) in the United Kingdom. The AOP has started a campaign to raise awareness of the danger of smoking to the eyes. The campaign is called ""Stub it out"". The word ""stub"" means put out a cigarette by pushing the end against something hard; ""stub it out"" is saying, ""stop smoking"". The AOP said only one in five people thinks smoking can damage the eyes.The AOP explained why smoking is so harmful to the eyes. Cigarette smoke gets in the eyes and causes or worsens a number of different eye problems. Cigarette smoke contains toxic chemicals that can irritate and damage the eyes. Smoke contains tiny pieces of metals like lead and copper. These can get into the eyes and lead to cataracts - a condition that causes the eye lens to become cloudy. People with cataracts usually need an operation to restore their sight. Smoke can also increase the chance of worsening sight problems for people with diabetes. The AOP said smokers are also three times more likely to damage the eyes' muscles.

Doctors say the bump is large enough to feel by pressing the bottom of the skull, just above the neck. Dr David Shahar, a health scientist at the University of The Sunshine Coast in Australia, spoke to the BBC about the discovery.

The crisis in Venezuela has led to a two-thirds cut in shipments of cheap fuel to Cuba.Cuba imports about two-thirds of its food from other countries. A lot of this used to come from the USA. Cuba spent about $2 billion a year on importing food. The US embargo and the crisis in Venezuela means it is difficult for Cuba to import food. The shelves of many stores and supermarkets are empty. Many people have to stand in long lines when shops get a food delivery. The government has started rationing to stop people hoarding food. If people buy too much of one thing and then hoard it, there is less food for others. One store in the capital city Havana limited people to just four packets of powdered milk, four packs of sausages and five packets of peas per person. One shopper said life was ""tough"".",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1905/190513-rationing-in-cuba.html,breakingnewsenglish,

There are now over 9,000 books on the library's shelves. The books are divided into over 20 categories, including politics, philosophy, drama, thrillers, romance, history, literature, healthy living and economics. The library is inside a truck that tours schools in the suburbs of Ankara. The garbage collectors hope to create a greater passion for reading books in children, especially in the age of mobile phones and tablets. Many schools do not have a reading room or their own library.The library has got a lot of attention in Turkey. There is now a campaign for it to grow. People from all over Turkey are sending their unwanted or old books to the garbage collectors. The director of the library said: ""The interest is growing. Each day we have guests coming here to borrow books or have a quiet time to read."" A worker at the mobile library said: ""We have books here for children aged from six to ten, but also books for older children, like world classics and fiction novels.

The university's president Shigeru Kono said: ""Our job as a university is to look after our staff. We feel we have to discourage them from smoking."" Many companies have also started not recruiting smokers. Mr Kono said there would be a ban on smoking anywhere in the university by teaching and other staff from August. In addition, staff and students will be banned from taking cigarettes and lighters into any areas of the university from April 2020. Approximately eight per cent of the university's professors and teachers are smokers.The no-smoking policy taken by Nagasaki University is part of a growing trend in Japan to ban smoking in public spaces. There are currently bans in many public places, including restaurants and bars, in the lead-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. There are many areas of Tokyo and Kyoto in which people cannot smoke on the streets. The number of people in Japan who smoke is on the decline. In 1966, 49 per cent of adults smoked, including 84 per cent of men. Last year, 18 per cent of adults smoked, including 28 per cent of men.

He made way for his son Crown Prince Naruhito to become the new emperor. Akihito decided to step down because of his health. At the age of 85, he has been visibly slowing down for the past few years. He has also had a couple of health scares. He believes his son is now better able to carry out the duties of emperor. Emperor Akihito will be remembered for using a personal touch to bring his people together after many national disasters. He continually visited people after earthquakes, tsunami and other tragedies.The new Emperor Naruhito became the 126th emperor to ascend the throne of the world's oldest monarchy. Naruhito, 59, spent two years studying at Oxford University. His wife, the new Empress Masako, studied at Harvard University and worked as a diplomat. A traditional ceremony took place as part of the historic handover. In the ceremony, Naruhito received a sacred sword, a jewel and official seals that date back thousands of years.

The report is from the international accountancy company Deloitte. It reported that the wage bill for Premier League teams went above $3.5 billion for the first time ever. The report said that almost 60 per cent of all the revenue earned by the League goes towards wages. This is up from 55 per cent in the 2016/17 season. The Premier League's top six clubs, which include Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal, have the highest wage bills in the League.The Premier League is the top level of English football leagues. It is the most-watched sports league in the world. People in 212 countries and territories, in 643 million homes worldwide watch it. This means it makes a lot of money from television rights and merchandising. However, the increase in the wage bill has reduced the profits earned by the clubs. Deloitte said: ""With the emphasis now on clubs to generate revenue growth...it may be that we see the levels of pre-tax profit [go down] over the next few years.""

A paleontologist is someone who studies fossils. The dig is called Mission Jurassic. Researchers from the USA, England and Holland will join the Mission Jurassic team. They will try to find bones from dinosaurs that lived in the area 150 million years ago, in the Jurassic Era. The site of the dig is known as the Jurassic Mile. It is roughly 2.6 square kilometers in size. Scientists have already uncovered many interesting things over the past two years. These include dinosaur footprints, plant fossils and the bones of a 30-metre-long Diplodocus.The bones found at the dig will go on display in Indianapolis - at the world's largest children's museum. Professor Paul Barrett, a researcher at the museum and a co-leader of the dig, said: ""This is an area that hasn't been...extensively studied....The hope is to find new material of previously described species and, if we're lucky, new species of dinosaurs and the animals and plants that lived around them.""

The movement has the hashtag KuToo. This is a combination of the Japanese words ""kutsu"" (which means shoe) and ""kutsuu"" (which is the Japanese word for pain). The movement was started by Japanese actress Yumi Ishikawa. She tweeted about her belief that employers in Japan should not require female workers to wear high heels. Ms Ishikawa also launched an online petition. It asks Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to forbid employers from requiring women to wear certain types of shoes.Ishikawa's tweet is now spreading across other parts of Asia. Many women in China and South Korea have started their own campaigns against having to wear high heels. Ishikawa told TIME magazine: ""I thought that if there are so many people who feel the same as me, why not start some sort of movement."" Many women supported Ishikawa on social media. They complained about sore feet, bleeding heels, back pain and other health issues.

These will be standard equipment on cars, just like seatbelts and airbags. There are other things that cars will be fitted with. All cars will have breathalyzers that won't allow driving if the driver has drunk too much alcohol. Cars must also have advanced emergency braking, a built-in data recorder, drowsiness and distraction monitoring, and sensors to help when reversing. The EU said 25,000 people are killed each year on Europe's roads. Most accidents are caused by human error. The new safety systems will reduce road deaths.There has been mixed reaction to the new safety features. Some people agree with them, while others disagree.

It added that the new safety features could save up to 10,500 lives and avoid up to 60,000 serious injuries by the year 2030. Many drivers are unhappy with the technology.

One head teacher at a school in London does not have enough money to pay for cleaners or canteen staff. This means she has to help to clean the toilets and serve students in the school cafeteria. Ms Siobhan Lowe is head of Tolworth Girls' School in south London. She recently told reporters that she was embarrassed because her school did not have enough money to support students. Ms Lowe said she has sold school land, cut subjects and fired her deputy-head teacher to keep her school open.The south London school is typical of many schools in the UK.

In today's world, that is becoming less important. Companies now want their workers to dress in a more casual way. This is to make staff feel more relaxed, so they work harder. The latest international company to relax its dress code is the investment bank Goldman Sachs. It said its staff could choose not to wear a suit, but asked employees to ""exercise good judgment"" in deciding how to dress for work.

In the video, Mr Samuel answers questions from his followers and from reporters. He said: ""I want everyone in India and the world to realise one thing - that they are born without their consent. I want them to understand that they do not owe their parents anything. If we are born without our consent, we should be maintained for our life. We should be paid by our parents to live."" He added: ""I love my parents...but they had me for their joy and their pleasure.""

"A new study shows that we could learn vocabulary while we are sleeping. This is great news for students struggling to learn a new language. It is also good for anyone who is trying to expand their knowledge of words. Researchers from the University of Bern in Switzerland have shown that it is possible to learn new information while we are sleeping deeply, and then recall this information when we need it after we wake up. This new information includes foreign language vocabulary. The researchers conducted tests on whether or not a person can remember new words and their translations while they were asleep. They said our sleeping brain is much more aware of the outside world than we thought.Researcher Marc Züst said, ""language areas of the brain and the hippocampus - the brain's essential memory hub - were activated"" after a person woke up. He said these areas of the brain allow us to remember vocabulary during deep sleep. The researchers said that during deep sleep, our brain cells are active for a short period of time - about half a second. The cells then enter into a period of inactivity - again, about half a second. The active state is called ""up-state"" and the inactive state is called ""down-state."" The ""up-state"" period is the time when our brain could learn new vocabulary. The researchers say more research is needed to be 100 per cent sure that we can learn vocabulary while asleep.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1902/190206-learning-vocabulary.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Much of mid- and northeastern America is in the middle of a deadly cold snap. Many states from Michigan in the north to Georgia in the south are experiencing freezing temperatures not experienced for decades. It is currently colder in many parts of the USA than it is in Antarctica. The cold spell is because of what is called a polar vortex. This is a swirling mass of air and wind that has come down from the Arctic, which is where the North Pole is. The government has declared states of emergency in Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan. Many schools and businesses have been closed due to the extreme cold. People have been warned not to travel, and even not to go outside and breathe in the icy air.The weather website AccuWeather said that the temperature in Thief River Falls, in the state of Minnesota, dropped to a real-feel minus sixty degrees Celsius. Many parts of the Chicago River turned to ice, Niagara Falls turned into a winter wonderland and parts of Lake Michigan froze over. The bitter freeze is believed to be responsible for the deaths of at least eight people so far. Health officials are urging people to go outside only if it is absolutely necessary. They warned that exposing the skin to the freezing air was dangerous. It could lead to frostbite or breathing problems. People were also urged to be careful when shoveling snow outside and be careful of blocks of snow and ice falling from the roof.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1902/190202-polar-vortex.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Workers in India are moving over 300 crocodiles from their home because they are too near a new tourist sight. Officials in India's state of Gujarat want to move the crocs because they could be a danger to tourists visiting the new Statue of Unity. The statue opened to the public last October. It is 182m high and is the tallest statue in the world. It is next to a reservoir, which is also home to many crocodiles. Tourism officials want the giant reptiles moved so seaplanes for tourists can land on the reservoir. If the crocodiles stayed, they could be dangerous and attack tourists. Officials are using cages to catch the animals. Some of them are over 3m long. They are going to a new home in another part of Gujarat.Animal lovers are angry that people are moving the crocodiles. Dr Jitendra Gavali said: ""The government is disturbing their habitat and putting their lives at risk. The government hasn't thought out where it will release the captured crocodiles safely."" So far, only 17 of the animals have been caught and moved. The editor of the environmental magazine 'Sanctuary Asia', Bittu Sahgal, said the idea to move the crocodiles was crazy. He tweeted: ""Have we collectively lost our minds? As any environmentalist will tell you, this is sheer insanity.""

"Germany may put a speed limit on its world famous autobahn network of highways. The autobahn has a total length of about 12,996 kilometers. There is no speed limit on it for many types of vehicles. However, there are limits in some built-up areas, spots that are accident-prone, or roads that are under construction or undergoing repairs. On the parts of the network on which there is no limit, there is an advisory speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour (80 mph). Germany's government may now put a speed limit on all parts of the autobahn. This is because Germany has to meet fuel emission targets set by the European Union. It wants to reduce the damage done to the environment by cars that drive fast.Many drivers in Germany are unhappy with a possible speed limit on the autobahn. They do not want the 130kph limit, even though that is normal in other EU countries. Some politicians say the proposed speed limit will never get passed in Germany's government. One politician, Ulrich Lange, said: ""I don't think the suggestion of a speed limit is practical."" One of Germany's best-selling newspapers Bild Zeitung disagreed with the speed limit. It wrote: ""Our autobahn roads are a symbol of freedom. 'Tested on German autobahn' is a quality seal. There are enough speed limits.""

The administration said the cotton plants were among several plants that were ""growing well"". Other plants that are now growing on the moon are potatoes, rock cress and rapeseed. The plants are part of a project on China's space mission to the far side of the moon. The project is called a ""moon surface micro-ecological circle"". Project leader Liu Hanlong says the cotton seeds were the first to sprout. He said the plants were chosen because they were small, strong and could grow in the difficult conditions on the moon's surface.Professor Hanlong said the project's aim was to understand more about how plants grow outside of Earth. The long-term aim is to develop plants that can grow on the moon or on planets like Mars. The professor said: ""We have given consideration to future survival in space. Learning about these plants growing in a low-gravity environment would allow us to lay the foundation for our future establishment of a space base."" The project also includes yeast and fruit flies.

Macedonia declared independence in 1991 after the break-up of the former country Yugoslavia. It became a member of the United Nations in 1993, but its name caused an argument with Greece. Greece's largest region is also called Macedonia. The Greek government said it owned the name ""Macedonia"". Greece blocked its neighbor's attempts to join the EU and NATO over the use of the name ""Macedonia"". Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said the name change would, ""open the doors to the future"".The name change comes after a decade of talks between Macedonia and Greece. Just over 67 per cent of representatives in Macedonia's parliament voted for the name change. Eighty-one MPs voted in favor of the name change in the 120-seat parliament. Opposition politicians, who opposed the agreement with Greece, boycotted the vote. Several hundred people protested against the deal in front of Macedonia's parliament over the past three days.

"There is new technology that means we may no longer need to go to the optician for an eye test. The new technology is a device that is used with a smartphone. The device tests our eyes and gives us a number that tells us how good or bad our eyesight is. We can then take this number to an optician to order a pair of glasses, or order the glasses online. The new device is from a startup company called EyeQue. It has been used to test the eyes of 50,000 people. The company says the results of the smartphone eye test are as good as the results you get by visiting an optician. The simple device costs just $30. An updated version will come out later this year and will cost between $50 to $70.An EyeQue spokesman said the device was better than going to visit an optician. He said: ""The reason for that is when you go to the eye doctor, it's one moment in time. You may be having a bad day. You may be nervous. The doctor may be in a hurry. What we do is different measures over time. We are able to average it out, and we get a better result."" However, the spokesman said the device wasn't a replacement for the optician.

Following the research, researchers believe they know why some of us prefer coffee while others like tea more. The researchers found that people who like more bitter tastes are more likely to drink coffee. The researchers said they found something strange in their research.

They said that posting selfies seemed to increase levels of narcissism in a way that text messaging does not.Professor Phil Reed, from the Department of Psychology at Swansea University, said: ""There have been suggestions of links between narcissism and the use of [selfies] on social media, such as Facebook, but until this study, it was not known if...using such platforms is associated with the...growth in narcissism. The results of this study suggest that...posting selfies can increase narcissism."" Professor Read said that ""about 20 per cent of people may be at risk of developing"" narcissism.

They will use these expressions to find out if the passenger might be lying. A human security guard will take over if the lie-detecting software detects a security risk. The procedure will initially divide passengers into two types. Low-risk travellers will be asked basic information in the lie-detection process, while higher-risk passengers will get more detailed questions. A psychology expert doubted if the system would work. He said: ""If you ask people to lie, they will do it differently and show very different behavioural cues than if they truly lie....This is a known problem in psychology.""",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1811/181105-lie-detector-tests.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Earth is losing wildlife at a faster rate than at any time in history. This is according to the new ""Living Planet Report"" from the World Wildlife Fund. The report says the global wildlife population shrank by 60 per cent between 1970 and 2014. The WWF warned that: ""Earth is losing biodiversity at a rate seen only during mass extinctions."" Researchers state that most of the decline in our animal population is because of ""exploding human consumption"". There are more and more humans on this planet. We are eating more, overfishing, cutting down trees for beef production, consuming more, and using more energy and natural resources. This has resulted in a massive loss of habitat for animals.The report estimates that only a quarter of the world's land has been untouched by humans. This means human activity has greatly affected animals on three-quarters of Earth's surface. Researchers tracked more than 4,000 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and amphibians. They say the loss of animal life is worst in South and Central America. These regions saw an 89 per cent loss in the population of vertebrates in the past four decades. The WWF wrote: ""The astonishing decline in wildlife population...is a [depressing] reminder, and perhaps the ultimate indicator, of the pressure we [put] on the planet.""

The museum is currently taking part in 10 trials on patients to find out what effect art has on health. The patients include people with breast cancer, eating disorders, epilepsy and mental health problems. Thomas Bastien, director of education and wellness at the museum, believes that art heals. He said: ""We saw that the museum was good for people, so we decided to start this program with the doctors. If you're suffering from breast cancer, you could come to the museum and you might feel better.""A doctor who has a lot of experience in helping to heal people with art spoke about the benefits of art therapy. Dr Hélène Boyer said: ""There's more and more scientific proof that art therapy is good for your physical health."" She said looking at art increases hormones released in our bodies.

"The world's longest sea bridge has opened. It links Hong Kong and Macau to mainland China. The bridge is called the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and is 55 kilometres long. The bridge took over a decade to construct. Builders had to make artificial islands in the Pearl River Delta to provide the supports for the bridge. There is also a 6.7-kilometre underwater tunnel in the middle of the bridge. This is to allow ships to sail through the Delta. The new bridge stretches longer than 14 Golden Gate Bridges lined up end to end. The bridge will greatly cut the time it takes to travel from mainland China to Hong Kong and Macau. The journey time to Macau has been cut from over three hours to just 30 minutes.Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the opening ceremony of the bridge on Thursday. He hopes the new crossing will help to connect 68 million people in 11 different cities. China's government believes that up to 29,000 cars will cross the sea link daily by the year 2030. A trade and tourism expert said: ""This makes Hong Kong a lot more accessible for goods, passengers and trade, so this is a benefit from the economic perspective."" The bridge will be open to tourists to drive across it. However, local car owners will not be able to cross the bridge unless they have a special permit. Most drivers will take a shuttle bus to make the journey. The shuttle buses will cost $8-$10 for a single trip.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1810/181024-sea-bridge.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"One of the world's biggest makers of tissues is changing the name of one of its products. The company called Kimberly-Clark is putting an end to its Kleenex ""Mansize"" brand of tissues. This comes after many people complained to the company that the name ""Mansize"" was sexist. That name has been on the boxes of Kleenex tissues for over 60 years. Kleenex ""For Men"" tissues were first launched in 1956. They were advertised as an alternative to cotton handkerchiefs. Adverts said the tissues ""stayed strong when wet"". The company said that from now, the tissues will be renamed ""Extra Large"". Many companies around the world are looking at the name of their products to make sure they are not gender stereotyping.Kimberly-Clark said it was changing the name of its tissues because its consumer service department had many complaints about the Mansize name.

"New research shows that nicer people are likely to be poorer than people who are not so nice. Researchers looked at how the personalities of different people affected how rich or well off they were. The researchers found that people with a nice, warm personality were worse off financially than people who were more selfish. Kinder people found it more difficult to look after their money. Researcher Dr Joe Gladstone said this was because of the ""agreeableness"" of people who were kinder, more trusting and more caring. He said: ""We find that agreeableness is associated with various [signs] of financial hardship, including lower savings, higher debt and higher default rates.""The researchers looked at data from different sources, including two online surveys taken by almost 4,000 participants. The data included answers to questions on people's financial situation, how people got into debt, and people's attitude towards money. They compared this data with surveys in which almost 5,000 people answered questions about their personality and their agreeableness.

The UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced new plans that will make it illegal for restaurants to keep the tips given by customers. For decades, many restaurants have kept most of the tips customers add to their credit card payments or the money customers put in tip jars. Some restaurants use the tips as part of a worker's pay. Many people in England are angry about this. Restaurant workers are among the lowest paid staff in Britain and many of them rely on tips to survive. The food and drink industry in the UK is huge. There are over 150,000 hotels, bars and restaurants in the UK. These employ about two million people.Many waiting staff in the UK are happy that the new law is coming in. They said they were fed up with international chain restaurants keeping the money that was meant for waiters. The staff also said restaurant managers often used the tips to help pay for the chefs and kitchen staff. Workers at the TGI Fridays restaurant chain went on strike earlier this year because of low pay. Prime Minister May said the new law would make sure restaurant workers are treated fairly.

"A poor potato harvest in Europe this summer could mean French fries are up to three centimeters shorter than usual. The poor harvest is because of the very hot summer Europe had. There were record hot temperatures in many countries. The heatwave caused a lack of rain, which meant farmers produced a lot fewer potatoes than they normally do. Pierre Lebrun, a spokesman from a potato growers' association in Belgium, said farmers grew 25 per cent fewer potatoes than normal. The effect of this is that potato prices are up and the average size of potatoes is smaller. Mr Lebrun said: ""Because the potatoes are smaller at the moment, we will all be eating smaller chips.""Belgium is one country where the potato shortage is a big talking point. Fries are the national dish in Belgium. The country has over 5,000 eateries specializing in fries. Belgians love their fries so much that there is a campaign to rename them ""Belgian fries"" instead of ""French fries"" because Belgians say the fry was invented in their country. Belgium is one of the largest exporters of frozen fries in the world. It exports around 2.3 million tons of them every year. Mr Lebron explained why fries would be shorter. He said: ""Generally, to have long fries, we work with potatoes with a diameter of more than 50mm. Then you get fries of 8 to 9 cm.

The ISS is a large satellite in space that scientists live in to do scientific experiments. The first part of it was put into space in 1998. Last week, NASA alerted astronauts on the ISS that the station was slowly leaking air. Astronaut Alexander Gerst and five other astronauts started looking for the leak. Mr Gerst eventually found it and quickly used a simple and effective way of stopping the leak - he put his finger over the hole. Luckily, the hole was only two millimeters wide so it was not a major emergency, but it did need fixing.The hole was in a docked Russian Soyuz MS-09 spacecraft. NASA said it could have been caused by a small piece of space junk or a small meteorite colliding with the spacecraft. The ISS travels at speeds of around 28,000 kph. Even a tiny object hitting it can cause a lot of damage. Flight controllers in the USA and Russia worked together with the crew to fix the hole.

Instead, people who have a cough should drink or eat honey or get some medicine from a drugstore. The doctors say that in most cases, honey and over-the-counter medicines will work and people do not need antibiotics. The doctors added that most of the time, a cough will improve on its own within two to three weeks even if you take nothing. Many of us visit a doctor at a hospital or clinic if we have a cough. Public health officials in England say this is largely a waste of time. They say antibiotics do little to make a cough go away.Doctors say we are using antibiotics too much and this can be bad for us. Many viruses and infections are becoming resistant to antibiotics, so medicines are becoming less effective. Doctors say this is leading to the creation of superbugs. These can be very dangerous to our health. The doctors said honey can be very effective in soothing a sore throat and making other symptoms disappear. A hot drink with honey is a traditional and well-known remedy for coughs and sore throats. People also add lemon or ginger to it. Using honey may be better for children with coughs.

"The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has made people angry. He said he would resign if anyone can prove that God exists. President Duterte has a history of upsetting people with his religious beliefs. He recently made many people in his largely Roman Catholic country angry by calling God stupid. On Friday, he questioned the principles of the Roman Catholic Church. In particular, he challenged what the Church says about sin. He asked why sin can only be removed from children by paying money to the Church. He said: ""Where is the logic of God there?"" The 73-year-old leader said that he wanted ""one single witness"" who has a picture or a selfie that a human was ""able to talk to and see God"".Opponents of the president hit back at him by calling him ""one evil man"". Senator Antonio Trillanes said the president's comments showed that Mr Duterte lied, had no heart and was a ruthless leader. Despite his comments, President Duterte said he did believe in God. He said: ""There is a universal mind somewhere which controls the universe."" Duterte is very popular in the Philippines for his policies on drugs and crime. He has spent the past few years fighting a war on drugs in which hundreds of people have been killed. He also appeared at an event in which customs officials crushed illegally imported luxury cars. He has agreed to meet religious leaders at a meeting on Monday to ease tensions.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1807/180709-god.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"There is good news about the twelve boys and their football coach who are trapped in a Thai cave. They are alive and well. The group was missing for nine days, but was found by rescuers yesterday. Thailand has been praying for them to be found since they went missing on June 23. The search for the group was 24-hour news in Thailand. It was unclear where they were or whether or not they were still alive. The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing. They went into the cave in northern Thailand when it was dry, but there was suddenly heavy rain. This blocked the exit to the cave. The rain flooded it and the boys and their coach were trapped.The bad news is that the soccer team could be trapped in the cave for months. Rescuers have to wait until the water recedes (goes down) before the team can get out. Another possibility is for the boys to learn to dive. If they do that, they can get out sooner. However, none of the boys can swim. Rescuers say they may have to take food, medicine and supplies to the boys for the next four months. They are currently trying to put power and telephone lines in the cave. Two British rescue divers who found the boys said they were all happy, but very, very hungry. The rescuers took a video of them. A mother of one of the boys described her happiness.

Authorities say a lot of actors try to avoid paying tax and their love of money is harmful. Government officials said they want to stop ""money worship"" in society and in the movie industry because money is not the most important thing in life. The government also wants to try and stop a celebrity culture from developing. It says many young people are ""blindly chasing celebrities"" and turning them into heroes, which is giving people a false idea about what life is really like. The government said movies should benefit society, not movie star bank accounts.The government has issued a set of rules that tell movie production companies how to pay their movie stars. The salaries of actors will be capped at 40 per cent of the total cost of the movie. Furthermore, leading actors will receive no more than 70 per cent of the total wages for the entire cast. Many Chinese citizens said they support the new rules. They say it is not good for society that ""greedy"" actors and celebrities are ""showing off"" their wealth and ""Hollywood lifestyles"". One Chinese citizen wrote on social media: ""Society has given them too much and they give nothing back.

Sting hit out at leaders during an Amnesty International concert in Athens, Greece. Amnesty International is the largest human rights NGO in the world. Sting also praised Greece for the way it has helped refugees over the past few years. He said: ""Thank God for Greece because you have shown the way. You have shown how to treat refugees when other people are building walls. When children are being taken from their mothers and put in cages, you are acting with compassion and generosity and common sense....Our so-called leaders, a sad parade of half-men, cowards, have not got the solutions.""Sting told crowds that Greece helped nearly a million refugees in 2015, even though it was dealing with a major financial crisis. Other countries refused to help the refugees. Many quickly built barbed-wire fences to keep them out. Sting had harsh words for the recent family-separation policy in the USA. More than 2,000 children have been detained and separated from parents who tried to cross the Mexico border into the US illegally. The concert audience cheered and applauded when Sting called this policy ""brutal"" and ""barbaric"". Some European countries still seem unwilling to help refugees.

"Scientists at the Canadian company Carbon Engineering have said they are close to making carbon capture work. Carbon capture is the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO2) from places like power plants and then storing it so it does not harm the environment. Carbon Engineering says its scientists are close to capturing CO2 from the atmosphere and turning it into carbon-neutral fuel. This could be a big step forward in the fight against global warming. The scientists also said they have greatly reduced the cost of carbon capture, to as low as $94 per ton of CO2 captured. Many scientists believed carbon capture would cost about $1,000 per ton captured.The technology works by sucking air into special industrial towers. The CO2 is mixed with an alkaline liquid and frozen. It is then heated and combined with hydrogen. This produces liquid fuels like gasoline and jet fuel. The founder of Carbon Engineering, Professor David Keith, was optimistic about the future of this process. He believes his company could help to combat climate change. He said: ""After 100 years of practical engineering and cost analysis, we can confidently say that while air capture is not some magical cheap solution, it is a viable and buildable technology for producing carbon-neutral fuels in the immediate future, and for removing carbon in the long run.""

It will take him more than six months to complete the 9,000-km swim. He will have to swim for eight hours a day to reach his target on the west coast of the USA. He will also have to face many dangers. There will be sharks, jellyfish, storms, rough seas, and very low water temperatures. He will also have to fight exhaustion and any injuries he picks up along the way. However, Mr Lecomte  said: ""The mental part is much more important than the physical. You have to make sure you always think about something positive.""Lecomte has been training for six years to take up this challenge. He has practised every day during that time by swimming in the sea. This is to make sure he is in top physical condition. He has also been training his mind. It will be a very lonely swim and he needs to be mentally tough. Lecomte said he is doing the swim to raise awareness of climate change, the effects of plastic rubbish in the ocean, and the effects of the Fukushima nuclear disaster on the ocean. Scientists will also study his body to monitor how extreme exercise affects the heart. In 1998, Lecomte made the first solo trans-Atlantic swim. It took him 73 days to cover the 6,400km.

"Malaysians have helped their government with its money problems. They gave nearly $2 million to help the country with its national debt. Malaysia has a new party in power for the first time since the nation's independence in 1957. The new government promised to fix the problems left by the previous government. One of these problems was the huge national debt. Malaysia's current leaders say the previous government lost a lot of money. They now want to put that right. The government has used a new way of raising money. They decided to ask for help by using crowdfunding. This means setting up a special page on the Internet to raise cash. People can give money to the page using their credit card. The amount the government has raised so far is very small compared to its multi-billion-dollar debt. The $2 million is just a drop in the ocean compared to the country's $251 billion debt. This is about 80 per cent of Malaysia's economic output. However, Malaysia's finance minister Lim Guan Eng said it was important to let people try to help the country. He said: ""The people voluntarily want to share their earnings with the government to help ease the burden.""

"There is a legendary monster that people say lives in the deep Loch Ness lake in the north of Scotland. It is called the Loch Ness Monster, or ""Nessie"" for short. It looks kind of like a dinosaur, with a small head on a long neck and humps on its back. People first spotted Nessie in 1933. Since then, there have been many sightings and a few photographs. Now, scientists from New Zealand will use a special technique to see if there really is a Loch Ness Monster. A research team, led by Professor Neil Gemmell of the University of Otago, will use a technique called eDNA sampling to try and find some of Nessie's DNA. Professor Gemmell says this will show if the monster really exists or not.Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster are often in the newspapers. Loch Ness is in the Scottish Highlands. The word ""loch"" is the Scots word for ""lake"". Many scientists have tried to find the monster before. They have even sent sonar equipment to the bottom of the loch, which is 230 metres deep. All of the photographs that people have taken of Nessie over the years are blurred. Some people say they are just car tyres floating in the water. Gemmell says he will test water from the loch. He said there should be DNA from the monster's skin, urine and other things. He will check all DNA found and make sure it is not from other marine animals. If he finds DNA not known to scientists, that could belong to Nessie.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1805/180526-loch-ness-monster.html,breakingnewsenglish,

"British researchers say they are close to finding a cure for the common cold. Scientists have worked for decades on a medicine that would help to end colds. The biggest problem for researchers was finding a drug that could fight the hundreds of types of viruses that can cause a cold. The viruses are difficult to find and they change very quickly so they can fight against new drugs. Until now, there has been no way to treat cold viruses, so we all have to suffer every winter. However, scientists have developed a special molecule that could make colds a thing of the past. They tested the molecule and found that it blocked the viruses that cause colds. The molecule stopped the viruses from working in the body.The usual treatment for a common cold is to take medicines or remedies for the different symptoms. We might take one thing for a sore throat and another thing for a runny nose or a fever. Different viruses can cause different symptoms. The researchers believe the new molecule could stop all symptoms from developing. Lead researcher Ed Tate, from London's Imperial College, said it could help millions of people end their suffering.

The researchers concluded that night owls were at higher risk of an early death than early birds (people who slept early). Night owls were also at a greater risk of poor health compared to early birds.The researchers said society and working patterns needed to change to reduce the risks of ill health for night owls. Researcher Malcolm van Schantz said: ""This is a public health issue that can no longer be ignored.""

It told its followers on Twitter that the first lady looked, ""awesome in a gorgeous jacket from the Red Cross"".Eliza Reid is originally from Canada and works as a journalist. She met her husband, President Gudni Johannesson, when she was studying at Oxford University. Ms Reid told the Hit Iceland website in 2017 that she ""won"" a blind date with the future president at a rowing club event. She had no idea she would one day become First Lady of Iceland. Both she and her husband are very popular in Iceland for being just like normal people. They both have a very down-to-earth attitude and can often be seen in the city shopping with their four children and going to restaurants. The Red Cross also likes Ms Reid.

"A study shows that new technology is reducing children's ability to use a pencil or pen. The study is from the National Health Service in the UK. Researchers said that nowadays, children spend so much time swiping iPads or mobile phone screens that they cannot hold a pencil properly. Children are not using pencils, so they now lack the muscle strength in their hands to be able to write properly. Researcher Dr Sally Payne said: ""Children are not coming into school with the hand strength and [ability] they had 10 years ago. Children coming into school are being given a pencil but are increasingly not able to hold it because they don't have the fundamental movement skills.""The researchers said technology is changing the physical way that children write, draw or make things. Children are increasingly using technology to create. Dr Payne explained why. She said: ""It's easier to give a child an iPad than encourage them to do muscle-building play such as building blocks, cutting and sticking, or pulling toys and ropes. Because of this, they're not developing the underlying foundation skills they need to grip and hold a pencil."" Some experts say technology may be causing bigger problems. One expert said if a child isn't strong enough to hold a pencil, perhaps their whole body is weak. She said it was better for children's physical development to climb trees than to watch YouTube videos.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1804/180404-pencils.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"The U.S. military is worried about China and Russia developing hypersonic missiles. These are missiles that can travel between five and twenty times the speed of sound.  Both Russia and China are developing the missile a lot faster than the United States. A senior U.S. military official said this could be a security problem for the USA. General John Hyten warned that the USA has no defense that could stop the use of such weapons against it. He said the USA needed small nuclear weapons to stop Russia attacking the USA. President Donald Trump said he has ""plans to get together in the not-too-distant future"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the arms race.Russia says it successfully tested a hypersonic missile earlier this month. China tested its missiles last year and will soon have the weapons ready for use. President Putin explained that Russia needs the weapons because of actions other countries have taken against it. He said ""unlawful sanctions"" by the USA and European countries have hurt Russia's development. He added: ""You have failed to contain Russia."" Mr Putin says the missiles will be able to fly anywhere in the world and will ""strike like a fireball"".

"The world is waiting to see if a trade war breaks out between the USA and China. Stock markets in Asia did badly in Friday's trading because investors are worried about U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to hit Chinese companies with trade tariffs. A tariff is a tax a country puts on goods and services coming in from other countries. President Trump has warned China he will issue tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports. China said it would issue its own tariffs in reply to Mr Trump. Tokyo's Nikkei share index fell by more than 4 per cent on Friday, Shanghai's market was down more than 3 per cent, and stocks and shares in Seoul fell by 3 per cent. There was also a fall on New York's Wall Street stock exchange.Experts on world trade are worried that the import tariffs could be the start of a global trade war. Trade researcher Robert Carnell said: ""If the tariffs go ahead as planned, then we believe China will retaliate. It is impossible to imagine that they cannot. And then we expect the U.S. to retaliate further. This can turn ugly on a global scale very quickly."" President Trump says he wants to protect U.S. workers and companies. Mr Trump is not happy with the trade imbalance between the USA and China. Experts believe that the USA buys $385 billion more goods from China than China buys from the USA. Trump wants to try and reduce this imbalance by at least $100 billion with his tariffs.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1803/180325-trade-war.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"The world-famous physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking published an important paper before he died last week. Professor Hawking died on March 14, aged 76. Two weeks before his death, he published his final theory in a paper called ""A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation"". He explained two very important ideas. The first was how humans might be able to detect multiverses. These are parallel universes that were created at the same time as our universe after the Big Bang. The second theory is about how our universe will eventually end, when the stars finally run out of energy. Scientists say his paper could be his most important work ever, and that he could have won a Nobel Prize for it.Stephen Hawking's new paper started by explaining an older theory of his called inflation. This is when our universe suddenly expanded from a tiny point in space into the billions of stars and solar systems we have today. Hawking suggested there were an infinite number of big bangs and each of them created its own separate universe. He called this collection of universes a multiverse. Hawking wrote that he believed scientists could find the multiverse by using sensors on space ships. Carlos Frenk, a professor of cosmology, said: ""These ideas offer the breathtaking prospect of finding evidence for the existence of other universes.""

"Scientists from the World Health Organization (WHO) say the world is possibly at risk from a deadly disease. However, they do not know its name or what it does and looks like. They have called it 'Disease X'. It could be caused by a virus or another micro-organism that scientists don't yet know about. The WHO said Disease X could go unnoticed until it is too late and it is quickly spreading around the world. The WHO is taking the threat of Disease X seriously. It is putting a lot of money into research and is preparing a plan for a sudden outbreak. It said: ""Disease X represents the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a [virus] currently unknown to cause human disease.""The scientists said that Disease X could come from many different sources. It could come from existing diseases changing and becoming strong enough to resist our vaccines; it could come from terrorism and bio-weapons; it could also come from scientists using DNA-changing technology to make entirely new viruses. The biggest threat could come from animals. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said: ""Scientists estimate that more than 6 out of every 10 known infectious diseases in people are spread from animals."" These include Ebola, avian flu and mad cow disease. Everyone living closer together in cities and increasing international travel and tourism will make it easier for diseases to spread.

"Technology has come to the rescue of Japanese farmers. For thousands of years they have tried to keep animals away from their farms. However, engineers have invented the ""Super Monster Wolf"" to finally scare away wild animals that want to eat crops of rice, pumpkin or sweet potato. Super Monster Wolf is a solar-powered scarecrow robot that looks like a real wolf. It has lookalike wolf hair, big scary teeth and red LED eyes with infrared sensors. It also has 48 different wolf howls and other noises so animals never get used to it. Super Monster Wolf will be used to keep animals like wild boar and deer out of rice paddies, farms and fruit orchards. Farmers lose millions of dollars of crops every year to hungry animals.Members of Japan's agricultural association (JA) took part in trials of the Super Monster Wolf in nine locations across Japan. JA spokesman Chikao Umezawa reported that the robot wolf significantly reduced crop losses. He said it was more effective than an electric fence at keeping animals out. The robot can sense movement up to one kilometre away and immediately make its scary sounds. The robot will start being mass produced from next month. It will be 65cm long and 50cm high. The price is $4,800 but farmers will have the option of renting the wolf by the month.

Archaeologists started excavation work on the site late last year. They found tombs belonging to priests of Thoth. He was the ancient god of the moon and wisdom. Thoth was also believed to be the inventor of writing. Egypt's Antiquities Minister, Khaled al-Anani, said: ""We will need at least five years to work on the necropolis.

"It almost seems too hard to believe, but there is now a banana that has an edible peel. Most people would never think of eating the peel of a banana. However, banana farmers in Japan have created a special technique for growing bananas with a peel we can eat. The new banana-growing method is called the ""freeze-thaw awakening"" technique. Farmers in Okayama, in the west of Japan, keep their banana trees at a freezing cold temperature of -60° Celsius. The farmers then replant the trees in 27ºC temperatures. The huge change in temperature makes the tree suddenly grow too quickly for the peel to fully mature. This makes the skin thin, soft and sweet enough to eat. The new variety of banana is called the ""Mongee"". Farmers are now selling it in small bunches of 10 bananas. They are not cheap. One Mongee banana costs yen 650 (about six dollars). The farmers have not grown a lot of Mongee bananas, so the price is high. They want to grow more so they can sell them all over the world. This means the price will come down. Bananas are the most popular fruit in Japan. Similar to other countries, Japan imports most of its bananas. About 99% of bananas in Japanese stores are imported. The Mongee could mean Japanese people eat more home-grown bananas.

The UK's power system is now the fourth cleanest in Europe and the seventh cleanest in the world.The United Kingdom has been trying to reduce the amount of coal it uses. Coal now supplies less than 7 per cent of the UK's electricity. A spokesman said it must now try to use less gas to make sure it meets its target for greenhouse gas emissions. The UK currently uses too much gas. The conservation charity World Wildlife Fund said it was pleased that the UK is moving towards greener energy. It said: ""We have never been cleaner or greener, and we are on [target] for an even better year in 2018."" It added: ""Climate change is wreaking havoc on our nature and wildlife, but we are at last facing up to the challenge. We are turning our backs on polluting fossil fuels and embracing a new, clean future.""",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1712/171230-green-energy.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that too much gaming is officially a mental health problem. The WHO has put ""gaming addiction"" as a mental health condition on its official list of diseases. The list is called the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). It says that gaming disorder happens when people cannot stop playing and gaming becomes more important than other interests in life. The WHO says this must happen for at least a year for a doctor to say someone has gaming disorder. Someone with gaming disorder will insist on gaming even if they know they have a problem and they have suffered ""negative consequences"" from gaming too much.The WHO said doctors should be aware that addiction to gaming is a clear and present danger to people's health because it has ""serious"" consequences. A WHO spokesman said: ""Most people who play video games don't have a disorder, just like most people who drink alcohol don't have a disorder either. However, in certain circumstances, overuse can lead to adverse effects."" Some doctors believe that too much gaming should not be considered a mental illness.

"A cafe in London has started a personalized way of making coffee. It is a new form of barista art called the ""selfieccino"". A barista is someone who makes the coffee, lattes and frappuccinos in coffee shops. They used to draw chocolate hearts, flowers and swirls in the white froth of the coffee. However, they have now taken that to a new level. They can now put a picture of a customer's face in the white frothy coffee topping. This means coffee lovers can sip on a cup of coffee with their own self-portrait in it. The cafe is called the Tea Terrace. It is located in one of London's top shopping areas, Oxford Street. The cafe sold over 400 of the personalized drinks within days of starting the service earlier this week.Baristas make use of technology to put the portraits of people on top of the coffee. Customers send a picture of their face on an online messaging app. The barista then uses a machine called a ""Cino"" to change the picture into an image on the white froth using different food colourings. The whole process takes about four minutes and costs $7.50 for the selfie in the coffee. The owner of the cafe, Ehab Salem Shouly, explained why he started the selfieccino service. He said: ""It's not enough any more to just deliver great food and great service. It's got to be Instagram worthy.""

"Scientists have created plants that glow in the dark. They are hoping to produce plants that can light up our lives. The scientists are from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA. They hope their discovery could lead to plant lights replacing electric lights. One day, even light that trees produce could replace street lights. Professor Michael Strano, lead author of the research, explained that his team wants to create sustainable light sources and help the environment. He said: ""The vision is to make a plant that will function as a desk lamp - a lamp that you don't have to plug in. The light is ultimately powered by the energy metabolism of the plant itself.""The researchers got the idea for their lighting plants from fireflies. They looked at the substance in fireflies that makes them glow. They created nanoparticles that contain the substance. They then put the nanoparticles into plant leaves to make them glow. The scientists were able to make plants that glowed for nearly four hours. The research team has tested the substance on salad leaves, including spinach and watercress. Professor Strano said: ""Our target is to perform one treatment, when the plant is a seedling or a mature plant, and have it last for the lifetime of the plant.""

He joined Facebook in 2007 and became a vice president. He was responsible for increasing the number of users Facebook had. Mr Palihapitiya said he feels very guilty about getting more people to use social networks. He said the networks are destroying society because they are changing people's behavior. Twenty years ago, people talked to each other face to face. Today, people message each other and do not talk. People also really care about what other people think of them. They post photos and wait to see how many people like the photo. They get very sad if people do not like the photo.Mr Palihapitiya said people should take a long break from social media so they can experience real life. He wants people to value each other instead of valuing online ""hearts, likes, and thumbs-up"". Palihapitiya also points out how fake news is affecting how we see the world. It is becoming easier for large websites to spread lies. It is also becoming easier to hurt other people online. Anyone can hide behind a fake user name and post lies about other people. Palihapitiya said this was a global problem. He is worried about social media so much that he has banned his children from using it. However, he did state that Facebook was a good company.

"Millions more people around the world have high blood pressure. This news came earlier this week when the American Heart Association (AHA) changed the numbers at which high blood pressure starts. For many decades, doctors said high blood pressure started at a reading of 140 over 90. The AHA has changed this and said the disease should be treated sooner. It said high blood pressure now starts at a reading of 130 over 80. Blood pressure happens when your heart pushes blood around your body too fast. If this pushing is too strong, it can put stress on your heart and arteries. This can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Normal blood pressure is less than 120 over 80.AHA doctors said health problems can happen at the lower figures of 130 over 80. However, they said it is possible for people to deal with this level of blood pressure without taking medicine. They said the new reading is, ""a yellow light that you need to be lowering your blood pressure, mainly with non-drug approaches"". People with high blood pressure need to make healthy lifestyle changes. These include losing weight, exercising more, eating healthier food, avoiding alcohol and salt, quitting smoking and avoiding stress.

"New research shows that it is bad for children to watch TV, tablet or mobile phone screens before bedtime. Researchers from the University of Colorado found that ""screen time"" before sleeping damages children's health. The researchers looked at over 60 different studies on how screen time affects children. They said: ""Of more than five dozen studies looking at children aged from 5 to 17 around the world, 90 per cent have found that more screen time is associated with delayed bedtime, fewer hours of sleep, and poorer sleep quality."" Screens are becoming smaller and smaller, so children can look at them in bed. More than 75 per cent of children in the study had some kind of screen in their bedroom.Children need a lot more sleep than adults. Pre-school children need 10 to 13 hours, pre-teens should get between nine and 12 hours, and teenagers should be getting between eight and 10 hours a night. The researchers highlighted three main reasons how screens affect children's sleep. First, the light from screens upsets a child's body clock. The light from screens getting into children's eyes before they sleep tricks their body into thinking it is still daytime. Second, children often watch videos of things that excite them or interest them. This keeps their brain active, so they take longer to sleep. Finally, when children are watching screens, they are not exercising. Children need physical activity to make them tired.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1711/171108-screen-time.html,breakingnewsenglish,

A new study may have an answer about why this is. The study looked at the eating habits of two- to four-year-olds. It found that not liking greens is because of a child's genes. This means parents do not have to stress out over their children not eating enough vegetables. Many parents worry because they cannot get their children to eat healthily. The study found that changes in two genes can make children dislike greens. The changes put some youngsters off trying new food and can turn them into fussy eaters.The study found that changes in DNA can affect how some small children taste things differently. These children think many green vegetables taste very bitter. Children without the DNA changes do not think these vegetables are bitter.

"Many of the world's plants are in danger of dying out. A scientist, Dr Paul Smith, said one in five of the world's plants is in danger of extinction. Botanic gardens contain about 100,000 species, including a third of all the world's endangered plants. Botanic gardens help to protect around 40 per cent of endangered species of plants. They contain many of the rarest plants. Dr Smith said: ""This is the first time that we have carried out a global assessment to look at the wide range of plants grown, managed and conserved in botanic gardens. For the first time we know what we have and, perhaps more importantly, what is missing from botanic gardens.""Researcher Dr Samuel Brockington said the world's botanic gardens were the best hope for saving the world's most endangered plants. He said: ""Currently, an estimated one-fifth of plant diversity is under threat, yet there is no technical reason why any plant species should become extinct."" Dr Brockington warned that if we do not protect endangered plants, people could have trouble finding food and fuel in the future. He said: ""If we do not conserve our plant diversity, humanity will struggle to solve the global challenges of food and fuel security…and climate change."" Most of the plants are in danger because of humans cutting down forests for farming and cities, and because of pests and climate change.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1709/170929-botanic-gardens.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"U.K. police have said a man who put a bomb on a London subway train bought most of the parts for the bomb online. Police have accused an 18-year-old Iraqi refugee of planting the bomb on a busy commuter train on September 15. The bomber left his device on a packed subway carriage during the peak rush hour. The bomb exploded at Parsons Green subway station at 8.20am. It caused burns to the face and body of 30 passengers. Police said there would have been more casualties if the bomb had worked properly. It didn't detonate fully so there was less harm to humans than there could have been. Police said the bomb contained, ""knives, screws, glass and similar items to increase the likelihood of death"".The bomber bought many of the ingredients for his device from the online shopping site Amazon. One of these ingredients was several hundred grams of an explosive called TATP. This is also called ""Mother of Satan"" because it is so powerful. Police said the bomber used it to create ""maximum destruction"". Reporters later checked Amazon for the ingredients and were shocked to find that the site directed them to other things that could be used to make bombs, in the ""items frequently bought together"" tab. Amazon said it will work to stop this happening.

Research from San Diego State University looked at data on teenage behaviour from the past 40 years, between 1976 and 2016. It looked at surveys on 8 million teens from seven different countries. Researchers said that compared to teenagers from the 70s, 80s and 90s, today's teens, ""are taking longer to engage in both the pleasures and the responsibilities of adulthood"". Professor Jean Twenge said: ""The whole developmental pathway has slowed down."" She said today's 18-year-olds are living more like 15-year-olds used to live. She said teenagers are taking far fewer risks than they did before.The researchers said today's teenagers are taking longer to do things their parents and grandparents did. They are older when they go on their first date, less likely to have a part-time job, and are less likely to drive. Professor Twenge said this is a, ""slow life strategy"". Researchers also found that more teenagers are spending longer living with their parents instead of renting their own room or apartment. One of the reasons for these behaviours is how much time teenagers spend online. The Internet is keeping teens on social media, looking at videos or playing games instead of living in the ""real world"".

"According to new research, men who are bald or going bald should not worry about their looks. Many bald men get stressed and depressed about losing their hair. However, research from the University of Pennsylvania shows that both women and men find bald men more attractive. The research also showed that people thought bald men were more confident and taller. Researchers asked male and female students to rate photos of men. They had to judge each picture based on three categories. They had to rate attractiveness, confidence and dominance. Bald men came top in every category. The study said: ""[Bald] men were viewed as nearly an inch taller and 13 per cent stronger.""The researchers said bald men could do better at work and in society because they have no hair. The study said they could be more successful in negotiations because they look stronger. However, the study had some bad news for bald men. It found a bald or shaved head makes a man look about four years older than he is. The American Hair Loss Association estimates that 85 per cent of men will be bald or going bald by the age of 50. The study might mean men don't have to spend billions of dollars every year trying to prevent or cure hair loss. Instead, they should be happy to be bald.

"Archaeologists in Egypt have found a tomb that has three mummies inside it. The ancient tomb is over 3,500 years old. It contains the mummified bodies of a woman and her two sons. Archaeologists say the tomb belonged to a royal goldsmith called Amenemhat and that the woman may be his wife. There was a statue of the goldsmith, sitting beside the woman. The tomb was found near the city of Luxor on the River Nile. Luxor is about 700km south of Egypt's capital city Cairo. Archaeologists say the woman was about 50 years old when she died. Tests show that she died because she had a bone disease. Her two sons were in their 20s and 30s. All three bodies were in very good condition.The site that contains Amenemhat's tomb consists of a courtyard and two burial shafts. It was discovered by an Egyptian archaeological team from Luxor Antiquities. The latest discovery came after six years of digging on the site.

"Do you ever wonder why we yawn? Do you always yawn when you see other people yawn? A new study from Nottingham University in the UK has done research on this. Researchers found that yawning is contagious. It is a powerful and unstoppable reaction. People automatically want to yawn when they see other people yawning. The researchers said people actually yawn more when they try to stop yawning. The researchers also found that some people have a much stronger urge to yawn than other people. Lead researcher Professor Stephen Jackson said that even reading about yawning could be enough to make people yawn. You might even want to yawn right now.The researchers studied the reactions and brain activity of 36 adult volunteers. The volunteers looked at video clips of other people yawning. They then had two choices - either to stop themselves yawning or to allow themselves to do it. The volunteers were videoed as they yawned or tried not to yawn. The researchers also monitored the brain activity of the volunteers and checked how strong their feeling to want to yawn was.

He launched his start-up project last year and called it Koniku. He has raised over $1 million in funding. Dr Agabi said his project is already making profits of $10 million. Technology giants like Google and Microsoft are very interested in it. The security industry is also keeping a close watch. Koniku could be put in drones and smell bombs and explosives. It could also be used in airport security systems to smell explosives. An additional use could be in hospitals to smell diseases in humans.Dr Agabi did not base Koniku on silicon chips. Agabi said computers have used silicon for decades, but it is not powerful enough to deal with the maths needed to recognize smells. Instead, he based his device on neurons from the brain of a mouse. Neurons are cells in the brain that share information. They use electricity and chemical signals to process and send information. Using neurons in computers is called biotechnology. Agabi said biotechnology can make devices that can smell. He said: ""Biology is technology. Bio is tech. Our deep learning networks are all copying the brain.""

New research shows that only 59 per cent of British Jews feel welcome in the UK, which is their home. More than 10,000 British Jews were interviewed in the large-scale study. Around 40 per cent of Britain's Jews said they felt afraid and hid their religion in public. The research is from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism (CAA). It found there has been a 45 per cent surge in anti-Semitic crime since 2014.The study revealed that more than three-quarters believed that Britain's largest left-wing political party, the Labour Party, has fuelled anti-Semitism. People said its negative opinions on Israel created bad feeling towards Jews. They also said its leader failed to crack down on anti-Semitism within the party. Another reason was the fact that very few anti-Semitic hate crimes go to court. Fewer than 24 such crimes go to court each year.

Exposing small kids to dirt helps them to build their immune system. Dr Gilbert even argues that children often get allergies because parents try to protect their kids too much and try too hard to clean everything that children use. He said parents now over-sterilize everything in the home. This causes children's immune systems to become too sensitive, which can lead to things like asthma, eczema, and food allergies.

The three tatami rooms are on the second floor of the house.Starbucks has done its best to make sure the coffee shop blends in with its traditional surroundings. There are no neon signs and no big, green Starbucks names or logos. Instead, there is a traditional dark-blue curtain hanging over the front door. The coffee shop's logo is printed on the curtain in black. Starbucks has reformed the house in the traditional style and has created a Japanese garden for people to look at. The company also wants to be a good neighbor. It has decided not to let people form lines in front of the shop as they wait to get in. It will also limit the number of customers during peak hours. This is to avoid disrupting the quiet atmosphere in the area with crowds of customers.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1707/170703-coffee-shop.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"The president of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, has won the 2017 World Food Prize. Mr Adesina won the prize and $250,000. He got the award for his two decades of work in increasing food production in Africa. He used his experience as a top banker to help agriculture in Africa. He helped to change many farming laws and made it easier for small farmers to get loans for their business. He also helped farmers to modernize their farms and the way they grow their crops. The World Food Prize Foundation President, Kenneth Quinn, said Mr. Adesina won the prize, ""for driving change in African agriculture for over 25 years and improving food security for millions across the continent"".The World Food Prize was created by the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman Borlaug. He is known as the father of the ""green revolution"". He helped to breed crops that produced more food and were stronger and more resistant against disease. His work helped to prevent famine in Asia in the 1960s. Mr Quinn said Adesina ""grew up in poverty"" in Africa and decided to do his best at school to get a good education. He got a PhD. in agricultural economics. He became a leader in African banking and was also Nigeria's Minister of Agriculture from 2011 to 2015.

"Scientists believe they know why birds' eggs are different shapes. Some eggs are quite round; some are kind of potato-shaped; and others are longer and pointy. Two thousand years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle said flatter eggs had female chicks inside them and rounder eggs contained male chicks. But he was wrong. A new study from Princeton University in the USA suggests that the shape of the egg depends on how well and how fast the female bird flies. Professor Mary Stoddard said: ""It has not gone unnoticed that birds have evolved to [lay eggs with] shapes that are quite diverse in form - everything from a spherical owl egg to a pointy sandpiper egg.""Professor Stoddard and her colleagues created a mathematical formula to map the shape of different eggs. They looked at almost 50,000 eggs from 1,400 different bird species. The researchers put the shape, length and height of the eggs into a computer database. They also looked at how oval the eggs were. The researchers found that the birds that laid the most-oval-shaped eggs were the best fliers. Professor Stoddard said: ""We were shocked to see that one of the best explanations for egg shape variation was flight ability."" The researchers found that hummingbirds and sandpipers laid the most-oval-shaped eggs; owls laid the roundest eggs; and sea birds laid the pointiest eggs.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1706/170625-eggs.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"YouTube has announced a plan ""to fight online terror"". One of the things YouTube says it will do is to find dangerous videos and delete them. This includes videos on how to make fire-bombs and other deadly devices. Google, which owns YouTube, announced four things it would do to tackle the problem of dangerous videos. Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president, called these things: ""Four steps we're taking today to fight online terror."" The first step is to ask users to identify or flag videos that might help terrorists. The second step is to remove the videos. The third step is to focus on videos that could make people become terrorists. Finally, step four is to show ""anti-terrorism"" adverts.There are many problems with making the four steps work. Perhaps the biggest problem is that it is a huge task to monitor so many videos on YouTube. Over one hour of video is uploaded to YouTube each second. The advertising company AdWeek said one hundred years' of video is uploaded every 10 days. Another problem is that many of the videos Google wants to target are not illegal. Mr Walker said even a BBC news video could be used by terrorists in the wrong way. Walker said Google would use software that will learn what content breaks its guidelines. A further problem is how to delete videos that do not break YouTube's guidelines but still have content that could turn people towards terrorism.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1706/170621-youtube.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Scientists have developed a drug that can copy the effects of sunlight. The new drug tricks the skin into making it darker and giving us a suntan. The drug makes our body produce more of a natural pigment found in our skin called melanin. A pigment is something in our body that colours our skin. Plants also have pigments that give them different colours. The scientists are from the Massachusetts General Hospital in the USA. They say their new drug could have many benefits for our health. The biggest benefits could be to prevent skin cancer and perhaps even slow down how old people look. Too much sunlight and getting suntans can give us skin cancer, make our skin look old and give us many wrinkles.Scientists say the drug can safely give people suntans because there are no damaging UV rays. When people are out in the sun, UV rays slowly burn our skin and damage it. The rays make lighter-skinned people turn red, unless those people use sunblock or cover their skin. The drug makes the body produce more dark melanin, which makes our skin look tanned. Melanin is the body's natural sunblock. Researcher Dr David Fisher said the drug could help fight skin cancer - the most common type of cancer. He said the drug could make our body produce more melanin. This could protect the skin from UV radiation and cancer. He said: ""Dark pigment is associated with a lower risk of all forms of skin cancer.""",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1706/170617-suntan.html,breakingnewsenglish,

There will be a 4x400m mixed relay in athletics and a 4x100m mixed relay in swimming. British Olympics swimming champion Adam Peaty told the BBC that having mixed events in Tokyo would make the Olympics ""more fun"".

IOC president Thomas Bach said the Games will be ""more youthful, more urban and include more women"". Not everyone is happy with the introduction of the new events. Some people said it was wrong to include urban sports like skateboarding, 3-on-3 basketball, sport climbing and BMX freestyle. These are to try and get more young people to watch the Games.

The IEP has reported on world peace for the past 10 years. Every year, it publishes a document called the Global Peace Index (GPI). This index ranks 163 countries and territories on their level of peacefulness. It also offers advice on how to develop peaceful societies. The latest report found that the world became 0.28% more peaceful over the past year. Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world. It has been number one on the GPI since 2008.

"Scientists believe they have found how flamingos stand on one leg. We all love the image of these beautiful birds standing in water on just one leg. The reason why the birds do this has puzzled scientists for decades. Researchers in Atlanta, USA, say they have uncovered this secret of the natural world. Professor Young-Hui Chang says a flamingo can stand on just one leg for many hours because of its skeleton. The flamingo's hips and leg bones are in a special shape and position that give the bird amazing balance. Professor Chang said the flamingo's basic anatomy (bone structure) means it can stand on one leg with ease. Flamingos do not have to use their muscles a lot to do this.Another researcher, Lena Ting, said the flamingo is very unique because it can stand still for a long time on one leg. He said it would be very difficult for a human to stay still without moving, even for an hour. He said: ""Most of us aren't aware that we're moving around all the time."" He added that even when we stand still, we actually move and use a lot of energy. The muscles in our body constantly change to keep us straight and stop us from falling over. The position of the bones in a flamingo means the birds do not need to use so many muscles to keep still. This means they save energy. The researchers say that saving energy could also be the reason other birds stand and sleep on one leg.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1705/170526-flamingos.html,breakingnewsenglish,

Microsoft said the WannaCry ransomware cyber-attack happened because the NSA keeps lots of cyber-weapons on its computers. Ransomware is a type of harmful software that blocks access to a computer until the owner of the computer pays money (a ransom) to the hackers. The NSA is America's military intelligence organization. It helps to keep America's communications and information systems safe. It is also responsible for stopping cyber-attacks against the USA. However, experts say the WannaCry ransomware used computer spying tools originally designed by the NSA.

"The world-famous Maori war dance (the haka) and being bilingual may help Maori people keep dementia away. Researchers from the University of Auckland in New Zealand say performing the haka and speaking two languages (Maori and English) might help Maoris avoid getting dementia. A study by New Zealand's Ministry of Health compared rates of dementia among citizens in their 80s and 90s. They expected to find higher rates of dementia among Maoris. This is because Maoris generally have less access to health care, less income, and more heart diseases than non-Maoris. However, researchers found no differences in rates of dementia between Maoris and non-Maoris.The haka is a traditional war cry or challenge. It is done by a group of people who all chant and repeat the same energetic movements and stamping of the feet. It was originally performed by warriors before a battle. They wanted to show their strength and frighten their enemy. The New Zealand Native football team started using it in 1888. The New Zealand rugby team (the famous All Blacks) then started using it before their matches in 1905. It is now a key part of the pre-match preparations for the All Blacks rugby team.

Lead researcher Professor Dion Sommer said we become, ""more mentally flexible with age, more tolerant of other people"". He said this could be the reason why older mothers do not scold and physically discipline their children as much as younger mothers. He added that, ""this style of parenting can contribute to a positive psycho-social environment"" as the child grows up.The findings of the research showed that the average age of the women while pregnant was about 31. Studies show that older mothers worry less during pregnancy and are happier and more positive about becoming parents and towards their children in general. This may mean they are more caring and supportive of their children. Older mothers also tend to be in more stable relationships, they are better off financially and they have had a better education. Researchers also found that children born to older mothers have a better language ability than those born to younger mothers. This may be because older mothers spend more time with their children and talk to them more often.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1703/170331-older-mothers.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Scientists from Bristol University in the UK say they have found a way to mass produce blood that would be suitable for patients who need it in hospitals. For a number of years, they have been able to produce red blood cells in a laboratory. However, the process to do that was very slow and they could not produce a lot of blood. The new technique means scientists can make an ""unlimited supply"" of blood. Researcher Dr Jan Frayne said: ""Previous approaches to producing red blood cells have relied on various sources of stem cells which can only presently produce very limited quantities."" She added: ""We have demonstrated a feasible way to sustainably manufacture red cells for clinical use.""Professor David Anstee, another of the researchers, told the BBC that his team has found a way to mass produce blood, but they now need the technology to actually do this on a large scale. He said: ""There is a bioengineering challenge. To produce that much [blood] is quite a challenge….The next phase of our work is to look at methods of [producing more]."" He told reporters that to begin with, they would produce only rare types of blood, as these can be difficult to find with traditional blood donation sources. He said: ""The first therapeutic use of a cultured red cell product is likely to be for patients with rare blood groups, because suitable conventional red blood cell donations can be difficult to source.""

"A park in Beijing, China has started a trial to try and save toilet paper and prevent thieves from stealing it. Park officials have installed six facial recognition scanners at the city's Temple of Heaven Park. The machines will scan someone's face before providing him or her with 60 cm of toilet paper. That same person will then have to wait for nine minutes if they want extra paper. A park spokesman said there was a problem of visitors to the toilets taking too much toilet paper. He said some people came and filled their bags with it. The park had put up posters and broadcast messages over loudspeakers asking visitors to use less toilet paper.The new facial recognition scanners have brought a surprise. They have become a tourist attraction. Visitors are now coming to look at and try out the machines. Videos of people pulling strips of toilet paper from the machines have gone viral on social media sites. Staff are available to help people with problems using the machines or for people who urgently need more toilet paper. The scanners seem to be popular. A user on the Chinese social media site Weibo commented: ""This is a really good idea. I recommend that it be rolled out in toilets nationwide."" The trial appears to be successful so far. The daily amount of toilet paper used in the park's toilets has gone down by 20 per cent.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1703/170323-facial-recognition.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Have you ever wondered why everyone's nose is a different shape? Researchers have come up with a possible explanation for this. A study from Pennsylvania State University in the USA says the Earth's climate could have something to do with the shape of our nose. The study found that people who have wider noses usually live in warmer, more humid areas. People with narrower noses are more commonly found in colder and drier climates. The nose plays an important function in making sure the air we breathe reaches our lungs in a warm and moist condition. The width of the nostrils and length of the nose help to make sure this happens. Researchers said the nose is a little like a temperature controller.The researchers used 3D images to measure the noses of more than 2,600 people from Africa, Asia and Europe. They measured the width of the nostrils, the distance between nostrils and nose height. The researchers said their findings could help people who move to different climates to adjust to the heat or cold, and the humidity. This could help reduce respiratory problems. Study co-author Dr Arslan Zaidi said increased travel and climate change make it difficult to predict if our nose will change shape in the future. He said: ""Our lifestyles aren't what they used to be. We move around the world way too much. That makes it very complicated to predict the future [evolution] of the nose with the changing climate.""",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1703/170319-nose-shape.html,breakingnewsenglish,

The first problem is fake news. He said websites and companies are creating fake news just to make money, or to try and change people's political opinions. He said the danger is that fake news ""spreads like wildfire"". The second problem is political advertising. He said adverts are used in ""unethical ways"" to stop voters from voting or to make them click on fake news stories. His final concern is the misuse of personal data by governments. He said people are killed in some countries because of the websites they visit.Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989. He said that it had ""lived up to [his] vision"" in many ways. He said: ""I imagined the web as an open platform that would allow everyone, everywhere to share information, access opportunities and collaborate across geographic and cultural boundaries."" His letter outlined a five-year strategy to keep his vision alive. He said there were complex problems, and that the solutions would not be simple. He wants to put, ""a fair level of data control back in the hands of people"".

"Are you good at remembering things? Can you remember a long list of English vocabulary quickly and easily? If the answer to these two questions is 'no,' help may be at hand. A new study says pretty much anyone can have an upgraded memory if they train their brain. Scientists say that we can train our brain to be a ""memory athlete"" just like athletes train to be champions. Neuroscientist Martin Dresler wrote in the journal ""Neuron"" that just six weeks of brain training can turn people with average memories into people with an incredible ability to remember things. Dr Dresler even suggested people could train their brain to enter the World Memory Championships that are held in March every year.Dr Dresler compared MRI scans of the brains of 23 of the world's top 50 memory champions with the brains of ""normal"" people. He said: ""We were interested in what differentiates memory champions from normal people, like you and me."" He was surprised to find no differences. This made him believe we can all become memory athletes with the right training. Dresler found that 40 days of daily 30-minute training sessions using a memory technique called mnemonics more than doubled a person's memory capacity. Mnemonics is an ancient memory device that helps people remember things, especially in list form. Who knows?

"Ever since the discovery of a new solar system several weeks ago, scientists have been discussing whether planets in the system could contain life. Scientists called the system ""TRAPPIST-1"". It contains a small sun and seven Earth-sized planets. It is very similar to our own solar system. NASA scientist Michael Gillon said three of the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets receive as much heat from its sun as Venus, Earth and Mars receive from our Sun. He said this provides the right environment for life to exist. TRAPPIST-1 is in a star system called Aquarius. It is nearly 40 light-years away from the Earth. Its sun is smaller than our Sun and has just 1/1000th of its brightness, but that could be enough to support life.Michael Gillon explained that you could see the other six planets in the sky if you were on one of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. A neighbouring planet could look bigger than our view of our Moon. Mr Gillon said: ""If you were on the surface of one of these planets, you would have a wonderful view of the other planets. You wouldn't see them like we see Venus or Mars, like dots of light. You would see them really as we see the Moon. You would see the structures on these worlds.""

"Radio listeners in Bulgaria can now start listening to modern music again. For the past two months, they could only listen to music that was over 70 years old. A dispute over copyright meant the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) could not play any pop music. Listeners could only listen to classical music or folk songs that were recorded before World War II. In the European Union, copyright disappears 70 years after an artist's death. BNR has now signed a deal with the copyright organization. In the deal, BNR will pay more royalty fees. A part of these fees goes to the singer, band, composer or songwriter of a song or a piece of music. Every time the radio plays a song, it must pay royalties to the artist. Something surprising happened during the two-month dispute over copyright and royalties. The number of listeners to BNR's shows increased by 20 per cent. After the radio station started playing only Bulgarian folk tunes, classical music and pre-war jazz, more people started listening to the radio. It seems many listeners are more interested in listening to older music than Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. BNR is now thinking about changing its music programming. BNR boss Aleksandar Velev said there could even be new radio stations. Mr Velev told reporters: ""We will not change the profiles of the current radio shows.

"Scientists have conducted tests on mice showing that fasting could have many health benefits. Fasting is eating or drinking very little or nothing for a short period of time. It is usually around 24 hours but can be for a few days. The tests were carried out by scientists at universities in the USA and Italy. They found that occasional fasting in mice could reduce the risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other diseases. The scientists fed mice for four days on a low-calorie, low-protein and low-carbohydrate but high-fat diet. They then gave the mice just 10% of their normal calorie intake for three days. The scientists found this diet made the pancreas in the mice work better.The pancreas is an organ in the body that uses special cells called beta cells to produce the hormone insulin. The body uses insulin to break down glucose (a kind of sugar) in the blood. People with diabetes have trouble producing enough insulin so they have health problems because there is too much sugar in their blood. This can cause death. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops producing insulin. In type 2 diabetes, either not enough insulin is produced or the insulin that is produced has no effect. Scientists said the mice on the fasting diet produced increased amounts of beta cells and insulin. They said their results were very promising and that tests now need to be done on humans.",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1702/170227-fasting-diet.html,breakingnewsenglish,

Have you ever spent ages trying to scrape the last bits of jam from the sides of the jar? If the answer to these questions is 'yes,' you may be happy to know that a solution to your problems is coming. Scientists have invented a super-slippery surface that can be put on the inside of bottles, tubes, jars, tins and other containers. The slippery inside means anything will just slide out, like water. Every last drop of things like glue, paint and cosmetics will come out, leaving the container totally empty, and making you happier and richer.Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the company LiquiGlide wanted to create something that would reduce waste and save us money.

"We were taught at school that there were nine planets, but now there are eight (scientists said Pluto is not a planet). Now we may have to change our thinking about how many continents there are. We are taught there are seven continents - Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. Geologists (people who study the land and the earth) now say there is an eighth continent - Zealandia. This is a huge, largely underwater landmass in the southern Pacific Ocean. Six per cent of this landmass is above water and is what we know as New Zealand and New Caledonia. Around 94 per cent of it is under the ocean. In total, it measures five million square kilometres, which scientists say is big enough to be a continent.Geologists explained why they think Zealandia is a continent. They wrote a research paper and published it in the Geological Society of America's Journal. They argue that the land does not have to be above water for it to be a continent. They said four different points make Zealandia a continent. It is a lot higher than the surrounding area, it has a unique geology, it is easy to find the shape of the continent, and it is a lot thicker than the ocean floor. Nick Mortimer, a geologist at GNS Science in New Zealand, said it would be easy to understand that Zealandia is a continent, ""if you could pull the plug on the world's oceans"" and let the water out.

"A team of engineers has created a super-thin material that could help keep buildings cool. The team is from the University of Colorado Boulder in the USA. Engineers from the university developed the revolutionary new material, that is very thin and can cool objects even under direct sunlight. The material does not need energy to work nor does it need water to help keep things cool. The engineers say the new material could provide an answer to air conditioners, which are expensive to run and need a lot of water. The material is unlike anything found in nature. It is a glass-polymer hybrid that is just 50 micrometers thick. That's slightly thicker than the aluminium foil we use for cooking.The engineers explained how their new material works. They said when it is put on top of something, two things happen. The first thing is that it cools the object underneath by reflecting the sun's rays back into space. At the same time, the second thing happens - the material removes the object's own heat and sends that into the air. An engineer said: ""The key advantage of this technology is that it works 24/7 with no electricity or water usage….We're excited about the opportunity to explore potential uses in the power industry, aerospace, agriculture and more.""

The silk that spiders spin is incredibly strong and is tougher than steel. For decades, scientists have been researching what makes the silk so amazing. Finally, researchers from Sweden's University of Agricultural Sciences and the Karolinska Institute have found the answer. They found that the materials for webs are stored in a spider's silk gland as protein. The gland has a level of acidity that helps to make the protein into very strong silk. The researchers copied this process to make enough artificial spider-web silk to stretch for one kilometer.The new artificial silk could be very useful to humans. Doctors are interested in it to use for stitches. They also think it can help the skin recover after a burn. Some doctors believe the new silk could replace torn ligaments in the body.

Researchers have worked out the genetic code of the Southeast Asian tiger tail seahorse. They now have the genetic map of all of its DNA. This means scientists can find out a lot more about this sea creature than before. They can now start to figure out why seahorses are so different to other fish. Unlike other fish, seahorses have no teeth. Another difference is the male brooding of their young - male seahorses carry babies and give birth to them instead of females. In addition, seahorses do not swim horizontally like other fish; they swim vertically (up and down).Scientists from Germany’s University of Konstanz and others from China and Singapore helped to sequence the genome of the tiger tail seahorse. A genome is a map of all the genes and genetic information in a cell or organism. Seahorses started to change from other fish about 100 million years ago.

"The government of Venezuela has seized nearly 4 million children's toys from a toy distributor. It will give the toys to children for free or at discounted prices in time for Christmas. The government says the distributor was unfairly charging high prices for the toys, which meant only the richest people could buy them. Venezuela has one of the highest rates of inflation in the world. This is the rate at which prices go up. The IMF says the rate could be as much as 2,000 per cent in 2017. Many Venezuelans can't afford to buy non-essential items like toys. Even a jar of Nutella can cost half the monthly minimum salary. In the past few months, Venezuela has also ordered price cuts on clothes.In total, the government seized 3,821,926 toys from two warehouses. It tweeted: ""Our children are sacred. We will not let anyone rob them at Christmas. Boys and girls of this country will have a happy Christmas."" The government said the toy distributor was keeping the toys out of the shops to reduce their supply and so increase prices. The government also accused the company of buying them with dollars it got at very low rates several years ago and now wanted to sell the toys at much higher prices. The toy distributor has said it has done nothing wrong and was not trying to sell the toys at high prices to make huge profits.

Instead, the post went viral and 1.2 million people have said they would attend the party. Crescencio Ibarra said he would not turn away anyone who came to the party for his daughter Rubi. He said everyone was invited. Mr Ibarra said in a TV interview that he had no idea why his post became so popular and why more than a million people accepted his invitation. He said: ""We wanted to invite the people from the area, that's all.""

"A new study shows that having a low social status can be bad for our health. The study was on monkeys. Researchers from Duke University in the USA looked at the behaviour and health of 45 female monkeys and found that those with a lower social status had more health problems. The monkeys were split up into five groups of nine. The researchers gave the monkeys in each group time to get to know each other. Then they took one monkey from each group and put her into another group. This meant she was the ""new girl"" and was at the bottom of the group. When scientists checked the health of the monkeys, they found that the ""new girl"" was unhealthier than the other monkeys.The researchers said that although their study focused on monkeys, the findings could also be true for humans because we share a lot of our DNA with monkeys. Professor Graham Rook, from University College London, told the BBC News that the findings of the study may also apply to humans. He said governments must understand that people with a lower social status suffer more from health problems. He said that just because ""people at the bottom"" have got cars and TVs, it does not mean they are happy. If they feel they are at the bottom compared with richer people, their health will worsen.

"Plant biologists have thought of a clever new way to increase the size of crops by as much as 20 per cent. They have genetically modified part of the mechanism in plants that is responsible for photosynthesis. Of course, photosynthesis is the most important chemical reaction in the world. It is the process where plants use sunlight to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. This means we can all breathe. The scientists have found a way for plants to use the energy they get from sunlight better, so they grow bigger and produce more food. Lead researcher Professor Stephen Long said his team is genetically modifying staple crops such as rice, wheat, maize and soybean – the world's biggest crops.The scientists targeted the mechanism that plants use to protect themselves from damage when the Sun's rays are too strong. To prevent damage, plants turn their energy into heat, which disappears into the air. However, this heat-loss process continues even when clouds block the Sun. The scientists put extra copies of the heat-loss genes into modified plants. These additional copies speed up the heat-loss process so the plants can more quickly return to using energy to grow. Professor Long believes this could help the world's food needs. He said if he could get 20 per cent more food from crops, ""that would greatly [reduce] what we see as the future pressure on food supply"".",B1,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1611/161119-photosynthesis.html,breakingnewsenglish,

"There are calls to end the semi-annual practice of putting our clocks backwards and forwards an hour. It is done by forwarding clocks by one hour in the spring so that evening daylight lasts an hour longer and then putting them back in the autumn. This is done in many parts of the world and is called Daylight Saving Time (DST). Scientists are questioning the value of tinkering with time. They say changing the clocks could actually be harmful to our health and increase energy costs. The States of California and Massachusetts in the USA are considering unilaterally abandoning DST. Lawmakers there feel it has no relevance today when we have electric lights and people work around the clock.Those in support of DST argue that it saves energy because lights are turned on later. They argue it promotes outdoor leisure activities in the summer evening, and is therefore good for physical and psychological health. They also say it reduces traffic accidents and crime. People who tend to support DST are city workers, retail businesses, outdoor sports enthusiasts and businesses, tour operators, and others who benefit from increased light during the evening in summer. Opponents say it increases energy costs and causes health risks. The incidence of heart attacks and strokes can increase due to changes in the circadian cycle (our body clock).

"The World Health Organization (WHO) and International Labour Organization have issued a stark warning about the danger of overworking. They said working long hours is causing the premature death of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. The two organizations analysed the link between loss of life and working long hours. Their findings were sobering. Around three-quarters of a million workers die early after suffering strokes and heart attacks as a result of working over 55 hours a week. Most of these deaths were in people aged 60 to 70 who had worked at least 55 hours between the ages of 45 and 74. The researchers discovered that men accounted for 72 per cent of the deaths.The WHO study revealed that people who work at least 55 hours a week have a 42 per cent increased risk of stroke, and a 19 per cent increased chance of heart disease. Researchers analysed data from workforces in 154 countries. They looked at data collected from 1970 to 2018. The WHO Director-General said: ""No job is worth the risk of stroke or heart disease. Governments, employers and workers need to work together to agree on limits to protect the health of workers."" The WHO said over nine per cent of workers overwork.

The answer is... nonuplets. A 25-year-old Malian woman, Halima Cisse, has given birth to nine healthy babies. This is a new record. The previous record was by a woman in the US who delivered eight babies (octuplets) at a single birth. People in Mali were avidly following the progress of Ms Cisse's pregnancy and she was inundated with well wishes. Malians were not the only ones who were pleasantly surprised when doctors announced the nonuplets.

It is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome and is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built. It was completed over two millennia ago in AD 80. The plans will see the monument fitted with a new floor that will allow visitors the chance to stand where Roman gladiators once fought for their lives. Gladiators were used to entertain audiences during the Roman Empire by fighting to the death with swords against other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals.Italy's Culture Minister Dario Franceschini announced the high-tech project and said it would open to the public by 2023. It is projected to cost around 18.5 million euro, or $22.2 million. The Colosseum currently has no floor.

"Plastic has been a blight on the landscape and a deadly threat to wildlife for decades. Environmentalists have issued many pleas for us to reduce the amount of plastic we use or switch to biodegradable alternatives. One solution to this problem may be at hand. Scientists have developed a form of biodegradable plastic. This means that the billions of plastic bags, cups, straws and utensils that we dispose of each day could be ""compostable"" - they could decompose and break down as naturally as organic waste. The scientists are from the University of California, Berkeley. They say they have invented a plastic that could break down within a few weeks, rather than centuries, using just heat and water.The new, biodegradable product involves embedding polyester-eating enzymes into the plastic during the production process. When these enzymes are exposed to heat and water, they eat away at the plastic and reduce it to lactic acid. This provides nutrients for the soil when composted. Professor Ting Xu said up to 98 per cent of the plastic her team made degraded into small molecules. She said: ""We are basically saying that we are on the right track. We can solve this continuing problem of single-use plastics."" She added: ""Look at all the wasted stuff we throw away - clothing, shoes, electronics like cellphones and computers.

He said: ""Self-awareness is a rather poorly investigated area of dog cognition."" He added: ""Body awareness is a mental capacity to organize someone's action by taking in consideration their own body exists."" His test put dogs in situations that would make them aware of their body position. The study is published in the journal ""Scientific Reports"".The scientists conducted tests on 54 dogs. The dogs had to respond to commands from their owners. Researchers attached a toy to a mat and asked the dog to give the toy to its owner. The dog had to understand it would be unable to take the toy to its owner unless it got off the mat first. Many of the dogs understood the issue and got off the mat to complete the task.

"Staff at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra have been requested to avoid the use of certain words related to gender. ANU's Gender Institute issued a list of replacement terms for everyday words like 'mother' and 'father'. The switch in vocabulary is part of an initiative to encourage more gender-neutral language. Staff are being asked to use the term 'gestational parent' instead of 'mother,' and 'non-birthing parent' in place of 'father'. The institute's gender handbook claims the words 'mother' and 'father' exclude non-binary people. These are people who identify as being neither male nor female. Non-binary people feel unrepresented in society because of words that refer to males and females.The gender handbook explains the suggested nomenclature guidelines. It says: ""While many students will identify as 'mothers' or 'fathers,' using these terms alone to describe parenthood excludes those who do not identify with gender-binaries."" It added: ""This non-gendered language is particularly important in...discussions of childbirth and parenthood."" An ANU spokesperson said the handbook was just a guide. It said: ""This document is not an official ANU policy....It is a guide developed by expert researchers to assist anyone committed to enhancing inclusiveness and diversity.""

"The energy giant Royal Dutch Shell has announced it has passed its peak production of oil. The days of increasing oil production are over and the decline in output has started. Shell said in a press release that, ""oil production peaked in 2019"". The ""high point"" of Shell's oil production reached around 1.7 million barrels per day. It now expects an annual drop of up to two per cent per year. The fall comes a year ahead of Shell's initial forecasts. In 2015, the company predicted the peak of global oil demand would be in 2020. The announcement included news that Shell would reduce the number of its oil refineries from 14 sites to six. This means the loss of around 9,000 jobs, or more than 10 per cent of its workforce.Shell said it is shifting its focus onto renewables and reducing its carbon footprint. It pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The company said it wants to diversify into becoming an energy provider rather than relying on fossil fuels. It has been actively exploring new, green technologies such as carbon capture. It has also been buying companies that provide electric vehicle charging stations.

This spurred the manager of a branch of a local Chinese restaurant, Gyoza Ohsho, to get going. Keiichi Iwatani, 39, decided to feed those faced with spending the night in sub-zero temperatures. He delivered hundreds of gyoza dumplings, fried rice and crab omelettes to weary, anxious and snowbound drivers. Seven employees helped him to deliver the provisions on foot throughout the night to 300 hungry and relieved people.Mr Iwatani talked about his relief efforts to the Mainichi newspaper.

"A new study shows that while identical twins can look perfectly alike, it is not a perfect similarity. They are not clones of each other. Scientists at the University of Iceland analyzed the DNA from 387 pairs of identical twins - babies born from a single fertilized egg. The scientists compared the DNA with that of the twins' parents and children. The geneticists looked for mutations in the early stages of development. A mutation is a tiny change in the sequence of the DNA that can occur when a cell divides. This change causes a slight difference in the DNA replication process. A single, tiny change can create differences in height, intelligence, eye colour and even in susceptibility to disease.The study shows that identical twins do not share totally identical DNA. In about 15 per cent of identical twin pairs, one twin carried a ""substantial"" number of mutations that the other did not share. The scientists say this difference is important as it sheds light on the ""nature versus nurture"" debate. This is whether human behaviour is determined by the environment, socialization and upbringing, or by a person's genes. The research shows that this tiny difference, and not environmental factors, could be the reason why one twin develops different behavioural characteristics or medical conditions. Professor Kari Stefansson said a genetic mutation may be the source of a given disease or trait.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2101/210110-identical-twins.html,breakingnewsenglish,

In recent weeks, a fast-moving stream of water known as the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front has put the chunks on a trajectory that means they could run aground off the coast of South Georgia. Scientists say the three fragments are roughly 2,600 square kilometres in size.

They could also block the route between penguin colonies and their feeding grounds during the breeding season.

The vast majority of those who enjoy a slice of their favourite seasonal treat are unaware that there is a science behind its slicing. Dr Chris Budd, a professor of applied mathematics and geometry at two UK universities, tested several hypotheses on the optimal way to cut a Christmas cake into slices.

His solution was to cut the cake across the middle, leaving two semicircles, then cut slices and push the remaining halves together. He said: ""It works."" However, perhaps he would admit that it isn't exactly rocket science.According to Wikipedia, Christmas cake is an English tradition that began as plum porridge. The plums later gave way to raisins, sultanas, orange rind and other dried fruit. The fruit is often soaked in rum or brandy. It is quite common for the fruity loaf part of the cake to be covered in a layer of marzipan, and then the top and sides to be coated in icing. The icing is a hardened, white sugar coating that can be over a centimetre thick. The top of the cake is usually decorated with an array of Christmassy symbols like fir trees or snowmen and women.

Transport authorities in the town of Jasper, Alberta have erected electronic signs to warn drivers not to let moose lick their cars. Moose are the largest and heaviest members of the deer family and are native to Canada. They are a frequent sight on Canadian roads, but an addiction to salt has led them to sate their need by licking cars. Vehicles are splashed with road salt that has been sprinkled on the road to help melt snow. It is common to see moose licking salt on the roads, but they have now developed a preference for licking it off cars.A Jasper National Park spokesperson explained why the salt licking was a problem. He warned that the moose's addiction is becoming an increasing problem and could be fatal. He said: ""This behaviour started as an occasional issue a few years ago and now is too common. People are getting far too close, and it's perpetuated by the moose's obsession with salt."" A tour operator said: ""I hate to say it, but this road salt is kind of like a drug for the moose.""

"We all love and have enjoyed an all-you-can-eat buffet, but how many of us have had an ""all-you-can-stay"" holiday? It sounds too good to be true, but a hotel company in the Maldives is offering guests a once-in-a-lifetime vacation. The luxury Anantara Veli resort has a special package that includes unlimited use of its property for the whole of 2021. Customers will get the use of a two-person bungalow that is perched above the crystal-clear blue waters of the Indian Ocean. The resort is also throwing in airport transfers, 365 breakfasts, discounts on spa treatments, cooking lessons on Maldivian cuisine, and scuba diving. However, all this comes at a hefty cost of $30,000.The Maldives is a tiny archipelago nation in the Indian Ocean, about 700km from the southern tip of India. It has developed into a luxurious, high-end destination. It is famed for its pristine beaches, palm trees and five-star hospitality. The quality of its marine life has put it on the bucket list of adventure-seeking scuba divers. Many of its resorts are on private islands and atolls, making it a perfect choice for holidaymakers who seek seclusion and privacy in paradise.

"Poor diet and nutrition may be behind an average height gap of 20cm between the tallest and shortest children in different countries. Researchers from Imperial College London conducted a global analysis of the Body Mass Index (BMI) of schoolchildren and adolescents around the world. This involved measuring the height and weight of millions of children and teenagers. They discovered that the world's tallest 19-year-olds, at 183.8cm, lived in the Netherlands, while the shortest, at 160.1cm, lived in East Timor. The researchers said teenagers in northwest and central Europe were the tallest in the world. On average the shortest children lived in South and South-East Asia, Latin America and East Africa.The study was extremely comprehensive. It involved analysing data from 65 million children aged five to 19 years old in 193 countries. The researchers reported that children's height and weight varied enormously in different regions. The team warned that a lack of quality food and nutrition was a major factor behind stunted growth and a rise in childhood obesity. It said improved diets increased the average height of children in China. Nineteen-year-old boys there were 8cm taller in 2019 than in 1985. Researchers attribute this to improved nutrition. The lead author of the report urged countries to adopt policies that encouraged healthier eating, but to be aware of the perils of excessive weight gain.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2011/201111-diet-and-height.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"The Japanese gaming company Nintendo has predicted the year ending March 2021 will be a bumper year for its Switch games console. Executives said sales will be 26 per cent higher than initial forecasts. It expects to ship 24 million of its consoles by the end of the financial year. This is a 26 per cent increase from the previous forecast. The company said the rise in demand for the Switch console is partly attributable to a pandemic-driven boom in gaming. Millions of people have been staying indoors because of COVID-19 and have invested in a new games console. The result has provided Nintendo with an extra reason for optimism - its operating profit forecast is up by 50 per cent to $4.3 billion.The Nintendo Switch was unveiled in October 2016 and released worldwide in 2017. It is a hybrid console that can be used as either a home console or a portable, standalone device. It has controllers with motion sensing and tactile feedback. These can attach to both sides of the console to support handheld-style play like that of the Nintendo Wii. Gamers can play online through Internet connectivity, as well as with other consoles on a local wireless network. Developers have created over 320 games for the console, many from third-party companies.

"Scientists have announced the breathtaking news that there is water on the Moon. They said the Moon may hold water in more places and in larger amounts than they previously thought. The scientists are from NASA in the USA. Based on a detailed analysis of two separate studies, they confirmed the presence of water molecules on the side of the Moon we can see. Ice was thought to exist on the dark side of the Moon, which is permanently blocked from sunlight*. However, NASA said it found water on the sunlit parts of the lunar surface. The space agency says it identified a third of a litre of water in one area. This was not enough to form ice as the molecules were trapped in a cubic metre of rock. NASA's discovery could pave the way for more space exploration. It could be a game-changer in the quest to explore the heavens. It could accelerate the building of permanent bases on the Moon as it opens up the possibility of there being a sustainable source of drinking water. This could be turned into rocket fuel one day. A NASA spokesperson explained the significance of the discovery. He said: ""Water is extremely critical for deep space exploration. It's a resource of direct value for our astronauts. Any time we don't need to pack water for our trip, we have an opportunity to take other useful items with us.""

"Zoologists have long hailed saving the giant panda from the brink of extinction as a conservation success story. For decades, the panda has been the ""poster animal"" for all endangered species. It is even on the logo of the World Wildlife Fund. The International Union for Conservation of Nature removed it from the endangered species list in 2016, although it remains ""vulnerable"". Many conservationists are now concerned this has come at a cost to other mammals, especially those sharing its habitat. A study published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution found that the leopard, snow leopard, wolf and Asian wild dog have almost disappeared from the majority of areas in which the giant panda lives.Researcher Professor Sheng Li, from Peking University, commended the efforts to protect the giant panda but lamented this has come at the expense of some of China's larger, carnivorous mammals. Since panda conservation areas were established in the 1960s, Asian wild dogs have disappeared from 95% of protected reserves, leopards from 81%, wolves from 77%, and snow leopards from 38%. Professor Li said his findings ""indicate the insufficiency of giant panda conservation for protecting these large carnivore species"".

"Three people have been charged for their alleged involvement in the massive hacking attack on Twitter that took place on July the 15th. Hackers hacked into 130 high-profile accounts, including those of former US President Barack Obama, presidential candidate Joe Biden, rapper Kanye West, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The accounts of companies like Apple and Uber were also breached. The hack was part of a bitcoin scam. The perpetrators compromised Twitter's administrative tools to gain access to the accounts. They then altered the accounts to post legitimate-looking tweets that informed followers they could double any funds sent to a bitcoin account.The three suspects were arrested on Friday. One is a 19-year-old from the United Kingdom, the other two are American citizens aged 17 and 22. The 17-year-old is a resident of Florida. State investigators believe him to be the mastermind of the hack. A state attorney has filed 30 felony charges against him for ""scamming people across America"". The teen faces multiple charges, including 10 counts of fraudulent use of personal information.

"The annual Hajj is set to take place in the sacred city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The pilgrimage is one of the most important events in the Muslim calendar. It lasts approximately 5 to 6 days and is a mandatory religious duty for Muslims. Hajj must be carried out at least once in the lifetime of all adult Muslims. However, they must be physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey and must be able to support their family during their absence. This year's Hajj has been greatly scaled down because precautionary measures for coronavirus have been put in place. The pandemic has meant the postponement of numerous events, causing considerable disappointment for pilgrims.The Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah announced last month that it was severely limiting the number of pilgrims allowed to enter the holy site this year. Officials said the measures were to avoid any further outbreaks of COVID-19 and contain the risks of infection. Many Muslim-majority countries around the world have cancelled pilgrimages to Mecca. The result is that Mecca will see only a tiny fraction of the two million pilgrims it usually receives during Hajj. This year, places will be restricted to a few thousand Saudi Arabian citizens.

"A dam on the Blue Nile in Ethiopia is escalating tensions in the region. African Union-led talks between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam broke down on Monday. There are fears that the filling of the dam could lead to armed conflict. Ethiopia is constructing the dam to supply electricity to its rural areas. It is the largest hydroelectric dam in Africa and is two-thirds finished. Ethiopia has started filling the dam, which has raised alarm in Cairo. Egypt views the dam as an ""existential threat"" and is concerned the dam will reduce its water supplies. Most of Egypt's water comes entirely from the Nile, particularly during times of drought.The Blue Nile originates in natural springs above Lake Tana in Ethiopia. It supplies the majority of the water for the Nile River. The Blue Nile merges with the White Nile near Khartoum in Sudan. The waterway becomes the River Nile from the point of confluence of the two rivers. Ethiopia calls the dam an ""existential necessity"". Taxes from Ethiopian citizens have largely paid for the dam. Ethiopia's government says the dam is essential as nearly half the country's population lacks access to electricity. Egypt has said it could share electricity with Ethiopia instead of the dam being used.

"For decades, dog lovers have been incorrectly calculating the age of their pet pooches. People have traditionally worked out their dog's age in ""human years"" by multiplying by seven. However, researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine in the USA have come up with a new formula. They say it more precisely determines canine age. Their new method requires a little more than simple mental arithmetic to work out a dog's age. It involves a comparison of the genomes of dogs and humans. Scientists had to analyse how DNA changes as humans and dogs age. The scientists regard such DNA analysis as the best way to measure the ageing speed of mammals.The researchers analysed blood samples from 105 Labrador retrievers. After a bit of number crunching, they created a graph to show the different rates at which canines and humans age. They said a one-year-old dog is similar to a 30-year-old human, while a four-year-old hound is comparable to a 52-year-old person. Researcher Trey Ideker said by the time a dog reaches seven years old, its ageing slows. He said: ""This makes sense. When you think about it, a nine-month-old dog can have puppies, so we already knew that the 1:7 ratio wasn't an accurate measure of age."" The researchers said their new formula doesn't fully address the fact that different breeds of dog age at different speeds.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2007/200706-dog-years.html,breakingnewsenglish,

"New research sheds light on how carnivorous plants like the Venus fly trap developed a taste for meat. A study from the University of Würzburg in Germany suggests that subtle changes in the genetics of plants led to some becoming carnivorous. These changes led to the development of some of nature's most ingenious species. Carnivorous plants adapted novel and devious ways to entice and snare insects. The Venus fly trap uses clam-like leaves that snap shut when an insect crawls between them. The pitcher plant is shaped like a vase - insects go inside and then cannot crawl up the slippery insides. The sundew plant has long sticky leaves, which roll up after insects get stuck on them.Researchers in a variety of fields collaborated in the study. They included computational evolutionary biologist Jörg Schultz and plant biologist Rainer Hedrich. They sequenced and compared the genomes of carnivorous plants to non-carnivorous plants. They discovered that meat-eating plants developed from the same common ancestor about 60 million years ago. Dr Schultz said: ""We were able to trace the origin of carnivorous genes back to a duplication event that occurred many millions of years ago in the genome of the last common ancestor of the carnivorous species.""

"Most of us learn at school that warm air rises and cool air sinks. This has always appeared to be a fundamental principle of science. However, a study from the University of California, Davis found that there are circumstances in which cool air rises. Researchers discovered that in tropical atmospheres, cold air rises because of the lightness of water vapour. Apparently, in warmer and more humid climates, water particles become more buoyant and can help cooler air rise. Lead researcher Dr Da Yang said: ""Water vapour has a buoyancy effect which helps release the heat of the atmosphere to space and reduce the degree of warming. Without this lightness of water vapour, the climate warming would be even worse.""The scientists said humid air is lighter than dry air at the same temperatures and pressure. This is called the vapour buoyancy effect. It allows cooler air containing water droplets to rise, which then forms clouds and thunderstorms. The resulting rain has a cooling effect in tropical areas. Another researcher, Seth Seidel, said more research is needed to find out the effects rising cool air has on climate change, and on its impact on curbing the effects of global warming. Seth Seidel said: ""Now that we understand how the lightness of water regulates tropical climate, we plan to study whether global climate models accurately represent this effect.""

"The Game of Thrones actor Hafthor Bjornsson has set a world weightlifting record by lifting 501kg. Mr Bjornsson, 31, set the record for deadlifting*. This is pulling weights from the floor to the chest, and then raising the weights above the head with the arms fully extended. The actor broke the record at his personal gym in his native Iceland. He lifted the barbell for two seconds and then dropped the weights. He roared in delight at his achievement. His feat of power and strength was streamed by the sports broadcaster ESPN and posted on Bjornsson's YouTube channel. The record was previously held by a British man called Eddie Hall. In 2016, Mr Hall became the first man ever to lift 500kg.Besides being an actor, Hafthor Bjornsson is a powerlifter. In 2018, he won the World's Strongest Man competition. He shot to fame when he portrayed Ser Gregor ""The Mountain"" Clegane in the hit series Game of Thrones. He is 2.05m tall and weighs 195kg, so people have dubbed him a ""man mountain"". Bjornsson explained how happy he was after breaking the deadlift record. He said: ""I'm extremely proud, you know. I'm extremely happy....There's nothing better than proving people wrong. So many people didn't believe in me. So many people said, '501kg is never going to go up.'"" He added: ""I'm just absolutely speechless....I'm excited, super excited.

It was an area of the Sahara Desert in Morocco that 100 million years ago was a scary place to be. The team of fossil hunters said an area near the Morocco-Algeria border was home to a terrifying array of ferocious predators - rather like the beasts from Jurassic Park, but on steroids. The paleontologists have dubbed the area as being the ""most dangerous place in the history of planet Earth"". Their claim is based on the discovery of an array of fossils found in ancient rock formations called the Kem Kem group deep in the Sahara.Professor David Martill wrote about the significance of the study. He said: ""This is the most comprehensive piece of work on fossil vertebrates from the Sahara in almost a century."" He added: ""This place was filled with absolutely enormous fish...probably four or even five times larger than today's....There was an enormous freshwater saw shark...with the most fearsome of teeth.

Governor Cuomo has signed a special executive order permitting people to get married online. All wedding ceremonies had been halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but special measures have been introduced to allow couples to tie the knot. The procedure for weddings under lockdown now entails applying for a marriage license online and having clerks conducting the ceremony virtually. Mr Cuomo said the new online weddings would be legally binding. A city official said: ""The executive order will temporarily suspend a provision of law that requires in-person visits.""The new executive order means couples can get wed via video conferencing.

Captain Tom Moore has raised over $25 million for the UK's National Health Service (NHS) by walking around his garden 100 times. The World War II vet came up with the idea of raising just £1,000 to thank NHS staff for helping him with treatment for cancer and a broken hip. Mr Moore set up a donation page on a fundraising website. He said he would do 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday on April the 30th. His endeavours caught the imagination of the British public, who have been donating millions of dollars a day to support him. Prince William called him a ""one-man fundraising machine"".Captain Moore completed his 100 laps on Thursday. He vowed he would not stop walking as long as people are still donating. Over half a million people have signed a petition for the UK government to award a knighthood to Captain Moore. He would then become Sir Tom Moore.

"Authorities in Paris have taken extra measures in an attempt to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. They have banned people exercising outdoors during the day to try and stem the surge in the number of infections and deaths. No one will be allowed to exercise outside of their home between the hours of 10am and 7pm. The move is in reaction to greater numbers of people taking to the streets in recent good weather and flouting lockdown rules. There have been over 10,000 deaths in France, putting it in fourth place on the fatalities list behind Italy, Spain and the USA. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the new ruling would prevent further transmission of the virus and lead to a flattening of the curve.Scientists from the Eindhoven University of Technology explained that when people exercise, there is a greater spread of viral load in the air. They said that when a cyclist or jogger sneezes, coughs or even just exhales, the micro-particles linger longer in the air and spread farther than when someone is simply walking. This poses a danger to the person coming behind them who has to pass through a cloud of droplets. The scientists advised that people who exercise should be given a wider berth. They said walkers should get at least four metres, runners 10 metres and cyclists at least 20 metres.

The art form can trace its roots back nearly 1,000 years in Japan but it is only in recent times that it has taken off globally. Manga is now as synonymous with Japan as sushi, geisha and Mt Fuji. Such is the popularity of manga outside Japan, an exhibition of manga works proved to be the most popular show at the British Museum in 2019. It attracted more visitors than a show on the Dutch painter Rembrandt. The manga exhibition was the largest display of manga material ever assembled outside Japan. Around 1,920 people paid to see it every day, according to the museum.The manga exhibition showcased the 900-year history of the art. It included the earliest forms of manga by master painters to sketches and illustrations of today's popular anime and video game characters such as Pokemon. There were also exhibits from animated films known as ""anime"". The show included 70 manga series, including Osamu Tezuka's seminal work ""Astro Boy"".

"Researchers believe they have solved one of science's greatest mysteries. They think they have found out why a dog's nose is cold. Scientists from universities in Sweden and Hungary have posited that dogs' noses are constantly cold because they act as ""ultra-sensitive heat detectors"". Canines can sense the temperature of something before they touch it. They added that dogs use their noses to detect tiny changes in temperature, such as when possible predators or prey are nearby. Humans generally only know something is hot after touching it, often with painful consequences. It was common belief that the only reason dogs' noses are cold is to control and regulate their own body temperature.The researchers conducted experiments on sixteen dogs that had to detect the temperature of different objects in a room. The objects had different temperatures that humans could only differentiate by touching them. The scientists said that the brain activity in the dogs showed that they could discern which objects were warmer than others. Anna Balint, lead author of the study, said: ""Dogs are able to sense the thermal radiation coming from warm bodies or weak thermal radiation, and they can change their behaviour according to this signal.""

Scientists in Germany conducted a study on how a hearty breakfast affected the body's metabolism in a laboratory experiment. Sixteen men ate a low-calorie breakfast and high-calorie dinner one day, and reversed this with a high-calorie breakfast and low-calorie dinner the next. Eating a larger breakfast and a smaller dinner boosted a process called diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). This is the generation of heat in the body that burns up calories. This happened even when the total calories consumed throughout the day remained the same.Eating a big breakfast led to 2.5 times higher rates of DIT. Researcher Dr Juliane Richter spoke about the findings of her investigation.

"Pasta has been reclassified as a vegetable in U.S. schools. An overhaul of national dietary regulations has resulted in pasta now counting towards the vegetable requirements in school lunches across the USA. The new school guidelines were released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture last week. The rules stipulate that: ""Pasta made of vegetable flour may credit as a vegetable, even if the pasta is not served with another recognizable vegetable."" Pasta can only be regarded as a vegetable serving if it is made with potato, soy or other starchy, vegetable-based flour. Shocked critics of the new rules joked that bread could be regarded as a vegetable as that is also made from flour.Other changes outlined include the halving of fruit given to children for breakfast and the provision of a greater selection of burgers, fries, pizza and other high-calorie food that is full of saturated fat and salt. The Agriculture Secretary defended the guidelines. He said the new rules would reduce food waste. He said the new policy was necessary because, ""a more common-sense flexibility is needed to provide students with nutritious and appetizing meals"". The guidelines reverse the Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which was championed by Michelle Obama. A health expert said: ""This makes absolutely no sense. Politics and industry pressure should not interfere with what is best for children's health.""",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2001/200130-vegetables.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Scientists have discovered that stress is one factor in turning our hair grey, white or silver - at least, in mice. Stem cell biologists from Harvard University in the USA conducted a series of tests on mice to ascertain the effects of stress on the rodents. The scientists injected the mice with an ingredient found in chili peppers that gives them their heat. The compound made the mice stressed. This caused a hair-colouring pigment in the mice to go into overdrive as a reaction to the stress and deplete colour-regenerating stem cells. This caused the mice's hair to rapidly turn white. Lead researcher, Professor Ya-Chieh Hsu, said: ""The detrimental impact of stress that we discovered was beyond what I imagined.""People have wondered for centuries about the link between stress and greying hair. It is believed that France's Queen Marie Antoinette's hair turned white the night before she was beheaded during the French Revolution in the late-eighteenth century. More recently, we have witnessed the locks of presidents and other world leaders quickly lose colour. The strains of leadership seem to go to the roots of things, especially hair follicles. Professor Hsu said the loss of the pigment-regenerating stem cells cannot be reversed. She said: ""Once they're gone, you can't regenerate pigment any more. The damage is permanent."" Worryingly, she hypothesised that stress could be responsible for accelerating the aging process.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2001/200126-grey-hair.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"China has unveiled ambitious plans to drastically reduce single-use plastics by 2025. China's National Development and Reform Commission is fast-tracking a number of measures designed to slash the production and use of plastics over the next five years. It announced that by the end of 2020, non-biodegradable plastic bags will be banned in supermarkets and shopping malls in major cities. The ban will also apply to food delivery services, which use vast amounts of the plastics. Single-use plastic straws and cutlery used by food takeaway services will be banned nationwide by the end of this year. China will encourage the use of alternative materials such as non-plastic products and biodegradable shopping bags.Single-use plastics are one of the world's biggest sources of plastic pollution. They have become a ubiquitous part of daily life and a part of our throwaway culture. The Chinese authorities set a goal of reducing the ""intensity of consumption"" in order to reverse our reliance on single-use plastics. Previous regulations to curb plastic use, in 2008, led to an estimated cut in plastic bag production of 67 billion bags.

"There is a newly-found menace on the roads that could be harming our health - brake pads from road vehicles. Scientists have discovered that toxic dust and metal particles from worn-out brake pads could have the same harmful impact on our bodies as diesel emissions. King's College London found that fine dust released when a vehicle brakes could cause a number of health problems. These include an inflammation of the lungs, reduced immunity, an increased risk of respiratory problems, and serious infections like bronchitis or pneumonia. It is estimated that 93 per cent of particulate pollution from traffic comes from sources such as tyres, clutches and brake wear, and road dust.The scientists say brake dust could be the cause of a condition they have dubbed ""London throat"". Sufferers are the city dwellers who continually experience runny noses and irritating coughs and colds. These could be caused by people inhaling the brake dust. Metal particles coat the lungs and prevent cells in our immune system from clearing harmful bacteria. Researcher Dr Ian Mudway said dust from the various sources of friction within vehicles casts doubt on motor industry claims of zero-emission cars. He said: ""There is no such thing as a zero-emission vehicle. As regulations to reduce exhaust emissions kick in, the contribution from [sources such as brake dust] are likely to become more significant.""",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2001/200114-brake-pads.html,breakingnewsenglish,

Thousands of satellites are being launched into orbit throughout 2020 to make high-speed Internet more readily available across the world from space. The scientists say the skies will be so littered with arrays of satellites they will compete for our attention with the stars.

Cobain wore the olive green acrylic and mohair cardigan while performing live on the TV show MTV Unplugged in November 1993 with his band Nirvana. He played a largely acoustic set of his favorite songs and cover songs.The cardigan was made by the maker Manhattan. It has reportedly never been washed since Cobain last wore it and has a hole in it from a cigarette burn. The cardigan was previously bought in 2015 by a buyer who wished to remain anonymous but has since spoken about his purchase. The owner described the responsibility he felt in owning such a famous piece of rock and roll history. He told reporters: ""I thought, 'Oh, now I'm also going to be responsible for this.' It was kind of like when my children were born years ago - I was so happy to see them, but then I was like, 'Oh no.'"" For those who cannot afford auctions, Mr Cobain's daughter has started a fashion collection called Kurt Was Here.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1910/191030-kurt-cobain.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"People are now banned from climbing one of the most sacred sites in indigenous Australian culture. The world's largest monolith, the giant Uluru in the desert of Australia's Northern Territory, is now officially off-limits to tourists and climbers. It will be closed from October 25 in recognition of the site's cultural significance to the local Anangu traditional owners. The giant site was once known as Ayers Rock, before it reverted to its historic name of Uluru. It has been a major attraction for decades. Tourists from around the world have flocked there in droves to climb the rock. However, it is a sacred site in Anangu culture. The Anangu custodians of the rock have long campaigned for the ban.The ban was initially announced in 2017 and most visitors complied with it. Australia's tourist association said that only 16 per cent of visitors have actually climbed the rock since 2017. Local Anangu man Rameth Thomas, who grew up in a tiny community near Uluru, explained to the BBC how important the rock is to his people. He said: ""That place is a very sacred place. That's like our church. I've been telling them since I was a little boy: 'We don't want you to climb the rock.'"" He added: ""All of our stories are on the rock. People right around the world come just to climb it. They've got no respect.""

The wanted suspects have been accused of a range of charges including murder, human and drug trafficking and robbery. The most-wanted list was released as part of Europol's ""Crime has no gender"" campaign. A spokeswoman said: ""People think that usually these crimes are not being committed by women, but they are, and they are equally as serious as those committed by men.""

The astronomers recently discovered 20 new moons orbiting Saturn, which brings the planet's total number to 82. This edges out Jupiter, with 79 celestial bodies, into second place. Each of the newly-discovered moons is at least 5km in diameter. Seventeen of them orbit Saturn backwards and take more than three years to complete one orbit of Saturn. The astronomers found the moons using the powerful Subaru telescope, located on Hawaii. The research team will now look for moons that are around a kilometer in diameter.Lead astronomer Dr Scott Sheppard commented on the perceived origins of the new moons. He said: ""We don't think they formed with the planet. We think they were captured by the planet in the past."" He posited that Saturn sucked in a swirling mixture of gas and dust to form the moons. Dr Shepperd added: ""We think these moons interacted with that gas and dust. These were comets or asteroids that happened to be passing by....They were captured into orbits around the planet rather than falling into the planet.

He said there has been an increase in the number of users experiencing health problems after using the creams. These include seizures, rashes and scarring. The spokesperson said the creams could increase the risk of skin cancer, and liver and kidney damage.The global skin-lightening industry is booming. In 2017, it was valued at an estimated $4.8 billion and is forecast to nearly double to around $8.9 billion in the next decade. Many people use it to reduce the darkness of the color of their skin. The LGA warned that ""rogue retailers"" were selling illegal skin-lightening lotions on which the label incorrectly listed the ingredients and omitted the illegal substances.

"There is good news for parents who are in two minds about the merits of using time-outs as a form of punishment. Research from the University of Michigan in the USA says there is evidence to show time-outs can be an effective discipline strategy for children aged between two and eight years. Researchers say parents do not need to fret about their parenting skills if they give time-outs to misbehaving children as they do not harm children's mental wellbeing or their relationship with their parents. In an eight-year study, researchers compared the emotional health and behavior in children whose parents used time-outs with those who didn't. They found there was no difference in the children.Time-outs are a form of discipline used by parents to modify their children's behavior. It usually involves sending children to a quiet space or quiet corner. The aim is for children to reflect on their behavior. Scientists have disagreed about the effectiveness of this strategy. Dr Rachel Knight said: ""Some reports in the media and by select organizations have suggested that time-out is ineffective and even harmful."" She added: ""There are some alarming claims that time-outs can damage the parent-child relationship and negatively affect emotional health, but the research simply doesn't support those claims.""

The rocks contain the remnants of the cataclysmic aftermath of a gigantic asteroid impacting with Earth.

Geophysicist Jay Melosh from Purdue University said: ""It tells us what went on inside the crater on that day of doom that killed the dinosaurs. All of this mayhem is directly recorded in the core.""Scientists say the asteroid was around three to four kilometers wide. It smashed into the ocean and created a hole 160kms wide and 20kms deep. This triggered a chain reaction of earthquakes, tsunami, icecap melting, landslides and fires that forever changed the geology and life forms on Earth, killing off the dinosaurs. The asteroid's impact hurled out rock and minerals and created a massive crater. Molten rock fell back into the crater, which was then filled with ocean water from tidal waves. This water was full of soil, vegetation, animal life and other debris, all of which settled in layers ready for scientists to analyze millions of years later.

"Many of us believe that having children is the key to happiness and a perfect family life. Naturally, this idealistic image is true for some, but researchers say that in reality, children make us happiest when they fly the nest - when they have grown up and left home. Researchers in Germany looked at data from a survey of 55,000 over 50-year-olds living in Europe. The survey respondents were quizzed about their emotional wellbeing. The researchers discovered that most parents were happier with life after their offspring had left home and started making their own way in life. Researchers say this could be because raising children creates financial worry, stress, fatigue and anxiety.The research was led by Christoph Becker at Heidelberg University. He concluded that a big reason for parents being happiest when their children leave home is that the tables are turned and the children provide more support to their parents. He said parents whose children no longer live with them suffer from fewer symptoms of depression and have a more positive outlook on life. Regarding the role reversal in providing support, Mr Becker said: ""Children's roles as caregivers, providers of financial support or simply as a means of social contact might outweigh the negative aspects of parenthood.""

"Researchers have come up with a useful tactic to deter seagulls from stealing your picnic sandwiches or making a grab for your French fries. The advice is to stare at the birds to prevent any food theft. This invaluable tip comes from a study from the University of Exeter in the UK. Researchers conducted tests at a beach on the effects of staring at the sea birds. They put a bag of fries on the ground and monitored how long it took gulls to approach and snatch the fries without a researcher looking at the birds. They then carried out the same test, but this time a researcher made eye contact as a bird approached. The birds took an extra 21 seconds to approach the food when a researcher stared at them.The researchers concluded that the seagulls were deterred by the human gaze. Only 26 per cent of the birds made an attempt to take the researchers' food with the eye contact. Three-quarters of the birds just stood still and looked at the food or flew away. Lead researcher Madeleine Goumas said: ""I noticed that gulls seemed to have a bad reputation for food-snatching, but I saw it happen quite rarely. When I did see it happen, gulls often swooped in from behind, and the people were completely oblivious. Gulls are often seen as aggressive and willing to take food from humans, so it was interesting to find that most wouldn't even come near during our tests.""",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1908/190819-seagulls.html,breakingnewsenglish,

He now has the lesser role of Prime Minister but has a tough task ahead of him. His most pressing undertaking is to deliver Brexit and make sure Britain withdraws from the European Union. Mr Johnson has vowed to ensure this will be done by October 31st. His political future depends on this.Boris Johnson had to go to Buckingham Palace to meet Queen Elizabeth before taking over as the UK's 77th Prime Minister. Tradition dictates that the Queen formally asks any new appointee to form a new government. Johnson accepted and drove to 10 Downing Street - the official residence of the British leader. His first job is to form his Cabinet - the people who will take up key decision-making roles in the new UK government. Johnson said: ""Though I am today building a great team of men and women, I will take personal responsibility for the change I want to see."" In his first speech to the nation as Prime Minister, he promised to spend more money on the police, education and social welfare.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1907/190726-boris-johnson.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Alan Turing, the man widely recognised as being the father of modern computer science, has been honored by being selected to appear on a United Kingdom banknote. Mr Turing was chosen ahead of a wealth of notable British historical figures and luminaries to be the face of the new £50 note. Turing was instrumental in helping Britain and its allies win World War II. He led a team of codebreakers to crack the Enigma code the Nazis used to send messages to warships and military commanders. He invented the now famous British Bombe to do this. This was a giant computer, which ushered in the birth of modern computing and the beginnings of artificial intelligence.Alan Turing was a mathematical genius who also excelled in the sciences. He was born in London in 1912. He graduated from Cambridge University and then outlined his vision for creating an algorithm-based computing machine. He said of his invention: ""This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be."" His idea is central to the computers we use today. His brilliance led to his being asked to join the WWII code-breaking team. Despite his pivotal role in ending that war, he was persecuted in the post-war years for being homosexual. Being gay was illegal in the UK until 1967. He chose to be chemically castrated rather than go to prison. Turing died in 1954, aged 41, in an apparent suicide.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1907/190722-alan-turing.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"The world's largest education publisher, Pearson, has said it will gradually phase out printed textbooks. It has taken a decision to make all of its learning resources ""digital first"". Pearson said the future of the industry is in e-books and digital services. Pearson CEO John Fallon explained more about the company's future direction. He told the BBC: ""We are now over the digital tipping point. Over half our annual revenues come from digital sales, so we've decided, a little bit like in other industries like newspapers or music or in broadcast, that it is time to flick the switch in how we primarily make and create our products."" He added: ""I am increasingly confident and excited about this.""Pearson said a huge advantage of digital books is that they can be continually updated, which means teachers will always have access to the latest versions of textbooks. Mr Fallon said Pearson would stop its current business model of revising printed course books every three years. He said this model has dominated the industry for over four decades and is now past its use-by date. Fallon said: ""We learn by engaging and sharing with others, and a digital environment enables you to do that in a much more effective way.""

Turkey received the first deliveries of the Russian-made S-400 missile defense system on Friday. The USA had warned Turkey not to buy defense equipment from Russia. The USA and Turkey are both allies in NATO - a defense organization created in 1949 to counter any possible military aggression by Russia. NATO consists of 29 North American and European nations. The USA has the biggest military among the member states. In recent years, Turkey has been establishing closer ties with Russia. This has caused security concerns for the USA and other NATO member countries.The U.S. has warned Turkey it will face economic sanctions if it goes ahead and installs the S-400 defense system. It also said Turkey would not be allowed to play any part in a program to manufacture the USA's high-tech F-35 fighter jets. The U.S. wants Turkey to buy its Patriot missile defense system instead. U.S. officials argue the Russian system would be incompatible with NATO systems and would expose F-35 fighter jets to possible Russian subterfuge. Turkey said the S-400 would not be integrated into NATO systems and would not pose a threat to the NATO alliance. Turkey's president said the decision to purchase the S-400 system did not mean it is seeking ""alternatives"" in its relations with the West.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1907/190714-missile-defense-system.html,breakingnewsenglish,

"Japan has resumed commercial whaling after a hiatus of over three decades. Commercial whaling was banned in 1986 by an International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium. However, Japan withdrew from the IWC in December. Japan's government has promised all whalers will stay within 320 kilometers from its coast. The Japanese fisheries agency set a quota for killing 227 whales every six months. In the first days of resumed whaling, whalers caught two minke whales, which were taken to the northern port of Kushiro. The whale meat was auctioned in Tokyo and sold for record prices. Eager restaurant owners snapped up the meat at prices of up to $140 per kilo.Japan has engaged in the practice of whaling for centuries. Whale restaurant chef Mitsuo Tani summed up why he thought the return of commercial whaling was important. He said: ""A country that does not preserve its food culture has no future."" He also promoted the health benefits of whale meat. He said: ""It is five times lower in calories than beef, 10 times lower in cholesterol, two times less fat than chicken and it's packed with iron.

"The United Kingdom has said it is playing its part in striving for a cleaner and greener planet. For the first time since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, the UK is being powered more by zero-carbon fuels than fossil fuels. In each of the first five months of 2019, fossil fuels have produced less than half of the UK's electricity. Analysts say a ""tipping point"" has been reached and the trend of zero-carbon energy sources providing more power than fossil fuels will continue. Power from wind, solar, nuclear and hydro sources outstripped coal and gas-fired generation. A decade ago, three quarters (75.6 per cent) of the UK's electricity came from coal and gas, and only 22.3 per cent was zero carbon.The switch to more zero-carbon power was described by the UK's energy chief executive as a ""key milestone on the journey towards net zero"". CEO John Pettigrew said the zero-carbon share should increase to 90 per cent by the 2030s. The UK's Prime Minister Theresa May has made a commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

"Tensions are rising in the Middle East over the latest attacks on oil tankers. The USA is blaming Iran for the attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday. The tankers are owned by Japan and Norway. They were hit by blasts while navigating waters close to the strategically important Strait of Hormuz between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Around a fifth of the world's oil passes through the Strait, which is just 68km at its narrowest point. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Iran was behind the ""blatant assault"" on the vessels. He said the U.S. would defend itself and its allies against ""Iranian aggression"" in the region. However, he provided no evidence that Iran was behind the attacks.The attacks are the second such incidents carried out against tankers in the past month. Two Saudi tankers were sabotaged in the UAE port of Fujairah last month. The U.S. says the latest tankers were hit by mines and posted a video online of supposed Iranian forces removing an unexploded mine off the hull of one of the ships. Iran's Foreign Minister described the attacks as ""suspicious"". He said Iran's navy was investigating them. Iran called the U.S. accusations ""unfounded,"" ""inflammatory"" and ""Iranophobic"".

"High-tech drones are flying to the defence of tortoises in California's Mojave Desert. The desert tortoises in the western Mojave are under threat of being wiped out by ravens. The raven is a larger version of the crow. Its population in the Mojave has increased by more than 700 per cent in the past 25 years and this is having a catastrophic impact on the desert tortoises. Allison Fedrick, a local conservationist, observed that in some places, ""where there used to be 10 ravens, there are now 15,000"". Ms Fedrick noted that if nothing was done to help the tortoises, they would be completely wiped out. Their numbers have plummeted by more than 90 per cent since 1990.Technology is coming to the rescue of the tortoises. A team of biologists and drone operators has come up with a strategy to reduce the raven population. They are using drones and the use of the method of ""egg oiling"". This involves flying drones up to the ravens' nests, removing fertilized eggs, coating them with a film of corn oil, and then replacing them. The oil blocks oxygen from entering the egg, effectively ending the life of the embryo inside. Biologist Mercy Vaughn said: ""If ravens figure out that their eggs are rotten, they are likely to eat them and nest someplace else.""

"A father in Australia is being hailed as a hero after saving his baby son from the jaws of a wild dingo. The baby was dragged from his campervan on Australia's Fraser Island on Friday. His father awoke and heard his son's screams outside. He rushed to his son's aid and dragged his son from the dingo's jaws. He also fought off other animals in the pack. The 14-month-old baby boy was rushed to hospital and underwent surgery for a fractured skull and deep cuts to his neck and head. Doctors report he is now in a stable condition and is expected to make a full recovery. The father said: ""Our son is doing well....We ask the media to please respect our family's privacy while we focus on our son's recovery.""The recent attack on the infant boy is the third such incident this year. Fraser Island residents are worried that the attacks could threaten the island's heritage status. Long-term resident, Hannah Robinson, said many visitors did not realize they should not camp in unfenced areas with children under the age of 12. She said there was not enough education about how to be aware of the threat of the animals on the island. She added: ""We have been calling for a visitors' center for years.

"The Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) has started removing fuel rods from Japan's stricken Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant. Tepco is the company that operates the nuclear power plant. It was badly damaged and suffered meltdowns following being hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Tepco started the removal of the nuclear fuel on Monday, five years behind schedule. The work to remove and relocate the hazardous rods was delayed because of a whole series of malfunctions of the devices that had been designed for the removal operation. Another factor that caused delays was high levels of radiation observed in the area. Tepco said this posed a ""significant challenge"" for engineers.Tepco said it is removing seven unspent nuclear fuel rods from the reactor's pool. There are a total of 1,573 spent and unspent fuel rods stored at the power plant. The rods will be transferred to safer storage pools at the plant. Tepco said the work would be completed by the end of March 2021. A company spokesman, Tomohiko Isogai, said: ""I believe everything is going well so far. We will watch the progress at the site as we put safety first. Our goal is not to rush the process but to carefully proceed with the decommissioning work.""

That gargantuan number is a five followed by twenty zeroes. Scientists estimate the black hole to have a diameter of 40 billion km and to be three million times larger than our planet. Lead astronomer Professor Heino Falcke spoke to the BBC about the black hole. He said: ""What we see is larger than the size of our entire Solar System. It has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun. And it is one of the heaviest black holes that we think exists. It is an absolute monster - the heavyweight champion of black holes in the Universe.""The image of the black hole was captured by an array of eight linked telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). No single telescope exists that is powerful enough to capture the image. Each of the EHT telescopes is located high up on volcanoes in Hawaii and Mexico, mountains in the USA and Spain, a desert in Chile, and in Antarctica. A team of 200 scientists pointed the networked telescopes towards the M87 galaxy and scanned it over a period of 10 days. The data they gathered was stored on hundreds of hard drives. It was then collated and processed to produce the image that is now a landmark in space exploration.

"Scientists have discovered a bizarre link between music and cheese. Different genres of music affect the way cheese matures. A top Swiss cheese-maker and a team of researchers from Switzerland's Bern University conducted a six-month test to look into the effect music had on the maturation process of Emmental cheese. After the cheese had matured, it was sampled and assessed by the researchers and a jury of culinary cheese experts. The researchers found that cheese that had been played hip-hop had a stronger aroma and flavor than the other samples. The cheese aficionados reached the same conclusion as the researchers - the hip-hop cheese was the tastiest.The experiment involved exposing different cheeses to a 24-hour, non-stop musical loop. A music player directed sound waves at the cheese for six months. The experiment was titled ""Cheese in Surround Sound"". The music included Mozart's ""The Magic Flute,"" Led Zeppelins rock classic ""Stairway to Heaven,"" and A Tribe Called Quest's hip-hop tune ""Jazz (We've Got)"". A researcher explained the differences in taste. He said: ""Bacteria are responsible for the formation of the taste of cheese, with the enzymes that influence its maturity.

A new study shows that paper books are better than e-books for bedtime reading. The study suggests that the good old printed book, with real pages that you turn with your fingers, makes parents and children interact more than they do when reading with an electronic book. Researchers from the University of Michigan studied how 37 pairs of parents and toddlers interacted with e-books and paper books. The researchers found that with electronic books, parents asked their children fewer questions and made fewer comments about the story.The study involved observing parents and children (aged two or three) reading from three different book formats. These were printed books, basic e-books on a tablet, and enhanced e-books with features such as animation, graphics and sound effects. The researchers discovered that the parents and toddlers interacted with each other less with both types of e-books than they did with the printed books. A researcher said that when they did speak, they were far likelier to talk about the device and the technology rather than about the story.

Like many rural towns in Italy, the number of Sambuca's residents is dwindling because many young people are moving to cities. The Sambuca mayor believes the houses will be easy to sell because his town is so attractive. It overlooks the Mediterranean Sea, is close to gorgeous beaches and has retained its heritage with its cobbled streets and Arabesque architecture.Like all bargains, there is a small catch to the one-euro houses - the buyer must promise to spend $17,000 on renovating the property within three years of purchasing it. Sambuca's deputy mayor said the houses are owned by the town, so there is little of the red tape normally associated with buying a property. He said: ""We're not intermediaries who liaise between old and new owners. You want that house, you'll get it in no time."" He promised potential buyers would love the town. He said: ""This fertile patch of land is dubbed the ""Earthly Paradise"". We're located inside a natural reserve, packed with history. Gorgeous beaches, woods and mountains surround us. It's silent and peaceful - an idyllic retreat for a detox stay.""",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1901/190119-homes-for-sale.html,breakingnewsenglish,

"The world-famous credit card company Mastercard is removing its name from its company logo. It will follow the likes of Apple and Nike to have a logo that has a symbol only and no writing. Mastercard had traditionally used a logo that had overlapping yellow and red circles with the word ""Mastercard"" written over the top. The company has decided to drop the word ""Mastercard"" and use just the two intersecting circles as a wordless logo. The new logo will be used as the brand's symbol on credit cards and in stores, as well as on advertising at sports and other events. The company's marketing officer said over 80 per cent of people spontaneously recognized the new symbol without the word ""Mastercard"".Mastercard conducted extensive research for more than 20 months on how recognizable the new logo would be without its name being on it. The new logo is part of a wider strategy to transition from being a credit card company to a digital payments and financial services company. The world is now full of instantly recognizable logos that contain no words. Apple's bitten apple logo and Nike's swoosh are prime examples. Most of the logos of apps on people's smartphones are just symbols. A design expert spoke about maximizing the effect of a small logo on a phone or watch.

This is according to the recently-released annual Global Gender Gap Report from the World Economic Forum. It said it would take more than 200 years before women and men worldwide have economic parity. The report found many areas in which women lag far behind today. One huge area is pay. Women around the world currently earn about 20-30 per cent less on average than their male counterparts. A factor contributing to this is the scarcity of women in management positions. The WEF said: ""In the workplace, women still encounter significant obstacles in taking on managerial or senior official roles.""The World Economic Forum (WEF) found that the inequalities between the sexes had closed by only a small amount in the past year, since the last report was published. Researchers found that the largest gap between the sexes was in politics.

"A court in Australia has judged that the use of the word ""Kiwi"" to describe a person from New Zealand is not discriminatory. New Zealander Julie Savage filed a complaint against an Australian bakery where she was nicknamed ""Kiwi"" by her colleagues. She asserted that the term ""Kiwi"" was a form of racial discrimination and was insulting and disrespectful. However, the employment tribunal decided otherwise and dismissed her complaint. The bakery owner argued that the term ""Kiwi"" was one that most New Zealanders were proud of. He said the New Zealand government openly endorses the term and that it was used as ""a term of endearment and as a means of identifying as a New Zealander"".The tribunal judge ruled that calling a New Zealander a Kiwi was not offensive.

Geo-engineers from Harvard University believe that spraying ""sun-dimming"" chemicals into the stratosphere high above the Earth could slow down global warming. They also say their technique would be ""remarkably inexpensive,"" costing in the region of $2.25 billion a year over a 15-year period. The technique is known as stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). It is still in its infancy and is yet to be proven. It would involve the use of gigantic hoses or high-powered chemical cannons to spray chemicals into the stratosphere to act as a reflective barrier against sunlight and harmful UV rays.The scientists have admitted that their idea is currently still in the planning stages.

We simply show that a hypothetical deployment program commencing 15 years hence, while both highly uncertain and ambitious, would indeed be technically possible from an engineering perspective."" Not all scientists think the idea is a good one. Some think it is somewhat pie in the sky.

Tens of thousands of Australians have signed a petition to block the plans to project an advertisement for the Everest Cup onto the iconic white sails of the Opera House. The race is the richest horse race in the world. The decision to use the Opera House as a platform for the ad even has the backing of Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison. He said: ""It's not like they're painting it on there. I mean, it's lights flashing up there for a brief moment of time....I don't understand why we tie ourselves up in knots about these things.""The former chief executive of the Opera House described the decision to promote the race on the world-famous landmark as ""crass, inappropriate and offensive"". He said: ""I find it extraordinary that the state politicians on both sides have somehow decided that this is in the interests of Sydney, New South Wales or Australia to corrupt the way the Opera House works, to corrupt the art integrity of the building."" The son of Peter Hall, the architect who helped complete the Opera House, said: ""My father would have been sickened by it....He would not have condoned advertising on the building in any way.

"A university in the UK has voted to replace hand clapping with 'jazz-hand waving'. The University of Manchester Students' Union voted in favor of replacing clapping with 'jazz hands' to respect people who can be negatively affected by loud noise. The jazz hands action is the British Sign Language's form of clapping. It is simply the practice of waving one's hands in the air. Students' Union spokeswoman Sara Khan said the vote was taken out of respect for many people who are affected by loud noise, which includes clapping and cheering. She said many people with conditions like autism, sensory issues and deafness tend to avoid public events because of loud clapping and cheering.The vote has sparked a lot of criticism online. British broadcaster Piers Morgan tweeted that, ""Britain is losing its mind"". The debate even reached as far as the USA, where former Florida governor Jeb Bush tweeted: ""Not cool, University of Manchester. Not Cool."" Representatives of the Students' Union hit back, saying they represent the majority of students' views at the university. The Union said: ""The policy was passed to encourage the use of British Sign Language clapping during our democratic events to make those events more accessible and inclusive for all.""

"Rugby players with tattoos are being asked to cover them up during next year's World Cup in Japan. The request by the sport's governing body World Rugby is to avoid offending people in Japan. It is somewhat of a taboo in Japan to be seen in public with a tattoo. Tattoos are usually associated with the notorious yakuza crime gangs, for whom tattoos are a source of great pride. Many swimming pools, gyms, bath houses and onsen in Japan ban people with tattoos from using their facilities. However, in 2016, Japan's tourism agency asked onsen to relax their rules. It said tourists had tattoos for very different reasons. The agency suggested giving tourists stickers to cover their tattoos.The Rugby World Cup director Alan Gilpin said all the competing teams understood the cultural sensitivity in Japan regarding tattoos. He said: ""When we raised it with the teams a year or so ago, we were probably expecting a frustrated reaction from them, but there hasn't been at all."" He added that the players want to respect Japanese culture. He said the wearing of a vest used for watersports would be a form of ""self-policing"" among the players.

President Magufuli said: ""Women can now give up contraceptive methods."" He supported his argument by citing the example of European countries that he says are struggling to find enough workers because people use different methods of birth control. He told reporters: ""I have traveled to Europe and I have seen the effects of birth control. In some countries they are now struggling with a declining population. They have no labor force.""President Magufuli accused those of using birth control of laziness. He said: ""Those going for family planning are lazy.

They do not want to work hard to feed a large family and that is why they opt for birth control and end up with one or two children only."" He added: ""You have cattle. You are big farmers.

"The sportswear maker Nike has announced it will use American football player Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign to celebrate its ""Just Do It"" 30th anniversary. Mr Kaepernick ignited controversy in 2016 while playing as quarterback for his team the San Francisco 49ers. He refused to stand for the national anthem as a protest against racial injustice and social issues. Instead he knelt down on one knee. This started a trend of other players ""taking the knee"" in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Kaepernick's actions caused heated debate. In September 2017, President Donald Trump tweeted that NFL players should be either fired or suspended if they failed to stand up for the national anthem.

"Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has suggested that the U.S. dollar could be losing its status as the world's most important currency. Mr Lavrov said that because the U.S. has imposed economic sanctions on countries like Iran, Turkey and Russia, these countries could start conducting international business in their own national currencies instead of the dollar. In addition, countries that have had trade tariffs imposed on them by the U.S. could also do trade in their own currencies. This could include the global economic superpower China ditching the dollar. China is already setting up trade deals in its own currency. Experts say the U.S. dollar could lose its position as the international reserve currency.The U.S. dollar replaced the British pound as the international reserve currency in the 1920s. Since then, most international trade has taken place using the dollar. Today, when China buys oil from Iran, it pays in U.S. dollars. This means more U.S. dollars flow out of the U.S. than flow in. The effect of this is the U.S. has a currency deficit as its dollars are in the bank accounts of other countries. Mr Lavrov said: ""I'm confident that the grave abuse of the role of the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency will result over time in the weakening and demise of its role.""

"A theme park in France has established a novel and environmentally-friendly way of keeping its grounds free of litter. It has selected and trained six ""intelligent"" rooks to pick up rubbish and keep the park clean. Rooks are members of the crow family and are up to 47cm in length. The clever birds will be put to work at the Puy du Fou theme park in the west of France. They have been trained to pick up cigarette ends, paper and other things people throw on the ground. The birds pick up the litter and deposit it into a special trash can, which then delivers some bird feed as a reward. The more litter the birds put in the trash can, the more food they get.The head of the theme park, Nicolas de Villiers, explained the rationale of using the crows to the AFP news agency. He said there were several reasons for deploying the crows. He said: ""The goal is not just to clean up, because the visitors are generally careful to keep things clean, but also to demonstrate that nature itself can teach us to take care of the environment."" Crows are highly sociable and intelligent birds. Some biologists say they are as smart as a seven-year-old child.

The surgeons described the condition in the journal Facial Plastic Surgery. They wrote that 55 per cent of plastic surgeons reported an increase in the number of patients wanting alterations to their face to look like they do after using Snapchat filters.Snapchat and other social media apps provide filters to allow people to ""enhance"" photos of their face to look ""cuter"". The professors say this is fuelling an obsession among younger people, especially teenage girls and women, with the ""perfect"" face.

"France has voted to ban smartphones and personal tablets from schools. Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly by 62-1 on Monday to prohibit students aged between 3 and 15 from even bringing their devices to school. The ban is part of a campaign to reduce addiction to electronics. It fulfills a campaign promise made by French President Emmanuel Macron in 2017. French Minister of National Education Jean-Michel Blanquer also campaigned for the ban saying devices were harmful to children's development. He called mobile devices a public health crisis and said the law protects children from the ""phenomenon of screen addiction and the phenomenon of bad mobile phone use.""The new ban extends a previous law made in 2010 that meant students could not use their devices in lessons. There are exceptions to the ban for students with disabilities and for using devices in the classroom for extra-curricular activities. Many lawmakers do not believe the ban is enough to bring about change. They believe the ban is little more than a publicity stunt. Application of the ban to students aged 15 and older will depend on the policy of individual schools. Experts have found that the increased use of mobile devices causes cyber-addiction, sleep disruption and bullying.

"Many people cannot sleep without using a fan, but scientists say this could be bad for us. This is unwelcome news for those of us struggling to nod off during the current scorching hot weather. According to sleep experts at the website Sleep Advisor, there are many reasons why the use of a fan could be detrimental to our health. Fans can cause problems for people with asthma or hay fever. The rotating blades of fans cause dust and pollen to circulate around the room and add to an asthmatic's sleeplessness. Sleep Advisor says circulating air can dry out and irritate your eyes, mouth and sinuses, which also makes it difficult to sleep. Fans also cool the air and can make muscles tense up and cramp.Other sleep experts disagree and say there are no dangers to health from using a fan. Dr Len Horovitz, a specialist on the health of the respiratory system, said: ""There's nothing about a fan that's toxic. There's nothing wrong with circulating air."" He told the Live Science website that if a fan stops us sweating, it will help us to sleep. He said people should keep fans at a safe distance from their bed and not have them blowing directly at their body. He also recommended keeping an air filter in the bedroom to reduce the levels of dust in the room. Sleeping with a fan may be preferable to using an air conditioner, which can chill any sweat on our body and possibly cause us to wake up with a cold.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1807/180731-fans.html,breakingnewsenglish,

Japan has declared its heatwave a natural disaster as at least 80 people have died from heat-related conditions. The doctors say people are getting less than half the protection from the sun than they think. Their advice is to use lotion with the highest sun protection factor (SPF) possible. Many people wrongly believe SPF 15 is sufficient to block the sun's harmful UV rays. However, researchers say people need to use SPF 30 or 50 to make sure they are protected.The doctors highlighted another problem related to our use of suntan lotion - we do not use enough of it. Apparently, we are skimping on how much lotion we apply to our skin. Professor Anthony Young said most people apply lotion too thinly and often do not spread it on areas of the skin that are at risk. He said most people only get 40 per cent of the expected protection from SPF 50 lotion because they are applying it too thinly. People need to apply at least six teaspoons (36g) to cover their body. Doctors say we need to use more than half a teaspoon to cover the face, neck and ears.

The vehicle has been tested in Canada, which has authorized its use. Even though it will take to the skies, drivers (or pilots) will not need a pilot's license to get behind the controls. However, BlackFly operators will have to successfully complete a pilot's written examination and receive training in how to use the vehicle.Critics say the term ""car"" is somewhat of a misnomer as it has no wheels and cannot be driven on roads.

The newly-discovered insect has a huge stinger on its tail that could inject a powerful and deadly sting into any unfortunate victim. A scientist said the stinger ""looks like a fierce weapon"". The stinger delivers a paralyzing venom that debilitates its victims. Once paralysis has set in, the wasp lays eggs inside the victim's body.

However, even though the age has been lowered, there are still certain things that will not change. The legal age for drinking alcohol, smoking and gambling will remain fixed at 20. The new law will enable 18-year-olds to get married without parental consent, and allow them to apply for loans and credit cards.

"The head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis, has given a stark warning to around 50 of the world's top oil company executives about the threat to humanity from fossil fuels. At a private, closed-door meeting in the Vatican on Saturday, the pontiff urged the oil companies to switch to renewable energies for the sake of our planet. He told the executives that fossil fuels were a major driver in climate change and that global warming represented a challenge of ""epochal proportions"". He said the companies needed to act quickly, saying: ""There is no time to lose."" He warned that: ""With each month that passes, the challenge of energy transition becomes more pressing.""Pope Francis explained how important it was for the world to transition to greener forms of energy. He said: ""The energy question has become one of the principal challenges...facing the international community. The way we meet this challenge will determine our overall quality of life."" Francis said fossil fuels are a contributor to poverty, war and death around the world as they affect, ""the real possibility either of resolving conflicts in different areas of our world or of...providing them with new fuel to destroy social stability and human lives.""

"Women are on the rise in Spanish politics. Spain's newly-formed government consists of eleven women and six men. The newly-elected socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has put women in some of the biggest positions in his cabinet, including head of defence, economy, education and finance. Spain now has the highest proportion of women in top government positions than anywhere else in Europe. In a televised statement, Mr Sanchez said his new government consisted of people who wanted to move Spain forward. He said: ""All are highly qualified and bring a vocation for public service and reflect the best of Spain. [They are]...open to the world but anchored in the European Union.""Mr Sanchez seems an unlikely leader. His Socialist party holds just 84 of the 350 seats in Spain's parliament. He took office on Friday, replacing the unpopular conservative leader Mariano Rajoy. Ex-prime minister Rajoy was the focus of a corruption scandal and had become unpopular because of his austerity measures. Sanchez promised to bring change to Spain. However, he has to work quickly to turn Spain's economy around. He has promised to call elections in less than two years, which may not be enough time to amend the outgoing government's budget for 2018.

"Authorities in China are looking at a new way of halting the country's increasing divorce rate. In parts of China, couples who file for divorce are being asked to take an exam to ascertain how much they still might love each other and whether or not their marriage can be salvaged. Up to half of all Chinese marriages between those who were born in the 1980s have ended in divorce. China's rising divorce rate has been attributed to the increased empowerment of working women, who are more financially independent and less reliant on a partner. Media sources say the rise of social media and dating apps are adding to the problem, as there are increasing numbers of extramarital affairs.The divorce tests have had a mixed reaction in China. Liu Chunling, the director of a marriage-registration office, told reporters that the test was aimed at reducing the divorce rate and preventing ""impulsive divorces"". She said: ""Only the harmony of millions of family units can achieve the harmony of an entire society."" Chinese Internet users were less enthusiastic about the 15-question test being used to determine a couple's love for each other. One post on the Weibo social media site asked: ""So if you remember your wedding anniversary you can't divorce? Divorce isn't a case of amnesia.""

"Hotter weather leads to lower exam results, according to a new study from Harvard University, the University of California and Georgia State University. What's more, hot weather may reduce learning in both the short term and long term. Researchers reported that hot weather on test days and higher than average temperatures throughout the school year resulted in poorer grades. The study is the first major research into the effect of heat on students in the USA. Researchers analyzed how test scores from 10 million American students were impacted by the weather. Their findings showed that an average temperature increase of just 0.55ºC over one year resulted in a one per cent decrease in learning.The research is in a paper called ""Heat and Learning"" and was published last month by the USA's National Bureau of Economic Research. One of the more concerning conclusions contained in the study is that global warming may affect learning and the income-earning potential of students around the world. The researchers predicted that if global temperatures continued to rise, the average American student could lose $25,000 in income over their lifetime because of lower exam results. Using air conditioning in classrooms could circumvent this. The researchers also found that hotter weather was, ""particularly damaging...for low income and minority students"" across the USA.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1806/180601-exam-results.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but scientists say cockroach milk could become a new superfood. Insect dairy could be the next big thing on supermarket shelves and in our diets. Scientists say insect milk could be a perfect non-dairy alternative to cow's milk, no matter how hard it might be for people to accept milk from bugs. Scientists studied the nutritional value of the milk from the Pacific Beetle cockroach. They discovered that the milk was much richer in nutrients than dairy milk. Scientists said: ""A single crystal [of cockroach milk] is estimated to contain more than three times the energy of an equivalent mass of dairy milk."" The crystals were also full of amino acids and proteins.Most cockroaches do not actually produce milk. The Pacific Beetle cockroach is the only one known to feed milk to its young. However, milking enough cockroaches to satisfy a growing human population clearly isn't as easy as milking cows. An alternative is to try and replicate the milk in a lab using stem cell technology, and then turn this technique into a large-scale industrial process. A South African company called Gourmet Grubb has already started selling insect-milk ice cream. It says the milk is, ""a sustainable, nature-friendly, nutritious, lactose-free, delicious, guilt-free dairy alternative of the future"".

It said the redistribution is continuing as populations shift and demand for food increases. In particular, equatorial regions were drying, while tropical areas and higher latitudes were gaining water supplies. NASA warned that if this trend continued, many highly populated urban areas could struggle to find sufficient water in the future. NASA's claims are the result of a 14-year study into shifting locations and depleting resources of freshwater. It was part of a mission conducted between 2002-2016 called GRACE, which is an acronym for Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment.Researchers say that the shifting freshwater patterns are the result of human activity.

It is still unclear when Mr Mahathir, 92, will be sworn in as Malaysia's next prime minister. When he assumes power, he will be the world's oldest elected leader. Mahathir was Malaysia's prime minister from 1981 to 2003. At that time, he was leader of the BN party, which came to power in 1957 after Malaysia gained independence from British colonial rule.

Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a report on Friday showing the falling numbers of children. According to the statistics, the number of children aged 14 or under dropped for the 37th consecutive year. There was another record fall in the ratio of children to the overall Japanese population. This dropped to a new record low of 12.3 per cent and was the 44th year of decline in a row. This ratio is the lowest among countries in the world with a population of 40 million or more.Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been trying to address the country's dwindling birth rate. He has introduced several measures to encourage lower-income families to have bigger families. However, these measures seem to be having little success. This is coupled with the fact that fewer Japanese people are getting married, which demographers say is a ""ticking time-bomb"" for Japan. The number of annual births in 2016 fell below one million for the first time since the government began collecting data in 1899.

The researchers added that children up to the age of 17 or 18 remain adept at learning grammar. There is bad news for those who want to pick up a new language beyond their late teens. The researchers say this is past the ""critical period"" when language-learning ability starts to decline. Researcher Joshua Hartshorne said: ""As far as a child is concerned, it's quite easy to become bilingual....That's when you're best at learning languages. It's not really something that you can make up later."" The research was based on an analysis of results from a 10-minute online grammar quiz. Over 670,000 language learners of all ages participated in the test. Researchers measured the grammatical ability of people who started learning a language at different points in their life. Professor Hartshorne focused on grammar rules that were most likely to confuse a non-native speaker as a gauge of that person's proficiency. MIT researcher Josh Tenenbaum suggested people simply might be too busy to learn a language later in life.

A historic summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Supreme Leader of North Korea Kim Jong-un will take place at an as yet undisclosed location by May. The two leaders will discuss North Korea's denuclearization. US Vice-President Mike Pence said American diplomacy had brought North Korea to the negotiating table. He said: ""It is evidence that President Trump's strategy to isolate the Kim regime is working."" North Korea's ambassador to the UN hailed the ""courageous decision"" of Mr Kim for bringing about the meeting. He said Kim would help secure ""peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the East Asia region"".World leaders welcomed the upcoming inaugural meeting. Such unprecedented talks seemed unlikely a few months ago, when the two leaders were hurling insults at each other. It could be a sign that one-time enemies could now be ""frenemies"". South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the meeting was ""like a miracle"". He said there would be obstacles ahead, but the talks were a key step towards denuclearization.

"Thailand will soon close one of its world famous beaches in an effort to reverse the damage done to its coral by mass tourism. The beach is in Maya Bay on the tiny island of Koh Phi Phi Leh. It garnered worldwide attention after it featured heavily in the Leonardo DiCaprio blockbuster movie The Beach. The film put the Maya Bay beach on the bucket lists of millions of travellers worldwide. The result has been an influx of up to 5,000 sun worshippers a day to its emerald shores. They arrive on hundreds of boats, which have caused irreversible damage to the bay's coral. Officials say that most of the coral in the bay has died. The beach will close between June and September to let the coral recover.Experts predict that almost 80 per cent of Thailand's coral reefs have been destroyed, and that once pristine beaches have been damaged by tourism. The deputy dean of the Faculty of Fisheries at Bangkok's Kasetsart University is an outspoken critic of the level of tourism Thailand's coastline has to endure. He said the biggest culprits were beachfront hotels, boat anchors crashing into and breaking the coral, and plastic waste being dumped in the sea. He believes the ""ideal solution"" is for Maya Bay to be closed permanently. He said: ""While it's a very pretty bay, visiting it with a flotilla of boats and hordes of other tourists rather detract from the magic.""

"A new report shows that no country in Africa will meet goals set to end childhood malnutrition by the year 2030. That target was set by the United Nations in 2015 as a Sustainable Development Goal. The UN adopted a set of goals, ""to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda"". The new report is published in the journal Nature. It identifies poor child nutrition and low levels of education across 51 African countries. These were key factors in countries battling to provide children with sufficient food. Researcher Simon Hay said the goal of ending childhood malnutrition was always an ""aspirational"" target. He said: ""This aspiration is very, very far away.""There was some good news in the report. It highlighted the fact that many African nations, including Ghana and Nigeria, have shown signs of improvement in childhood development since the year 2000. However, it is a different story for countries like Chad, Central African Republic and Eritrea. The report indicates that malnutrition remained ""persistently high"" in 14 countries between Senegal in the west and Somalia in the east.

"Fashion designers and clothing experts are wandering how a new suit might change their industry. The suit is a little out of this world - literally. It is a spacesuit that has its own built-in toilet. The high-tech garb has been designed by NASA engineers to help astronauts deal with the call of nature in emergency situations in space. The new suits are called the Orion Crew Survival Systems Suits (OCSSS). They will be worn by astronauts on NASA's next-generation spacecraft, Orion, which will venture a lot farther away from Earth than previous space missions have gone. The spacecraft will not be advanced enough to reach Mars, but will be able to carry humans around the moon and back. The OCSSS spacesuits will allow astronauts to survive for six days in emergency situations. The suit is fitted with a revolutionary waste disposal system that will allow astronauts to do things like urinate and defecate without taking it off. Astronauts will also be able to eat in the suit. NASA astronaut Rick Mastracchio explained how important and how much of a life-saver the OCSSS space suit will be. He said: ""Spaceflight is not always glamorous. People need to go the bathroom, even in a spacecraft. How is this waste treated such that it does not harm the astronaut or even kill them?""

"Scientists say we are unaware of a massive cause of pollution that is right under our very noses. Everyday household items such as toothpaste, shaving foam, deodorant, perfume and furniture polish contain volatile compounds that help to cause pollution. Dr Brian McDonald, an air-pollution researcher at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, conducted research into how our homes create pollution. His team was surprised to find that household items now contribute as heavily to particular types of air pollution as cars, trucks and other vehicles. Dr McDonald said that as ""the transportation sector gets cleaner, these other sources...become more and more important"".The researchers focused on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a whole range of household items. VOCs react with sunlight to form ozone pollution. This escapes into the environment and gets trapped in our house or apartment, causing pollution in our homes. The scientists said VOCs interact with other chemicals to form tiny particles in the air. These particles can lead to lung damage. Dr McDonald said governments should regulate household products more tightly to reduce their negative impact on our health. He issued a stark warning, saying: ""The things I use in the morning to get ready for work are comparable to emissions that come out of the tailpipe of my car.""",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1802/180219-household-items.html,breakingnewsenglish,

It varies in the degree to which it affects someone's language and accent. In some cases, someone's native language sounds like it is tinged with a foreign accent; in other instances, rhythm, stress and pronunciation can completely change. The condition was first documented in 1907 by French neurologist Pierre Marie. It is a relatively rare condition. Only about 60 cases of FAS have been documented over the past century.

"When doom-and-gloom merchants warn us about threats to our existence, we usually hear about climate change, asteroid strikes or nuclear war. Now scientists have warned of the potential threat from Earth's magnetic poles flipping upside down. The North Pole and South Pole are responsible for creating a special barrier around Earth that protects us from killer radiation from space. All life on Earth depends on this shield. Without it, scientists say solar rays could cause considerable damage. The poles could flip in the next thousand years. This is because a rolling layer of liquid iron under the earth's crust is changing direction. The revolving currents of this molten iron at Earth's center act as a gigantic electromagnet.Historically, Earth's North and South magnetic poles have flipped every 200,000 to 300,000 years. The last time was 780,000 years ago, so the next flip is well overdue. Some scientists say the flip could destroy satellite communications and power grids; that dangerous solar rays would greatly multiply rates of cancer; and that climate change could kill billions of creatures. Some scientists forewarn that a polar flip could even blow Earth's atmosphere away. However, one scientist dismissed the doom-mongers. He believes that the effects of any increase in radiation would be as harmful as lying on a hot beach for a day.

The tablets will not be Internet enabled, but prisoners will be able to get limited, but monitored, online access by plugging their device into approved kiosks at specific times. Inmates will be allowed to email an approved list of family and friends; order certain music, books and videos; and file grievances and reports of abuse. All of this activity will be heavily monitored by prison staff.Prisoner support services welcomed the free tablet initiative. They called it a ""game-changer"" and a ""huge step forward"".

"Centipedes are the kind of creatures that are not to be messed with. Their venom packs a serious punch and can cause rapid paralysis and death in insects and small animals. They have even been known to kill people with their highly venomous sting. Scientists have now discovered a deadly toxin in centipede venom that can shut down the hearts of animals that are 15 times bigger than them. The scientists isolated a toxin in the Chinese red-headed centipede. This beast can grow to roughly eight inches in length. The toxin in its venom blocks potassium from moving in and out of cells. This blocking of potassium prevents the brain from sending signals to the heart to beat, thus causing a rapid death.The venom is rarely fatal for humans, but it can cause agonizing pain and swelling for up to two weeks. The scientists have called it SSM Spooky Toxin. Researcher Shilong Yang, an expert in toxins at China's Kunming Institute of Zoology, explained: ""The ""centipede's venom has evolved to simultaneously disrupt cardiovascular, respiratory, muscular and nervous systems. This molecular strategy has not been found in other venomous animals."" Despite their name (centi is ""hundred"" in Latin and pedis is ""foot""), centipedes do not have 100 legs. They have a varying number of legs, ranging from 30 to 354. Centipedes always have an odd number of pairs of legs.

"Scientists have changed their estimation of when adolescence ends and adulthood starts. Adolescence is that difficult time when children develop into adults. It was traditionally thought to coincide with our teenage years. However, scientists from the University of Melbourne have redefined this. They say it can start at the age of 10 and continue to the age of 24. Puberty used to occur around the age of 14, but because of improved health and nutrition, puberty can now start at the age of 10, especially in the developed world. Likewise, the upper age for when adolescence ends has been increased. This is because we stay in education longer, and delay responsibilities like marriage, parenthood and getting a job.The scientists published their study in the ""Lancet Child and Adolescent Health"" journal. They say society needs to change laws to take into account the findings of the research. Professor Susan Sawyer said: ""Although many adult legal privileges start at age 18, the adoption of adult roles and responsibilities generally occurs later."" The researchers say youth support services could be extended to the age of 25. However, this could be problematic in many countries around the globe.

The scientists say an area of the brain is responsible for assigning memories to smells and for storing them for decades. The area can instantly recall the memories with great clarity years later if a person encounters the smell again. Christina Strauch, from the Ruhr University in Germany, said smells are stored in the olfactory brain. The word olfactory means anything related to the sense of smell. She said: ""It is known that the piriform cortex is able to temporarily store olfactory memories. We wanted to know if that applies to long-term memories as well.""There are a multitude of scents that can transport us back to our childhood. Smells from cookies baking in the oven or the perfume of an elderly aunt can bring back surprising recollections of growing up. Professor Strauch said certain scents can take you away to another point in time. Strauch said some odours can make you wish you were actually back in a certain point of time, or make you want to escape. She said it depends on whether or not the smell has a positive or negative association. Aromatherapists partly depend on this for their patients.

"Scientists are highlighting the damage that glitter does to our seas, oceans and environment. The scientists are calling for a worldwide ban on the sparkly, shiny pieces of plastic that decorate everything from eyelids to greetings cards to furniture. Scientists from New Zealand's Massey University say glitter is a micro-plastic and should therefore be banned. They say a considerable amount of glitter ends up in the world's oceans. Fish cannot digest it and it does not break down, so it stays in the food chain. Professor Richard Thompson conducted research in the seas around the United Kingdom. He found that plastic particles were discovered in about one-third of the fish caught.Micro-plastics are tiny pieces of plastic that are less than five millimeters long. Most glitter produced around the world falls into the category of micro-plastics. Dr Trisia Farrelly told Britain's ""Independent"" newspaper: ""I think all glitter should be banned because it's a micro-plastic."" Professor Thompson said: ""I was quite concerned when somebody bought my daughters some shower gel that had glitter particles in it. That stuff is going to escape down the plughole and potentially enter the environment."" Some cosmetics companies are now discontinuing their use of plastic glitter. The company Lush stated: ""We've avoided micro-plastics by switching to synthetic and mineral glitter.""",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1712/171204-glitter.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Scientists from two of the USA's elite universities have pioneered a new method of creating artificial muscles. The scientists have dubbed their discovery as a ""soft robot"". It is a 2.6-gram ""muscle"" that looks like a small bag with many water-filled compartments. It has been given amazing strength by supporting it with an origami-inspired structural framework. This allows the artificial muscle to lift an object that is 1,000 times its own weight. The New Scientist website said this weight-to-strength ratio is the equivalent of a newborn baby lifting a large 4WD car. The ground-breaking discovery could greatly benefit many areas of science, medicine, robotics and engineering.The scientists are from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. They are experts in the field of soft robotics. They said their new soft robot muscle can be made in just 10 minutes and costs less than one dollar. Researcher, professor Robert Wood, hopes to create ""softer"" robots that are more similar to humans. He said: ""Humans are normally soft and brittle compared to the big industrial robots that you might find on an assembly line. The next step is to take this system and develop it into a fully functional robot."" Dr Daniela Rus explained that the robots could be like the human hand.

Once upon a time, when night-time fell, we were plunged into darkness. Things are different, and brighter today. A study published in the journal Science Advances reports that artificial light at night is increasing in most countries worldwide. Scientists say it grew by 2.2 per cent a year between 2012 and 2016. The intrusion of artificial light into our night-time is causing us many problems.

There is a rich diversity of insects and other creepy-crawlies we share our homes with and they all have particular tastes regarding accommodation. Researchers from universities in the USA and Denmark studied different physical factors in 50 houses to find out what affected where bugs lived. They discovered that the largest number of bugs generally reside in ground-level, carpeted rooms that have many windows. Lead author of the research, Dr Misha Leong, said: ""We are just beginning to realize and study how the home we create for ourselves also builds a complex, indoor habitat for bugs and other life.""The researchers found that every room in a house offered differing ecological environments for bugs. They found that booklice, fruit flies and ladybugs preferred living rooms. Spiders, ants, centipedes and beetles were more likely to live in darker, damper places like basements. The researchers said there were many benefits of sharing our homes with insects and other bugs. They said many were essential for ensuring microbes we need to stay healthy are present in our homes.

"Scientists have developed a breathalyzer to test people for malaria. The device could help detect the deadly disease much earlier than other methods and thus help millions of people around the world. The researchers, from Washington University in St Louis, USA, say that people with malaria give off a distinctive ""breath print"". The breathalyzer detects the chemicals that malaria creates as the person breathes into the device. One of the odours the device detects is identical to a natural smell that attracts malaria-spreading insects such as mosquitos. The device is still in its early stages of development. The researchers say it could lead to a new, cheap and easy way to help diagnose malaria.The prototype breathalyzer detects six different odours or chemical compounds to spot instances of malaria. The researchers did tests on 35 children in Malawi. They took breath samples using the breathalyzer to test the accuracy of the machine. It accurately identified 29 of the children as having malaria. This was a success rate of 83 per cent. Lead researcher Audrey Odom John said: ""It's clear that if we had fast, easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic devices…we could reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. This would have a major impact on the control of malaria, because all current diagnostic methods require blood sampling.""

The measure is to address the current housing crisis in New Zealand. For the past few decades, overseas buyers have been snapping up houses as investments or for holiday homes in New Zealand. This has created an increased demand for properties, which has seen house prices soar. Prices have risen by more than 50 per cent in the last decade. New Zealanders are up in arms at the inflated prices they now have to pay to buy a home. Many citizens have simply been priced out of the market and cannot afford to get on the housing ladder.Ms Ardern expressed her determination to end the practice of overseas investment increasing property prices. She said: ""We are determined to make it easier for Kiwis to buy their first home, so we are stopping foreign speculators buying houses and driving up prices. Kiwis should not be outbid like this."" However, the new measure will not apply to Australians. Furthermore, overseas investors will still be able to buy land. Ardern said the changes would not stop non-residents or non-citizens from buying residential land to build a house on.

We have our own form of English, which is different but fully legitimate and accepted worldwide."" Professor Hickey highlighted some examples of the words Irish presenters are being asked to pronounce with a British English accent. He said: ""The Irish don't pronounce the TH [in 'birthday'] as a fricative, but as a stop with no breath….The same is true of 'news' - the Irish pronunciation is and always has been 'nooze'.""

"Floyd Mayweather has won what was billed as the fight of the century, and the richest fight in boxing history. Mayweather took home a staggering $100 million for defeating Conor McGregor in 10 rounds in Las Vegas on Saturday. Thousands of spectators paid tens of thousands of dollars for ringside seats. Millions more around the world tuned in on pay-per-view streaming sites. Boxing purists derided the fight as a circus event and a mismatch. It pitched Mayweather, one of the greatest fighters in boxing history, who had never been defeated or even knocked down, against McGregor - a mixed martial arts fighter in his first ever professional boxing match. But the hype surrounding it made it a huge spectacle.Mayweather, 40, entered the ring as the heavy favourite, even though he had retired two years ago. His boxing record was 49 wins (including 26 knockouts) and no defeats. McGregor, 29, is the reigning Ultimate Fighting Championship lightweight world champion. Mayweather's victory came early in the 10th round. The referee dived in to save McGregor from any more punishment from Mayweather's flurries of punches. Victory means Mayweather has 50 wins and no defeats, to edge ahead of the legendary Rocky Marciano, who retired with a 49-0 record. McGregor gave a gutsy and spirited performance, but in the end, Mayweather's vast experience and superior technique came through.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1708/170828-boxing.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"The government of Chile has rejected plans for a billion-dollar mining project because it would disrupt marine life. The area that was threatened with mining is home to 80 per cent of the world's Humboldt penguin. Other creatures that live in the waters include blue whales, fin whales and sea otters. A mining company called Andes Iron had wanted to extract millions of tons of iron and copper in the north of Chile. It also wanted to build a new port to facilitate the mining process. Chile's Environment Minister told reporters: ""I firmly believe in development, but it cannot be at the cost of our environmental heritage or cause risk to health, or to unique ecological areas in the world.""Chile's National Mining Society said the decision was bad news for mining and for the country. It said the mining project was essential for the economic development of the region and the country. The controversial mining project would have generated $2.5 billion in revenue. Government ministers said the mining company had not shown the full negative impact of the mining project on the local environment. It also questioned the project's finances. The Environmental Minister said: ""There are deficiencies in basic information and insufficiencies in mitigation, compensation, and reparation measures, meaning we believe that the eventual impacts have not been properly taken care of.""",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1708/170824-penguins.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"New research shows that binge-watching television can adversely affect your health. Binge-viewing involves excessive watching of back-to-back TV shows in a single sitting. It has become prevalent across the world with the advent of online streaming and downloading services. Researchers from the University of Michigan in the USA and the Leuven School for Mass Communication Research in Belgium surveyed 423 people aged 18-25 on their TV-viewing habits. Their research found that binge-viewing greatly interrupted sleep patterns. Co-author Professor Jan Van den Bulck said: ""Our study signals that binge-viewing is prevalent in young adults and that it may be harmful to their sleep.""The researchers asked participants about their sleep quality, levels of fatigue and prevalence of insomnia. They also enquired about their frequency of binge-watching programs on televisions, laptops and desktop computers. Over 80 per cent of the participants reported binge-watching, with 20 per cent doing so several times a week. Binge-watchers are 98 per cent more likely to experience poor sleep quality. A researcher said: ""Bingeable TV shows have plots that keep the viewer tied to the screen. We think they become intensely involved with the content and may keep thinking about it when they want to go to sleep.""

"New research suggests that using smiley face emojis in work e-mails could jeopardize your career. Researchers from a university in Israel report that people inserting emojis in work-related mail are likely to be deemed stupid and incompetent. The researchers conducted experiments on 549 professionals from 29 different countries to gauge their reaction to emojis. The professionals had to ""evaluate both the competence and warmth"" of the e-mail writer. Dr Ella Glikson said: ""Our findings provide first-time evidence that, contrary to actual smiles, smileys do not increase perceptions of warmth and actually decrease perceptions of competence."" She added: ""In formal business e-mails, a smiley is not a smile.""Other research has also shown that emojis are often misunderstood. Some of this misunderstanding is related to how the reader or viewer interprets the emoji design. In other cases, there is a technological problem. The emoji that was typed in by the writer is not shown in the same way in the e-mail received and read by the reader. This happens when the writer and reader of an e-mail do not use the same software or operating system for their devices. Emojis originated on Japanese mobile phones in the late 1990s. They quickly spread in popularity and now more than six billion of them are sent every day around the world. There is even a World Emoji Day, which is celebrated on July the 17th every year.

"The medical world sees another example of science fiction coming true. Scientists have revealed a ""breakthrough technology"" that repaired cells and organs in mice and pigs with a 90 per cent success rate. Researchers at Ohio State University in the USA have developed a device barely a centimeter wide that is full of tiny microchips called nanochips. The new device is a pad that is placed on the skin. It initiates the process of repairing damaged organs and healing serious wounds. The nanochips ""reprogramme"" damaged cells to restore them to their functional state. Researcher Dr Chandan Sen said: ""With this technology, we can convert skin cells into elements of any organ with just one touch.""The new technology is called tissue nano-transfection (TNT). It is a non-invasive procedure, which means surgeons do not have to cut the body. It works by placing the pad of nanochips over a damaged area of the body. A small electric current then injects DNA into the skin's cells in less than a second. This transforms the cells into building blocks that then regenerate any nearby damaged tissue, such as skin, arteries, or even organs like the liver, lungs and heart. Researchers say it could replace the need for patients needing reconstructive surgery and revitalize organs that are prematurely aging. It could even help repair the brain. Testing will begin on humans next year.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1708/170810-body-repair.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"A child protection charity in the UK is urging parents to ask their children for permission before uploading photos and videos of them on social media. This follows a study by Ofcom, a communications watchdog, revealing that parents are divided on whether it is right to post photos of their children online. The practice of parents uploading photos and videos of their kids is termed ""sharenting"". This is a combination of the words ""share"" and ""parenting"". Ofcom said the biggest reason for parents not sharing photos of their kids is to protect the privacy of under-18s. The NSPCC said: ""Each time a photo or video is uploaded, it creates a digital footprint of a child which can follow them into adult life.""The website theatlantic.com highlighted how prevalent sharenting is in the USA. It said: ""In the United States, the vast majority of 2-year-olds…already have an online presence. More than 80 per cent of babies younger than that are already on social media."" The website said there is a conflict between a parent's pride in their children and his or her desire to share photos of them, and the potential dangers of sharing photos of their kids. Parents often include personal information about their children along with the photos they upload. This could put kids at risk of identity theft and digital kidnapping. There is also the danger of parents publishing real-time information about their children's whereabouts.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1708/170806-sharenting.html,breakingnewsenglish,

For the past 20 years, Russell Taylor has been illegally painting yellow parking-restriction lines on the road outside his house. Mr Taylor told the BBC news agency that the reason for his actions was to improve traffic safety in his neighborhood in the capital, Wellington. He also wanted to protest against gentrification. Mr Taylor said he initially painted the yellow lines after becoming fed up with the local council's lack of interest in following up residents' complaints about road safety. He explained that he had seen numerous accidents and near-collisions on his narrow street and that his actions have made the road safer.Wellington City Council confirmed it was aware of the road markings and that they would be removed. It pointed out that it was illegal to install ""fake traffic devices,"" such as Taylor's homemade yellow lines. It said: ""We're aware of problems and complaints about parking in Holloway Road, and that the fire service had trouble getting to a house fire there in the past year because of parked vehicles.""

"A new study has revealed that a tiny, water-dwelling creature is likely to live until the end of the Earth. The near indestructible tardigrade, also known as water bear, looks like a short caterpillar with eight legs. It is just one-tenth of a millimeter in size but has the physiological makeup to be able to survive in any extreme conditions. The microscopic water bear can survive without food for three decades. It can also exist in bitterly freezing temperatures of -272º Celsius and in furnace-like temperatures of 150ºC. Water bears can also survive the crushing pressure of deep oceans, the vacuum of outer space, nuclear war, global warming, or any other extreme meteorological event that would doom humans.Scientists say water bears are so hardy and resilient that the only thing that would wipe them out for good is if the Sun boils all the Earth's oceans away. The study says this is likely to happen in several billion years from now. The new study states that complex life is extremely difficult to destroy and could exist on other planets.

"There is potentially good news for coffee lovers. Drinking three or more cups of coffee a day may help people live longer. This is according to a 16-year-long study from the International Agency for Research on Cancer and Imperial College London. Researchers looked at health data on over half a million people over the age of 35 from 10 European countries. They suggest that drinking more coffee is linked to a lower risk of death, particularly from heart diseases. This study showed that people who had a daily minimum of three cups of coffee were 8-18% less likely to die from health problems than non-coffee drinkers. Researchers said coffee drinkers had better liver function and a stronger immune system.Not all experts agree with the research findings. Health experts suggest that the health benefits of drinking coffee could be because coffee drinkers may have more money and therefore live a healthier lifestyle. They also say that because drinking coffee can be a social activity, coffee drinkers may socialize more and this may increase wellbeing and help us live longer. They say the research does not prove that drinking coffee has concrete health benefits. Researchers also caution against drinking too much coffee. The upper level of safe caffeine intake is around 400 mg. More than this increases the risk of suffering from panic attacks, heart problems, and insomnia.

The researchers observed 60 volunteers as they walked, ran and cycled while wearing the devices. Researchers found that none of the devices had an error rate below 20 per cent. Dr Euan Ashley, co-author of the study, said: ""People need to know that on energy expenditure, [the trackers] give rough estimates.""The Stanford scientists said users of fitness trackers should be cautious about using the devices to judge what they eat. Dr Ashley said: ""If you go to the gym, and you think you've lost 400 calories, then you might feel you've got 400 calories to play with."" This could be a problem for those who base what they eat on how many calories their fitness tracker said they burned. One CEO of a fitness tracker company suggested the researchers may not have adjusted the user settings properly. The CEO told the USA Today newspaper that the study method could have reported incorrect data, saying: ""We think the excess error reported in energy expenditure is not representative in this study, due to this methodological error.""",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1705/170528-fitness-trackers.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Memes are becoming a growing part of our everyday life and popular culture, especially online. Many of us know memes as the pictures and photographs that go viral on social media sites. People use them to make jokes or social and political observations. However, biologist and author Richard Dawkins, the originator of the word 'meme', is unhappy with how the Internet has defined a meme as a ""picture with words"". Mr Dawkins coined the term 'meme' in his 1976 book 'The Selfish Gene'. He said memes are ideas that spread from brain to brain and are replicated many times, much like genes. He told the BBC: ""I'm not going to use the term Internet meme to refer to a picture with writing on it.""Memes have infused our culture to the extent that universities now offer degree courses on them. America's Northwestern University unveiled its Meme Studies course back in 2011. Britain's Sky News says memes have helped to make politics more accessible to young people. One Twitter user told a Sky journalist that: ""Memes helped people understand more complex ideas, and that having politics framed in a different way makes it more digestible."" This was obvious with how memes became a key part of how people expressed their views during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The vice.com website said: ""Memes now have as much power, influence and reach as the propaganda posters of yesteryear.""",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1705/170524-memes.html,breakingnewsenglish,

Holland's King Willem-Alexander has just revealed he has been secretly flying planes for the Dutch carrier KLM for the past 21 years, completely unbeknown to his passengers. The 50-year-old king got his military pilot's license as a member of the Royal Netherlands Air Force when he was in his twenties. He developed a love of flying and trained to become a commercial pilot. He revealed his secret life as a pilot in an interview with Dutch media. He flew for KLM twice a month. The king said he was now preparing to upgrade his skills.

He explained: ""You have an aircraft, passengers and crew. You have responsibility for them. You can't take your problems from the ground into the skies. You can completely disengage and concentrate on something else. That, for me, is the most relaxing part of flying."" He said it was easy to keep his anonymity while flying, and that very few passengers ever knew he was piloting their plane.

Mr Comey at first thought the news of his firing was a prank and he didn't believe it. He was in Los Angeles to address employees at an FBI field office. While talking to FBI agents, he saw a news program reporting on the fact that President Trump had removed him from his position. FBI staff then confirmed to Mr Comey that he had indeed been fired. The White House hand delivered a letter from President Trump to Mr Comey at his Washington office informing him of his firing, but Comey was not there to receive it.The sacking is now a huge political story in the USA. Many newspapers and TV news stations are saying Mr Comey was fired because he was investigating President Trump's alleged links to Russia. Journalists are saying the sacking is to try to cover up a scandal concerning President Trump and Russia. The White House denied this, saying the sacking had nothing to do with Russia. Officials stated that Comey was removed from his position because of his mishandling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's e-mails when she was Secretary of State.

"Researchers have discovered that swearing and using bad or profane language can increase one's physical strength. The researchers are from Keele University in England. They conducted tests on 81 people to see the effect swearing had on their physical performance. In one test, participants did a short, intense workout on an exercise bike. Some people were asked to swear as much as they could before they started their workout, while others were told to be quiet. In another test, participants were told to grip the bike's handlebars as tightly as they could. The researchers found that the groups who swore a lot, cycled or gripped three to four per cent more powerfully than the tight-lipped group.Past research also shows that swearing helps to increase our tolerance to pain. A 2009 study discovered that swearing led to an increased heart rate and higher levels of adrenaline - these help to numb pain. This perhaps explains why so many of us swear when we hurt ourselves. Another study found that swearing was a sign of honesty because people who swear frequently are believed to be better at self-expression. Dr. Richard Stephens, lead researcher of the Keele study, said he was at a loss to explain why swearing affects the body. He said: ""Quite why it is that swearing has these effects on strength and pain tolerance remains to be discovered.

"A natural solution to the growing crisis of plastic waste in the environment may be at hand. Researchers have discovered that a tiny caterpillar, commonly known as a waxworm, has a taste for plastic. Researchers from Cambridge University in the UK say that the waxworm devours plastic at ""uniquely high speeds"". They say that it is possible to utilize this environmentally-friendly solution to global waste on an industrial scale. Millions of waxworms could be bred to spend their days breaking down and consuming plastic bags, bottles, household items and other discarded waste. Around a trillion plastic bags end up in landfills around the world each year. They take centuries to biodegrade.Researcher Dr Paolo Bombelli said: ""It's extremely, extremely exciting because breaking down plastic has proved so challenging."" He said the waxworm can break down a notoriously tough plastic like polyethylene more than 1,400 times faster than other organisms. The waxworm uses enzymes in its saliva to break the plastic's chemical bonds. It might be possible one day to replicate these enzymes and spray them on waste to make it decompose. Another researcher said: ""We are planning to implement this finding in a viable way to get rid of plastic waste, working towards a solution to save our oceans, rivers, and all the environment from the unavoidable consequences of plastic accumulation.""",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1704/170430-plastic-eating-waxworm.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Female workers in the UK are to be offered an unusual perk by their employers. British companies are considering offering egg freezing as a perk. Tech companies like Apple and Facebook already offer egg freezing as a benefit to female employees, and now other companies may follow the tech giants' lead. Many British companies are in talks with IVF clinics about providing the option of egg freezing to women. The UK's largest chain of fertility clinics, CARE Fertility, said it has been in discussion with several high-profile employers. The perk comes at a considerable cost to employers. Apple and Facebook have been offering subsidized egg freezing to female staff at a cost of up to £16,000 ($20,000) per employee.Companies will provide the egg-freezing perk to allow women in their 20s or 30s to focus on their careers. The idea is that women could make use of their frozen eggs in their 40s when they meet the right partner or are financially stable. Rob Smith, clinical director of CARE London, said: ""Successful pregnancy at that age is very low indeed so by freezing eggs earlier on they will just have that guarantee at the back of their mind."" Mr Smith said the perk was also an option for couples wanting to conceive later in life. Critics of the idea said it was wrong to prioritise careers over having children.

"A new study has shown that physical activity and exercise are 'contagious' because of social media. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) discovered that people who post details of their exercise patterns and achievements on social media sites motivate and encourage other people to be more active. Researchers tracked the exercise routines of 1.1 million runners over a period of five years. They looked at the geographic location of the runners, their social network use, distance, time, pace and the calories they burned. The researchers concluded that sharing personal exercise data via social media can inspire others to exercise more, exercise harder and do so more competitively.The journal 'Nature Communications' has published the research. The study includes detailed accounts of how inspiring it can be to read about a friend's physical activity. Researchers said: ""On average, an additional kilometre run by friends can inspire someone to run an additional three-tenths of a kilometre, and an additional ten minutes run by friends can inspire someone to run three minutes longer."" The study said social media improved the performance of runners who had been a little slower or less in shape, and of those who were showing signs of overtaking a friend's performance.

"A high school in Canada has come under fierce criticism on the Internet for a women's studies course it offered to its female students. The online backlash was because the course included what many believed to be sexist subjects that were unfit and inappropriate for women in the 21st century. These included 'polite conversation,' dinner party etiquette, and 'nail application skills'. There was also a subject titled: ""How to enhance your style by using tips and tricks designed for your face and body shape"". The course also had lessons on the basics of web design, reproductive health, the role of women in history, and a look at how beauty is seen by the media and different cultures around the world.Among those who were shocked by the syllabus was actress and singer Siobhan Bryn. She wrote: ""This is unbelievably sexist. Women's studies is not fashion and putting on a lunch."" She asked: ""Was this designed in the 1950's? Can you get someone who knows about women's studies to design this course?"" Activist Meg Fenway said: ""This is profoundly offensive and disrespectful.""

A company that operates 89 funeral homes is offering a 15 per cent discount on funeral services to any driver over the age of 75 who surrenders their driving licence. The discount also applies to family members of those relinquishing their licence. The scheme has the full backing of the local police force. Drivers must visit a police station to hand in their licence. Police officers then provide a document, which the elderly person hands to the funeral home as proof that they are no longer allowed to drive. Similar schemes in Japan have included cut-price taxi fares, discounts on entry to public baths and cheaper noodles.The latest initiative is a further attempt to reduce the number of traffic accidents involving seniors, which is becoming a serious problem in Japan. There are almost 5 million licence holders in Japan over the age of 75. This is double the number from a decade ago.

Researchers at Georgia Southern University in the USA analyzed data on the sleeping habits and patterns of nearly 3,000 women and 3,000 men. They wanted to get to the bottom of what affects adults' sleep. The researchers discovered that having children in the house leads to sleep deprivation in many mothers. Motherhood significantly reduced the number of hours a mother slept each night. Unsurprisingly, this had an adverse effect on mothers' energy levels and tiredness during the day. The study found that fathers' sleep remained largely unaffected by having kids in the house.The study reveals that children were the biggest cause of mothers being sleep deprived. Dr Kelly Sullivan, co-author of the report, said each child increased a woman's risk of getting insufficient sleep by 46 per cent. In addition, 48 per cent of mothers under 45 reported getting an average of seven hours of sleep a night, compared with 62 per cent of women of the same age who did not have children at home.

"The former head of Microsoft, Bill Gates, has warned that the world could be in great danger from bio-terrorism. He said the world could face a catastrophe from a virus made by terrorists that could kill 30 million people in less than a year. Mr Gates, the richest person in the world, was speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany. He said there was a ""reasonable"" chance that a bio-terrorist could act in the next 10 to 15 years. He added that world leaders are not prepared for such an attack. He expressed his surprise that very few leaders were even aware of it. He asked for global ""health security"" to become a major part of government discussions and policies.Mr Gates explained that: ""The next epidemic has a good chance of originating on a computer screen."" He said a genetically engineered virus was easier to make and could kill more people than nuclear weapons, but no country on Earth is ready for this threat. He asked governments, ""to prepare for these epidemics in the same way we prepare for war"". Gates asked governments to start ""germ games"" activities to prepare for a bio-terrorist attack, like many countries engage in war games. He said we needed better monitoring to spot outbreaks early, and systems to quickly develop vaccines - within weeks rather than years.

"A new study suggests that marital bliss has beneficial health effects. The research is from Carnegie Mellon University in the USA. It concludes that being married reduces your levels of a stress hormone called cortisol. Researchers tested for cortisol in the saliva of 572 adults aged 21-55 on three different, non-consecutive days. Multiple saliva samples were taken throughout each 24-hour period. The researchers found that the married people in the sample had less cortisol than people who were single, separated, divorced or widowed. The researchers said: ""Married people tend to be healthier than both the previously and never married, but the mechanisms through which this occurs remain unclear.""The stress hormone cortisol has many different functions in our body. It regulates blood sugar levels, immune responses and inflammation and can increase the risk of heart disease. It also increases the chances of surviving cancer. High levels of cortisol have been linked to mental conditions such as anxiety and depression. Laboratory director Sheldon Cohen said: ""These data provide important insights into the way in which our intimate social relationships can get under the skin to influence our health."" Researcher Brian Chin added: ""It is exciting to discover a physiological pathway that may explain how relationships influence health and disease.""",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1702/170217-married-people.html,breakingnewsenglish,

Affleck said it was a tough decision to hand over the directing reins. He explained that he could not act in as well as direct the new Batman film. He said: ""Performing this role demands focus, passion and the very best performance I can give. It has become clear that I cannot do both jobs to the level they require. Together with the studio, I have decided to find a partner in a director who will collaborate with me on this massive film.""The movie industry magazine 'Variety' reports that Mr Reeves is in initial talks with the production company Warner Bros. to accept taking over as director.

"The television maker Vizio has agreed to pay $2.2 million to settle claims that it collected data from 11 million people without their consent. The lawsuit against the flat-panel TV maker was filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the USA. The FTC discovered that Vizio had been gathering and selling data on customers without permission for years. The FTC claimed Vizio began making televisions in 2014 that automatically tracked what people were watching. They fitted tracking devices to TVs made before 2014 by using software updates. The FTC said: ""Consumers didn’t know that while they were watching their TVs, Vizio was watching them.""The FTC said Vizio captured second-by-second information about what people were watching.

"Researchers from the University of Michigan in the USA have found that the brain of astronauts changes shape during spaceflight. It is the first study to look into how the brain changes on the journey into space. Researchers looked at pictures of the brains of 26 astronauts who spent time in space. The photos were taken by high-tech medical machines called MRIs. Twelve of the astronauts spent two weeks as Space Shuttle crew members, and 14 spent six months on the International Space Station. All of them experienced increases and decreases in the size of different parts of the brain. The researchers said that the longer an astronaut spent in space, the bigger the differences in size were.The research produced some interesting findings. The researchers explained that, ""gravity is not available to pull fluids down in the body"". This means there is a shift in the position of the brain inside the skull. The brain becomes either more squashed or bigger in size. The findings could help doctors in the future to treat problems that affect the brain's function. One possibility is to treat people who develop problems caused by long-term bed rest. Another possibility is to treat those who have a build-up of fluid in the brain, which can lead to brain damage. The researchers also say we will understand more about how neurons in the brain make connections.

"For whatever reason, people assume dogs are more intelligent creatures than cats. This notion has been called into question by scientists in Japan, who have said that cats are as smart as dogs at certain memory tests. Cat lovers, of course, have always known this. Researchers at Kyoto University conducted tests on how well 49 cats could recall or relate to an event from the past – known as an episodic memory. The Japanese team got the felines to eat from one of two bowls. Fifteen minutes later, the cats were tested on their ability to remember which bowl they had eaten from and which remained untouched. The team found the cats could recall what they ate and where, suggesting they had episodic memory.The scientists also said that cats were as good as dogs on a whole variety of mental tests, including responding to the gestures, facial expressions and emotions of humans. Researcher Saho Takagi told reporters that she believed cats think about past events similar to the way humans do. She said: "" An interesting speculation is that they may enjoy actively recalling memories of their experience, like humans."" She added: ""Episodic memory is viewed as being related to an introspective function of the mind. Our study may imply a type of consciousness in cats.""

Project director, Tony Hothersall, explained that the green venture had three main aims. He said: ""One is to plant three million trees - a tree for every man, woman and child - over the next 25 years. Next, we are very much focused on bringing existing woodland into management because there is no point in planting new woodland if you can't manage what you've got already. Finally, we want to engage people a lot more in their natural environment - in planting trees, in managing areas, [and] in understanding more about the benefits that trees and woodlands bring to our society.""Mr Hothersall further outlined the rationale behind the recently-launched environmental project. He said: ""Manchester wants to be a world-class city region. We have a lot of fantastic development going on, but the natural environment needs to keep up with that."" He believes the initiative will reconnect people with trees and the natural world, provide benefits to health and reduce stress.

They said people who regularly ate hot red chili peppers had a 13 per cent reduced risk of premature death compared with those who did not eat them. They concluded that: ""The consumption of hot red chili pepper was associated with reduced mortality. Hot red chili peppers may be a beneficial component of the diet.""The researchers surveyed a total of 16,179 adults over a period of six years.

This misinformation leads to unsafe ear health habits."" Doctors say our body produces earwax for a good reason. It does an essential job of cleaning out the ears, stopping them from drying out, and helping them to sweat naturally. It also protects the inner ears against bacteria, bugs, dirt and dust.

The smaller the insula, the more likely it is that someone will suffer from PTSD. Researchers discovered that the insula was particularly small in girls who had gone through a traumatic event. It was larger than usual in boys who had experienced a distressing, shocking or frightening event. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental disorder that can develop after traumatic events, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, or threats on a person's life. Symptoms may include disturbing or suicidal thoughts, nightmares related to the events, and alterations to how a person thinks and feels.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1611/161113-ptsd.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Many of India's big cities are experiencing such hazardous air pollution that it almost defies belief. The standard measurement for healthy, normal, breathable air is set at a level of 50 according to the Air Quality Index (AQI). A level of 300 means the air is hazardous to breathe. The AQI website says 300 represents a health alert and the city should be put under emergency conditions. The website says that, ""everyone may experience more serious health effects"". On November 8, the city of Chandrapur in Maharashtra reached an AQI level of 824, to become India's most polluted city. The capital New Delhi has reached an AQI of 724. Environmentalists say many cities are now like ""gas chambers"".A toxic haze shrouds India's capital and residents are being warned to wear masks. Schools were ordered closed for three days. New Delhi generally has its fair share of pollution problems due to the nine million vehicles that clog its streets, most not conforming to emissions standards. The situation has been made worse recently due to a number of factors. These include chemical pollution blowing in from nearby states, farmers setting fire to straw as autumn arrives, and a lack of wind. To alleviate the crisis, city officials have ordered roads to be doused with water to stop dust from rising. They have also banned diesel-powered electricity generators for 10 days, except at hospitals and cellphone towers.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1611/161109-air-quality.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"The former chief of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, has said America needs to be the world's policeman to make sure the world is a safer place. Mr Rasmussen outlined his views in an interview with Britain's Sky News. He said America needed to intervene in the world's trouble spots to restore law and order. He said: ""We need determined American global leadership."" He stated that the USA had no choice but to act more forcefully, explaining that: ""Syria is torn by war and conflict, Iraq is on the brink of collapse, Libya is a failed state,…Russia is attacking Ukraine and destabilising Eastern Europe, China is flexing its muscles, [and] the rogue state North Korea is threatening nuclear attacks.""Mr Rasmussen was particularly critical of President Barack Obama, whom he says has not done enough to prevent conflict. He said: ""Superpowers don't get to retire. Look around; you will see a world on fire."" The Russia Today (RT) newspaper questions the value of recent U.S. military interventions. It said U.S. foreign policy has led to greater instability in the Middle East and North Africa. It stated that Libya plunged into chaos after the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi with the US having no post-exit plan. RT added that U.S. policy in Iraq and Syria created one of the greatest global security threats in the form of ISIS.

"Help may be at hand for those of us who want to keep the wrinkles and grey hair at bay and slow down the process of aging. New research suggests that eating green vegetables can ward off the signs of aging. Researchers say that broccoli, cabbage and avocado in particular contain a compound that helps slow down the rate at which we age. The key compound, present in green fruit and vegetables, is called NMN. It helps slow down the physical signs of getting old. Scientists say NMN can also rejuvenate the metabolism. It helps replenish levels of energy production in our body that deteriorate as we age. It also helps reduce weight gain and the deterioration of vision.The research was conducted by scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine in the USA. Researcher professor Shinichiro Imai said: ""We have shown a way to slow the physiological decline that we see in aging mice. This means older mice have metabolism and energy levels resembling that of younger mice."" Professor Imai said tests on mice showed that NMN reduced typical signs of aging, including a decline in the strength of skeletal muscle, poor liver function, lower bone density and weakening eyesight. The reason our metabolism changes over time and leads to reduced energy levels has baffled scientists for decades. This latest research casts new light on this mystery.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1611/161101-aging.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"Myanmar was for decades ruled by an oppressive military junta. However, since the country returned to democratic ways, things have changed. The Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) has just stated that Myanmar is home to the world's most generous people. It is the third successive year for the country to achieve this accolade. The CAF ""World Giving Index"" found that 91 per cent of Myanmar residents gave money to charity in the past year, 62 per cent helped a stranger, and 55 per cent claimed they had volunteered. An economic adviser to Myanmar's president said: ""The results demonstrate very sharply how a 'poor' country can be a 'rich' one through its generosity, by focusing on giving rather than getting.""The report also found that people in Iraq are the kindest to strangers. Eight in 10 Iraqis are reported to have helped someone they don't know in the past year. The BBC commented on how significant this statistic was, given the turmoil Iraq has been in for years because of war. It stated that: ""It is the kindness of Iraqis…to complete strangers in the face of years of conflict and terrible violence which stands out in the list."" John Low, CEO of the Charities Aid Foundation, said: ""The generosity of people, even in countries suffering from disaster and turmoil, is truly humbling.""

"An expert believes she has uncovered the secret of what dogs dream about. Dr Deirdre Barrett, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School, conducted research into dog dreams and concluded that, among other things, dogs dream about their owners. Dr Barrett said canine dreams were comparable to those we have: ""Humans dream about the same things they're interested in by day….There's no reason to think animals are any different. Since dogs are generally extremely attached to their human owners, it's likely your dog is dreaming of your face, your smell and of pleasing or annoying you."" The psychologist even advised pet owners to give their pets ""happy daytime experiences"" to make sure they have nice dreams. Dr Barrett stated that there is no way of knowing for certain what dogs see when they dream. Research isn't even close to disclosing that mystery with human dreams. Her conclusions are based on the fact that canines and other mammals have a sleep cycle that is similar to the human cycle. This includes a period of activity called REM (Rapid Eye Movement), which is the part of the sleep cycle when humans dream. She said: ""That certainly makes it the best guess that other mammals are dreaming too."" Dr Barrett also explained the reason that dogs move their legs while they are asleep. She said they are probably acting out their dreams so their legs move in a running motion in their sleep.",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1610/161024-dog-dreams.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"The Swedish furniture giant IKEA has banned old people from dating at its store in Shanghai, China. Store managers decided to clamp down on what they described as 'illegal date clubs'. Since the store opened several years ago, hundreds of lonely, divorced or widowed elderly people have descended on the cafeteria in search of love and companionship. Many of them simply used the café as a meeting place and did not buy anything. Management said they occupied seats for 'extended periods,' 'spoke loudly,' 'spat on the floor,' 'flirted' and had 'quarrels and fights'. The store posted a notice saying: ""From today, the restaurant will only be for people who purchase their food first.""The older clientele are up in arms over the ban. They say they have nowhere else to go. An 88-year-old IKEA regular said: ""We've been to McDonald's and KFC, but there are barely any of our peers there. We feel like aliens there - surrounded by youngsters."" Another frequent visitor to the restaurant said: ""I guess few people know just how lonely old people are. Our kids are not around, and some visit only on weekends. I feel quite good when I come here. I talk with friends, but some elderly do meet people who become lovers."" Some customers have little sympathy for those in search of love.

"Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari is in hot water over sexist remarks he made about his wife Aisha. He was replying to reports that his wife may not support his bid to be re-elected to power. He stated during a news conference in Berlin that: ""I don't know which party my wife belongs to but she belongs to my kitchen and my living room and the other room."" President Buhari was standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the time. Ms Merkel did not express an opinion on Mr Buhari's words but did give him a shocked, stern look. Mr Buhari went on to add fuel to the fire, telling reporters that he can ""claim superior knowledge"" over his wife after running for president three times.Nigeria’s first lady Aisha Buhari warned her husband that she would not campaign alongside him in future elections unless he reformed his leadership.

"Samsung, the South Korean tech giant, has warned owners of the Galaxy Note 7 to turn off their phone after more reports of the device catching fire. The company will also stop shipping the flagship phone to stores. The device, launched in August, was set to rival Apple's iPhone. Samsung engineers must now conduct an investigation into what is causing so many phones to catch fire. Samsung had already been hit following a recall of 2.5 million phones in September after many burst into flames when their batteries exploded. This new episode further damages the company's credibility as many of the exploding phones are those that had batteries replaced in September and were deemed to be safe.Industry analysts are now predicting how much the latest trouble will cost the company. South Korean media is reporting that the company could discontinue producing the phone. However, South Korea's finance minister Yoo Il-ho has warned that the country's exports would be damaged if it did this. He said: ""Right now we can't tell what the impact will be in the long term. It's up to the company and the government cannot interfere, but if they do scrap the model, it will have a negative impact on exports.""

"It will come as little surprise to many that girls spend 40 per cent more time performing unpaid household chores than boys. That 40 per cent equates to a whopping 160 million more hours of chores a day undertaken by girls.  In some countries, this figure is considerably higher. A new report from the United Nations children's agency UNICEF highlights this disparity. UNICEF's Anju Malhotra stated. ""Girls sacrifice important opportunities to learn, grow and just enjoy their childhood."" She added: ""This unequal distribution of labour among children also perpetuates gender stereotypes and the double burden on women and girls across generations.""Much of the work done by girls is of a menial and physically demanding nature. Two-thirds of girls cook and clean in the home, while half collect firewood or water. They also spend a long time caring for children and elderly relatives. The country where girls work longest is Somalia. Here, girls aged between 10 and 14 years spend 26 hours a week on household chores. The report is being released to coincide with the UN's International Day of the Girl Child, which is on the 11th of October.

"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is in trouble again following revelations about his tax returns. The New York Times said Mr Trump's 1995 tax returns showed he reported over $900 million in business losses. This has enabled him to not pay nearly a billion dollars in income tax over the past 19 years. The Times suggests Trump is being hypocritical, as he has constantly criticized the tax system for being unfair. The Times wrote: ""Trump is right when he says the system is rigged. What he doesn't say is that it’s rigged in his favor and in the favor of people like him, and against regular people - those of us who earn money, pay income tax on it, and financially support the country in which we live.""Mr Trump has spent years on social media attacking high-profile people for not paying enough tax. He attacked President Obama for paying a ""paltry"" tax rate of 20.5 per cent. Former New York mayor and Trump campaign advisor Rudy Giuliani said Mr Trump had done nothing illegal and called him a ""genius"" for not paying tax and turning around his loss-making business. He likened Trump to Winston Churchill, Britain's leader during World War II.

"It is common knowledge and an obvious example of sexual inequality that men get paid more than women for doing the same job. One industry in which the reverse is true is modeling. The gender pay gap for male models and their female counterparts is gigantic. A well-known modeling agency has claimed that male models are paid as much as 75 per cent less than female models. Elizabeth Rose from the UK's Premier Models said women could be paid £40,000 ($52,000) for appearing in a top fashion show, while men could only get £10,000 ($13,000). Ms Rose said: ""I think it's the only industry where men get paid less than women. It's unfair for men, [but] I wouldn't say it's female empowerment.""Rose says the situation is slowly changing and pay is getting better for men. She explained that advertisers are more willing to promote men's products as men are getting more into fashion. She said: ""More and more, male models are being used for grooming products. Men are taking a lot more care of themselves. Generally, in the 2000s, it's fine to take a long time doing your hair. It's fine [for men] to use moisturizer [and] wear make-up."" One consolation for men is that they are able to work as a model for longer than women. Rose said: ""Men have a longer career path, definitely. The male models that make the most are probably in their 30s.""

"Watching sad or traumatic movies can sometimes be just what the doctor ordered. A new study reveals that watching distressing movies may boost our tolerance to pain. Researchers at Oxford University say that movies that get your emotions going can increase the amount of endorphins released by the brain. These are our body's natural painkillers - chemicals that make us feel better after physical or psychological pain. Dr Robin Dunbar, a co-author of the study, explained that: ""Maybe the emotional [distress] you get from tragedy triggers the endorphin system."" He added: ""The same areas in the brain that deal with physical pain also handle psychological pain.""Dr Dunbar and his colleagues conducted a series of tests to determine the effect that tragic stories have on us. They invited 169 people to take part in the experiment. One group watched a traumatic drama about a disabled man battling homelessness, drug addiction and alcoholism. Another group watched a documentary on the geology and archaeology of Britain. The results showed that on average, the pain tolerance of those who watched the traumatic drama increased by 13.1 per cent. This compared to an average decrease in pain threshold of 4.6 per cent for those who watched the documentary. Dr Dunbar suggested one reason we like watching sad movies is the natural high from the endorphins. ",B2,https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1609/160924-painkillers.html,breakingnewsenglish,
"History was made at the recent New York Fashion Week. For the very first time, there was a collection in which every model walked down the catwalk wearing a hijab. The hijab is the veil traditionally worn by Muslim women, which usually covers the head and chest. It has got a bad press recently because of it being banned in various parts of the world. However, Muslim designer Anniesa Hasibuan from Indonesia wanted to show just how stylish and elegant the hijab could be and wowed the fashion world with her creations. Ms Hasibuan is just 30 years old and becomes the first Indonesian to feature a collection at a prestigious global fashion event. She received a standing ovation at the end of her show in New York.There has been an upswing in the past few years of fashion designers incorporating Islamic fashion into their designs. The international retail clothing company H&M released an advert showing a Muslim model in a hijab, while Dolce and Gabbana released a line of hijabs aimed at wealthy Muslim customers. Not everyone is happy with the hijab entering mainstream fashion. Some say the new designs are bordering on being un-Islamic.

A new report highlights how the investment banking industry in the UK follows centuries-old, unwritten rules about how bankers should conduct themselves. The study was undertaken by the British government's Social Mobility Commission. Researchers looked at how the industry selected people in job interviews. They found that the industry was governed by ""relatively opaque"" codes of conduct. They wrote: ""For men, the wearing of brown shoes with a business suit is generally considered unacceptable…within investment banking.""The survey suggested that people from working class backgrounds had to change their behaviour to fit in with bankers who were from middle and upper classes. One newly-appointed banker said: ""I felt like my accent was a bit out of place, so I changed it."" The study also said the industry discriminated against those who did not go to elite universities. The Commission's chairman said: ""Bright, working-class kids are being systematically locked out of top jobs in investment banking because they did not attend a small handful of elite universities.""

"Authorities in Hawaii are proposing a ban on the popular tourist activity of swimming with dolphins off the Hawaiian coast. The dolphins have served as a magnet for tourists over the past few decades. However, federal officials say the increasing tourism is harmful to the dolphins because they are supposed to be resting and socializing. The National Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration proposes to prohibit swimming with, or approaching within 50 metres of, Hawaii's spinner dolphins. That would put an end to many tour group activities, which involve sailing alongside the creatures in a boat and snorkeling with them.Ann Garrett, a spokeswoman for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said she didn't think the ban would have a big impact on the tourist trade in Hawaii. Ms Garrett said: ""We think that by identifying 50 metres as the minimum distance, there still can be a viable tourist industry in Hawaii."" Tour operators disagreed with Garrett's assessment. Tour company owner Kevin Merrill warned: ""It would be the end of legitimate dolphin swimming. We couldn’t offer the people the quality interaction that they expect."" Dolphins typically are most active at night and sleep and relax during the day, which is when the tourists interact with them.
