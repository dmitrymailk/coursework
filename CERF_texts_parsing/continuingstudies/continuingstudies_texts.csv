"I am new to the city. I do not know anyone. But an old woman lives next door. Her name is Val. She gives me a big box of vegetables.She grows them in a garden by the sidewalk. There are carrots, tomatoes, beans, and peas. They are the best vegetables I ever ate. Val lives alone, too. But she seems happy in her garden. She loves plants. Sometimes, I can hear her talking to them. Maybe that is why they grow so big.One day, I stop seeing Val in the garden. I see people take many boxes from her home. Weeds grow in her garden. The dirt is dry. The plants look sad. Val must have passed on.So I pull the weeds. I water the garden. I even talk to the plants.Then a family moves next door. They are new to the city. They do not know anyone.

"It is hard to be a farmer. Cold weather can kill your crops. Bugs can eat your crops. Weeds can hurt your crops. Your crops may need more rain than they get. Fruits and Vegetables can go bad before they are sold. Some people say farmers can fix all of this with GM food.What is GM food? All living things have DNA. DNA tells living things how to grow. These days, people can change the DNA that tells food how to grow. When people change the DNA of food, it is called GM food.Some GM food can grow in cold weather. GM food can stop bugs from eating it. GM fruits and vegetables can stay good longer. One day, GM food may be able to grow in dry land in Africa. It will feed people who do not have much food.But there is a lot we do not know about GM food. Will GM companies help poor people grow food? Or do GM companies just want to get rich? Does GM food kill bugs we need, like butterflies? Does GM food make birds sick? Does GM food make people sick? We do not know. There have not been many tests on GM food.Do you think farmers should grow GM food?",A1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/200/reading/gm-food1,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/200-stories-cam/gm-food.mp3}
"The tomato is from South America. When the tomato came to Europe, people did not eat it. Doctors said it would make them sick. So people just grew tomatoes because they looked nice.Now people from all over the world eat tomatoes. Tomatoes are used in sauce, soup, juice, salsa, and ketchup. The tomato is very good for you. Only a tomato leaf or stem will make you sick.People do odd things with tomatoes. People grow tomatoes in space. There is a big tomato fight every year in Spain. A long time ago, people would toss a bad tomato when they saw a show they did not like.In Canada, many tomatoes are grown on big farms. The farms bring in poor people from far away to help grow tomatoes. Without these workers, the farms could not run. But the workers do not get much money. Canada does not let the workers stay here. Many people say this is not fair.Most farms pick tomatoes before they are ripe. They last longer this way. But these tomatoes do not taste as good. So lots of people grow their own tomatoes.Grow Your Own TomatoesTomatoes that you grow are better than tomatoes that you buy. You can grow tomatoes inside if you do not have a garden. You need: Tomato seedsA big pot (50 cm deep)Potting soil (many big food shops sell this)A windowFill the pot with potting soil. Pack the soil down a little bit. Put a seed on top of the soil. Add a bit more soil on top.Add water. The soil must always be a bit wet. Seeds like to be warm. Put your pot in a warm place. It does not need sun yet.The plant will grow above the soil. Put the plant by a window. The plant needs four hours of sun a day. You can tie the stem to a stick to help the plant stay up. Always keep the soil a bit wet.Pick the tomatoes when they are the same red colour top to bottom.

"A man named Randy liked to hunt trees. He looked for big trees and old trees. He made maps to show where these trees were. He did not want to cut them down.

Randy set out to find the tree.But someone else found it first. It was found by a logger. Loggers wanted to cut down Canadas tallest tree and all the trees around it.Randy made a path in the forest so people could see the tall tree.

"Vancouver Islands Pacific Rim Whale FestivalIn British Columbia, people have festivals that celebrate the things that make their hometown special. Every year, about 20,000 grey whales swim past the west coast of Vancouver Island. The whales travel from Mexico to the Arctic and back again. The whole trip is about 16,000 kilometres. Every March, the people who live around the Pacific Rim National Park have a festival to celebrate the whales journey. The festival is the Pacific Rim Whale Festival. The whales travel very close to the shore as they swim north. This allows people to gather together to watch the whales from land and from boats.Nanaimos Bathtub RaceOn the east coast of Vancouver Island, you can see people moving through the water in a strange type of boat. During the Nanaimo Bathtub Race, people have a big race in boats made from bathtubs! The city of Nanaimo is home to the oldest and most famous bathtub boat race in the world. The race started as a silly event in 1967. Today, Nanaimos World Championship Bathtub Race is a serious sport that brings racers and visitors from around the world.Vancouvers Dragon Boat FestivalVancouver is home to another famous festival on the water. This is the Dragon Boat Festival. Dragon boat racing started in China more than 2,000 years ago. It was brought to Vancouver during the Worlds Fair called Expo 86. The Dragon Boat Festival came back to Vancouver in 1989 to celebrate the many cultures living together in the city. The festival begins with a ceremony. The ceremony wakes up the dragon and gives the people and boats the dragons strength. Each boat has a dragons head on the front and a tail on the back. The boat holds a team of about 20 people. The people in the boats paddle to the beat of a drummer. The drummer sits at the front of the dragon boat.",A2,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/330/reading/bc-festivals1,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/330-stories-cam/all-together-now-three-bc-festivals.mp3}
"The land we now call British Columbia is home to more First Nations languages than any other part of Canada. About 32 First Nations languages are spoken here. But many of these languages are at risk. For example, there are now fewer than 10 people who can speak the language of the Skwomesh Nation. Most of the speakers are over the age of 65.There is a young man named Khelsilem Rivers. Khelsilem is 24 years old. He has learned the Skwomesh language. He spends much of his time working to keep the Skwomesh language alive. Khelsilem lives in a house with other young people who want to speak their traditional language every day.Why is language so important? Language is how we practice our culture. We share our stories, our songs, our history, and our teachings through language. Language is part of our identity. People in our families who were alive before us are called our ancestors. Language connects us to our ancestors. Knowing our language helps us be healthy in mind, body, and spirit.Skwomesh is one of the aboriginal languages in British Columbia that is at risk. This means that the Skwomesh language could be lost forever. It could be lost forever because no one will ever speak Skwomesh again. Native people are now being helped by university departments to help preserve their languages. In the past, many Canadians did not respect aboriginal languages and this was wrong. Hopefully, in the future, native people like Khelsilem Rivers will keep the Skwomesh, and many other native languages alive. This will help Canadas aboriginal peoples preserve their culture.",A2,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/330/reading/first-nations-languages1,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/330-stories-cam/spread-the-word.mp3}

"A long time ago in China there lived a poor boy called Liang. He had no family, so he made his living by doing odd jobs for other people in his village, such as cutting wood and tending cattle. His life was difficult, but Liang was a generous boy and always willing to help people who needed it. In his heart he had a dream. He wanted to paint pictures and become a great artist. He practised drawing all the time. When he was in the forest cutting wood, he drew birds and animals with a stick. If he was looking after a farmers cows he drew on the sides of the barn. Whatever he was doing he drew – plants, animals, birds and people. He thought of nothing else except drawing, and soon he became very good at it. One night Liang dreamed that an old man gave him a paintbrush. The man said it was a magic paintbrush and Liang should use it to help people. When Liang woke up the next morning, he was surprised to see that he had a beautiful paintbrush in his hand. Liang was hungry, so he painted a bowl of rice. Suddenly the rice became real, and he ate it. Now he felt happy, so he drew a bird. The bird came to life and flew away. When Liang went into the village he met an old farmer carrying water from the river to his field. It was a long walk and the man was very tired. Liang painted a river beside the field and the river came to life. Now the farmer could easily bring the water to his crops. Soon Liang met another villager who was crying because his cow had died in the night, and there was no milk for his children. Liang drew a cow, and it came to life. The villager was overjoyed and happily began to milk his cow.From that day Liang used his paintbrush to help the people in his village. Whenever they needed something, Liang would paint it. Soon the villagers began to prosper, and word of Liangs magic paintbrush began to travel beyond the village.People asked him, Why dont you use your magic paintbrush to become rich? What else do I need? replied Liang. I feel rich because I can help.It wasnt long before a rich man who lived near the village heard about Liangs magic paintbrush, and thought he would use it to make himself richer than the emperor. This man decided to steal Liangs paintbrush. He sent some of his *thugs to Liangs home, where they captured Liang and put him in prison. The rich man took the paintbrush.The rich man wanted to show off his power so he invited some friends to his house. He drew a lot of pictures, but not one picture became real. The rich man figured there must be some special secret that he didnt know about, so he sent for Liang. When Liang stood before him he said, If you draw some pictures for me and they become real, I will let you go free. Liang knew that this rich man was not a good man. He didnt want to help, but he wanted to be free. He had an idea. He said, I will help you, but you must let me go. Paint me a golden mountain, said the rich man. I want to go there and get lots of gold. What he didnt say out loud was, And then I will be the richest man in the kingdom, richer even than the emperor himself! Liang drew a picture of the sea.Why did you draw the sea? said the rich man, I told you to draw the mountain. I want gold, not fish!	The mountain is on the other side of the sea. replied Liang. Ill show you. Liang drew the golden mountain on the other side of the sea. When the rich man saw the mountain shining in gold his eyes lit up like two yellow suns. Yes! he said, Thats much better! But the mountain is far from here. How will I get there?Ill draw you a boat to get to the mountain, said Liang. And he drew a golden dragon boat that was even bigger and more beautiful than the emperors boat. The rich man climbed aboard the boat and stood in the bow facing the golden mountain. He said to Liang, Now draw me a wind to take the boat to the mountain. Liang began to draw a wind, and the boat set sail. The rich man stretched his arms out to grab the golden mountain. Make the wind stronger so I can get there faster, he said to Liang. Liang kept drawing and the wind got stronger. Soon the wind became a terrible gale and the rich mans beautiful boat sank beneath the sea and took him down with it. People say that Liang married a beautiful girl from his village and had a big family, and they were happy all their days.* thug: a violent and rough person",A2,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/330/reading/the-magic-paintbrush1,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/330-stories-cam/the-magic-paintbrush.mp3}
"Once there was a monkey who lived in a naval tree beside a river. This naval tree produced more fruit than any other tree in the jungle, and its fruit was fresher and sweeter than the fruit on all the other trees.Every day when the monkey ate this fruit, he was very happy. Not only could he eat his fill, but he could throw some fruit into the river when his friend the crocodile came by. The crocodile and the monkey spent many hours sitting on the shore of the river and talking, and in time they became best friends.The crocodile always took some fruit home to his dear wife. She loved the naval fruit so much that she became addicted to its taste and freshness. One day she thought, If the monkey eats this fruit every day, then his flesh must also taste sweet, especially his liver. Oh, I want to taste the monkeys liver. She thought about it and thought about it until she couldnt stand it any longer.Finally she said to her husband, I want to taste the monkeys liver. Please bring him home, so I can satisfy my hunger.The crocodile was shocked! You want to eat the monkeys liver? But . . . hes my friend! I love him. And hes so generous to us. My dear, its impossible.The lady crocodile became angry. She demanded that he bring the monkey to her. She demanded that he let her taste the monkeys liver. Otherwise she would leave.The crocodile was torn apart. He loved his wife, and didnt want to lose her. He loved his friend, and didnt want to lose him. Why did he have to make this difficult choice?In the end, he decided to lose his monkey friend. With a heavy heart, he swam slowly back across the river and sat under the naval tree. Oh Monkey, he called, Its a lovely night, and I feel like going for a ride on the river. Why dont you come along? I could show you the beauty of the river.I dont think so, said the monkey. I dont think thats a good idea. And anyway, I cant swim, and Im afraid of the water.I am the king of the river. You dont need to be afraid when you ride on my back. Besides, weve been friends for a long time. What a shame it would be if you cant trust me by now.The monkey thought for a minute. Perhaps the crocodile was right. Who can you trust, if not your friends? OK, he said, Ill come with you. He jumped onto the crocodiles back, and they sailed into the river.It was a wonderful ride, and the monkey was really happy, but the crocodile was quiet, and deep in thought. Whats the matter? asked the monkey.The crocodile almost burst into tears. Im sorry, my friend. I lied to you. I am not doing this to entertain you. Rather, I am taking you to my wife. She wants to eat your liver.Eat my liver!! The monkey was astonished. Why does she want to eat my liver?She knows that you eat the fruit of the naval tree every day. She thinks that your liver must be very sweet and tender, so she wants to eat it.I see, said the monkey. He saw that his life was in danger. He thought for a minute. My friend, dont feel bad on my account, he said. I would be honored to give my liver to your wife. But you should have told me about this before we left the naval tree.Why? asked the crocodile.Well, I always wash my liver in the river and then hang it on a branch of the tree.Oh?If you take me back to the tree, Ill get it for you. Then you can take it to your wife.The crocodile swam quickly back to the naval tree. When he got to the shore, the monkey jumped off his back and climbed up the tree. Hah! Crocodile! Dont you know that I cant give you my liver?

"Raven was bored. He was walking along the beach in Haida Gwaii, looking for some new way to amuse himself. As he walked along the beach, the blue ocean in front of him and the green forest behind him didnt seem interesting. Raven wanted to play, but there was no one to play with.Then he heard a strange sound, unlike any sound he knew. He looked up and down the beach. Where was it coming from? As he walked he noticed a large white clamshell lying in the sand. Inside the clamshell were tiny creatures, unlike any he had seen before. Raven bent down to get a closer look. The creatures seemed afraid of him, so he began to coax them in a gentle voice, Come out. Come out. Dont be afraid. I wont hurt you. A few of the creatures came out of the clamshell. They were very different from Raven. They had no feathers, no wings, and no beaks. Like him, they walked on two legs, but they had arms, faces with mouths, and black hair. They spoke to each other in a language that Raven didnt understand. These tiny creatures were the first humans.Raven enjoyed watching these humans play and explore the world. After a while, when he was beginning to feel bored again, he noticed that these humans were only men. There were no women. Raven had an idea. He wondered if he could find some women. He searched for a long time. Then he saw some *chitons. He opened one of the chitons and found some lovely, tiny women. He brought the women to the men.Raven enjoyed watching the behaviour of the men and women. He saw them begin to pair off and have children. The human families moved to other parts of the island. Since that day, many generations of humans have grown and flourished, and Raven has never been bored. * Chiton: a large sea shell",A2,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/330/reading/raven-and-the-first-people1,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/330-stories-cam/raven-and-the-first-people.mp3}
"In the beginning there was no light in the world, because an old magician kept it hidden in a box inside his house. Raven, who was always hungry, didnt like the darkness because it was difficult to find food. One day he was looking for food near the old magicians house. He heard a voice saying, I have a box, and inside this box is another box, and inside this there is another box, and inside the smallest box is all the light in the world. Raven decided to steal the light.Raven waited until the old mans daughter went down to the river to collect water. Just as she was dipping her basket into the river, he changed himself into a *hemlock needle. The needle floated into her basket. When the girl drank some water, she swallowed Raven too. Inside the girls belly Raven took the form of a human baby. He grew and grew, and in time she gave birth to a funny looking child with black eyes and a big nose. The old man loved his grandson so much that he gave in to the childs every wish. Raven became spoilt and greedy. He was bored with all his toys, and wanted to play with the box that held the light. Finally the grandfather opened the box and tossed the glowing ball of light to Raven.As soon as Raven caught the light, he immediately changed into his bird form. Holding the light in his beak, he flew up the chimney hole into the dark world. The magician was angry. He wanted to get the light back into his box. He flew after Raven.The light was heavy in Raven's beak, and he was getting tired. The magician was coming closer. Raven broke off some pieces of the light and threw them into the sky.

"Sedna was a beautiful Inuit girl who didnt want to get married. Many hunters wanted to marry her, but she refused their offers. Her father scolded her, saying, I am getting older, and soon you will need a good husband who can provide you with food and furs. You must marry the next hunter who asks for you. Sedna still wasnt interested.Soon a young hunter from a distant place came to her fathers camp . He was dressed in warm furs, and spoke in a soft voice. He promised to provide a good home and plenty of animals for food and clothing. Although he kept his face hidden under his hood, Sedna was very impressed with him, so she agreed to marry him.Sedna got into her husbands kayak and travelled with him to her new home. When they arrived at his island, she saw that her home was nothing but some sticks and bits of moss and feathers clinging to a large rock. Her husband took off his hood, and she realized that he was not a man, but an evil raven. He never hunted, he only caught fish. Sedna was cold, lonely, hungry, and very unhappy. Every day she cried for her father to come and save her. Her father heard her cries and decided to rescue her. He paddled his kayak to the island where she was living. On their way home, Sedna looked back and saw that the raven was following them. He was gaining on them quickly. As the raven came close, her father took his paddle and struck the bird, who had to fall back. Then the raven flapped his powerful wings at the ocean and caused a huge storm to blow up. When her father saw that their lives were in danger, he became afraid for his own life. He threw Sedna over the side of the kayak. Sedna tried to save herself. She grabbed onto the kayak with her fingers, but her father took his paddle and beat at her fingers until they broke off. As they sank into the ocean, her fingers turned into seals and fish. Again, Sedna grabbed the kayak with her hands, but her father took his paddle and beat her hands until they also fell into the water. As they sank into the ocean, her hands turned into whales and walrus. Sedna also sank into the ocean.Sedna lives at the bottom of the ocean. She is the goddess of the sea. She is the one who provides animals for the hunters, but only when she feels generous. When she is angry, and this is often, the hunters cant find food; and the people go hungry.",A2,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/330/reading/sedna-the-sea-goddess1,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/330-stories-cam/sedna-the-sea-goddess.mp3}
"A long time ago in Japan there lived an old farmer and his wife. The old man was kind and gentle and always had a smile for everyone he met, but his wife was cold and very bad-tempered. They had no children to help them, so as they got older, they had to work even harder just to survive. The old man found and tamed a little sparrow, and taught it many kinds of tricks. When he came in from the fields at the end of each day, the sparrow would welcome him home, and sing and dance for him; so in spite of his hardships the old man went to bed happy each night. One day the old man had to go far into the forest to cut wood. It was laundry day, and his wife was in a bad mood as she prepared the starch for the clothes and set it outside to cool. While she was washing the clothes, the sparrow flew down to the starch and, as the old man had taught it to, pecked at the starch until it was gone. When the old woman came to get the starch and saw that the sparrow had eaten it, she went into a rage. She grabbed the bird in one hand and with the other she picked up her scissors and cut off the tip of its tongue. Then she threw the sparrow out the door, and it flew away as fast as it could go.That night when the old man came home there was no sparrow to greet him and warm his heart. When he questioned his wife, she admitted what she had done, adding, And good riddance! That bird has always caused more work for me.The poor man was devastated. Before dawn the next morning he took off to look for his little sparrow. He wandered through fields and forests, calling, Mr. Sparrow, Mr. Sparrow, where are you now? How can I help you, my poor little tongue-cut sparrow?After a long time searching he came to a large bamboo wood, where he finally met the sparrow again. The old man ran forward to greet his little pet. They talked for a while, and the old man could see that the sparrow no longer suffered from any injury. The sparrow invited the old man home. He introduced his family and asked his wife to prepare a delicious feast. During the meal the sparrows daughters danced and sang for the old man. It was the best hospitality the old man had ever experienced! When it was time for the old man to return home, the sparrow brought out two wicker baskets, one large and one small. He said, Here is a parting gift for you. Choose the one you want.Thank you. said the old man, Since Im not as strong as I used to be, and I have a long way to go, Ill take the smaller one. So he strapped the smaller one to his back and returned home.Immediately his wife began to scold him for being away so long, and didnt stop until he opened the basket and onto their floor spilled gold and silver and all kinds of precious jewels. With the sparrows gift, they had enough to be comfortable in their old age. But the woman didnt stay happy for long. Why didnt you choose the bigger basket? she scolded. Then we could be very rich indeed and live in a bigger house and have servants. How could you be so stupid?The old woman decided to visit the sparrow. She went into the forest and walked and walked until she found the sparrows house in the bamboo wood. The sparrow and his family were not pleased to see her, but they were kinder than she, so they invited her in. She ate quickly and then called for her gift. When the two baskets were set out before her she chose the larger one. Without even thanking them she strapped it to her back and returned home. When she opened the basket a horde of demons sprang out and tormented her to death.The old man was comfortable and happy for the rest of his days.",A2,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/330/reading/the-tongue-cut-sparrow1,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/330-stories-cam/tongue-cut-sparrow.mp3}
"Viola Desmond was an African Canadian woman from Nova Scotia. She lived in a time when black women were expected to be servants in houses, and black men were expected to be servants on trains. From a young age, Viola dreamed of having her own business. By 1946, she was making her dreams come true. Viola was only 32, yet she had her own beauty salon. She had set up a school to train other black women to work in the beauty business. She also had her own line of beauty products. One day, she was driving across Nova Scotia to make a delivery. But then her car broke down in New Glasgow. She decided to go see a movie while she waited for her car to be fixed. She went to the Roseland Theatre. It was a brick building with a big sign that lit up at night. She paid for a ticket and went inside. The theatre had a main floor and a balcony. Viola sat on the main floor because her eyesight was poor and she needed to be close to the screen. Just as the movie started to play, she felt a tap on her shoulder. A staff person told her she could not sit there. Her ticket was for the balcony. Viola went back to the ticket booth. She asked for a ticket for the main floor. The ticket seller said, We dont sell tickets on the main floor to you people. Thats when she realized that the balcony was for black people. The main floor was for white people. Viola said that she could not see from the balcony. She put the extra money for a main floor ticket on the counter. The ticket seller would not take it, but she went back to her seat anyway. Thats when the manager came in. He told her to move to the balcony, or he would call the police. Viola told him to go ahead. She wasnt moving. She was doing nothing wrong. Sure enough, the police came. They asked her one more time to move. Viola said no. So the police grabbed her by the arms and took her from the theatre. They had to drag her. I just sort of went limp, Viola said. I wasnt going to make it easy for them. The police took Viola to prison. She sat up awake the whole night. The next day, she was taken to court. Nobody had told her she could call a lawyer, so she had to argue for herself. She didnt know how courtrooms worked, and she was found guilty.  Her husband begged her to forget about what had happened and move on. But Viola bravely took the case back to court. Sadly, she lost once more. But Violas case brought many people together to fight for equal rights in Nova Scotia. They kept up the battle and in 1954, the province finally got rid of the laws that made it legal to treat black people differently from white people. People of colour are now equal under the laws of Canada. However, racism is alive in many Canadians hearts and minds. Violas story invites us to ask: What can we do to make sure that history does not repeat itself?",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/viola-desmond,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-peter/The-Story-of-Viola-Desmond.mp3}
"In 1919, Tommy Douglas was a teenager standing on a rooftop in downtown Winnipeg. He was looking down on a huge crowd of workers protesting low wages. They could not give their families a good quality of life, even though they worked very hard. Suddenly, the police pulled out their guns and shot over 20 of the protesting workers. Many more were hurt. Tommy was deeply affected by what he saw that day. He believed everyone should have a good quality of life, whether they were rich or poor. He thought it was wrong that people who fought for their rights were being killed. When he was 26, he became a minister so he could help people. His first job was in Saskatchewan. When the miners in his town went on strike, he took them food and blankets. Once more the police came in. They shot and killed three people. Tommy had seen enough. He decided to go into politics to make life better for poor people. He joined a socialist party called the CCF.  People tried to scare voters by saying he was a communist. So Tommy told a story about a place called Mouseland. In Mouseland, the mice kept voting for fat black cats who made laws that were only good for cats. To make a change, next time the mice voted for the fat white cats. Of course, nothing changed. Finally one day, a mouse got the idea to vote for other mice. The story ends with everyone calling him a communist! This story helped people understand socialism. The cats were like rich people who were in government at the time. On the other hand, the mice were the working class people that Tommy wanted to see in government.  With his bold ideas and ability to speak to a crowd, Tommy connected with voters. He became premier of Saskatchewan in 1944. He had this job until 1961. During that time, he kept his promises to make life better for everyone in Saskatchewan. At the time, only big cities had power for heat and lights. Tommy brought in power across the province. He made a law that bosses had to give workers at least two weeks of paid vacation. He made a bill of rights saying that people of all races and genders are equal. The biggest change of all was that he brought in free health care for everyone in the province. Health care was personal for Tommy. When he was a young boy, he got an infection in his leg. His family was poor and could not afford health care. He was going to lose his leg. Thankfully, a doctor agreed to operate on his leg for free. Most people were not as lucky as he had been in his time of need. In 1959, Tommy brought in free health care for everyone in Saskatchewan, rich and poor. Before long, many people across Canada wanted the same health care rights that people in Saskatchewan had. In 1961, Tommy was voted into the federal government. The federal government put many of Tommys ideas in place for the rest of Canada. These ideas included money for seniors, minimum wages, and even health care. In a county-wide vote, in 2004, Canadians named Tommy Douglas as the greatest Canadian of all time.",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/tommy-douglas,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-peter/The-Story-of-Tommy-Douglas.mp3}
"At one time, the word queer was an insult. Today, it is a word many people proudly use to describe themselves. The road to pride began with Jim Egan. Jim was born in Toronto in 1921. As a young man, he began visiting bars quietly known to be gay meeting places. He had to be careful. The police in Toronto often went to these places. They would trick gay men by pretending to be gay, too. Then they would arrest them. The mens names would be printed in newspapers. They often lost their jobs, their family, and their friends. Landlords would not rent to them. Being gay meant being left out by the world. Jim met a man named Jack in one of those bars. They fell in love. The world seemed like a less lonely place. Jim loved to read. He noticed queer people were being written about a lot more in the newspapers. But queer people were always talked about as being sick and immoral. This upset Jim. He could not stay silent. So, in 1949, he began writing letters to the newspapers. He protested the way they talked about gay people. He called for equal rights under the law. This was at a time when no one else was speaking up. Over the next 10 years, his letters appeared in many places, including TIME magazine. In 1963, a reporter from Macleans magazine wrote a story about Jim. It was the first positive report about queer people by a major Canadian news company. Jim used a fake name to avoid arrest. Jack was uncomfortable with Jims activism. He was worried that one day they might be thrown in jail. So Jim agreed to give up his activism. They moved across the country to Vancouver Island and started a new life. In 1969, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau finally got rid of the law that made queer relationships illegal. Trudeau said, Theres no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation. Jim and Jack no longer had to worry about being put in prison. In the 1980s, AIDS began taking the lives of gay men. Gay men whose partners died of AIDS did not have the same rights as everyone else whose partners were sick or had passed away. Jim returned to queer activism — and this time, Jack was right by his side. They helped run an AIDS organization. They also ran a drop-in group out of their home for queer people. Jim retired in 1987. The government would not give him and Jack the same amount of money that married men and women get when they retire. Jim and Jack had been together for over 40 years. They took the government to court. It took eight years, but the courts made it illegal to discriminate based on who people are in love with. This was the first time queer people in Canada had human rights. In 2005, Canada became the fourth country in the world to make same gender marriage legal. Canada became a worldwide leader in queer rights.

"An eight-year-old boy named Elijah sat in the forest with his grandfather. He lived on a reserve in Manitoba called Red Sucker Lake. His grandfather was showing him how to make a beaver trap. Elijah loved spending time on the land. He had learned all about hunting and fishing from his grandfather. One day, a small plane landed on the lake. A white man stepped out. He was sent by the government. His job was to take Elijah from his grandparents and bring him to a residential school, or boarding school. Elijah didnt want to get on the plane, but he had no choice. At that time, First Nations people didnt have any rights. They werent allowed to vote or be in government. The laws said that First Nations children had to go to residential school, so they would become more like white people. Elijah spent the next 10 years in residential school. The teachers cut his hair. They told him that the things he had learned from his grandfather were the ways of the heathens, or godless people. He was punished if he tried to speak his own language. During that time, many of his classmates tried to run away. But they were always caught and brought back. By the time Elijah became an adult, the laws keeping First Nations people out of government had changed. Elijah had an idea. If he was in government, he could help First Nations people stand up for their rights. So, in 1981, he ran to be an MLA, or member of the government. He won! He was the first Aboriginal MLA in the history of Manitoba. Even as an MLA, it was hard to make change. The students who went to the residential schools didnt know about their culture anymore. They didnt feel like they belonged anywhere. They also had to deal with a lot of racism. Elijah was starting to feel powerless. But his chance to make a difference was just around the corner. In Ottawa, the prime minister of Canada wanted to pass a bill, or a suggested law. The bill was supposed to help the country stay united. It said that Canada was created by the English and the French. It protected French language and culture. But it didnt say anything about the role of First Nations people in building Canada. It did nothing to protect First Nations cultures or languages. The prime minister needed all of the MLAs in Manitoba to agree to the bill to make it a law. But when it was Elijahs turn to vote, he held up an eagle feather and spoke the word, No. He felt that Canada had a duty to protect First Nations language and culture too. With that, the prime ministers bill did not pass. A picture of Elijah holding an eagle feather was soon on the front page of newspapers across the country. It was a moment that put First Nations issues front and centre in Canadian politics. If the country wanted to stay united, First Nations rights couldnt be ignored. Elijah Harper inspired a new wave of First Nations people to take part in politics. He paved the way for a new generation of indigenous people to fight for their rights with protests like Idle No More. The Idle No More protest movement was just beginning when he died in 2013. The eagle feather that was laid to rest the day he died has been picked up once more.",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/elijah-harper,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-peter/The-Story-of-Elijah-Harper.mp3}
"Joy Kogawa remembers her childhood home in Vancouver fondly. The house always had the smell of wood burning in the fireplace. The walls were covered with paintings, photos, and bookcases. The sounds of music, storytelling and laughter sailed through the air. Her bedroom had toy boxes filled with cars, dolls, and games. A cherry tree stood in the yard outside her window. But her happy days there were cut short. In 1941, a warplane from Japan dropped a bomb on the United States. Canada went to war with Japan. The prime minister of Canada thought that Japanese Canadians might be spies. So he had all Japanese Canadians taken from their homes. They were sent to live and work in camps. To pay for the camps, their homes and belongings were sold. Most of the people sent to the camps were born in Canada. Half of them were under the age of 19. Both the RCMP and the military agreed the prime ministers decision did not make sense. But the prime minister did it anyway. He wanted Canada to be mostly for white people. He hoped the Japanese Canadians would just go back to Japan. Joy Kogawa was just six years old when her family was forced from their home. They were put on a train and shipped to a camp in Slocan, British Columbia. The family had to live in a one-room shack. It was a heat trap in the summer and an ice box in the winter. Her family was forced to work on a farm. Joy had to work alongside them in the beet fields – often instead of going to school. She dreamed of going back to her home in Vancouver. After the war, Joy did not want to be thought of as Japanese. She thought of herself as a white person. It was a way of trying to forget the painful past. One day, Joy came across some letters. They were written by a Japanese Canadian woman from Vancouver and sent to her brother in Toronto. The letters were about how terrible it was to live in a time of so much racism. The writer called for justice. These letters gave Joy an idea. She decided to write a story based on what had happened to her family. She wrote a book called Obasan. As she wrote it, she began to accept herself as Japanese Canadian. And she began to want justice, too. Joy began to work for justice for the Japanese Canadians who had been put in camps. She worked with others to hold meetings, write letters, and organize rallies. Her book, Obasan, helped people across Canada to understand the terrible things that had happened. Finally, in 1988, the federal government said it was sorry for what had happened. It paid back part of what had been taken from Japanese Canadians. It promised to work to make sure such a terrible injustice never happens again. In 2005, Joys childhood house in Vancouver was going to be torn down. Joy helped raise enough money to buy it back. To this day, the house still stands as a reminder of the injustice of racism and war. If we remember our past, we can avoid making the same mistakes in the future.",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/joy-kogawa,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-peter/The-Story-of-Joy-Kogawa.mp3}
"A baby boy named Gabor lay crying in his crib. No matter what his mother did, he would not stop crying. So his mother called the doctor. The doctor told her that all of the Jewish babies he knew were crying. This was in Hungary during World War II. The Nazis had taken over the country. They were doing terrible things to Jews. Gabors family was Jewish. The Nazis had just killed Gabors grandparents. Gabors dad was forced to do hard work every day for the Nazis. Gabors aunt was missing. Gabor was only a baby, so he could not have known these things. But he could probably feel his mothers deep sadness and stress. So he cried and cried. The doctor could not really help. Today, Gabor Maté lives in Vancouver. He still struggles to feel at peace. He goes shopping to feel better. He spends lots of money on music records. His wife gets mad at him. They cannot afford for Gabor to keep buying new records. There is no space in their house for more records. But he cant stop. Gabor has developed an addiction to shopping. An addiction is a strong and harmful need to do something. Gabor is now a doctor, and he works with people who have drug addictions. People who have drug addictions face a lot of judgment. They often get blamed for their addiction. Gabor thinks that this is wrong. He says the addiction is usually the result of a stressful childhood. People with addictions have lived through trauma, such as violence or loss. Yet, the government treats them like criminals. They are put in jail because drug use is illegal. This does nothing to help them get better. Is there a better way? Gabor calls on everyone to treat people with addictions with compassion. He writes books, gives speeches, and goes on talk shows to spread this message. He says we must stop judging people for the ways they cope with their difficult lives. We must make a world where people can get their needs met and everyone is treated with respect. If we lived in this kind of world, more children would grow up healthy. Fewer people would need to do drugs to cope. We have not built this kind of world yet. Until we have, Gabor works to reduce the harm done by addiction. He keeps people with addictions alive – and as healthy as possible. British Columbia is a worldwide leader in this approach. For example, B.C. is home to a place called Insite. Drug users can get clean needles from Insite. They can also do drugs at Insite. If they overdose, a nurse will make sure they do not die. There is no other place like it in North America. When the government tried to close Insite, Gabor was one of many people who spoke out. Today, Insites doors are still open and it continues to save hundreds of lives.  But as a doctor, Gabor Maté is not just saving lives. He is helping to build a world where every life is worth living.",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/gabor-mate,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-peter/The-Story-of-Gabor-Mate.mp3}
"In 1882, a nine-year-old girl from the Prairies was at a community picnic. The summer sun was high in the sky. People sat on tablecloths spread over the green grass. They ate sandwiches and watermelon. They drank tea and lemonade. And the boys were lining up for a race. The nine-year-old girl wanted to run in that race. But she was told that races were for boys only. It was not nice for girls to run. Their skirts might fly up and their legs might show. A fire was lit inside her that day. One day, she would see to it that women could do the same things that men could do – like vote. Her name was Nellie McClung. Running in races wasnt the only thing girls werent allowed to do. Back then, it was illegal for women to vote, be in government, own property, or go to university. This is because men were thought to be more reasonable than women. Only men were reasonable enough to take part in the world of government and business. Women were seen as emotional. This made them more fit for the world of homemaking and childcare. When Nellie grew up, she poked holes in these old ideas. She spoke to large crowds in favour of womens right to vote. Some Canadians worried that womens rights would lead to the breakdown of the family. With a colourful hat on her head and a charming sense of humour, Nellie changed hearts and minds. Womens rights activists in Europe and America often used violence to get their point across. Nellie used humour, instead. She starred in a play where she debated mens right to vote. She began by telling the men how nice they looked. Then she pointed out that most of the people in prison were men, and men made up only a small number of the people who went to church. How could these people be trusted with politics? Big crowds came to see Nellies play. They roared with laughter. It became fashionable to support womens rights.  White women were finally allowed to vote in federal elections in 1918. As a result of racist laws, women of colour and Aboriginal women would not be allowed to vote until much later.  In 1921, Nellie served as one of the first female MLAs in the government of Alberta. It was often said that womens involvement in politics would lead to divorce. Nellie and her husband Wes proved those claims wrong. Wes was proud of his wife. I dont mind being Mr. Nellie McClung, hed say with a smile. One day, Nellies friend Emily Murphy invited some friends to her house for tea. They talked about how unfair it was that women were not allowed to sit in the Senate. This is because women were not seen as persons in the eyes of the law. The women decided to take the matter to court. After a long battle, they won the case in 1929 – but Nellie wasnt finished. The end is not yet! she said. Even though women had won many legal rights, they were still not treated as equal to men. This was especially true of women of colour. Unlike most womens rights activists of her time, Nellie called for an end to racism.  Even as she grew older and her health declined, she kept writing and speaking for equal rights. Nellie said, Because Ive got a bad heart, my doctor has told me not to write. I assume he meant books, so I keep busy on letters, editorials, and messages. If she hadnt died in 1951, she would probably still be fighting for womens rights today.",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/nellie-mcclung,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-peter/The-Story-of-Nellie-McClung.mp3}
"There are people who say the most amazing structure on earth is the human brain. It is so complex that it took about 700 million years to develop. Humans started out as wormlike creatures that used one end of the body to move forward. Ever so slowly, a bunch of nerves began developing at that one end — the head. These nerves helped the creature to sense light, food and danger. Eventually, this bunch of nerves became the creatures brain. To carry messages from the brain to other parts of the body, the creature grew a spinal cord. Later, the creature became a fish with eyes, ears and a nose that could send the brain information about sights, sounds and smells.More time passed, and the fish grew arms and legs so it could move about on land. For this, it needed a larger and more complex brain. It became an ape-like creature, and the parts of the brain used for seeing images and being social grew much stronger. Finally, the ape-like creature became human, with a brain that was capable of reason, emotion, creativity, memory and the ability to judge right from wrong.The human brain is very mysterious. Many questions about the brain have not yet been answered. For example, why do we need to sleep or why do we dream? There is a lot about the brain that we do not yet understand. Believe it or not, people used to think of the brain as useless stuffing. Of course, we now know the brain is our control centre. The surface of the brain is called the cerebral cortex. It is the part of the brain that makes us intelligent, and it consists of four parts called lobes. The front lobe is where much of our thinking and feeling happens. The top lobe processes information which is coming from parts of our bodies, such as our skin and muscles. The side lobe plays an important role in hearing, speech and long-term memories while the back lobe processes images from our eyes.Which do you think is more powerful: your brain or a supercomputer? You might be surprised to learn that the worlds best supercomputer is only about as powerful as half a mouse brain! Your brain is packed with 100 billion brain cells called neurons. They send information to your body telling it what to do, and they receive information from each of your senses, what you see, feel, taste, hear and touch. All of this information travels to and from parts of your body along your spinal cord, which is like a highway found down the centre of your back. As the information travels from neuron to neuron, pathways are created. When you think about or practice something again and again, those pathways get stronger. Thats how the brain learns and remembers. Actually, you were born with most of the neurons you have now, but when you were a baby, you didnt have many pathways to connect them. As an adult, you now have more than 125 trillion connections between your neurons. No computer on earth can compete with the speed of your brain and how much information it can hold.",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/most-amazing-structure1,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-cam/The-Most-Amazing-Structure-on-Earth.mp3}
"Many different factors affect how well we learn. While we cant control all of these factors, there are many that we can. For example, fuel for our brain comes from calories in the food we eat. In fact, 20% of the calories we eat are used by our brain. Although not all calories help the brain, research suggests that some foods, such as egg yolk, whole grains, nuts, fish, dark leafy green vegetables, beans, strawberries and blueberries might be especially good for concentration and memory.Drinking enough water is also important. The brain is more than 70% water. If we dont drink enough water, it affects our concentration. We need around six to eight glasses of non-sugary, non-alcoholic fluid each day. Moreover, studies suggest that the brain does not do well with sudden rushes of sugar, so sweet, fizzy drinks do not help the brain either.Remember also the importance of oxygen, which is carried to the brain by your blood. When you move your body, your blood flow increases and your brain gets more oxygen. Going for a walk, running, or riding a bike really help get oxygen to the brain, as do stretching and breathing deeply.Besides exercise, rest is important. Getting enough rest boosts our mood and helps us concentrate. Whats more, when we are asleep, the brain practices what we did during the day. We actually learn in our sleep. If you have a hard time falling asleep, try listening to gentle music, thinking positive thoughts, or reading something funny to relax. Avoid video games and exciting TV shows in the hour before bedtime.Stress can also stop the brain from working at its best. Some people fight stress by imagining a beautiful box. When its time to concentrate on something, they imagine filling that box with all the things that give them stress. Then they imagine putting that box away until they have time to deal with whatever is inside.Dont forget that your brain gets information from your senses. Therefore, your brain will have an easier time focusing and remembering when vision, hearing, smell, touch and taste are involved. Use your vision to help you learn by imagining what you read – like a movie in your mind. This is called visualizing. Underline or highlight important information in a text with a yellow marker and use different colours when you take notes. Make charts, mind maps, flashcards, diagrams, or draw pictures. Use your hearing to help you learn by reading out loud or explaining the new information to someone else. Use your sense of taste by chewing gum while you learn.Yet another way to boost your brainpower is to create an environment where you work well. Many people, for instance, work better in light from a window. Temperature can also make a difference. A room that is too warm might make you feel sleepy. Lots of people find it easier to concentrate in rooms that are tidy. Some people find it helpful to listen to music when they study while others prefer silence. Get rid of any distractions, whatever they may be. For example, turn off your cell phone and let people in your home know that you need to be left alone.",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/boost-your-brainpower1,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': }
"The human brain remembers negative experiences more easily than positive ones. Our brains have developed this way because threats, like dangerous animals, had a more immediate effect on our ancestors survival compared to positive things like food or shelter. As a result, you likely know what makes you unhappy, but do you know what makes you happy?Research suggests that our level of happiness depends partly on factors we cannot control – our genes and our life circumstances. But our level of happiness is also shaped by the choices we make. If youve been chasing wealth, fame, good looks, material things, and power, you may be looking for happiness in all the wrong places. Psychologists suggest that the following seven habits make people happier.People who form close relationships tend to be happier than those who do not. The number of friends we have is not important. What matters is the quality of our relationships. Relationships that bring happiness usually involve the sharing of feelings, mutual respect, acceptance, trust, fun and empathy.People who make a habit of caring for the wellbeing of others tend to be happier. This might involve volunteering for an organization or reaching out to support friends and family on a regular basis.People who exercise regularly improve both their physical and mental well-being. Some research has shown that exercise can be as effective as medication in treating depression.When we are so interested in an activity we enjoy that we lose track of time, we are in a state of flow. The activity could be making art, playing piano, surfing, or playing a game. People who experience flow in their work or hobbies tend to be happier.People who include spirituality in their daily life tend to be happier. Practicing spirituality is a way of recognizing and trying to understand the wonder and beauty of existence. Some people do this by going to a place of worship or praying. Some people practice yoga or meditation. Some people go for long walks in nature.People are more likely to be happy if they know what their strengths are and use them regularly. People who set goals and use their strengths to achieve them tend to be happier. People are especially happy when they can use their strengths to serve the greater good.People who think positively by being grateful, mindful, and optimistic are more likely to be happy. Being grateful means being thankful. Being mindful means being open to, focusing on, and enjoying the experiences of the present moment. Being optimistic means being hopeful about the future.",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/happy-brain1,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-cam/Secrets-of-a-Happy-Brain.mp3}
"Dave Farrow is a Canadian who appears in the Guinness Book of World Records for having the greatest memory. As a student, Dave had a learning disability called dyslexia. Despite his struggles with subjects like reading and writing, Dave found ways to improve his memory in order to do well in school. In 2008, he set a world record by memorizing the order of 59 decks of playing cards in two days. How did his brain store all of this information? According to Dave, anybodys brain can do it, but it helps to understand how memory works.Your brain is constantly taking in information through your senses. The information enters your sensory memory, which has the capacity to hold lots of information, but only for a few seconds. If you ignore the information, your brain will discard it. However, if you pay attention to it, the information goes into your short-term memory. This is why learning to pay attention is an important first step to improving your ability to recall what you learn.To help the brain focus, Dave recommends breaking big tasks down into smaller ones. He sets a timer and works as hard as he can for short periods of time until the timer alarm sounds. Then he takes a small break. This keeps his focus strong.Your short-term memory can only hold information from 15 seconds to a few minutes. In addition, short-term memory can only hold about seven things at one time. Memory champions like Dave have to hold long lists of information in their short-term memory at one time. To do this, they rely on different tricks.One trick is to look at the first letter of every word you want to memorize. Then, create your own word, phrase or sentence using all of those letters. This is called an acronym. For example, if you want to remember all the colours in a rainbow, try remembering the name Roy G. Biv. Each letter in this fictional name matches the first letter of a colour: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. When you want to remember the colours of a rainbow, just think of Roy G. Biv and you will have an easier time.Another trick is to organize information into chunks. For example, when you try to remember a telephone number, your brain usually remembers it in chunks. You remember the area code as one chunk, the next three numbers as a chunk, and the last four numbers as a chunk. This way, your brain only has to remember three things instead of ten. This works for words as well as numbers. Imagine that you wish to improve your vocabulary. Whenever you learn a new word, study words that share the same meaning. This way, you learn several new words at the same time and you only need to memorize one definition. Such words are called synonyms. For example, synonyms for the word big are huge, enormous, gigantic, large and massive.A third memory trick is to use visualization. Say you wanted to memorize how people developed from wormlike creatures into human beings. First, create a picture in your mind for each stage (picture a worm, a fish, a monkey and a human). Then think of a path you regularly walk along. For example, you might normally walk from the path outside your home, into your house and into the kitchen. Finally, imagine each picture in a place along that path. For instance, in the garden you might see a worm. There might be a garbage can in the garden. You can imagine that the garbage can is full of rainwater and inside you can see a fish. When you enter the house you might see a bedroom door. You can imagine a monkey is jumping on the bed. Then you might see a member of your family, a human, cooking dinner. Visualize that path a few times and youll have the information memorized. Visualization works because the brain remembers images well, and the wackier an image is, the easier it is to remember.If you dont keep using the information, your brain throws it away. If you keep reviewing the information, it will go into your long-term memory. The more you practice recalling the information, the better you will be at remembering it. Try these tips the next time you need to remember a phone number, a new word or something for school.",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/memory-magic1,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-cam/Memory-Magic.mp3}
"Some students bring good luck charms to school on test days. They might keep a four-leaf clover in their pocket or wear a pair of lucky underwear. While these things cant hurt, there are better ways of doing well on a test.Writing a test is like running a marathon. Both activities require you to do your best for a long time. There are a couple of strategies you can use to stay relaxed, focused and motivated for the whole test.Runners train before a big race. They practice their skills in the same conditions they will face in the marathon. You can train for a test in a similar way. For a reading test, there may be comprehension questions on vocabulary, main idea, details, cause and effect, sequence and inferences. You may also be asked to summarize the text. For a writing test, you will likely be asked to write a paragraph about a given topic. The topics will often involve describing something, explaining how to do something, telling a story about something, or giving your opinion about something. The goal of a test is usually to independently apply the skills you have learned and practiced in class.Just like before a big race, it is a good idea to take care of your basic needs before the test begins. For example, get plenty of sleep the night before. During the day of the test, get enough to eat. Go to the bathroom ahead of time. These things will help you focus.When you get the test, dont forget to put your name on it. Then, take a quick look at each page. A long test may have different sections. Notice how many marks each section is worth. Like a runner, you will want to be careful about your pace. If you have a limited amount of time to complete the test, you will want to leave yourself enough time for the sections that are worth the most marks.Now you are ready to begin answering the questions. Read the instructions and questions very carefully. Make sure you understand what you are being asked to do. If you do not understand a question, ask your instructor. If you feel nervous, you may want to build your confidence by starting with the questions that are easiest for you.Some runners use positive self-talk when they are struggling. They tell themselves things like, I feel good about myself and my abilities. I am not going to worry. I will do the best that I can. Give this strategy a try. You can also take short brain breaks between sections to take some deep breaths, roll your neck and shoulders, and massage your temples.During a reading test, it can help to do a quick pre-reading exercise you have been taught, even if it is not part of the instructions. For example, try scanning the text to figure out the topic before you read the whole thing more carefully. Then think about what you already know about the topic. Predict the details that might be in the reading. For a writing test, pre-writing is a very important first step. Brainstorm your ideas and organize them before you start writing. Some students skip these two things, but they probably shouldnt. These activities warm up your brain so that it will work more efficiently.Before you hand in your test, review your answers. Unlike a marathon, it doesnt matter who finishes first during a test. Check your grammar and spelling. Make sure your instructor will be able to read your handwriting. Finally, be sure that you answered every question.Follow these tips and, if your lucky underwear doesnt work, you will have a solid back-up plan in place.",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/put-to-the-test1,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-cam/Put-To-The-Test.mp3}
"It was a cold night in September. The rain was drumming on the car roof as George and Marie Winston drove through the empty country roads towards the house of their friends, the Harrisons, where they were going to attend a party to celebrate the engagement of the Harrisons' daughter, Lisa. As they drove, they listened to the local radio station, which was playing classical music.      They were about five miles from their destination when the music on the radio was interrupted by a news announcement:      ""The Cheshire police have issued a serious warning after a man escaped from Colford Mental Hospital earlier this evening. The man, John Downey, is a murderer who killed six people before he was captured two years ago. He is described as large, very strong and extremely dangerous. People in the Cheshire area are warned to keep their doors and windows locked, and to call the police immediately if they see anyone acting strangely.""      Marie shivered. ""A crazy killer. And he's out there somewhere. That's scary.""      ""Don't worry about it,"" said her husband. ""We're nearly there now. Anyway, we have more important things to worry about. This car is losing power for some reason -- it must be that old problem with the carburetor. If it gets any worse, we'll have to stay at the Harrisons' tonight and get it fixed before we travel back tomorrow.""      As he spoke, the car began to slow down. George pressed the accelerator, but the engine only coughed. Finally they rolled to a halt, as the engine died completely. Just as they stopped, George pulled the car off the road, and it came to rest under a large tree.      ""Blast!"" said George angrily. ""Now we'll have to walk in the rain.""      ""But that'll take us an hour at least,"" said Marie. ""And I have my high-heeled shoes and my nice clothes on. They'll be ruined!""      ""Well, you'll have to wait while I run to the nearest house and call the Harrisons. Someone can come out and pick us up,"" said George.      ""But George! Have you forgotten what the radio said? There's a homicidal maniac out there! You can't leave me here alone!""      ""You'll have to hide in the back of the car. Lock all the doors and lie on the floor in the back, under this blanket. No one will see you. When I come back, I'll knock three times on the door. Then you can get up and open it. Don't open it unless you hear three knocks."" George opened the door and slipped out into the rain. He quickly disappeared into the blackness.      Marie quickly locked the doors and settled down under the blanket in the back for a long wait. She was frightened and worried, but she was a strong-minded woman. She had not been waiting long, however, when she heard a strange scratching noise. It seemed to be coming from the roof of the car.      Marie was terrified. She listened, holding her breath. Then she heard three slow knocks, one after the other, also on the roof of the car. Was it her husband? Should she open the door? Then she heard another knock, and another. This was not her husband. It was somebody — or something — else. She was shaking with fear, but she forced herself to lie still. The knocking continued — bump, bump, bump, bump.      Many hours later, as the sun rose, she was still lying there. She had not slept for a moment. The knocking had never stopped, all night long. She did not know what to do. Where was George? Why had he not come for her?      Suddenly, she heard the sound of three or four vehicles, racing quickly down the road. All of them pulled up around her, their tires screeching on the road. At last! Someone had come! Marie sat up quickly and looked out of the window.      The three vehicles were all police cars, and two still had their lights flashing. Several policemen leaped out. One of them rushed towards the car as Marie opened the door. He took her by the hand.      ""Get out of the car and walk with me to the police vehicle, Miss. You're safe now. Look straight ahead. Keep looking at the police car. Don't look back. Just don't look back.""      Something in the way he spoke filled Marie with cold horror. She could not help herself. About ten yards from the police car, she stopped, turned and looked back at the empty vehicle.      George was hanging from the tree above the car, a rope tied around his neck. As the wind blew his body back and forth, his feet were bumping gently on the roof of the car — bump, bump, bump, bump.",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/deathcar,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-peter/the-death-car.mp3}
"""Come on, come on, move it, idiot!""      Joanne beat impatiently on the steering wheel of her Mercedes sports car. How stupid to get caught up in the rush hour! She had planned to leave work early this afternoon, at three o'clock, to give herself a chance to relax and have a bath before going out to a meeting of her local tennis club. But just at ten to three a client had arrived, and it was two hours before she had finished dealing with the man. When she came out of her office, all the other staff in the Highlight Advertising Agency had already left. Now she was stuck in a traffic jam in central Birmingham at 5:30, and at 6:30 she was expected to be chairing a meeting of the tennis club. There would be no time for any hot bath.      Ahead of her, the traffic was moving at last, and she swung quickly out into the centre lane to turn right, and raced the last half-mile through the quiet suburban streets to her house. Pulling up on the driveway, she leapt out of the car and ran for the house. As she opened the door, she nearly tripped over Sheba, who was standing behind it.      ""Hey, Sheba, hello,"" she said, bending down to stroke the large alsatian dog's head, ""I've got no time for you now, but I'll take you out as soon as I get back from the tennis club.""      It was then that she noticed something worrying about the dog. Sheba seemed to be coughing or choking, her stomach pumping repeatedly as if she was trying to vomit something up. She was obviously in real discomfort and could hardly breathe; her sad eyes gazed up at Joanne helplessly.      ""Oh damn, this is all I need now,"" said Joanne to herself, dropping her briefcase and bending down to take a closer look, ""a sick dog, today of all days!"" On closer examination, Sheba did look very sick, and Joanne realised she would have to take her down to the vet immediately. Luckily, the vet's surgery was only a few streets away, and Joanne quickly loaded the dog, still coughing and choking, into her car for the short drive.      When she got there, the surgery was just about to close for the day. Luckily, Dr. Sterne had not left yet, and when he saw the state of Sheba, he brought her quickly into his office.      ""It looks like something is stuck in her throat,"" said Dr. Sterne. It shouldn't take me too long to get it out.""    ""Listen, doctor, I'm really in a rush to get to a meeting -- can I leave her with you, and go and get changed? I'll be back in ten minutes to pick her up, then I'll take her on to the meeting with me. Is that OK?""      ""Sure,"" said the doctor. ""You get going. I'll see you in ten minutes.""      Joanne jumped back into her car again, and made the quick trip round to her house in a couple of minutes. As she was once more entering the hallway, the phone on the table by the door began to ring. She picked it up, annoyed by this additional interruption to her plans.      ""This is Dr. Sterne,"" said an anxious voice. ""Is that you, Joanne?""      	""Of course it's me,"" said Joanne, surprised at the sound of his voice, ""no-one else lives here.""      	""I want you to get right out of that house immediately,"" said the doctor's voice. ""Right now. I'm coming round right away, and the police will be there any time now. Wait outside for us."" The phone went dead. Joanne stared at it. She was confused, but she was also a little frightened by the obvious fear in the voice of the doctor. She replaced the receiver, then quickly backed out of the door and ran into the street.      At that moment, a police car with its lights flashing swung round the corner and screeched to a stop outside the house. Two policemen got out. After briefly checking that she was the owner of the house, they ran into the house through the still open door, without explaining anything. Joanne was by now completely confused and very frightened. Then the doctor arrived.      ""Where's Sheba? Is she OK?"" shouted Joanne, running over to his car.      ""She's fine, Joanne. I extracted the thing which was choking her, and she's OK now.""      ""Well what's this all about? Why are the police in my house?""      Just then, the two policemen reappeared from the house, half-carrying a white-faced figure, a man in a dark grey sweater and jeans, who, it seemed, could hardly walk. There was blood all over him.      ""My God,"" said Joanne, ""how did he get in there? And how did you know he was there?""      ""I think he must be a burglar,"" said the doctor. ""I knew he was there because when I finally removed what was stuck in Sheba's throat, it turned out to be three human fingers. I don't think he's a very happy burglar.""",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/dog,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-peter/the-choking-dog.mp3}
"Eddie was a carpet fitter, and he hated it. For ten years he had spent his days sitting, squatting, kneeling or crawling on floors, in houses, offices, shops, factories and restaurants. Ten years of his life, cutting and fitting carpets for other people to walk on, without even seeing them. When his work was done, no-one ever appreciated it. No- one ever said ""Oh, that's a beautiful job, the carpet fits so neatly."" They just walked all over it. Eddie was sick of it.      He was especially sick of it on this hot, humid day in August, as he worked to put the finishing touches to today's job. He was just cutting and fixing the last edge on a huge red carpet which he had fitted in the living room of Mrs. Vanbrugh's house. Rich Mrs. Vanbrugh, who changed her carpets every year, and always bought the best. Rich Mrs. Vanbrugh, who had never even given him a cup of tea all day, and who made him go outside when he wanted to smoke. Ah well, it was four o'clock and he had nearly finished. At least he would be able to get home early today. He began to day-dream about the weekend, about the Saturday football game he always played for the local team, where he was known as ""Ed the Head"" for his skill in heading goals from corner kicks.      Eddie sat back and sighed. The job was done, and it was time for a last cigarette. He began tapping the pockets of his overalls, looking for the new packet of Marlboro he had bought that morning. They were not there.      It was as he swung around to look in his toolbox for the cigarettes that Eddie saw the lump. Right in the middle of the brand new bright red carpet, there was a lump. A very visible lump. A lump the size of -- the size of a packet of cigarettes.      ""Blast!"" said Eddie angrily. ""I've done it again! I've left the cigarettes under the blasted carpet!""      He had done this once before, and taking up and refitting the carpet had taken him two hours. Eddie was determined that he was not going to spend another two hours in this house. He decided to get rid of the lump another way. It would mean wasting a good packet of cigarettes, nearly full, but anything was better than taking up the whole carpet and fitting it again. He turned to his toolbox for a large hammer.      Holding the hammer, Eddie approached the lump in the carpet. He didn't want to damage the carpet itself, so he took a block of wood and placed it on top of the lump. Then he began to beat the block of wood as hard as he could. He kept beating, hoping Mrs. Vanbrugh wouldn't hear the noise and come to see what he was doing. It would be difficult to explain why he was hammering the middle of her beautiful new carpet.      After three or four minutes, the lump was beginning to flatten out. Eddie imagined the cigarette box breaking up, and the crushed cigarettes spreading out under the carpet. Soon, he judged that the lump was almost invisible. Clearing up his tools, he began to move the furniture back into the living room, and he was careful to place one of the coffee tables over the place where the lump had been, just to make sure that no-one would see the spot where his cigarettes had been lost. Finally, the job was finished, and he called Mrs. Vanbrugh from the dining room to inspect his work.      ""Yes, dear, very nice,"" said the lady, peering around the room briefly. ""You'll be sending me a bill, then?""      ""Yes madam, as soon as I report to the office tomorrow that the job is done."" Eddie picked up his tools, and began to walk out to the van. Mrs. Vanbrugh accompanied him. She seemed a little worried about something.      ""Young man,"" she began, as he climbed into the cab of his van, laying his toolbox on the passenger seat beside him, ""while you were working today, you didn't by any chance see any sign of Armand, did you? Armand is my parakeet. A beautiful bird, just beautiful, such colors in his feathers... I let him out of his cage, you see, this morning, and he's disappeared. He likes to walk around the house, and he's so good, he usually just comes back to his cage after an hour or so and gets right in. Only today he didn't come back. He's never done such a thing before, it's most peculiar...""      ""No, madam, I haven't seen him anywhere,"" said Eddie, as he reached to start the van.      And saw his packet of Marlboro cigarettes on the dashboard, where he had left it at lunchtime....      And remembered the lump in the carpet....      And realised what the lump was....      And remembered the hammering....      And began to feel rather sick....",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/fitter,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-peter/the-carpet-fitter.mp3}
"As Andrea turned off the motorway onto the road to Brockbourne, the small village in which she lived, it was four o'clock in the afternoon, but already the sun was falling behind the hills. At this time in December, it would be completely dark by five o'clock. Andrea shivered. The interior of the car was not cold, but the trees bending in the harsh wind and the patches of yesterday's snow still heaped in the fields made her feel chilly inside. It was another ten miles to the cottage where she lived with her husband Michael, and the dim light and wintry weather made her feel a little lonely. She would have liked to listen to the radio, but it had been stolen from her car when it was parked outside her office in London about two weeks ago, and she had not got around to replacing it yet.      She was just coming out of the little village of Mickley when she saw the old lady, standing by the road, with a crude hand-written sign saying ""Brockbourne"" in her hand. Andrea was surprised. She had never seen an old lady hitchhiking before. However, the weather and the coming darkness made her feel sorry for the lady, waiting hopefully on a country road like this with little traffic. Normally, Andrea would never pick up a hitchhiker when she was alone, thinking it was too dangerous, but what was the harm in doing a favor for a little old lady like this? Andrea pulled up a little way down the road, and the lady, holding a big shopping bag, hurried over to climb in the door which Andrea had opened for her.      When she did get in, Andrea could see that she was not, in fact, so little. Broad and fat, the old lady had some difficulty climbing in through the car door, with her big bag, and when she had got in, she more than filled the seat next to Andrea. She wore a long, shabby old dress, and she had a yellow hat pulled down low over her eyes. Panting noisily from her effort, she pushed her big brown canvas shopping bag down onto the floor under her feet, and said in a voice which was almost a whisper, ""Thank you dearie -- I'm just going to Brockbourne.""      ""Do you live there?"" asked Andrea, thinking that she had never seen the old lady in the village in the four years she had lived there herself.      ""No, dearie,"" answered the passenger, in her soft voice, ""I'm just going to visit a friend. He was supposed to meet me back there at Mickley, but his car won't start, so I decided to hitchhike -- there isn't a bus until seven, and I didn't want to wait. I knew some kind soul would give me a lift.""      Something in the way the lady spoke, and the way she never turned her head, but stared continuously into the darkness ahead from under her old yellow hat, made Andrea uneasy about this strange hitchhiker. She didn't know why, but she felt instinctively that there was something wrong, something odd, something....dangerous. But how could an old lady be dangerous? it was absurd.      Careful not to turn her head, Andrea looked sideways at her passenger. She studied the hat, the dirty collar of the dress, the shapeless body, the arms with their thick black hairs....           	Thick black hairs?      	Hairy arms? Andrea's blood froze.      	This wasn't a woman. It was a man.      	At first, she didn't know what to do. Then suddenly, an idea came into her racing, terrified brain. Swinging the wheel suddenly, she threw the car into a skid, and brought it to a halt.      ""My God!"" she shouted, ""A child! Did you see the child? I think I hit her!""      The ""old lady"" was clearly shaken by the sudden skid. ""I didn't see anything dearie,"" she said. ""I don't think you hit anything.""      ""I'm sure it was a child!"" insisted Andrea. ""Could you just get out and have a look? Just see if there's anything on the road?"" She held her breath. Would her plan work?      It did. The passenger slowly opened the car door, leaving her bag inside, and climbed out to investigate. As soon as she was out of the vehicle, Andrea gunned the engine and accelerated madly away. The car door swung shut as she rounded a bend, and soon she had put a good three miles between herself and the awful hitchhiker.      It was only then that she thought about the bag lying on the floor in front of her. Maybe the bag would provide some information about the real identity about the old woman who was not an old woman. Pulling into the side of the road, Andrea lifted the heavy bag onto her lap and opened it curiously.      It contained only one item -- a small hand axe, with a razor-sharp blade. The axe, and the inside of the bag, were covered with the dark red stains of dried blood.      Andrea began to scream.",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/hiker,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-peter/the-hitchhiker.mp3}
"""Mummy! Mummy!"" shouted little Murna racing from the front door through to the kitchen. ""There's a parcel. The postman's brought a parcel!""      	Her mother, Savni, looked at her in surprise. She had no idea who could have sent them a parcel. Maybe it was a mistake. She hurried to the door to find out. Sure enough, the postman was there, holding a parcel about the size of a small brick.      	""From America, madam,"" he said. ""See! American stamps.""      	It was true. In the top right-hand corner of the brown paper parcel were three strange-looking stamps, showing a man's head. The package was addressed to Savni, in big, clear black letters.      	""Well, I suppose it must be from Great-Aunt Pasni,"" said Savni to herself, as the postman went on his way down the street, whistling. ""Although it must be twenty years since we heard anything from her. I thought she would have been dead by now.""      	Savni's husband Jornas and her son Arinas were just coming in from the garden, where Murna had run to tell them about the parcel. ""Well, open it then!"" said Arinas impatiently. ""Let's see what's inside!""      	Setting the parcel down in the middle of the table, Savni carefully began to tear open the paper. Inside, there was a large silver container with a hinged lid, which was taped shut. There was also a letter.      	""What is it? What is it?"" demanded Murna impatiently. ""Is it a present?""      	""I have no idea,"" said Savni in confusion. ""I think it must be from Great-Aunt Pasni. She went to America almost thirty years ago now. But we haven't heard from her in twenty years. Perhaps the letter will tell us."" She opened the folded page cautiously, then looked up in dismay. ""Well, this is no help!"" she said in annoyance. ""It's written in English! How does she expect us to read English? We're poor people, we have no education. Maybe Pasni has forgotten her native language, after thirty years in America.""      	""Well, open the pot, anyway,"" said Jornas. ""Let's see what's inside.""      	Cautiously, Savni pulled the tape from the neck of the silver pot, and opened the lid. Four heads touched over the top of the container, as their owners stared down inside.      	""Strange,"" said Arinas. ""All I see is powder."" The pot was about one-third full of a kind of light-grey powder.      	""What is it?"" asked Murna, mystified.      	""We don't know, darling,"" said Savni, stroking her daughter's hair. ""What do you think?"" Murna stared again into the pot.      	""I think it's coffee,"" she announced, finally. ""American coffee.""      	""It's the wrong colour for coffee, darling,"" said Jornas thoughtfully. ""But maybe she's on the right track. It must be some kind of food."" Murna, by now, had her nose right down into the pot. Suddenly, she lifted her head and sneezed loudly.      	""Id god ub by doze,"" she explained.      	""That's it!"" said Arinas. ""It must be pepper! Let me try some."" Dipping a finger into the powder, he licked it. ""Yes,"" he said, ""it's pepper all right. Mild, but quite tasty. It's American pepper.""      	""All right,"" said Savni, ""we'll try it on the stew tonight. We'll have American-style stew!""      	That evening, the whole family agreed that the American pepper had added a special extra taste to their usual evening stew. They were delighted with it. By the end of the week, there was only a teaspoonful of the grey powder left in the silver container. Then Savni called a halt.      	""We're saving the last bit for Sunday. Dr. Haret is coming to dinner, and we'll let him have some as a special treat. Then it will be finished.""      	The following Sunday, the whole family put on their best clothes, ready for dinner with Dr. Haret. He was the local doctor, and he had become a friend of the family many years before, when he had saved Arinas's life after an accident. Once every couple of months, Savni invited the doctor for dinner, and they all looked forward to his entertaining stories of his youth at the university in the capital.      	During dinner, Savni explained to the doctor about the mysterious American pepper, the last of which she had put in the stew they were eating, and the letter they could not read.      	""Well, give it to me, give it to me!"" said the doctor briskly. ""I speak English! I can translate it for you.""      	Savni brought the letter, and the family waited, fascinated, as the doctor began to translate.      	""Dear Savni: you don't know me, but I am the son of your old Great-Aunt Pasni. She never talked much to us about the old country, but in her final illness earlier this year, she told us that after her death, she wanted her ashes to be sent back home to you, so that you could scatter them on the hills of the country where she was born. My mother died two weeks ago, and her funeral and cremation took place last week. I am sending her ashes to you in a silver casket. Please do as she asked, and spread them over the ground near where she was born. Your cousin, George Leary.""",B1,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/reading/pepper,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/410-stories-peter/the-american-pepper.mp3}
"Brendan's best friend is Tip. Tip and Brendan are inseparable. They teach each other things and they look after each other. Tip has helped Brendan become more responsible, more caring, and a better friend. Brendan is a nine-year-old boy, and Tip is a ten-year-old dog. Brendan and Tip are an example of how owning a dog can have a positive effect on a child's development. Having a dog develops a child's sense of responsibility, broadens his capacity for empathy, and teaches the nature of friendship.Having a dog helps a child learn how to act responsibly. As a dog owner, the child must take care of the animal's daily needs. The dog must be fed and exercised every day. A dog is completely dependent on its owner for all its needs, including the need for good health and a safe environment. Therefore, being responsible for a dog also means taking care of the dog so that it stays healthy. Furthermore, the owner must take responsibility for the safety of the dog and the safety of the people it comes into contact with. If the child forgets any of these duties and responsibilities, or ignores any of the dog's needs, the dog will suffer. This teaches the child that his responsibility to the dog is more important than his desire to play with his toys, talk on the phone, or watch TV. This is true not only for the care of a dog, but also for the care of oneself, another person, or one's job. Learning how to take responsibility for the health and welfare of a dog leads to learning how to take responsibility for oneself.Another lesson that a child can learn from having a dog is how to be empathetic. Empathy is the ability to put oneself in another person's, or in this case another creature's, situation and imagine that person's or creature's feelings or problems. A dog cannot express itself with speech, so its owner must learn how to interpret its behaviour. The child must learn to understand what the dog's behaviour means. Is the dog frightened, aggressive, or sick? The child needs to understand what is going on in the dog's mind. Understanding a situation from the dog's perspective helps the child understand why the dog is behaving in a certain way and what the dog needs. The result of learning to read a dog's behaviour is that the child develops empathy. By learning how to empathize with a dog, the child also learns how to empathize with other people. This leads to the child becoming a more considerate and caring person.Being considerate and caring are important characteristics in a good friend. One of the most significant benefits of owning a dog is the example of true friendship that a dog provides. A dog gives unconditional love to its owner. A dog will not stop loving its owner because of a little anger, indifference, or neglect. The dog will wait patiently for its owner to pat its head and say a few kind words. This acceptance of the negative qualities and appreciation for the positive qualities of its owner provide a wonderful model of how to be a good friend. A child soon realizes that his dog will always listen to him, will always be ready to play with him, will always protect him, and will always forgive him. A child who has learned to be even half as good a friend to others as his dog is to him will have learned one of the most valuable lessons in life.These are some of the most important lessons a child will ever learn. The benefits of owning a dog will last the child's entire lifetime. The understanding and appreciation of responsibility, empathy, and friendship that a child develops from the experience of having a dog will help him or her grow into a reliable, caring, and mature adult.",B2,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/490/reading/dog2-reading,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/490-stories-cam/The-Positive-Effects-on-Children-of-Owning-a-Dog.mp3}
"Do you believe that a kilogram of carrots could cost $10,000? My carrots cost me that much last year. Last summer I had to completely renovate my kitchen and it was all because of a bunch of carrots. The story begins with my picking twelve carrots from my vegetable garden and ends with my getting a new kitchen.I have a vegetable garden and every summer I enjoy eating my own vegetables. One day last summer I picked a dozen carrots. Usually, as soon as I have picked the carrots, I clean the dirt off them by rinsing them in a bucket of water. I keep a full bucket of water beside the garden just for this purpose. But this day, as I was getting up from the ground with my twelve carrots, I tripped and fell over the bucket. The water spilled out of the bucket and went all over my feet. I ran into the house to change my shoes and socks. When I was finally dry and clean, I realized that I had very little time to make dinner. The carrots were part of dinner, so I decided to wash the carrots quickly in the kitchen sink. The carrots were covered in a large amount of dirt from the garden. I put the carrots in the sink, rinsed them with water, and watched all the dirt wash away down the drain.The next day, when I was washing dishes, I noticed that the water drained out of the sink much more slowly than usual. It drained so slowly that I went to the store and bought a bottle of special drain cleaner. I used the drain cleaner and the water seemed to drain a little faster. However, the following day the drain worked even more slowly. I spent $100 on different kinds of drain cleaner. None of them worked.Soon the water did not drain at all. At this point I called a plumber to come and fix my drain. The plumber tried a lot of different cleaners and equipment, but nothing worked. He tried to go under the house to check the pipes, but he couldn't reach them. He had to cut a hole in the floor where the drain pipe was in order to try to find the problem. While he was cutting the small hole, he accidentally cut the hot-water pipe. Hot water sprayed over the plumber, onto the floor, behind the counters, under the refrigerator; water went everywhere. Two hours later we finally finished cleaning up all the water. But the water had caused a lot of damage.My refrigerator stopped working because the water had affected the electrical wires. I called an electrician to come and fix the refrigerator. The electrician had to move the refrigerator to work on the wires. In order to move the refrigerator, she had to balance it on an angle and pull it away from the wall. As the electrician was balancing it, she tripped over the plumber's tools. She fell down and the refrigerator tipped over. It crashed into the wall, resulting in a huge hole in the wall.I called a carpenter to come and fix the wall. In order to repair the hole in the wall, the carpenter had to tear down half of the entire wall. When the wall was half gone, the electrician found more electrical problems caused by the water damage. This resulted in the other half of the wall being removed to replace the damaged wiring. Meanwhile, the plumber was still looking for the source of the drain problem. Since the kitchen was in a terrible mess anyway, the plumber decided to remove part of the floor to look at the pipe there. In the middle of the floor, he found the problem: the dirt from the carrots was stuck in the pipe and nothing could go through or past the clump of dirt.Now I had a sink that did not drain, a refrigerator that did not work, a wall that was gone, and part of a floor that was missing. I looked at this disaster and decided that what I really needed was a new kitchen. Finally, I called a house builder to come and fix my kitchen. Three weeks later I had a new sink, a new refrigerator, new cupboards on a new wall, new tiles on a new floor, and $10,000 less in my bank. I have learned my lesson, I never wash carrots in the kitchen sink; I get them, clean and ready to eat, from the store.",B2,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/490/reading/renovations2-reading,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/490-stories-cam/From-Carrots-To-Renovations.mp3}

"Jack lay, quiet and unmoving, for thirty minutes while a stranger repeatedly stabbed him with sharp needles, causing blood to pour steadily out of his leg. Jack was getting a tattoo. His friend Tony had recently gotten a tattoo, and Jack was so impressed by Tony's bravery and his tattoo that he decided to get one too. Getting a tattoo because your friends and peers have them is just one of the reasons why a lot of young people in North America get tattoos. Peer pressure, media influence, and personal expression are some of the common reasons for wearing tattoos today.The desire to be part of a group, to be accepted by one's friends or peers, can have a great influence on what a person does. Sometimes, wearing a tattoo can be a sign that you belong to a certain group. Gangs often use special clothes and tattoos to identify their particular group. For example, in one gang all the members may wear green army jackets and have large 'Xs' tattooed on their arms. It is not only gangs that have this type of special 'uniform'. Young people often belong to a certain group of friends. Some of these groups wear only brand-name clothes. Some wear only black clothes. Others wear tattoos. When a person's friends are all doing something, such as getting a tattoo, that person is more likely to do the same thing, and get a tattoo too.The media is another big influence behind the popularity of tattoos in North America. A wide variety of media images show tattoos. Tattoos can be seen on people appearing in commercials selling expensive cars. Famous sports heroes with tattoos are shown in magazines. Fashion models are often seen in magazines and on TV wearing designer clothes that show their bodies tattooed with detailed and colourful patterns. These media images link tattoos to ideas of wealth, success, and status. As a result, many people decide to get a tattoo for its fashion and status value.It is not always the influence of other people or the media that results in a person getting a tattoo. Many people decide to wear tattoos in order to express their artistic nature, their beliefs, or their feelings -- in other words, to show their individuality. A musician in a rock band may get a tattoo of a guitar on the arm. Some environmentalists may tattoo pictures of endangered animals on their shoulders. Lovers may tattoo each others' names over their hearts. A tattoo can be a public sign to show what is important in a person's life.As you can see, there are many reasons why young North Americans get tattoos. A tattoo can be part of a group's uniform. It can be a sign of fashion. It can be an expression of individuality. The decision to get a tattoo is most often a result of the influence of friends or media or the desire to express oneself. For Jack, it was a mixture of all three.",B2,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/490/reading/tattoos2-reading,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/490-stories-cam/Why-People-Get-Tattoos.mp3}
"Floods are second only to fire as the most common of all natural disasters. They occur almost everywhere in the world, resulting in widespread damage and even death. Consequently, scientists have long tried to perfect their ability to predict floods. So far, the best that scientists can do is to recognize the potential for flooding in certain conditions. There are a number of conditions, from deep snow on the ground to human error, that cause flooding.When deep snow melts it creates a large amount of water. Although deep snow alone rarely causes floods, when it occurs together with heavy rain and sudden warmer weather it can lead to serious flooding. If there is a fast snow melt on top of frozen or very wet ground, flooding is more likely to occur than when the ground is not frozen. Frozen ground or ground that is very wet and already saturated with water cannot absorb the additional water created by the melting snow. Melting snow also contributes to high water levels in rivers and streams. Whenever rivers are already at their full capacity of water, heavy rains will result in the rivers overflowing and flooding the surrounding land.Rivers that are covered in ice can also lead to flooding. When ice begins to melt, the surface of the ice cracks and breaks into large pieces. These pieces of ice move and float down the river. They can form a dam in the river, causing the water behind the dam to rise and flood the land upstream. If the dam breaks suddenly, then the large amount of water held behind the dam can flood the areas downstream too.Broken ice dams are not the only dam problems that can cause flooding. When a large human-made dam breaks or fails to hold the water collected behind it, the results can be devastating. Dams contain such huge amounts of water behind them that when sudden breaks occur, the destructive force of the water is like a great tidal wave. Unleashed dam waters can travel tens of kilometres, cover the ground in metres of mud and debris, and drown and crush every thing and creature in their path.Although scientists cannot always predict exactly when floods will occur, they do know a great deal about when floods are likely, or probably, going to occur. Deep snow, ice-covered rivers, and weak dams are all strong conditions for potential flooding. Hopefully, this knowledge of why floods happen can help us reduce the damage they cause.",B2,https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/490/reading/floods2-reading,continuingstudies,{'audio_link': https://hlsvod.uvic.ca/vod/dcs/elc/studyzone/490-stories-cam/Causes-of-Floods.mp3}
