"The canopy, the upper level of the trees in the rain forest, holds a plethora of climbing mammals of moderately large size, which may include monkeys, cats, civets, and porcupines. Smaller species, including such rodents as mice and small squirrels, are not as prevalent overall in high tropical canopies as they are in most habitats globally.Small mammals, being warm blooded, suffer hardship in the exposed and turbulent environment of the uppermost trees. Because a small body has more surface area per unit of weight than a large one of similar shape, it gains or loses heat more swiftly. Thus, in the trees, where shelter from heat and cold may be scarce and conditions may fluctuate, a small mammal may have trouble maintaining its body temperature.Small size makes it easy to scramble among twigs and branches in the canopy for insects, flowers, or fruit, but small mammals are surpassed, in the competition for food, by large ones that have their own tactics for browsing among food-rich twigs. The weight of a gibbon (a small ape) hanging below a branch arches the terminal leaves down so that fruit-bearing foliage drops toward the gibbons face. Walking or leaping species of a similar or even larger size access the outer twigs either by snapping off and retrieving the whole branch or by clutching stiff branches with the feet or tail and plucking food with their hands.Small climbing animals may reach twigs readily, but it is harder for them than for large climbing animals to cross the wide gaps from one tree crown to the next that typify the high canopy. A macaque or gibbon can hurl itself farther than a mouse can: it can achieve a running start, and it can more effectively use a branch as a springboard, even bouncing on a limb several times before jumping. The forward movement of a small animal is seriously reduced by the air friction against the relatively large surface area of its body. Finally, for the many small mammals the supplement their insect diet with fruits or seeds, an inability to span open gaps between tree crowns may be problematic, since trees that yield these foods can be sparse.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test01/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, almost nothing was written about the contribution of women during the colonial period and the early history of the newly formed United States. Lacking the right to vote and absent from the seats of power, women were not considered an important force in history. Anne Bradstreet wrote some significant poetry in the seventeenth century, Mercy Otis Warren produced the best contemporary history of the American Revolution, and Abigail Adams penned important letters showing she exercised great political influence over her husband, John, the second President of the United States. But little or no notice was taken of these contributions. During these centuries, women remained invisible in history books.Throughout the nineteenth century, this lack of visibility continued, despite the efforts of female authors writing about women. These writers, like most of their male counterparts, were amateur historians. Their writings were celebratory in nature, and they were uncritical in their selection and use of sources.During the nineteenth century, however, certain feminists showed a keen sense of history by keeping records of activities in which women were engaged National, regional, and local womens organizations compiled accounts of their doings. Personal correspondence, newspaper clippings, and souvenirs were saved and stored. These sources form the core of the two greatest collections of womens history in the United Statesone at the Elizabeth and Arthur Schlesinger Library at Radeliffe College, and the other the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College. Such sources have provided valuable materials for later generations of historians.Despite the gathering of more information about ordinary women during the nineteenth century, most of the writing about women conformed to the great women theory of history, just as much of mainstream American history concentrated on great men. To demonstrate that women were making significant contributions to American life, female authors singled out women leaders and wrote biographies, or else important women produced their autobiographies. Most of these leaders were involved in public life as reformers, activists working for womens right to vote, or authors, and were not representative at all of the great mass of ordinary women. The lives of ordinary people continued, generally, to be untold in the American histories being published.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test02/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"The end of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century were marked by the development of an international Art Nouveau style, characterized by sinuous lines, floral and vegetable motifs, and soft evanescent coloration. The Art Nouveau style was an eclectic one, bringing together elements of Japanese art, motifs of ancient cultures, and natural forms. The glass objects of this style were elegant in outline, although often deliberately distorted, with pale or iridescent surfaces. A favored device of the style was to imitate the iridescent surface seen on ancient glass that had been buried.Much of the Art Nouveau glass produced during the years of its greatest popularity had been generically termed art glass. Art glass was intended for decorative purposes and relied for its effect upon carefully chosen color combinations and innovative techniques.France produced a number of outstanding exponents of the Art Nouveau style: among the most celebrated was Emile Gallé (1846-1901). In the United States, Louis Comfort Tiffany(1848-1933)was the most noted exponent of this style, producing a great variety of glass forms and surfaces, which were widely copied in their time and are highly prized today. Tiffany was a brilliant designer, successfully combining ancient Egyptian.The Art Nouveau style was a major force in the decorative arts from 1895 until 1915, although its influence continued throughout the mid-1920s. It was eventually to be overtaken by a new school of thought known as Functionalism that had present since the turn of the century. At first restricted to a small avant-garde group of architects and designers. Functionalism emerged as the dominant influence upon designers alter the First World War. The basic tenet of the movementthat function should determine formwas not a new concept. Soon a distinct aesthetic code evolved: form should be simple, surfaces plain, and any ornament should be based on geometric relationships. This new design concept, coupled with the sharp postwar reactions to the style and conventions of the preceding decades, created an entirely new public taste which caused Art Nouveau types of glass to fall out of favor. The new taste demanded dramatic effects of contrast stark outline, and complex textural surfaces.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test03/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"During most of their lives, surge glaciers behave like normal glaciers, traveling perhaps only a couple of inches per day. However, at intervals of 10 to 100 years, these glaciers move forward up to 100 times faster than usual. The surge often progress along a glacier like a great wave, proceeding from one section to another. Subglacial streams of meltwater might act as a lubricant, allowing the glacier to flow rapidly toward the sea. The increasing water pressure under the glacier might lift it off its bed, overcoming the friction between ice and rock, thus freeing the glacier, which rapidly slides downhill. Surge glaciers also might be influenced by the climate, volcanic heat, or earthquakes. However, many of these glaciers exist in the same areas as normal glaciers, often almost side by side.Some 800 years ago, Alaskas Hubbard Glacier advanced toward the sea, retreated, and advanced again 500 years later. Since 1895, this seventy-mile-long river of ice has been flowing steadily toward the Gulf of Alaska at a rate of approximately 200 feet per year. In June 1986, however, the glacier surged ahead as much as 47 feet a day. Meanwhile, a western tributary, called Valerie Glacier, advanced up to 112 feet per day. Hubbards surge closed off Russell Fiord with a formidable ice dam, some 2,500 feet wide and up to 800 feet high, whose caged waters threatened the town of Yakutat to the south.About 20 similar glaciers around the Gulf of Alaska are heading toward the sea. If enough surge glaciers reach the ocean and raise sea levels, West Antarctic ice shelves could rise off the seafloor and become adrift. A flood of ice would then surge into the Southern Sea. With the continued rise in sea level, more ice would plunge into the ocean, causing sea levels to rise even higher, which in turn would release more ice and set in motion a vicious cycle. The additional sea ice floating toward the tropics would increase. Earths albedo and lower global temperatures, perhaps enough to initiate a new ice age. This situation appears to have occurred at the end of the last warm interglacial (the time between glaciations), called the Sangamon, when sea ice cooled the ocean dramatically, spawning the beginning of the Ice Age.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test04/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"According to sociologists, there are several different ways in which a person may become recognized as the leader of a social group in the United States. In the family traditional cultural patterns confer leadership on one or both of the parents. In other cases, such as friendship groups, one or more persons may gradually emerge as leaders, although there is no formal process of selection. In larger groups, leaders are usually chosen formally through election or recruitment.Although leaders are often thought to be people with unusual personal ability, decades of research have failed to produce consistent evidence that there is any category of natural leaders. It seems that there is no set of personal qualities that all leaders have in common; rather, virtually any person may be recognized as a leader if the person has qualities that meet the needs of that particular group.Furthermore, although it is commonly supposed that social groups have a single leader, research suggests that there are typically two different leadership roles that are held by different individuals. Instrumental leadership is leadership that emphasizes the completion of tasks by a social group. Group members look to instrumental leaders to get things done. Expressive leadership, on the other hand, is leadership that emphasizes the collective well-beings of a social groups members. Expressive leaders are less concerned with the overall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and attempting to minimize tension and conflict among them. Group members expect expressive leaders to maintain stable relationships within the group and provide support to individual members.Instrumental leaders are likely to have a rather secondary relationship to other group members. They give others and may discipline group members who inhibit attainment of the groups goals. Expressive leaders cultivate a more personal or primary relationship to others in the group. They offer sympathy when someone experiences difficulties or is subjected to discipline, are quick to lighten a serious moment with humor, and try to resolve issues that threaten to divide the group. As the difference in these two roles suggest, expressive leaders generally receive more personal affection from group members; instrumental leaders, if they are successful in promoting group goals, may enjoy a more distant respect.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test05/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"The ocean bottoma region nearly 2.5 times greater than the total land area of the Earthis a vast frontier that even today is largely unexplored and uncharted. Until about a century ago, the deepocean floor was completely inaccessible, hidden beneath waters averaging over 3,6000 meters deep. Totally without light and subjected to intense pressures hundreds of times greater than at the Earth's surface, the deepocean bottom is a hostile environment to humans, in some ways as forbidding and remote as the void of outer space.Although researchers have taken samples of deepocean rocks and sediments for over a century, the first detailed global investigation of the ocean bottom did not actually start until 1968, with the beginning of the National Science Foundation's Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP). Using techniques first developed for the offshore oil and gas industry, the DSDP's drill ship, the Glomar Challenger, was able to maintain a steady position on the ocean's surface and drill in very deep waters, extracting samples of sediments and rock from the ocean floor.The Glomar Challenger completed 96 voyages in a 15year research program that ended in November 1983. During this time, the vessel logged 600,000 kilometers and took almost 20,000 core samples of seabed sediments and rocks at 624 drilling sites around the world. The Glomar Challenger's core samples have allowed geologists to reconstruct what the planet looked like hundreds of millions of years ago and to calculate what it will probably look like millions of years in the future. Today, largely on the strength of evidence gathered during the Glomar Challenger's voyages, nearly all earth scientists agree on the theories of plate tectonics and continental drift that explain many of the geological processes that shape the Earth.The cores of sediment drilled by the Glomar Challenger have also yielded information critical to understanding the world's past climates. Deepocean sediments provide a climatic record stretching back hundreds of millions of years, because they are largely isolated from the mechanical erosion and the intense chemical and biological activity that rapidly destroy much landbased evidence oof past climates. This record has already provided insights into the patterns and causes of past climatic changeinformation that may be used to predict future climates.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test06/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Basic to any understanding of Canada in 20 years after the Second World War is the country's impressive population growth. For every three Canadians in 1945, there were over five in 1996. In September 1966 Canada's population passed the 20 million mark. Most of this surging growth came from natural increase. The depression of the 1930's and the war had held back marriages and the catchingup process began after 1945. The baby boom continued through the decade of the 1950's, producing a population increase of nearly fifteen percent in the five years from 1951 to 1956. This rate of increase had been exceeded only once before in Canada's history, in the decade before 1911, when the prairies were being settled. Undoubtedly, the good economic conditions of the 1950's supported a growth in the population, but the expansion also derived from a trend toward earlier marriages and an increase in the average size of families. In 1957 the Canadian birth rate stood at 28 per thousand, one of the highest in the world.After the peak year of 1957, the birth rate in Canada began to decline. It continued falling until in 1966 it stood at the lowest level in 25 years. Partly this decline reflected the low level of births during the depression and the war, but it was also caused by changes in Canadian society. Young people were staying at school longer, more women were working, young married couples were buying automobiles or houses before starting families, rising living standards were cutting down the size of families. It appeared that Canada was once more falling in step with the trend toward smaller families that had occurred all through the Western world since the time of the Industrial Revolution.Although the growth in Canada's population has slowed down by 1966(the increase in the first half of the 1960's was only nine percent). Another large population wave was coming over the horizon. It would be composed of the children of the children who were born during the period of the high birth rate prior to 1957.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test07/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Are organically grown foods the best food choices? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and marketed food products are now being debated. Advocates of organic foodsa term whose meaning varies greatlyfrequently proclaim that such products are safer and more nutritious than others.The growing interest of consumers in the safety and more nutritional quality of the typical North American diet is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been sparked by sweeping claims that the food supply is unsafe or in adequate in meeting nutritional needs. Although most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, the preponderance of written material advancing such claims makes it difficult for the general public to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting entirely of organically grown foods prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely publicized and form the basis for folklore.Almost daily the public is besieged by claims for ""no-aging"" diets, new vitamins, and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated reports that natural vitamins are superior to synthetic ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than fumigated grains and the like.One thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods. But in many cases consumers are misled if they believe organic foods can maintain health and provide better nutritional quality than conventionally grown foods. So there is real cause for concern if consumers, particularly those with limited incomes, distrust the regular food and buy and buy only expensive organic foods instead.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test08/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"There are many theories about the beginning of drama in ancient Greece. The one most widelyaccepted today is based on the assumption that drama evolved from ritual. The argument for this view goes as follows. In the beginning, human beings viewed the natural forces of the world, eventhe seasonal changes, as unpredictable, and they sought through various means, to control these unknown and feared powers. Those measures which appeared to bring the desired results were then retained and repeated until they hardened into fixed rituals. Eventually stories arose which explained or veiled the mysteries of the rites. As time passed some rituals were abandoned, but the stories, later called myths, persisted and provided material for art and drama.Those who believe that drama evolved out of ritual also argue that those rites contained the seed of theater because music, dance, masks, and costumes were almost always used. Furthermore, a suitable site had to be provided for performances, and when the entire community did not participate, a clear division was usually made between the ""acting area"" and the ""auditorium."" In addition, there were performers, and since considerable importance was attached to avoiding mistakes in the enactment of rites, religious leaders usually assumed that task. Wearing masks and costumes, they often impersonated other people, animals, or supernatural beings, and mimed the desired effect - success in hunt or battle, the coming rain, the revival of the Sun - as an actor might. Eventually such dramatic representations were separated from religious activities.Another theory traces the theater's origin from the human interest in storytelling. According to this view, tales (about the hunt, war, or other feats) are gradually elaborated, at first through the use of impersonation, action, and dialogue by a narrator and then through the assumption of each of the roles by a different person. A closely related theory traces theater to those dances that are primarily rhythmical and gymnastic or that are imitations of animal movements and sounds.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test09/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Staggering tasks confronted the people of the United States, North and South, when the Civil war ended. About a million and a half soldiers from both sides had to be demobilized, readjusted to civilian life, and reabsorbed by the devastated economy. Civil government also had to be put back on a peacetime basis and interference from the military had to be stopped.The desperate plight of the South has eclipsed the fact that reconstruction had to be undertaken also in the North, though less spectacularly. Industries had to adjust to peacetime conditions, factories had to be retooled for civilian needs.Financial problems loomed large in both the North and the South. The national debt had shot up from a modest 65 million in 1861, the year the ear started to nearly 3 billion in 1865, the year the war ended. This was a colossal sum for those days but one that a prudent government could pay. At the same time, war taxes had to be reduced to less burdensome levels.Physical devastation caused by invading armies, chiefly in the South and border states, had to be repaired. This herculean task was ultimately completed, but with discouraging slowness.Other important questions needed answering. What would be the future of the four million black people who were freed from slavery? On what basis were the Southern states to be brought back into the Union?What of the Southern leaders, all of whom were liable to charges of treason? One of these leaders, Jefferson Davis, President of the Southern Confederacy, was the subject of an insulting popular Northern song, ""Hang Jeff Davis from a Sour Apple Tree."" And even children sang it. Davis was temporarily chained in his prison cell during the early days of his two-year imprisonment. But he and the other Southern leaders were finally released, partly because it was unlikely that a jury from Virginia, a Southern Confederate state, would convict them. All the leaders were finally pardoned by President Johnson in 1868 in an effort to help reconstruction efforts proceed with as little bitterness as possible.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test10/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Atmospheric pressure can support a column of water up to 10 meters high. But plants can move water much higher, the sequoia tree can pump water to its very top, more than 100 meters above the ground. Until the end of the nineteenth century, the movement of water in trees and other tall plants was a mystery. Some botanists hypothesized that the living cells of plants in which all the cells are killed can still move water to appreciable heights. Other explanations for the movement of water in plants have been based on root pressure, a push on the water from the roots at the bottom of the plant. But root pressure is not nearly great enough to push water to the tops of tall trees. Furthermore, the conifers, which are among the tallest trees, have unusually low root pressures.If water is not pumped to the top of a tall tree, and if it is not pushed to the top of a tall tree, then we may ask, how does it get there? According to the currently accepted cohesion-tension theory, water is pulled there. The pull on a rising column of water in a plant results from the evaporation of water at the top of the plant. As water is lost from the surface of the leaves, a negative pressure, or tension, is created. The evaporated water is replaced by water moving from inside the plant in unbroken columns that extend from the top of a plant to its roots. The same forces that create surface tension in any sample of water are responsible for the maintenance of these unbroken columns of water. When water is confined in tubes of very small bore, the forces of cohesion (the attraction between water molecules) are so great that the strength of a column of water compares with the strength of a steel wire of the same diameter. This cohesive strength permits columns of water to be pulled to great heights without being broken.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test11/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Mass transportation revised the social and economic fabric of the American city in three fundamental ways. It catalyzed physical expansion, it sorted out people and land uses, and it accelerated the inherent instability of urban life. By opening vast areas of unoccupied land for residential expansion, the omnibuses, horse railways, commuter trains, and electric trolleys pulled settled regions outward two to four times more distant from city centers than they were in the pre-modern era. In 1850, for example, the borders of Boston lay scarcely two miles from the old business district; by the turn of the century the radius extended ten miles. Now those who could afford it could live far removed from the old city center and still commute there for work, shopping, and entertainment. The new accessibility of land around the periphery of almost every major city sparked an explosion of real estate development and fueled what we now know as urban sprawl. Between 1890 and 1920, for example, some 250,000 new residential lots were recorded within the borders of Chicago, most of them located in outlying areas. Over the same period, another 550,000 were plotted outside the city limits but within the metropolitan area. Anxious to take advantage of the possibilities of commuting, real estate developers added 800,000 potential building sites to the Chicago region in just thirty yearslots that could have housed five to six million people.Of course, many were never occupied; there was always a huge surplus of subdivided, but vacant, land around Chicago and other cities. These excesses underscore a feature of residential expansion related to the growth of mass transportation: urban sprawl was essentially unplanned. It was carried out by thousands of small investors who paid little heed to coordinated land use or to future land users. Those who purchased and prepared land for residential purposes, particularly land near or outside city borders where transit lines and middle-class inhabitants were anticipated, did so to create demand as much as to respond to it. Chicago is a prime example of this process. Real estate subdivision there proceeded much faster than population growth.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test12/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"The preservation of embryos and juveniles is rare occurrence in the fossil record. The tiny, delicate skeletons are usually scattered by scavengers or destroyed by weathering before they can be fossilized. Ichthyosaurs had a higher chance of being preserved than did terrestrial creatures because, as marine animals, they tended to live in environments less subject to erosion. Still, their fossilization required a suite of factors: a slow rate of decay of soft tissues, little scavenging by other animals, a lack if swift currents and waves to jumble and carry away small bones, and fairly rapid burial. Given these factors, some areas have become a treasury of well-preserved ichthyosaur fossils.The deposits at Holzmaden, Germany, present an interesting case for analysis. The ichthyosaur remains are found in black, bituminous marine shales deposited about 190 million years ago. Over the years, thousands of specimens of marine reptiles, fish, and invertebrates have been recovered from these rocks. The quality of preservation is outstanding, but what is even more impressive is the number of ichthyosaur fossils containing preserved embryos. Ichthyosaurs with embryos have been reported from 6 different levels of the shale in a small area around Holzmaden, suggesting that a specific site was used by large numbers of ichthyosaurs repeatedly over time. The embryos are quite advanced in their physical development; their paddles, for example, are already well formed. One specimen is even preserved in the birth canal. In addition, the shale contains the remains of many newborns that are between 20 and 30 inches long.Why are there so many pregnant females and young at Holzmaden when they are so rare elsewhere? The quality of preservation is almost unmatched, and quarry operations factors do not account for the interesting question of how there came to be such a concentration of pregnant ichthyosaurs in a particular place very close to their time of giving birth.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test13/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"The Lewis and Clark expedition, sponsored by President Jefferson, was the most important official examination of the high plains and the Northwest before the War of 1812. The President's secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis, had been instructed to ""explore the Missouri River, and such principal streams of it as, by its course and communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean …may offer her most direct and practicable water communication across the continent, for the purposes of commerce."" Captain William Clark, the younger brother of famed George Rogers Clerk, was invited to share the command of the exploring party.Amid rumors that there were prehistoric mammoths wandering around the unknown region and that somewhere in its wilds was a mountain of rock salt 80 by 45 miles in extent, the two captains set out. The date was May 14, 1804. Their point of departure was the mouth of the Wood River, just across the Mississippi from the entrance of the Missouri River. After toiling up the Missouri all summer, the group wintered near the Mandan villages in the center of what is now North Dakota. Resuming their journey in the spring of 1805, the men worked their way along the Missouri to its source and then crossed the mountains of western Montana and Idaho. Picking up a tributary of the Columbia River, they continued westward until they reached the Pacific Ocean, where they stayed until the following spring.Lewis and Clark brought back much new information, including the knowledge that the continent was wider than originally supposed. More specifically, they learned a good deal about river drainages and mountain barriers. They ended speculation that an easy coast-to-coast route existed via the Missouri-Columbia River systems, and their reports of the climate, the animals and birds, the trees and plants, and the Indians of the Westthough not immediately publishedwere made available to scientists.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test14/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"For a century and a half the piano has been one of the most popular solo instruments for Western music. Unlike string and wind instrument, the piano is completely self-sufficient, as it is able to play both the melody and its accompanying harmony at the same time. For this reason, it became the favorite household instrument of the nineteenth century.The ancestry of the piano can be traced to the early keyboard instruments of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuriesthe spinet, the dulcimer, and the virginal. In the seventeenth century the organ, the clavichord, and the harpsichord became the chief instruments of the keyboard group, a supremacy they maintained until the piano supplanted them at the end of the eighteenth century. The clavichord's tone was metallic and never powerful; nevertheless, because of the variety of tone possible to it, many composers found the clavichord a sympathetic instrument for concert use, but the character of the tone could not be varied save by mechanical or structural devices.The piano was perfected in the early eighteenth century by a harpsichord maker in Italy (though musicologists point out several previous instances of the instrument). This instrument was called a piano e forte (soft and loud), to indicate its dynamic versatility; its strings were struck by a recoiling hammer with a felt-padded head. The wires were much heavier in the earlier instruments. A series of mechanical improvements continuing well into the nineteenth century, including the introduction of pedals to sustain tone or to soften it, the perfection of a metal frame and steel wire of the finest quality, finally produced an instrument capable of myriad tonal effects from the most delicate harmonies to an almost orchestral fullness of sound, from a liquid, singing tone to a sharp, percussive brilliance.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test15/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Joyce Carol Oates published her first collection of short stories. By The Gate, in 1963, two years after she had received her master's degree from the University of Wisconsin and become an instructor of English at the University of Detroit. Her productivity since then has been prodigious, accumulating in less than two decades to nearly thirty titles, including novels, collections of short stories and verse, plays, and literary criticism. In the meantime, she has continued to teach, moving in 1967 from the University of Detroit to the University of Windsor, in Ontario, and, in 1978, to Princeton University. Reviewers have admired her enormous energy, but find a productivity of such magnitude difficult to assess.In a period characterized by the abandonment of so much of the realistic tradition by authors such as John Barth, Donald Barthelme, and Thomas Pynchon, Joyce Carol Oates has seemed at times determinedly old-fashioned in her insistence on the essentially mimetic quality of her fiction. Hers is a world of violence, insanity, fractured love, and hopeless loneliness. Although some of it appears to come from her own direct observations, her dreams, and her fears, much more is clearly from the experiences of others. Her first novel, With Shuddering Fall (1964), dealt with stock car racing, though she had never seen a race. IN Them (1969) she focused on Detroit from the Depression through the notes of 1967, drawing much of her material from the deep impression made on her by the problems of one of her students. Whatever the source and however shocking the events or the motivations, however, her fictive world remains strikingly akin to that real one reflected in the daily newspapers, the television news and talk shows, and the popular magazines of our day.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test16/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Certainly no creature in the sea is odder than the common sea cucumber. All living creature, especially human beings, have their peculiarities, but everything about the little sea cucumber seems unusual. What else can be said about a bizarre animal that, among other eccentricities, eats mud, feeds almost continuously day and night but can live without eating for long periods, and can be poisonous but is considered supremely edible by gourmets?For some fifty million years, despite all its eccentricities, the sea cucumber has subsisted on its diet of mud. It is adaptable enough to live attached to rocks by its tube feet, under rocks in shallow water, or on the surface of mud flats. Common in cool water on both Atlantic and Pacific shores, it has the ability to suck up mud or sand and digest whatever nutrients are present.Sea cucumbers come in a variety of colors, ranging from black to reddish - brown to sand - color and nearly white. One form even has vivid purple tentacles. Usually the creatures are cucumber - shaped - hence their name - and because they are typically rock inhabitants, this shape, combined with flexibility, enables them to squeeze into crevices where they are safe from predators and ocean currents.Although they have voracious appetites, eating day and night, sea cucumbers have the capacity to become quiescent and live at a low metabolic rate - feeding sparingly or not at all for long periods, so that the marine organisms that provide their food have a chance to multiply. If it were not for this faculty, they would devour all the food available in s short time and would probably starve themselves out of existence.But the most spectacular thing about the sea cucumber is the way it defends itself. Its major enemies are fish and crabs, when attacked, it squirts all its internal organs into the water. It also casts off attached structures such as tentacles. The sea cucumber will eviscerate and regenerate itself if it is attacked or even touched; it will do the same if surrounding water temperature is too high or if the water becomes too polluted.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test17/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"A folk culture is small, isolated, cohesive, conservative, nearly self-sufficient group that is homogeneous in custom and race, with a strong family or clan structure and highly developed rituals. Order is maintained through sanctions based in the religion or family, and interpersonal relationships are strong. Tradition is paramount, and change comes infrequently and slowly. There is relatively little division of labor into specialized duties. Rather, each person is expected to perform a great variety of tasks, though duties many differ between the sexes. Most goods are handmade, and a subsistence economy prevails. Individualism is weakly developed in folk cultures, as are social classes. Unaltered folk cultures no longer exist in industrialized countries such as the United States and Canada. Perhaps the nearest modern-equivalent in Anglo-America is the Amish, a German American farming sect that largely renounces the products and labor saving device of the industrial age. In Amish areas, horse - drawn buggies still serve as a local transportation device, and the faithful are not permitted to own automobiles. The Amish's central religious concept of Demut, ""humility"", clearly reflects the weakness of individualism and social class so typical of folk cultures, and there is a corresponding strength of Amish group identity. Rarely do the Amish marry outside their sect. The religion, a variety of the Mennonite faith, provides the principal mechanism for maintaining -order.By contrast, a popular culture is a large heterogeneous group, often highly individualistic and constantly changing. Relationships tend to be impersonal, and a pronounced division of labor exists, leading to the establishment of many specialized professions. Secular institutions of control such as the police and army take the place of religion and family in maintaining order, and a money-based economy prevails. Because of these contrasts, ""popular"" may be viewed as clearly different from ""folk"". The popular is replacing the folk in industrialized countries and in many developing nations, Folk-made objects give way to their popular equivalent, usually because the popular item is more quickly or cheaply produced, is easier or time saving to use, or lends more prestige to the owner.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test18/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Many of the most damaging and life-threatening types of weather - torrential rains, severe thunderstorms, and tornadoes - begin quickly, strike suddenly, and dissipate rapidly, devastating small regions while leaving neighboring areas untouched. One such event, a tornado, stuck the northeastern section of Edmonton, Alberta, in July 1987. Total damages from the tornado exceeded 250 million, the highest ever for any Canadian storm. Conventional computer models of the atmosphere have limited value in predicting short - lived local storms like the Edmonton tornado, because the available weather data are generally not detailed enough to allow computers to discern the subtle atmospheric changes that precede these storms. In most nations, for example, weather -balloon observations are taken just once every twelve hours at locations typically separated by hundreds of miles. With such limited data, conventional forecasting models do a much better job predicting general weather conditions over large regions than they do forecasting specific local events.Until recently, the observation - intensive approach needed for accurate, very short - range forecasts, or ""Nowcasts,"" was not feasible. The cost of equipping and operating many thousands of conventional weather stations was prohibitively high, and the difficulties involved in rapidly collecting and processing the raw weather data from such a network were insurmountable. Fortunately, scientific and technological advances have overcome most of these problems. Radar systems, automated weather instruments, and satellites are all capable of making detailed, nearly continuous observation over large regions at a relatively low cost. Communications satellites can transmit data around the world cheaply and instantaneously, and modern computers can quickly compile and analyzing this large volume of weather information. Meteorologists and computer scientists now work together to design computer programs and video equipment capable of transforming raw weather data into words, symbols, and vivid graphic displays that forecasters can interpret easily and quickly. As meteorologists have begun using these new technologies in weather forecasting offices, Nowcasting is becoming a reality.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test19/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"People in the United States in the nineteenth century were haunted by the prospect that unprecedented change in he nation's economy would bring social chaos. In the years following 1820, after several decades of relative stability, the economy entered a period of sustained and extremely rapid growth that continued to the end of the nineteenth century. Accompanying that growth that was a structural change that featured increasing economic diversification and a gradual shift in the nation's labor force from agriculture to manufacturing and other nonagricultural pursuits.Although the birth rate continued to decline from its high level of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The population roughly doubled every generation during the rest of the nineteenth centuries. As the population grew, its makeup also changed. Massive waves of immigration brought new ethnic groups into the country. Geographic and social mobility - downward as well as upward - touched almost everyone. Local studies indicate that nearly three - quarters of the population - in the North and South, in the emerging cities of the Northeast, and in the restless rural counties of the West - changed their residence each decade. As a consequence, historian David Donald has written, ""Social atomization affected every segment of society,"" and it seemed to many people that ""all the recognized values of orderly civilization were gradually being eroded."" Rapid industrialization and increased geographic mobility in the nineteenth century had special implications for women because these tended to magnify social distinctions. As the roles men and women played in society became more rigidly defined, so did the roles they played in the home. In the context of extreme competitiveness and dizzying social change, the household lost many of its earlier functions and the home came to serve as a haven of tranquility and order. As the size of families decreased, the roles of husband and wife became more clearly differentiated than ever before. In the middle class especially, men participated in the productive economy while women ruled the home and served as the custodians of civility and culture. The intimacy of marriage that was common in earlier periods was rent, and a gulf that at times seemed unbridgeable was created between husbands and wives.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test20/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Orchids are unique in having the most highly developed of all blossoms, in which the usual male and female reproductive organs are fused in a single structure called the column. The column is designed so that a single pollination will fertilize hundreds of thousands, and in some cases millions, of seeds, so microscopic and light they are easily carried by the breeze. Surrounding the column are three sepals and three petals, sometimes easily recognizable as such, often distorted into gorgeous, weird, but always functional shapes. The most noticeable of the petals is called the labellum, or lip. It is often dramatically marked as an unmistakable landing strip to attract the specific insect the orchid has chosen as its pollinator.To lure their pollinators from afar, orchids use appropriately intriguing shapes, colors and scents. At least 50 different aromatic compounds have been analyzed in the orchid family, each blended to attract one or at most a few species of insects or birds. Some orchids even change their scents to interest different insects at different times.Once the right insect has been attracted, some orchids present all sorts of one-way obstacle courses to make sure it does not leave until pollen has been accurately placed or removed. By such ingenious adaptations to specific pollinators, orchids have avoided the hazards of rampant crossbreeding in the wild, assuring the survival of species as discrete identities. At the same time they have made themselves irresistible to collectors.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test21/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"One of the most important social developments that helped to make possible a shift in thinking about the role of public education was the effect of the baby boom of the 1950's and 1960's on the schools. In the 1920's, but especially in the Depression conditions of the 1930's, the United States experienced a declining birth rate-every thousand women aged fifteen to forty -four gave birth to about 118 live children in 1920, 89.2 in 1930, 75.8 in 1936, and 80 in 1940. With the growing prosperity brought on by the Second World War and the economic boom that followed it, young people married and established households earlier and began to raise larger families than had their predecessors during the Depression. Birth rates rose to 102 per thousand in 1946. 106.2 in 1950 and 118 in 1955. Although economics was probably the most important determinant, it is not the only explanation for the baby boom. The increased value placed on the idea of the family also helps to explain this rise in birth rates. The baby boomers began streaming into the first grade by the mid-1940's and became a flood by 1950. The public school system suddenly found itself overtaxed. While the number of schoolchildren rose because of wartime and postwar conditions, these same conditions made the schools even less prepared to cope with the flood. The wartime economy meant that few new schools were built between 1940 and 1945. Moreover, during the war and in the boom times that followed large numbers of teachers left their profession for better -paying jobs elsewhere in the economy.Therefore, in the 1950's and 1960's, the baby boom hit an antiquated and inadequate school system. Consequently, the ""custodial rhetoric"" of the 1930's and early 1940's no longer made sense; that is, keeping youths aged sixteen and older out of the labor market by keeping them in school could no longer be a high priority for an institution unable to find space and staff to teach younger children aged five to sixteen. With the baby boom, the focus of educators and of laymen interested in education inevitably turned toward the lower grades and back to basic academic skills and discipline. The system no longer had much interest in offering nontraditional new and extra services to older youths.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test22/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Nineteenth-century writers in the United States, whether they wrote novels, short stories, poems or plays were powerfully drawn to the railroad in its golden years. In fact, writers responded to the railroads as soon as the first were built in the 1830's. By the 1850's, the railroad was a major presence in the life of the nation. Writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau saw the railroad both as a boon to democracy and as an object of suspicion. The railroad could be and was a despoiler of nature furthermore, in its manifestation of speed and noise, it might be a despoiler of human nature as well. By the 1850's and 1860's, there was a great distrust among writer and intellectuals of the rapid industrialization of which the railroad was a leading force. Deeply philosophical historians such as Henry Adams lamented the role that the new frenzy for business was playing in eroding traditional values. A distrust of industry and business continued among writers throughout the rest of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth.For the most part, the literature in which the railroad plays an important role belongs to popular culture rather than to the realm of serious art. One thinks of melodramas, boy's books, thrillers, romances and the like rather than novels of the first rank. In the railroads' prime years, between 1890 and 1920, there were a few individuals in the United States, most of them with solid railroading experience behind them, who made a profession of writing about railroading - works offering the ambience of stations yards and locomotive cabs. These writers who can genuinely be said to have created a genre, the ""railroad novel"" are now mostly forgotten, their names having faded from memory. But anyone who takes the time to consult their fertile writings will still find a treasure trove of information about the place of the railroad in the life of the United States.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test23/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"By the 1820's in the United States, when steamboats were common on western waters, these boats were mostly powered by engines built in the West (Pittsburgh, Cincinnati or Louisville), and of a distinctive western design specially suited to western needs. The first steam engines in practical use in England and the United States were of low-pressure design. This was the type first developed by James Watt, then manufactured by the firm of Boulton and Watt, and long the standard industrial engine. Steam was accumulated in a large, double-acting vertical cylinder, but the steam reached only a few pounds of pressure per square inch. It was low-pressure engines of this type that were first introduced into the United States by Robert Fulton. He imported such a Boulton and Watt engine from England to run the Clemont. But this type of engine was expensive and complicated, requiring many precision-fitted moving parts. The engine that became standard on western steamboats was of a different and novel design. It was the work primarily of an unsung hero of American industrial progress Oliver Evans (1755-1819). The self-educated son of a Delaware farmer, Evans early became obsessed by the possibilities of mechanized production and steam power. As early as 1802 he was using a stationary steam engine of high-pressure design in his mill. Engines of this type were not unknown, but before Evans they were generally considered impractical and dangerous. Within a decade the high-pressure engine, the new type had become standard on western waters. Critics ignorant of western conditions often attacked it as wasteful and dangerous. But people who really knew the Ohio, the Missouri and the Mississippi insisted with good reasons, that it was the only engine for them. In shallow western rivers the weight of vessel and engine was important, a heavy engine added to the problem of navigation. The high-pressure engine was far lighter in proportion to horsepower, and with less than half as many moving parts was much easier and cheaper to repair. The main advantages of low-pressure engines were safe operation and economy of fuel consumption, neither of which meant much in the West.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test24/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Volcanic fire and glacial ice are natural enemies. Eruptions at glaciated volcanoes typically destroy ice fields as they did in 1980 when 70 percent of Mount Saint Helens ice cover was demolished. During long dormant intervals, glaciers gain the upper hand cutting deeply into volcanic cones and eventually reducing them to rubble. Only rarely do these competing forces of heat and cold operate in perfect balance to create a phenomenon such as the steam caves at Mount Rainier National Park.Located inside Rainier's two ice-filled summit craters, these caves form a labyrinth of tunnels and vaulted chambers about one and one -half miles in total length. Their creation depends on an unusual combination of factors that nature almost never brings together in one place. The cave-making recipe calls for a steady emission of volcanic gas and heat, a heavy annual snowfall at an elevation high enough to keep it from melting during the summer, and a bowl-shaped crater to hold the snow.Snow accumulating yearly in Rainier's summit craters is compacted and compressed into a dense form of ice called firm, a substance midway between ordinary ice and the denser crystalline ice that makes up glaciers. Heat rising from numerous openings (called fumaroles) along the inner crater walls melts out chambers between the rocky walls and the overlying ice pack. Circulating currents of warm air then melt additional openings in the firm ice, eventually connecting the individual chambers and, in the large of Rainier's two craters, forming a continuous passageway that extends two-thirds of the way around the crater's interior.To maintain the cave system, the elements of fire under ice must remain in equilibrium enough snow must fill the crater each year to replace that melted from below. If too much volcanic heat is discharged, the crater's ice pack will melt away entirely and the caves will vanish along with the snows of yesteryear. If too little heat is produced, the ice, replenished annually by winter snowstorms will expand, pushing against the enclosing crater walls and smothering the present caverns in solid firm ice.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test25/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"The word laser was coined as an acronym for Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Ordinary light, from the Sun or a light bulb, is emitted spontaneously, when atoms or molecules get rid of excess energy by themselves, without any outside intervention. Stimulated emission is different because it occurs when an atom or molecule holding onto excess energy has been stimulated to emit it as light.Albert Einstein was the first to suggest the existence of stimulated emission in a paper published in 1917. However, for many years physicists thought that atoms and molecules always were much more likely to emit light spontaneously and that stimulated emission thus always would be much weaker. It was not until after the Second World War that physicists began trying to make stimulated emission dominate. They sought ways by which one atom or molecule could stimulate many others to emit light, amplifying it to much higher powers.The first to succeed was Charles H. Towns, then at Columbia University in New York. Instead of working with light, however, he worked with microwaves, which have a much longer wavelength, and built a device he called a ""maser"" for Microwave Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Although he thought of the key idea in 1951, the first maser was not completed until a couple of years later. Before long, many other physicists were building masers and trying to discover how to produce stimulated emission at even shorter wavelengths. The key concepts emerged about 1957. Townes and Arthur Schawlow, then at Bell Telephone Laboratories, wrote a long paper outlining the conditions needed to amplify stimulated emission of visible light waves. At about the same time, similar ideas crystallized in the mind of Gordon Gould, then a 37-year-old graduate student at Columbia, who wrote them down in a series of notebooks. Towns and Schawlow published their ideas in a scientific journal, Physical Review Letter, but Gould filed a patent application. Three decades later, people still argue about who deserves the credit for the concept of the laser.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test26/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Panel painting, common in thirteenth-and fourteenth-century Europe, involved a painstaking, laborious process. Wooden planks were joined, covered with gesso to prepare the surface for painting, and then polished smooth with special tools. On this perfect surface, the artist would sketch a composition with chalk, refine it with inks, and then begin the deliberate process of applying thin layers of egg tempera paint (egg yolk in which pigments are suspended) with small brushes. The successive layering of these meticulously applied paints produced the final, translucent colors.Backgrounds or gold were made by carefully applying sheets of gold leaf, and then embellishing of decorating the gold leaf by punching it with a metal rod on which a pattern had been embossed. Every step in the process was slow and deliberate. The quick-drying tempera demanded that the artist know exactly where each stroke be placed before the brush met the panel, and it required the use of fine brushes. It was, therefore, an ideal technique for emphasizing the hard linear edges and pure, fine areas of color that were so much a part of the overall aesthetic of the time. The notion that an artist could or would dash off an idea in a fit of spontaneous inspiration was completely alien to these deliberately produced works.Furthermore, making these paintings was so time-consuming that it demanded assistance. All such work was done by collective enterprise in the workshops. The painter or master who is credited with having created the painting may have designed the work and overseen its production, but it is highly unlikely that the artist's hand applied every stroke of the brush. More likely, numerous assistants, who had been trained to imitate the artist's style, applied the paint. The carpenter's shop probably provided the frame and perhaps supplied the panel, and yet another shop supplied the gold. Thus, not only many hands, but also many shops were involved in the final product.In spite of problems with their condition, restoration, and preservation many panel paintings have survived, and today many of them are housed in museum collections.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test27/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Grows are probably the most frequently met and easily identifiable members of the native fauna of the United States. The great number of tales, legends, and myths about these birds indicates that people have been exceptionally interested in them for a long time. On the other hand, when it comes to substantive-particularly behavioral-information, crows are less well known than many comparably common species and, for that matter, not a few quite uncommon ones: the endangered California condor to cite one obvious example. There are practical reasons for this.Grows are notoriously poor and aggravating subjects for field research. Keen observers and quick learners, they are astute about the intentions of other creatures, including researchers, and adapt at avoiding them. Because they are so numerous, active, and monochromatic, it is difficult to distinguish one crow from another. Bands, radio transmitters, or other identifying devices can be attached to them, but this of course requires catching live crows, who are among the wariest and most untrappable of birds.Technical difficulties aside, crow research is daunting because the ways of the birds are so complex and various. As preeminent generalists, members of this species ingeniously exploit a great range of habitats and resources, and they can quickly adjust to changes in their circumstances. Being so educable, individual birds have markedly different interests and inclinations, strategies and scams. For example, one pet crow learned how to let a dog out of its kennel by pulling the pin on the door. When the dog escaped, the bird went into the kennel and ate its food.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test28/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"In the early days of the United States, postal charges were paid by the recipient and Charges varied with the distance carried. In 1825, the United States Congress permitted local postmasters to give letters to mail carriers for home delivery, but these carriers received no government salary and their entire compensation on what they were paid by the recipients of individual letters.In 1847 the United States Post Office Department adopted the idea of a postage stamp, which of course simplified the payment for postal service but caused grumbling by those who did not like to prepay. Besides, the stamp covered only delivery to the post office and did not include carrying it to a private address. In Philadelphia, for example, with a population of 150,000, people still had to go to the post office to get their mail. The confusion and congestion of individual citizens looking for their letters was itself enough to discourage use of the mail. It is no wonder that, during the years of these cumbersome arrangements, private letter-carrying and express businesses developed. Although their activities were only semilegal, they thrived, and actually advertised that between Boston and Philadelphia they were a half-day speedier than the government mail. The government postal service lost volume to private competition and was not able to handle efficiently even the business it had.Finally, in 1863, Congress provided that the mail carriers who delivered the mail from the post offices to private addresses should receive a government salary, and that there should be no extra charge for that delivery. But this delivery service was at first confined to cities, and free home delivery became a mark of urbanism. As late as 1887, a town had to have 10,000 people to be eligible for free home delivery. In 1890, of the 75 million people in the United States. Fewer than 20 million had mail delivered free to their doors.

"Archaeology has long been an accepted tool for studying prehistoric cultures. Relatively recently the same techniques have been systematically applied to studies of the more immediate past. This has been called ""historical archaeology,"" a term that is used in the United States to refer to any archaeological investigation into North American sites that postdate the arrival of Europeans.Back in the 1930's and 1940's, when building restoration was popular, historical archaeology was primarily a tool of architectural reconstruction. The role of archaeologists was to find the foundations of historic buildings and then take a back seat to architects.The mania for reconstruction had largely subsided by the 1950's and 1960's. Most people entering historical archaeology during this period came out of university anthropology departments, where they had studied prehistoric cultures. They were, by training, social scientists, not historians, and their work tended to reflect this bias. The questions they framed and the techniques they used were designed to help them understand, as scientists, how people behaved. But because they were treading on historical ground for which there was often extensive written documentation and because their own knowledge of these periods was usually limited, their contributions to American history remained circumscribed. Their reports, highly technical and sometimes poorly written, went unread.More recently, professional archaeologists have taken over. These researchers have sought out demonstrate that their work can be a valuable tool not only of science but also of history, providing fresh insights into the daily lives of ordinary people whose existences might not otherwise be so well documented. This newer emphasis on archaeology as social history has shown great promise, and indeed work done in this area has lead to a reinterpretation of the United States past.In Kingston, New York, for example, evidence has been uncovered that indicates that English goods were being smuggled into that city at a time when the Dutch supposedly controlled trading in the area.

"When Jules Verne wrote Journey to the Center of the Earth in 1864, there were many conflicting theories about the nature of the Earth's interior. Some geologists thought that it contained a highly compressed ball of incandescent gas, while others suspected that it consisted of separate shells, each made of a different material. Today, well over a century later, there is still little direct evidence of what lies beneath our feet. Most of our knowledge of the Earth's interior comes not from mines or boreholes, but from the study of seismic waves - powerful pulses of energy released by earthquakes.The way that seismic waves travel shows that the Earth's interior is far from uniform. The continents and the seabed are formed by the crust - a thin sphere of relatively light, solid rock. Beneath the crust lies the mantle, a very different layer that extends approximately halfway to the Earth's center. There the rock is the subject of a battle between increasing heat and growing pressure.In its high levels, the mantle is relatively cool; at greater depths, high temperatures make the rock behave more like a liquid than a solid. Deeper still, the pressure is even more intense, preventing the rock from melting in spite of a higher temperature. Beyond a depth of around 2,900 kilometers, a great change takes place and the mantle gives way to the core. Some seismic waves cannot pass through the core and others are bent by it. From this and other evidence, geologists conclude that the outer core is probably liquid, with a solid center. It is almost certainly made of iron, mixed with smaller amounts of other elements such as nickel.The conditions in the Earth's core make it a far more alien world than space. Its solid iron heart is subjected to unimaginable pressure and has a temperature of about 9,000oF.

"Despite the road improvements of the turnpike era (1790-1830). Americans continued as in colonial times to depend wherever possible on water routes for travel and transportation. The larger rivers, especially the Mississippi and the Ohio, became increasingly useful as steamboats grew in number and improved in design.River boats carried to New Orleans the corn and other crops of northwestern farmers, the cotton and tobacco of southwestern planters. From New Orleans, ships took the cargoes on to eastern seaports. Neither the farmers of the west nor the merchants of the east were completely satisfied with this pattern of trade. Farmers could get better prices for their crops if the alternative existed of sending them directly eastward to market and merchants could sell larger quantities of their manufactured goods if these could be transported more directly and more economically to the west.New waterways were needed. Sectional jealousies and constitutional scruples stood in the way of action by the federal government and necessary expenditures were too great for private enterprise. If extensive canals were to be dug, the job would be up to the various states. New York was the first to act. It had the natural advantage of a comparatively level route between the Hudson River and Lake Erie, through the only break in the entire Appalachian Mountain chain. Yet the engineering tasks were imposing. The distance was more than 350 miles and there were ridges to cross and a wilderness of woods and swamps to penetrate. The Erie Canal begun in 1817 and completed in 1825, was by far the greatest construction job that Americans had ever undertaken. It quickly proved a financial success as well. The prosperity of the Erie encouraged the state to enlarge its canal system by building several branches.The range of the New York canal system was still further extended when the states of Ohio and Indiana, inspired by the success of the Erie Canal, provided water connections between Lake Erie and the Ohio River.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test32/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Legend has it that sometime toward the end of the Civil War (1861-1865) a government train carrying oxen traveling through the northern plains of eastern Wyoming was caught in a snowstorm and had to be abandoned. The driver returned the next spring to see what had become of his cargo. Instead of the skeletons he had expected to find, he saw his oxen, living, fat, and healthy. How had they survived?The answer lay in a resource that unknowing Americans lands trampled underfoot in their haste to cross the ""Great American Desert"" to reach lands that sometimes proved barren. In the eastern parts of the United States, the preferred grass for forage was a cultivated plant. It grew well with enough rain, then when cut and stored it would cure and become nourishing hay for winter feed. But in the dry grazing lands of the West that familiar blue joint grass was often killed by drought. To raise cattle out there seemed risky or even hopeless.Who could imagine a fairy-tale grass that required no rain and somehow made it possible for cattle to feed themselves all winter? But the surprising western wild grasses did just that. They had wonderfully convenient features that made them superior to the cultivated eastern grasses. Variously known as buffalo grass, grama grass, or mesquite grass, not only were they immune to drought; but they were actually preserved by the lack of summer and autumn rains. They were not juicy like the cultivated eastern grasses, but had short, hard stems. And they did not need to be cured in a barn, but dried right where they grew on the ground. When they dried in this way, they remained naturally sweet and nourishing through the winter. Cattle left outdoors to fend for themselves thrived on this hay. And the cattle themselves helped plant the fresh grass year after year for they trampled the natural seeds firmly into the soil to be watered by the melting snows of winter and the occasional rains of spring. The dry summer air cured them much as storing in a barn cured the cultivated grasses.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test33/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Seventeenth-century houses in colonial North America were simple structures that were primarily functional carrying over traditional designs that went back to the Middle Ages. During the first half of the eighteenth century, however, houses began to show a new elegance. As wealth increased, more and more colonists built fine houses.Since architecture was not yet a specialized profession in the colonies, the design of buildings was left either to amateur designers or to carpenters who undertook to interpret architectural manuals imported from England. Inventories of colonial libraries show an astonishing number of these handbooks for builders, and the houses erected during the eighteenth century show their influence. Nevertheless, most domestic architecture of the first three-quarters of the eighteenth century displays a wide divergence of taste and freedom of application of the rules laid down in these books.Increasing wealth and growing sophistication throughout the colonies resulted in houses of improved design, whether the material was wood, stone, or brick. New England still favored wood, though brick houses became common in Boston and other towns, where the danger of fire gave an impetus to the use of more durable material. A few houses in New England were built of stone, but only in Pennsylvania and adjacent areas was stone widely used in dwellings. An increased use of brick in houses and outbuildings is noticeable in Virginia and Maryland, but wood remained that most popular material even in houses built by wealthy landowners. In the Carolinas, even in closely packed Charleston, wooden houses were much more common than brick houses.Eighteenth-century houses showed great interior improvements over their predecessors. Windows were made larger and shutters removed. Large, clear panes replaced the small leaded glass of the seventeenth century. Doorways were larger and more decorative. Fireplaces became decorative features of rooms. Walls were made of plaster or wood, sometimes elaborately paneled. White paint began to take the place of blues, yellows, greens, and lead colors, which had been popular for walls in the earlier years.

"Bloodhounds are biologically adapted to trailing their prey. The process by which the nose recognizes an odor is not fully understood, but there are apparently specific receptor sites for specific odors. In one explanation, recognition occurs when a scent molecule fits into its corresponding receptor site, like a key into a lock, causing a mechanical or chemical change in the cell. Bloodhounds apparently have denser concentrations of receptor sites tuned to human scents.When a bloodhound trails a human being, what does it actually smell? The human body, which consists of about 60 trillion living cells, sheds exposed skin at a rate of 50 million cells a day. So even a trail that has been dispersed by breezes may still seem rich to a bloodhound. The body also produces about 31 to 50 ounces of sweat a day. Neither this fluid nor the shed skin cells have much odor by themselves, but the bacteria working on both substances is another matter. One microbiologist estimates the resident bacteria population of a clean square centimeter of skin on the human shoulder at ""multiples of a million."" As they go about their daily business breaking down lipids, or fatty substances, on the skin, these bacteria release volatile substances that usually strike the bloodhound's nose as an entire constellation of distinctive scents.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test35/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Both the number and the percentage of people in the United States involved in nonagricultural pursuits expanded rapidly during the half century following the Civil War, with some of the most dramatic increases occurring in the domains of transportation, manufacturing, and trade and distribution. The development of the railroad and telegraph systems during the middle third of the nineteenth century led to significant improvements in the speed, volume, and regularity of shipments and communications, making possible a fundamental transformation in the production and distribution of goods.In agriculture, the transformation was marked by the emergence of the grain elevators, the cotton presses, the warehouses, and the commodity exchanges that seemed to so many of the nation's farmers the visible sign of a vast conspiracy against them. In manufacturing, the transformation was marked by the emergence of a ""new factory system"" in which plants became larger, more complex, and more systematically organized and managed. And in distribution, the transformation was marked by the emergence of the jobber, the wholesaler, and the mass retailer. These changes radically altered the nature of work during the half century between 1870 and 1920.To be sure, there were still small workshops, where skilled craftspeople manufactured products ranging from newspapers to cabinets to plumbing fixtures. There were the sweatshops in city tenements, where groups of men and women in household settings manufactured clothing or cigars on a piecework basis. And there were factories in occupations such as metalwork where individual contractors presided over what were essentially handicraft proprietorships that coexisted within a single building. But as the number of wage earners in manufacturing rose from 2.7 million in 1880 to 4.5 million in 1900 to 8.4 million in 1920, the number of huge plants like the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia burgeoned, as did the size of the average plant. (The Baldwin Works had 600 employees in 1855, 3,000 in 1875, and 8,000 in 1900.) By 1920, at least in the northeastern United States where most of the nation's manufacturing wage earners were concentrated, three-quarters of those worked in factories with more than 100 employees and 30 percent worked in factories with more than 1,000 employees.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test36/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Stars may be spheres, but not every celestial object is spherical. Objects in the universe show a variety of shapes: round planets (some with rings), tailed comets, wispy cosmic gas and dust clouds, ringed nebulae, pinwheel-shaped spiral galaxies, and so on. But none of the shapes on this list describes the largest single entities in the universe. These are the double radio sources, galaxies with huge clouds of radio emission that dwarf the visible galaxies, sometimes by a factor of a hundred or more. Stretching over distances greater than a million light-years, these radio-emitting regions resemble twin turbulent gas clouds, typically forming dumbbell-like shapes with the visible galaxy (when it is visible) in the center.These double radio sources present astronomers with a puzzle. Their radio emission arises from the synchrotron process, in which electrons accelerated to nearly the speed of light move through magnetic fields. However, in view of the rate at which the radio sources emit energy, they should disappear in a few million years as their electrons slow down and cease producing radiation. Somehow new electrons must be continually accelerated to nearly the speed of light, otherwise, by now almost none of the double radio sources would be observed.With the advent of high-resolution radio interferometers during the late 1970's, part of the answer became clear: the electrons are produced in jets that are shot out in opposite directions from the center of galaxy. Remarkably narrow and highly directional, the jets move outward at speeds close to the speed of light. When the jets strike the highly rarefied gas that permcales intergalactic space, the fast-moving electrons lose their highly directional motion and form vast clouds of radio-emitting gas.Cosmic jets have ranked among the hottest topics of astronomical research in recent years as astronomers strive to understand where they come from. Why should a galaxy eject matter at such tremendous speeds in two narrow jets? And why are such jets not seen in the Milky Way?",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test37/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"The sculptural legacy that the new United States inherited from its colonial predecessors was far from a rich one, and in fact, in 1776 sculpture as an art form was still in the hands of artisans and craftspeople. Stone carvers engraved their motifs of skulls and crossbones and other religious icons of death into the gray slabs that we still see standing today in old burial grounds. Some skilled craftspeople made intricately carved wooden ornamentations for furniture or architectural decorations, while others caved wooden shop signs and ships' figureheads. Although they often achieved expression and formal excellence in their generally primitive style, they remained artisans skilled in the craft of carving and constituted a group distinct from what we normally think of as ""sculptors"" in today's use of the word.On the rare occasion when a fine piece of sculpture was desired, Americans turned to foreign sculptors, as in the 1770's when the cities of New York and Charleston, South Carolina, commissioned the Englishman Joseph Wilton to make marble statues of William Pitt. Wilton also made a lead equestrian image of King George III that was created in New York in 1770 and torn down by zealous patriots six years later. A few marble memorials with carved busts, urns, or other decorations were produced in England and brought to the colonies to be set in the walls of churches-as in King's Chapel in Boston. But sculpture as a high art, practiced by artists who knew both the artistic theory of their Renaissance-Baroque-Rococo predecessors and the various technical procedures of modeling, casting, and carving rich three-dimensional forms, was not known among Americans in 1776. Indeed, for many years thereafter, the United States had two groups from which to choose - either the local craftspeople or the imported talent of European sculptors.The eighteenth century was not one in which powered sculptural conceptions were developed. Add to this the timidity with which unschooled artisans - originally trained as stonemasons, carpenters, or cabinetmakers - attacked the medium from which they sculpture made in the United States in the late eighteenth century.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test38/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Rent control is the system whereby the local government tells building owners how much they can charge their tenants in rent. In the United States, rent controls date back to at least World War II.In 1943 the federal government imposed rent controls to help solve the problem of housing shortages during wartime. The federal program ended after the war, but in some locations, including New York City, controls continued. Under New York's controls, a landlord generally cannot raise rents on apartments as long as the tenants continue to renew their leases. In places such as Santa Monica, California, rent controls are more recent. They were spurred by the inflation of the 1970's, which, combined with California's rapid population growth, pushed housing prices, as well as rents, to record levels. In 1979 Santa Monica's municipal government ordered landlords to roll back their rents to the levels charged in 1978. Future rents could only go up by two-thirds as much as any increase in the overall price level.In any housing market, rental prices perform three functions: (1) promoting the efficient maintenance of existing housing and stimulating the construction of new housing, (2) allocating existing scarce housing among competing claimants, and (3) rationing use of existing housing by potential renters.One result of rent control is a decrease in the construction of new rental units. Rent controls have artificially depressed the most important long-term determinant of profitability - rents. Consider some examples. In a recent year in Dallas, Texas, with a 16 percent rental vacancy rate but no rent control laws, 11,000 new housing units were built. In the same year, in San Francisco, California, only 2,000 units were built. The major difference? San Francisco has only a 1.6 percent vacancy rate but stringent rent control laws. In New York City, except for government-subsidized construction, the only rental units being built are luxury units, which are exempt from controls. In Santa Monica, California, new apartments are not being constructed. New office rental space and commercial developments are, however. They are exempt from rent controls.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test39/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Large animals that inhabit the desert have evolved a number of adaptations for reducing the effects of extreme heat. One adaptation is to be light in color, and to reflect rather than absorb the Sun's rays. Desert mammals also depart from the normal mammalian practice of maintaining a constant body temperature. Instead of trying to keep down the body temperature deep inside the body, which would involve the expenditure of water and energy, desert mammals allow their temperatures to rise to what would normally be fever height, and temperatures as high as 46 degrees Celsius have been measured in Grant's gazelles. The overheated body then cools down during the cold desert night, and indeed the temperature may fall unusually low by dawn, as low as 34 degrees Celsius in the camel. This is an advantage since the heat of the first few hours of daylight is absorbed in warming up the body, and an excessive buildup of heat does not begin until well into the day.Another strategy of large desert animals is to tolerate the loss of body water to a point that would be fatal for non-adapted animals. The camel can lose up to 30 percent of its body weight as water without harm to itself, whereas human beings die after losing only 12 to 13 percent of their body weight. An equally important adaptation is the ability to replenish this water loss at one drink. Desert animals can drink prodigious volumes in a short time, and camels have been known to imbibe over 100 liters in a few minutes. A very dehydrated person, on the other hand, cannot drink enough water to rehydrate at one session, because the human stomach is not sufficiently big and because a too rapid dilution of the body fluids causes death from water intoxication. The tolerance of water loss is of obvious advantage in the desert, as animals do not have to remain near a water hole but can obtain food from grazing sparse and far-flung pastures. Desert-adapted mammals have the further ability to feed normally when extremely dehydrated, it is a common experience in people that appetite is lost even under conditions of moderate thirst.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test40/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"With Robert Laurent and William Zorach, direct carving enters into the story of modern sculpture in the United States. Direct carving - in which the sculptors themselves carve stone or wood with mallet and chisel - must be recognized as something more than just a technique. Implicit in it is an aesthetic principle as well: that the medium has certain qualities of beauty and expressiveness with which sculptors must bring their own aesthetic sensibilities into harmony. For example, sometimes the shape or veining in a piece of stone or wood suggests, perhaps even dictates, not only the ultimate form, but even the subject matter.The technique of direct carving was a break with the nineteenth-century tradition in which the making of a clay model was considered the creative act and the work was then turned over to studio assistants to be cast in plaster or bronze or carved in marble. Neoclassical sculptors seldom held a mallet or chisel in their own hands, readily conceding that the assistants they employed were far better than they were at carving the finished marble.With the turn-of-the-century Crafts movement and the discovery of nontraditional sources of inspiration, such as wooden African figures and masks, there arose a new urge for hands-on, personal execution of art and an interaction with the medium. Even as early as the 1880's and 1890's, nonconformist European artists were attempting direct carving. By the second decade of the twentieth century, Americans - Laurent and Zorach most notably - had adopted it as their primary means of working.Born in France, Robert Laurent (1890-1970) was a prodigy who received his education in the United States. In 1905 he was sent to Paris as an apprentice to an art dealer, and in the years that followed he witnessed the birth of Cubism, discovered primitive art, and learned the techniques of woodcarving from a frame maker.Back in New York City by 1910, Laurent began carving pieces such as The Priestess, which reveals his fascination with African, pre-Columbian, and South Pacific art. Taking a walnut plank, the sculptor carved the expressive, stylized design. It is one of the earliest examples of direct carving in American sculpture. The plank's form dictated the rigidly frontal view and the low relief. Even its irregular shape must have appealed to Laurent as a break with a long-standing tradition that required a sculptor to work within a perfect rectangle or square.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test41/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Birds that feed in flocks commonly retire together into roosts. The reasons for roosting communally are not always obvious, but there are some likely benefits. In winter especially, it is important for birds to keep warm at night and conserve precious food reserves. One way to do this is to find a sheltered roost. Solitary roosters shelter in dense vegetation or enter a cavity - horned larks dig holes in the ground and ptarmigan burrow into snow banks - but the effect of sheltering is magnified by several birds huddling together in the roosts, as wrens, swifts, brown creepers, bluebirds, and anis do. Body contact reduces the surface area exposed to the cold air, so the birds keep each other warm. Two kinglets huddling together were found to reduce their heat losses by a quarter and three together saved a third of their heat.The second possible benefit of communal roosts is that they act as ""information centers."" During the day, parties of birds will have spread out to forage over a very large area. When they return in the evening some will have fed well, but others may have found little to eat. Some investigators have observed that when the birds set out again next morning, those birds that did not feed well on the previous day appear to follow those that did. The behavior of common and lesser kestrels may illustrate different feeding behaviors of similar birds with different roosting habits. The common kestrel hunts vertebrate animals in a small, familiar hunting ground, whereas the very similar lesser kestrel feeds on insects over a large area. The common kestrel roosts and hunts alone, but the lesser kestrel roosts and hunts in flocks, possibly so one bird can learn from others where to find insect swarms.Finally, there is safety in numbers at communal roosts since there will always be a few birds awake at any given moment to give the alarm. But this increased protection is partially counteracted by the fact that mass roosts attract predators and are especially vulnerable if they are on the ground. Even those in trees can be attacked by birds of prey. The birds on the edge are at greatest risk since predators find it easier to catch small birds perching at the margins of the roost.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test42/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Before the mid-nineteenth century, people in the United States ate most foods only in season. Drying, smoking, and salting could preserve meat for a short time, but the availability of fresh meat, like that of fresh milk, was very limited; there was no way to prevent spoilage. But in 1810 a French inventor named Nicolas Appert developed the cooking-and-sealing process of canning. And in the 1850's an American named Gail Borden developed a means of condensing and preserving milk. Canned goods and condensed milk became more common during the 1860's, but supplies remained low because cans had to be made by hand. By 1880, however, inventors had fashioned stamping and soldering machines that mass-produced cans from tinplate. Suddenly all kinds of food could be preserved and bought at all times of the year.Other trends and inventions had also helped make it possible for Americans to vary their daily diets. Growing urban populations created demand that encouraged fruit and vegetable farmers to raise more produce. Railroad refrigerator cars enabled growers and meat packers to ship perishables great distances and to preserve them for longer periods. Thus, by the 1890's, northern city dwellers could enjoy southern and western strawberries, grapes, and tomatoes, previously available for a month at most, for up to six months of the year. In addition, increased use of iceboxes enabled families to store perishables. An easy means of producing ice commercially had been invented I the 1870's, and by 1900 the nation had more than two thousand commercial ice plants, most of which made home deliveries. The icebox became a fixture in most homes and remained so until the mechanized refrigerator replaced it in the 1920's and 1930's.Almost everyone now had a more diversified diet. Some people continued to eat mainly foods that were heavy in starches or carbohydrates, and not everyone could afford meat. Nevertheless, many families could take advantage of previously unavailable fruits, vegetables, and dairy products to achieve more varied fare.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test43/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"The ability of falling cats to right themselves in midair and land on their feet has been a source of wonder for ages. Biologists long regarded it as an example of adaptation by natural selection, but for physicists it bordered on the miraculous. Newton's laws of motion assume that the total amount of spin of a body cannot change unless an external torque speeds it up or slows it down. If a cat has no spin when it is released and experiences no external torque, it ought not to be able to twist around as it falls.In the speed of its execution, the righting of a tumbling cat resembles a magician's trick. The gyrations of the cat in midair are too fast for the human eye to follow, so the process is obscured. Either the eye must be speeded up, or the cat's fall slowed down for the phenomenon to be observed. A century ago the former was accomplished by means of high-speed photography using equipment now available in any pharmacy. But in the nineteenth century the capture on film of a falling cat constituted a scientific experiment.The experiment was described in a paper presented to the Paris Academy in 1894. Two sequences of twenty photographs each, one from the side and one from behind, show a white cat in the act of righting itself. Grainy and quaint though they are, the photos show that the cat was dropped upside down, with no initial spin, and still landed on its body clockwise, the rear and tail twist counterclockwise, so that the total spin remains zero, in perfect accord with Newton's laws. Halfway down, the cat pulls in its legs before reversing its twist and then extends them again, with the desired end result. The explanation was that while no body can acquire spin without torque, a flexible one can readily change its orientation, or phase. Cats know this instinctively, but scientists could not be sure how it happened until they increased the speed of their perceptions a thousandfold.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test44/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"The changing profile of a city in the United States is apparent in the shifting definitions used by the United States Bureau of the Census. In 1870 the census officially distinguished the nation's ""urban"" from its ""rural"" population for the first time. ""Urban population"" was defined as persons living in towns of 8,000 inhabitants or more. But after 1900 it meant persons living in incorporated places having 2,500 or more inhabitants.Then, in 1950 the Census Bureau radically changed its definition of ""urban"" to take account of the new vagueness of city boundaries. In addition to persons living in incorporated units of 2,500 or more, the census now included those who lived in unincorporated units of that size, and also all persons living in the densely settled urban fringe, including both incorporated and unincorporated areas located around cities of 50,000 inhabitants or more. Each such unit, conceived as an integrated economic and social unit with a large population nucleus, was named a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA).Each SMSA would contain at least (a) one central city with 50,000 inhabitants or more or (b) two cities having shared boundaries and constituting, for general economic and social purposes, a single community with a combined population of at least 50,000, the smaller of which must have a population of at least 15,000. Such an area included the county in which the central city is located, and adjacent counties that are found to be metropolitan in character and economically and socially integrated with the country of the central city. By 1970, about two-thirds of the population of the United States was living in these urbanized areas, and of that figure more than half were living outside the central cities.While the Census Bureau and the United States government used the term SMSA (by 1969 there were 233 of them), social scientists were also using new terms to describe the elusive, vaguely defined areas reaching out from what used to be simple ""town"" and ""cities"". A host of terms came into use: ""metropolitan regions"", ""polynucleated population groups"", ""conurbations"", ""metropolitan clusters"", ""megalopolises"", and so on.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test45/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"In the 1600's when the Spanish moved into what later was to become the southwestern United States, they encountered the ancestors of the modern-day Pueblo, Hopi, and Zuni peoples. These ancestors, known variously as the Basket Makers, the Anasazi, or the Ancient Ones, had lived in the area for at least 2,000 years. They were an advanced agricultural people who used irrigation to help grow their crops.The Anasazi lived in houses constructed of adobe and wood. Anasazi houses were originally built in pits and were entered from the roof. But around the year 700 A.D., the Anasazi began to build their homes above ground and join them together into rambling multistoried complexes, which the Spanish called pueblos or villages. Separate subterranean rooms in these pueblos, known as kivas or chapels, were set aside for religious ceremonials. Each kiva had a fire pit and a hole that was believed to lead to the underworld. The largest pueblos had five stories and more than 800 rooms.The Anasazi family was matrilinear, that is, descent was traced through the female. The sacred objects of the family were under the control of the oldest female, but the ritual ceremonies were conducted by her brother or son. Women owned the rooms in the pueblo and the crops, once they were harvested. While still growing, crops belonged to the man who, in contrast to most other Native American groups, planted them. The women made baskets and pottery, the men wove textile and crafted turpoise jewelry.Each village had two chiefs. The village chief dealt with land disputes and religious affairs. The war chief led the men in fighting during occasional conflicts that broke out with neighboring villages and directed the men in community building projects.

"Barbed wire, first patented in the United States in 1867, played an important part in the development of American farming, as it enabled the settlers to make effective fencing to enclose their land and keep cattle away from their crops. This had a considerable effect on cattle ranching, since the herds no longer had unrestricted use of the plans for grazing, and the fencing led to conflict between the farmers and the cattle ranchers.Before barbed wire came into general use, fencing was often made from serrated wire, which was unsatisfactory because it broke easily when under strain, and could snap in cold weather due to contraction. The first practical machine for producing barbed wire was invented in 1874 by an Illinois farmer, and between then and the end of the century about 400 types of barbed wire were devised, of which only about a dozen were ever put to practical use.Modern barbed wire is made from mild steel high-tensile steel, or aluminum. Mild steel and aluminum barbed wire have two strands twisted together to form a cable which is stronger than single-strand wire and less affected by temperature changes. Single-strand wire, round or oval, is made from high-tensile steel with the barbs crimped or welded on. The steel wires used are galvanized - coated with zinc to make them rustproof. The two wires that make up the line wire or cable are fed separately into a machine at one end. They leave it at the other end twisted-together and barbed. The wire to make the barbs is fed into the machine from the sides and cut to length by knives that cut diagonally through the wire to produce a sharp point. This process continues automatically, and the finished barbed wire is wound onto reels, usually made of wire in length of 400 meters or in weights of up to 50 kilograms.A variation of barbed wire is also used for military purposes. It is formed into long cojis or entanglements called concertina wire.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test47/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Under certain circumstance the human body must cope with gases at greater-than-normal atmospheric pressure. For example, gas pressures increase rapidly during a dive made with scuba gear because the breathing equipment allows divers to stay underwater longer and dive deeper. The pressure exerted on the human body increases by 1 atmosphere for every 10 meters of depth in seawater, so that at 30 meters in seawater a diver is exposed to a pressure of about 4 atmospheres. The pressure of the gases being breathed must equal the external pressure applied to the body; otherwise breathing is very difficult. Therefore all of the gases in the air breathed by a scuba diver at 40 meters are present at five times their usual pressure. Nitrogen which composes 80 percent of the air we breathe usually causes a balmy feeling of well-being at this pressure. At a depth of 5 atmospheres nitrogen causes symptoms resembling alcohol intoxication known as nitrogen narcosis. Nitrogen narcosis apparently results from a direct effect on the brain of the large amounts of nitrogen dissolved in the blood. Deep dives are less dangerous if helium is substituted for nitrogen, because under these pressures helium does not exert a similar narcotic effect.As a scuba diver descends, the pressure of nitrogen in the lungs increases. Nitrogen then diffuses from the lungs to the blood and from the blood to body tissues. The reverse occurs when the diver surfaces; the nitrogen pressure in the lungs falls and the nitrogen diffuses from the tissues into the blood and from the blood into the lungs. If the return to the surface is too rapid, nitrogen in the tissues and blood cannot diffuse out rapidly enough and nitrogen bubbles are formed. They can cause severe pains, particularly around the joints.Another complication may result if the breath is held during ascent. During ascent from a depth of 10 meters, the volume of air in the lungs will double because the air pressure at the surface is only half of what it was at 10 meters. This change in volume may cause the lungs to distend and even rupture. This condition is called air embolism. To avoid this event, a diver must ascent slowly, never at a rate exceeding the rise of the exhaled air bubbles, and must exhale during ascent.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test48/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Each advance in microscopic technique has provided scientists with new perspectives on the function of living organisms and the nature of matter itself. The invention of the visible-light microscope late in the sixteenth century introduced a previously unknown realm of single-celled plants and animals. In the twentieth century, electron microscopes have provided direct views of viruses and minuscule surface structures. Now another type of microscope, one that utilize x-rays rather than light or electrons, offers a different way of examining tiny details, it should extend human perception still farther into the natural world.The dream of building an x-ray microscope dates to 1895, its development, however, was virtually halted in the 1940's because the development of the electron microscope was progressing rapidly. During the 1940's electron microscopes routinely achieved resolution better than that possible with a visible-light microscope, while the performance of x-ray microscopes resisted improvement. In recent years, however, interest in x-ray microscopes has revived, largely because of advances such as the development of new sources of x-ray illumination. As a result, the brightness available today is millions of times that of x-ray tubes, which, for most of the century, were the only available sources of soft x-rays.The new x-ray microscopes considerably improve on the resolution provided by optical microscopes. They can also be used to map the distribution of certain chemical elements. Some can form pictures in extremely short times, others hold the promise of special capabilities such as three dimensional imaging. Unlike conventional electron microscopy, x-ray microscopy enables specimens to be kept in air and in water, which means that biological samples can be studied under conditions similar to their natural state. The illumination used, so-called soft x-rays in the wavelength range of twenty to forty angstroms (an angstrom is one ten-billionth of a meter), is also sufficiently penetrating to image intact biological cells in many cases. Because of the wavelength of the x-rays used, soft x-ray microscopes will never match the highest resolution possible with electron microscopes. Rather, their special properties will make possible investigations that will complement those performed with light- and electron-based instruments.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test49/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Perhaps the most striking quality of satiric literature is its freshness, its originality of perspective. Satire rarely offers original ideas. Instead it presents the familiar in a new form. Satirists do not offer the world new philosophies. What they do is look at familiar conditions from a perspective that makes these conditions seem foolish, harmful or affected. Satire jars us out of complacence into a pleasantly shocked realization that many of the values we unquestioningly accept are false. Don Quixote makes chivalry seem absurd, Brave New World ridicules the pretensions of science, A Modest proposal dramatizes starvation by advocating cannibalism. None of these ideas is original. Chivalry was suspect before Cervantes, humanists objected to the claims of pure science before Aldous Huxley and people were aware of famine before Swift. It was not the originality of the idea that made these satires popular. It was the manner of expression the satiric method that made them interesting and entertaining. Satires are read because they are aesthetically satisfying works of art, not because they are morally wholesome or ethically instructive. They are stimulating and refreshing because with commonsense briskness they brush away illusions and secondhand opinions. With spontaneous irreverence, satire rearranges perspectives, scrambles familiar objects into incongruous juxtaposition and speaks in a personal idiom instead of abstract platitude.Satire exists because there is need for it. It has lived because readers appreciate a refreshing stimulus, an irreverent reminder that they lived in a world of platitudinous thinking, cheap moralizing, and foolish philosophy. Satire serves to prod people into an awareness of truth though rarely to any action on behalf of truth. Satire tends to remind people that much of what they see, hear, and read in popular media is sanctimonious, sentimental, and only partially true. Life resembles in only a slight degree the popular image of it. Soldiers rarely hold the ideals that movies attribute to them, nor do ordinary citizens devote their lives to unselfish service of humanity.

"Galaxies are the major building blocks of the universe. A galaxy is giant family of many millions of stars, and it is held together by its own gravitational field. Most of the material universe is organized into galaxies of stars together with gas and dust.There are three main types of galaxy: spiral, elliptical, and irregular. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, a flattish disc of stars with two spiral arms emerging from its central nucleus. About one-quarter of all galaxies have this shape. Spiral galaxies are well supplied with the interstellar gas in which new stars form: as the rotating spiral pattern sweeps around the galaxy it compresses gas and dust, triggering the formation of bright young stars and in its arms. The elliptical galaxies have a symmetrical elliptical or spheroidal shape with no obvious structure. Most of their member stars are very old and since ellipticals are devoid of interstellar gas, no new stars are forming in them. The biggest and brightest galaxies in the universe are ellipticals with masses of about 1013 times that of the Sun, these giants may frequently be sources of strong radio emission, in which case they are called radio galaxies. About two-thirds of all galaxies are elliptical. Irregular galaxies comprise about one-tenth of all galaxies and they come in many subclasses.Measurement in space is quite different from measurement on Earth. Some terrestrial distances can be expressed as intervals of time, the time to fly from one continent to another or the time it takes to drive to work, for example. By comparison with these familiar yardsticks, the distances to the galaxies are incomprehensibly large, but they too are made more manageable by using a time calibration, in this case the distance that light travels in one year. On such a scale the nearest giant spiral galaxy, the Andromeda galaxy, is two million light years away. The most distant luminous objects seen by telescopes are probably ten thousand million light years away. Their light was already halfway here before the Earth even formed. The light from the nearby Virgo galaxy set out when reptiles still dominated the animal world.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test51/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Beads were probably the first durable ornaments humans possessed, and the intimate relationship they had with their owners is reflected in the fact that beads are among the most common items found in ancient archaeological sites. In the past, as today, men, women, and children adorned themselves with beads. In some cultures still, certain beads are often worn from birth until death, and then are buried with their owners for the afterlife. Abrasion due to daily wear alters the surface features of beads, and if they are buried for long, the effects of corrosion can further change their appearance. Thus, interest is imparted to the bead both by use and the effects of time.Besides their wearability, either as jewelry or incorporated into articles of attire, beads possess the desirable characteristics of every collectible, they are durable, portable, available in infinite variety, and often valuable in their original cultural context as well as in today's market. Pleasing to look at and touch, beads come in shapes, colors, and materials that almost compel one to handle them and to sort them.Beads are miniature bundles of secrets waiting to be revealed: their history, manufacture, cultural context, economic role, and ornamental use are all points of information one hopes to unravel. Even the most mundane beads may have traveled great distances and been exposed to many human experiences. The bead researcher must gather information from many diverse fields. In addition to having to be a generalist while specializing in what may seem to be a narrow field, the researcher is faced with the problem of primary materials that have little or no documentation. Many ancient beads that are of ethnographic interest have often been separated from their original cultural context.The special attractions of beads contribute to the uniqueness of bead research. While often regarded as the ""small change of civilizations"", beads are a part of every culture, and they can often be used to date archaeological sites and to designate the degree of mercantile, technological, and cultural sophistication.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test52/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"In the world of birds, bill design is a prime example of evolutionary fine-tuning. Shorebirds such as oystercatchers use their bills to pry open the tightly sealed shells of their prey, hummingbirds have stiletto-like bills to probe the deepest nectar-bearing flowers, and kiwis smell out earthworms thanks to nostrils located at the tip of their beaks. But few birds are more intimately tied to their source of sustenance than are crossbills. Two species of these finches, named for the way the upper and lower parts of their bills cross, rather than meet in the middle, reside in the evergreen forests of North America and feed on the seeds held within the cones of coniferous trees.The efficiency of the bill is evident when a crossbill locates a cone. Using a lateral motion of its lower mandible, the bird separates two overlapping scales on the cone and exposes the seed. The crossed mandibles enable the bird to exert a powerful biting force at the bill tips, which is critical for maneuvering them between the scales and spreading the scales apart. Next, the crossbill snakes its long tongue into the gap and draws out the seed. Using the combined action of the bill and tongue, the bird cracks open and discards the woody seed covering action and swallows the nutritious inner kernel. This whole process takes but a few seconds and is repeated hundreds of times a day.The bills of different crossbill species and subspecies vary - some are stout and deep, others more slander and shallow. As a rule, large-billed crossbills are better at securing seeds from large cones, while small-billed crossbills are more deft at removing the seeds from small, thin-scaled cones. Moreover, the degree to which cones are naturally slightly open or tightly closed helps determine which bill design is the best.One anomaly is the subspecies of red crossbill known as the Newfoundland crossbill. This bird has a large, robust bill, yet most of Newfoundland's conifers have small cones, the same kind of cones that the slender-billed white-wings rely on.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test53/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"If you look closely at some of the early copies of the Declaration of Independence, beyond the flourished signature of John Hancock and the other 55 men who signed it, you will also find the name of one woman, Mary Katherine Goddard. It was she, a Baltimore printer, who published the first official copies of the Declaration, the first copies that included the names of its signers and therefore heralded the support of all thirteen colonies.Mary Goddard first got into printing at the age of twenty-four when her brother opened a printing shop in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1762. When he proceeded to get into trouble with his partners and creditors, it was Mary Goddard and her mother who were left to run the shop. In 1765 they began publishing the Providence Gazette, a weekly newspaper. Similar problems seemed to follow her brother as he opened businesses in Philadelphia and again in Baltimore. Each time Ms. Goddard was brought in to run the newspapers. After starting Baltimore's first newspaper, The Maryland Journal, in 1773, her brother went broke trying to organize a colonial postal service. While he was in debtor's prison. Mary Katherine Goddard's name appeared on the newspaper's masthead for the first time.When the Continental Congress fled there from Philadelphia in 1776, it commissioned Ms. Goddard to print the first official version of the Declaration of Independence in January 1777. After printing the documents, she herself paid the post riders to deliver the Declaration throughout the colonies.During the American Revolution, Mary Goddard continued to publish Baltimore's only newspaper, which one historian claimed was ""second to none among the colonies"". She was also the city's postmaster from 1775 to 1789 - appointed by Benjamin Franklin - and is considered to be the first woman to hold a federal position.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test54/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Hotels were among the earliest facilities that bound the United States together. They were both creatures and creators of communities, as well as symptoms of the frenetic quest for community. Even in the first part of the nineteenth century, Americans were private, business and pleasure purposes. Conventions were the new occasions, and hotels were distinctively American facilities making conventions possible. The first national convention of a major party to choose a candidate for President (that of the National Republican party, which met on December 12, 1831, and nominated Henry Clay for President) was held in Baltimore, at a hotel that was then reputed to be the best in the country. The presence in Baltimore of Barnum's City Hotel, a six-story building with two hundred apartments helps explain why many other early national political conventions were held there.In the longer run, too. American hotels made other national conventions not only possible but pleasant and convivial. The growing custom of regularly assembling from afar the representatives of all kinds of groups - not only for political conventions, but also for commercial, professional, learned, and avocational ones - in turn supported the multiplying hotels. By mid-twentieth century, conventions accounted for over third of the yearly room occupancy of all hotels in the nation, about eighteen thousand different conventions were held annually with a total attendance of about ten million persons.Nineteenth-century American hotelkeepers, who were no longer the genial, deferential ""hosts"" of the eighteenth-century European inn, became leading citizens. Holding a large stake in the community, they exercised power to make it prosper. As owners or managers of the local ""palace of the public"", they were makers and shapers of a principal community attraction. Travelers from abroad were mildly shocked by this high social position.",C1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/advanced/test55/index.html,englishteststore,{}

Now, however, there is proof that dolphins may be even cleverer than these big apes.Although a dolphin lives in the sea it is not a fish. It is a mammal. It is in many ways, therefore, like a human being.Dolphins have a simple language. They are able to talk to one another. It may be possible for man to learn how to talk to dolphins. But this will not be easy because dolphins can not hear the kind of sounds man can make. If man wants to talk to dolphins, therefore, he will have to make a third language which both he and the dolphins can understand.Dolphins are also very friendly towards man. They often follow ships.

So determined was she that she taught school and gave music lessons to earn money for her tuition.In 1849, after graduation from medical school, she decided to further her education in Paris. She wanted to be a surgeon, but a serious eye infection forced her to abandon the idea. Upon returning to the United States, she found it difficult to start her own practice because she was a woman.

"Man discovered fire many thousands of years ago: The first time he saw fire was probably when a tree was struck by lightning. He soon learned how to make fire for himself. However man probably made his first fire by rubbing two sticks together.Fire was very important to man. He needed to keep himself warm at night. He used fire to cook his food. He used fire to frighten away enemies and wild animals. In some parts of the world he used fire to signal messages. Red Indians, for example, used fire to make smoke signals. In some other countries people lit fires to warn their friends of danger.Fire was also used to give light. Before the invention of the oil lamp, men used burning sticks as torches. And before man discovered gas and electricity, he hung small fires in wire baskets from post to light the streets.One man even used fire to tell the time. He invented a candle clock. He made a candle that took exactly twelve hours to burn. Then he marked this candle in twelve equal parts. He lit the candle and could tell the time by counting the number of parts left of the burning candle. But the candle clock did not always work well.

The teaching of the Barbizon school, which stressed the use of colour and the creation of an impression or a mood influenced many American artists. One group of American painters led by James McNeil Whistler and John Singer Sargent, expatriated themselves from the American scene and settled in Europe. Whistler, who is often ranked as the greatest genius in the history of American art, was a versatile and industrious artist who was equally proficient in several media - oil, water colour, etching, and with several themes - portraits and his so-called ""nocturnes"", impressionistic sketches of moonlight on water and other scenes.

"About three thousand years ago, there were no shops. If you needed something you had to make it yourself. For example, if you needed something to wear, you had to kill an animal and get its coat. If you were a good hunter, and had a lot of coats, you could exchange them for other things you needed. You could get meat, fruit or an axe. This way of exchanging things is called barter.Later on, people began to use money. They made money from thing which would last and not go bad easily. They used stones, shells and animals' teeth. After men had discovered metal into small bars to use copper, tin, silver and gold. They made these metals into small bars so that they were easy to store and carry about. Before there were banks, people kept their money themselves. Most people hid their money in the ground. They thought that it was the safest place to store money.About five hundred years later, people began to make coins. They were easier to carry than metal bars. Early coins were not flat and round but were in lumps. Usually the king or ruler of a place gave the order to make coins. Therefore, people often put a picture of his head and his name on one side of the coin. This side of the coin is called the head. Then they put the date and value of the coin on the other side. This side is called the tail.The first paper money was made by the Chinese. In the fifteenth century, the first banks appeared in Italy.

They need less space and are easier to look after.If you want to have a pet, you can buy one from a pet shop but you must be careful not to buy a sick animal. It is best if you know something about the pet you want. This helps you choose a healthy pet. However, if you do not have much money and know very little about animals, you can visit the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA).The first society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was founded in England in 1821. It was set up to make sure that all animals are treated with kindness. The RSPCA in HongKong carries out this aim. The RSPCA officers collect animals which have no homes and are left in the street. They look after them until they are healthy again. People visiting the RSPCA may choose their pets from these animals and you can be sure that you will get a healthy pet. If later your pet becomes ill, you can take it to the doctors at the RSPCA for treatment.When you have a pet, it is very important that you look after it properly. You must remember to feed it at suitable times. You should also give it a clean and comfortable place to rest.

"You should keep in mind that your job will help determine your future friends and the place where you will live, as well as your income. In other words, your career means more than just a certain kind of work, it represents a way of life.Another point to be aware of in choosing your career is the effect this decision has on your present life. Some people think that students who have a career in mind do better work in school than those having no plans for themselves after graduation. Others disagree and claim that students are better off if they keep an open mind and seek a broad base of knowledge before deciding on a career.One serious problem faces you when you select a vocational goal: making the right choice for yourself. You should think carefully and make a tentative choice at first. It may develop into a permanent goal or it may not. But keep an open mind until you know more about the occupation. This will give you an opportunity to seek general knowledge before you attempt to specialize. You will find a general educational background to be useful and necessary in almost any job.When you select an occupation, remember to select a job that you think you can do best, both for your own satisfaction and the good of all: You should choose a vocation that will be a challenge to you and yet one in which you can achieve success through your abilities.",A2,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/elementary/test23/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Many people now think that teachers give pupils too much homework. They say that it is unnecessary for children to work at home in their free time. Moreover, they argue that most teachers do not properly plan the homework task they give to pupils. The result is that pupils have to repeat tasks which they have already done at school.Recently in Greece many parents complained about the difficult homework which teachers gave to their children. The parents said that most of the homework was a waste of time, and they wanted to stop it. Spain and Turkey are two countries which stopped homework recently. In Denmark, Germany and several other countries in Europe, teachers cannot set homework at weekends. In Holland, teachers allow pupils to stay at school to do their homework.The children are free to help one another. Similar arrangements also exist in some British schools.Most people agree that homework is unfair. A pupil who can do his homework in a quiet and comfortable room is in a much better position than a pupil who does his homework in a small, noisy room with the television on. Some parents help their children with their homework. Other parents take no interest at all in their children's homework.It is important, however, that teachers talk to parents about homework. A teacher should suggest suitable tasks for parents to do with their children. Parents are often better at teaching their own children.",A2,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/elementary/test24/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Can dolphin talk may be they cannot talk with words, but they talk with sounds. They show their felling with sounds.Dolphins travel in a group. We call a group offish a ""school"".

They tell when they are happier sad or afraid. They said ""Welcome"" when a dolphin comes back to the school. They talk when they play. They make a few sounds above water. They make many more sounds under water. People can not hear these sounds because they are very, very high. Scientists make tapes of the sounds and study them.Sometimes people catch a dolphin for a large aquarium, (an aquarium is a zoom for fish). People can watch the dolphins in a show. Dolphins do not like to be away from their school in an aquarium. They are sad and lonely.There are many stories about dolphins they help people. Sometimes they save somebody's life.

"There are books with fairy tales in many countries. Often the same stories are known and repeated in many different languages. Some of the things that happen in these stories are remarkable, although not as remarkable as things that are truly happening in medicine and science today.Most fairy tales begin with ""Once upon a time"" and end with ""They lived happily ever after"", so we will begin in the same way.Once upon a time, there was a girl called Cinderella who did all the work in the kitchen while her lazy sisters did nothing. One night her sisters went to a ball at the palace. Cinderella was left at home, very sad. After a time her fairy godmother appeared and told Cinderella that she could go to the ball- but to return home by midnight.So she went to the ball in a beautiful dress and a wonderful coach. She danced with the prince but at midnight she ran back home, leaving one of her shoes on the dance floor.

We saw a duck come along with tree ducklings paddling cheerfully behind her. As we watched them, there was a sudden swirl in the water. We caught a glimpse of the vicious jaws of a pikea fish which is rather like a fresh water shark - and one of the ducklings was dragged below the surface.The incident made Peter furious. He vowed to catch the pike. On three successive mornings we returned to the vicinity and used several different kinds of bait. On the third day, Peter was lucky. Using an artificial frog as bait, he managed to hook the monster. There was a desperate fight but Peter was determined to capture the pike and he succeeded.

"Making a film takes a long time and is a very hard work. Writing the story for the film may take many weeks. Filming the story being acted - or shooting the film, as it is called - often takes at least six months. Actors and cameramen work from very early in the morning until late at night. Each scene may have to be acted twenty or thirty times.The film studio is like a large factory, and the indoor stages are very big indeed. Scenery of all kinds is made in the studio: churches, houses, castles and forests are all built of wood and cardboard. Several hundred people work together to make one film. Some of these people are the actors and actresses. The director of the film, however, is the most important person in a film studio. He decided how the scenes should be filmed and how the actors should act.Most people go to see a film because they know the film stars in it. Sometimes the film may be very poor. It is best to choose a film made by a good director. Some famous directors make their films very real.

"Human memory, formerly believed to be rather inefficient, is really more sophisticated than that of a computer. Researchers approaching the problem from a variety of points of view have all concluded that there is a great deal more stored in our minds than has been generally supposed. Dr. Wilder Penned, a Canadian neurosurgeon, proved that by stimulating the brain electrically, he could elicit the total recall of specific events in his subjects' lives. Even dreams and other minor events supposedly forgotten for many years suddenly emerged in detail.Although the physical basic for memory is not yet understood, one theory is that the fantastic capacity for store in the brain is the result of an almost unlimited communication of interconnections between brain cells, stimulated by patterns of activity. Repeated references to the same information support recall. Or, to say that another way, improved performance is the result of strengthening the chemical bonds in the memory.",A2,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/elementary/test30/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Most people think that the older you get, the harder it is to learn a new language. That is, they believe that children learn more easily efficiently than adults. Thus, at some point in our lives, maybe around age 12 or 13; we lost the ability to learn well. Is this idea fact or myth?Is it true that children learn a foreign language more efficiently than adults? On the contrary, research studies suggest that the opposite may be true. One report, on 2000 Danish children studying Swedish, concluded that the teenagers learned more, in less time, than the younger children. Another report, on Americans learning Russian, showed a direct improvement of ability over the age. Range tested, that is, the ability to learn increased as the age increased, from childhood to adulthood.There are several possible explanations for these findings. For one thing, adults know more about the world and therefore are able to understand meanings more easily than children. Moreover, adult can you use logical thinking to help themselves see patterns in the language. Finally, adult have more selfdiscipline than children.All in all, it seems that the common idea that children are better language learners than adults may not be fact, but myth, the main idea in this short talk was that.",A2,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/elementary/test31/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"When you put a letter into the postbox, do you know what will happen to it?First of all, a postman will come in a van to collect all the mail from it. The mail is collected at fixed times, usually once in the afternoon. These collection times are shown on each postbox. The van will then take the mail to the nearest post office.The mail going to places in the same district will be put together. A machine will chop the stamps so that they can not be used again. Then postmen will arrange the letters into bundles and pack them into their postbox.The work of a postman is not easy. He often has to get up very early. He has to work outdoors in all the weathers. He must be strong in older to carry his heavy postage. He sometimes has to read bad writing. Can you read address on this envelope? It is very difficult for postman to deliver mail quickly and correctly when addresses are not written clearly.Do you know the proper way to send a letter? If you are writing to someone in Hong Kong, you should use a white envelope. If you want Lo send a letter to a country outside Hong Kong, you should use an envelope bordered by red and blue stripes. Also you should write the name and address clearly and correctly on the envelope. Letters and small parcels can be posted in postboxes or at a post office.

It is their way of saying that they are looking for a wife.Birds also sing to tell other birds to keep away. To a bird, his tree or even a branch of a tree, is his home. He does not want strangers coming near him, so he sings to warn them.If a bird can not sing well, he usually has some other means of giving important information.

"The umbrella is a very ordinary object. It keeps the rain and the sun of people. Most umbrellas fold up, so it is easy to carry them.However, the umbrella did not begin life as an ordinary object. It was a sign of royalty or importance. Some African tribes still use umbrellas in this way today. Someone caries an umbrella and walks behind the king or important person.Umbrellas are very old. The Chinese had them in the eleventh century BC. From there they traveled to India, Persia, and Egypt. In Greece and Rome, men would not use them. They believed umbrellas were only for women.When the Spanish explorers went to Mexico, they saw the Aztec .kings using umbrellas. English explorers saw Native American princes carrying umbrellas on the east coast of North America.

"Isn't it amazing how much time we spend speaking about food? Have you ever eaten …? ""What did you have for lunch?"" and so on. And yet when you travel from one country to another, find that people have quite different feelings about food. People often feel that what they eat is normal and that what other people eat is strange or silly. In most parts of Asia, for example no meal is complete without rice. In England, people eat potatoes everyday. In the Middle East, bread is the main part of every meal. Eating, like so many things we do, becomes a habit which is difficult to change. Americans like to drink tea and coffee four or five times everyday, Australians drink a large amount of beer and the French drink wine everyday.The sort of meat people like to eat also differs from one country to another. Horse meat is thought to be delicious in France. In Hong Kong, some people enjoy eating snakes. New Zealand eat sheep, but they never eat goat meat. The Japanese don't like to eat sheep meat because of its smell, but they enjoy eating raw fish.So it seems that although eating is a topic that we can talk about for hours, there is very little common sense in what we say about it.

"The diseases connected to smoking are a big problem. Doctors think that the annual medical cost for lung cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses connected to smoking is between 12 and 35 million pounds.And smoking costs society money in other ways. Between 27 and 61 billion pounds are spent each year on sick days when people don't go to work, on wages that you don't get when you don't go to work, and on work lost at the company when you are sick.This money counts the wages from people who die of cancer at young age and stop paying taxes. This does not count fire started by cigarettes, which kill fifteen hundred people yearly and injure another four thousand. Smoking costs every man, woman arid child in the UK from one hundred and ten to two hundred and fifty pounds each year in the lost work and wages. When you add another fifty to one hundred and fifty pounds yearly in insurance cost, that comes to one hundred and sixty to four hundred and ten pounds. If everyone stopped smoking, a family of four could have up to one thousand six hundred and forty pounds a year more.Smoking will also cause other problems. People who don't smoke will live longer, and so they will take money from the government when they are old. But they will also work for more years 'and pay more taxes.In the end, the value of a non-smoking nation is not in pounds.

"The elephants left the shade, crossed an open piece of grass between bushes, and came towards the mud-pool where my truck was parked. One by one, they arrived on the shore, but, just as they seemed to be about to bathe in the inviting muddy liquid, they became aware of the silent truck with its tell-tale smell of man. The leading elephant merely spread her ears and cautiously backed away taking the young elephants with her.A smaller mother elephant continued to stand next to the pool, however, swinging her long trunk and swaying her head from side to side always keeping an eye on the truck. The baby elephant behind her held up his head, waving his trunk to sample the suspicious smell in the wind. The mother elephant seemed to be uncertain about whether to come on and investigate the truck or to back away with the others. Finally she made up her mind and slowly advanced on the truck. Her ears were half out, and her trunk moved inquiringly towards the vehicle and then back under her stomach in a rhythmic swing.I was fascinated by this close approach. Never before had I been able to see the hairiness around the jaw, nor smell the warm scent of elephant which now reach me in concentrated waves. The mother elephant's steps were slow but determined, and brought her to within a couple of metres of me.She gave the impression of being intensely curious about this metal object which had appeared in her world and behaved as if it were itself an animal. I wondered how far she would accept the situation and, if after all the centuries of men killing elephants, she would ever allow me to approach her on foot.

"The sun was going down beyond great banks of cloud which were full of orange-pink light. It would usually be time for Joe to be going in but he didn't want to go back if Aunt Daisy and Uncle Ted were still there, because his mother would only send him straight to bed out of the way. So he turned away from home and walked down the lane past the football field, kicking a stone before him at the risk of scratching the toes of his best brown shoes. A couple of dogs, one large, black and smooth-haired, the other smaller with a long black and white coat, played on the edge of the field, running round, jumping at each other and sometimes rolling over and over together, totally content in each other's company.Joe watched them for a moment or two and walked on. Twenty minutes later he was on the riverside and half-way round the circle he had set out to walk from the town and back again. On his way he had passed several couples and one or two family groups returning from their Sunday evening walk; but now there was no one about except one man resting on the grass between the path and the river bank. When Joe realised that it was his father, his surprise was so great that the he stopped. Then his father, who had been leaning on his arm and looking into the river, looked round, but did not seem surprised to see him.Hello, Joe, he said dully. He went back to staring at the river. The fact that he was wearing his best clothes somehow added to the strangeness of his sitting there alone like this, and as Joe looked at him he was conscious for the first time of a sense of his father as not his father, but as someone Without connection With himself: as a man, with thoughts and feelings outside their existence as father and son. He saw, for the first time, his father as a person carrying about with him a world of his own, and he had an indefinite sense of this world of his father's extending back to a time and a life before he himself was born.

"Let children learn to judge their own work. A child learning to talk does not learn by being corrected all the time: if corrected too much, he will stop talking. He notices a thousand times a day the difference between the language he uses and the language those around him use. Bit by bit, he makes the necessary changes to make his language like other people's. In the same way, children learning to do all the other things, they learn to do without being taught - to walk, run, climb, whistle, ride a bicycle - compare their own performances with those of more skilled people, and slowly make the needed changes. But in school we never give a child a chance to find out his mistakes for himself, let alone correct them. We do it all for him. We act as if we thought that he would never notice a mistake unless it was pointed out to him, or correct it unless he was made to. Soon he becomes dependent on the teacher. Let him do it himself. Let him work out, with the help of other children if he wants it, what this word says, what the answer is to that problem, whether this is a good way of saying or doing this or not.If it is a matter of right answer, as it may be in mathematics or science, give him the answer book. Let him correct his own papers. Why should we teachers waste time on such routine work? Our job should be to help the child when he tells us that he can't find the way to get the right answer.

The idea that there is a body of knowledge to be learnt at school and used for the rest of one's life is nonsense in a world as complicated and rapidly changing as ours.

"A new British medical instrument is about to change dramatically our ability to recognise disease hidden inside the body. It is called the magnetic scanner, and it gives information about the body which current machines, such as the brain scanner and the more recent body, scanner, cannot provide. And unlike existing machines the new machine does not use X-ray radiation waves, which makes it much safer for patients.Unlike existing scanners, a magnetic scanner can show the side or the back of a suspect part of the body. Used on, for example, a lung with suspected damage, it can turn the image of the lung to give a series of different views. The image is not simply worked out in the computer's ""imagination""; the magnetic scanner actually examines every side of the lung.When examining the softer part of the body with existing scanners, doctors frequently have to use a ""contrast medium"" to make a muscular organ show up to X-ray waves, the usual ""contract medium"" given to patients before a stomach X-ray scan takes place is harmless, but for some brain-scans so that it passes into the brain, this is unpleasant and painful and it can be dangerous. The magnetic scanner needs no ""contrast medium"".The new machine can also see in greater detail than ever before. Growths of all kinds show up clearly on the brain and so do the dead patches which are the signs of the disease, multiple sclerosis. Until now patients complaining of double vision or an inability to control their muscles from time to time could be suffering from multiple sclerosis or, equally, from some much more easily cured disease and a brain scanner could no distinguish between these with certainty. The doctor can now definitely say whether or not cancer or multiple sclerosis is present. Previously, these diseases have been missed and patients have been given false information about their health. The technique is still improving with great speed: pictures produced a couple of years ago look very simple compared with those of today.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test05/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"You would like to take good photographs of real life situations but you have few ideas for pictures. I suggest you look around you. The everyday world is full of scenes being played by an ever-changing group of actors. You probably passed a dozen picture situations without noticing on your way to work this morning.The realistic approach to photography has been perfected in the past by such masters as Henri Carties-Bresson and Bill Brandt. But while you can learn a great deal from looking at the work of others, any success you can hope to achieve in this field has to come from developing an individual approach.The main requirement for any photographer has little to do with technical matters. You must develop an awareness of the world around you and the people who inhabit it, and you should learn to notice when a situation may develop to a point where you will be able to take a good picture. Those who have searched his happy state will be prepared when that moment arises, and will simply raise their camera quickly and shoot. Others who are not so aware will be struggling with camera cases and lens caps.Film manufacturers must be delighted at the thought of the inexperienced photographer setting out in search of the right situation and the right moment. Many miles of costly material have passed through thousands of cameras as this endless search continues. But although a lot of this waste must be put down to inexperience, you'll find that even the professionals have to use a lot of film when they are out of shooting.Not every shot is going to be a winner. If you look at the work of even the, best photographers you'll notice dozens of pictures have had to be taken only because they lead up to the successful shot of a situation that the photographer has obviously been observing through the lens. You may find that you have taken one or two pictures after the right moment has passed as well. There is seldom more than one shot which stands out. There is just one point where it all comes together, and you often have to waste film to catch that precious moment.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test06/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Having reached the highest point of our route according to plan we discovered something the map had not told us. It was impossible to climb down into the Kingo valley. The river lay deep between mountain sides that were almost vertical. We couldnt find any animal tracks, which usually show the best way across country, and the slopes were covered so thickly with bushes that we could not see the nature of the ground. We had somehow to break through to the river which would give us our direction out of the mountain into the inhabited lowlands.Our guide cut a narrow path through the bushes with his long knife and we followed in single file. Progress was slow. Then, when we thought we had really reached the river, we found ourselves instead on the edge of a cliff with a straight drop of 1,000 feet to the water below. We climbed back up the slope and began to look for another way down. We climbed, slipped, sweated and scratched our hands to pieces and finally arrived at the river. Happily we strode downhill along its bank without having to cut our way. However, after a few miles the river entered a steep-sided gap between rocks and suddenly dropped thirty-five feet over a waterfall. There was no path alongside it and no way round it.Then one of the guides saw a way of overcoming the difficulty. There was a fallen tree lying upside down over the waterfall with its leafy top resting on the opposite bank below the falls. Without hesitation he climbed down the slippery trunk to show us how easy it was. Having got to the fork of the tree, he moved hand over hand along a branch for four or five feet with his legs hanging in space, then he dropped onto the flat bank the other side, throwing his arms in the air like a footballer who has scored a goal, and cheerfully waving us on.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test07/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the growth of the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers: But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: ""We will soon be changed beyond all recognition"".Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a programme of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this programme has had a great deal of success: Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins.The effects of the development of-the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose most of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad.The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up the majority of the population but they are an important part of it because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test08/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"It can be shown in facts and figures that cycling is the cheapest, most convenient, and most environmentally desirable form of transport in town, but such cold calculations do not mean much on a frosty winter morning. The real appeal of cycling is that it is so enjoyable. It has none of the difficulties and tensions of other ways of travelling so you are more cheerful after a ride, even through the rush hour.The first thing a non-cyclist says to you is: ""But isn't it terribly dangerous?"" It would be foolish to deny the danger of sharing the road with motor vehicles and it must be admitted that there are an alarming number of accidents involving cyclists. However, although police records indicate that the car driver is often to blame, the answer lies with the cyclist. It is possible to ride in such a way as to reduce risks to a minimum.If you decide to join the thousands in Britain who are now returning to cycling as a cheap, satisfying form of transport, your first problem will be trying to decide what bike to buy. Here are three simple rules for buying a bike:1. Always buy the best you can afford. Of course there has to be a meeting point between what you would really like and economic reality, but aim as high as you can and you will get the benefit not only when you ride but also if you want to sell. Well-made bikes keep their value very well. And don't forget to include in your calculations the fact that you'll begin saving money on fares and petrol the minute you leave the shop.2. Get the best frame, the main structure of the bicycle, for your money as you can. Cheap brakes, wheels or gears can easily be replaced by more expensive ones, but the frame sets the upper limit on any transformation. You should allow for the possibility that your cycling ambitions will grow with practice. When you begin, the four miles to work may be the most you ever dream of, but after a few months a Sunday ride into the country begins to look more and more desirable. The best thing is to buy a bike just a little but better than you think you'll need, and then grow into it. Otherwise, try to get a model that can be improved.3. The fit is vital. Handlebars and seat height can be adjusted but must get the right sized frame. On the whole it is best to get the largest size you can manage. Frame sizes are measured in inches and the usual adult range is from 21 inches to 25 inches, though extreme sizes outside those measurements can be found. Some people say if you take four inches off from your inside leg measurement you will end up with the right size of bike. The basic principle though is that you should be able to stand with legs either side of the crossbar (the bar that goes from the handlebars to the seat) with both feet comfortably flat on the ground.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test09/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Through a series of experiments an American scientist has obtained an understanding of the social structure of the most complex of ant societies. The ants examined are the only creatures other than man to have given up hunting and collecting for a completely agricultural way of life. In their underground nests they cultivate gardens on soil made from finely chopped leaves. This is a complex operation requiring considerable division of labour. The workers of this type of ant can be divided into four groups according to size. Each of the groups performs a particular set of jobs.The making and care of the gardens and the nursing of the young ants are done by the smallest workers. Slightly larger workers are responsible for chopping up leaves to make them suitable for use in the gardens and for cleaning the nest. A third group of still larger ants do the construction work and collect fresh leaves from outside the nest. The largest are the soldier ants, responsible for defending the nest.To find out how good the various size groups are at different tasks the scientist measured the amount of work •done by the ants against the amount of energy they used. He examined first the gathering and carrying of leaves. He selected one of the size-groups, and then measured how efficiently these ants could find leaves and run back to the nest. Then he repeated the experiment for each of the other size groups. In this way he could see whether any group could do the job more efficiently than the group normally undertaking it.The intermediate-sized ants that normally perform this task proved to be the most efficient for their energy costs, but when the scientist examined the whole set of jobs performed by each group of ants it appeared that some sizes of worker ants were not ideally suited to the particular jobs they performed.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test10/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Did you know that if you want your pet cat to live as long as possible you should choose an ordinary female cat, keep a close eye on her in spring and summer, and make sure that she is not black or black and white? It has been discovered that male cats wander further from home, and of large number of cats killed on the roads in spring and summer, a surprisingly high percentage are black or black and white.Did you know, too, that domestic cats regard their owners as fellow members of the cat family and make many more sounds to us than they do to other cats when living in groups? They have worked out that we communicate by sound - and so learn a vocabulary we will understand to get their massage over.The way cats have learned to live with, and be looked after by man, without losing their hunting and killing abilities or their mental independence, is a good reason for studying them, some scientists say.A study of the suburban cats in Barking in Essex showed that outside the home they adopted the same hunting and exploring habits as wild cats, the female cats covered a territory limited to house and garden, while male cats travelled over an area ten times as large.Though many people think the opposite, a cat is very practical about defending its territory. Its attitude depends on its confidence about the cat it faces following the experience of its previous meetings. Females and young males often hide when fierce adult males turn up on their territory.Female cats seem to feel no tension between their affectionate relationships with humans and their life ""in the wild"". It is the male cats which occasionally show signs of anxiety indicating that they are suffering from strain.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test11/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Charlie Stowe waited until he heard his mother snore before he got out of bed. Even then he moved with caution and tiptoed to the window. The front of the house was Irregular, so that it was possible to see a light burning in his mother's room. But now all the windows were dark... Charlie Stowe was frightened.But the thought of the tobacconist's shop which his father kept down a dozen wooden stairs drew him on. He was twelve years old, and already boys at the County School laughed at him because he had never smoked a cigarette. The packets were piled twelve deep below, and the little shop lay under a thin layer of stale smoke which would completely cover up his crime. That it was a crime to steal some of his father's stock. Charlie Stowe had no doubt, but he did not love his father; his father was unreal to him, a shadowy figure, pale, thin, indefinite, who noticed him only occasionally and left even punishment to his mother. For his mother he felt a strong love, ..... from her speech he judged her the friend of everyone ..... But his father's affection and dislike were as indefinite as his movements. Tonight he had said he would be in Norwich, and yet you never knew. Charlie Stowe had no sense of safety as he crept down the wooden stairs .......At the bottom of the stairs he came out quite suddenly into a little shop. It was too dark to see his way, and he did not dare touch the switch. For half a minute he sat in despair on the bottom step with his chin in his hands. Then the regular movement of the searchlight was reflected through an upper window and the boy had time to fix in memory the pile of cigarettes, the counter, and the small hole under it. The footsteps of a policeman on the pavement made him grab the first packet to his hand and dive for the hole. A light shoe along the floor and a hand tried the door, then the footsteps passed on, and Charlie hid in the darkness.At last he got the courage back by telling himself in his strangely adult way that if he were caught now there was nothing to be done about it, and he might as well have his smoke.

"There was one thing that I found rather strange on my first day as housekeeper at Monk's House. The floors in the house were very thin. The bathroom was directly above the kitchen, and when Mrs. Woolf was having her bath before breakfast, I could hear her talking to herself. On and on she went, talk, talk, and talk, asking questions and giving herself the answers. I thought there must be two or three people up there with her. When Mr. Woolf saw that I looked surprised, he told me that Mrs. Woolf always said out loud the sentences that she had written during the night. She needed to know if they sounded right and the bath was a good place for trying them out.I was not allowed to make coffee at Monk's house - Mr. and Mrs. Woolf were very particular about coffee and always made it themselves - so Mr. Woolf came l.nto the kitchen at eight o'clock every morning to make it. When we earned the breakfast trays to Mrs. Woolf's room I noticed that she had always been working during the night. There were pencils and paper beside her bed so that when she woke up she could work, and sometimes it seemed as though she had had very little sleep.Mrs. Woolf's bedroom was outside the house in the garden. I used to think how inconvenient it must be to have to go out in the rain to go to bed. Her bedroom had been added on to the back of the house; the door faced the garden and a window at the side opened out on to a field. Because the writing-room was small, he had had a larger one built for her at the end of the garden against the church wall.I can always remember her coming to the house each day from the writing-room, when I rang the bell for lunch at one o'clock she used to walk down through the garden smoking one of her favourite cigarettes in a long holder. She was tall and thin and very graceful. She had large, deep-set eyes and a wide curving mouth - I think perhaps it was this that made her face seem particularly beautiful. She wore long skirts - usually blue or brown - in the fashion of the day, and silk jackets of the same colour.Her cigarettes were made from a special tobacco called My Mixture. Mr. Woolf bought it for her in London and, in the evenings, they used to sit by the fire and make these cigarettes themselves.Mrs. Woolf wore clothes that suited her well. I pressed them for her and did any sewing that was necessary - She was not able to sew, although sometimes she liked to try. There was one thing in the kitchen that Mrs. Woolf was very good at doing; she could make beautiful bread.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test13/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"By three o'clock in the afternoon there was nothing left for Hilliard to do. He had been to the Army and Navy Stores and gone slowly from counter to counter buying what he needed, and after that, looking, looking. The war had brought out a fever like that of Christmas among manufacturers and salesmen, there were so many possible things to buy, expressly for the soldiers in France. Hilliard watched people buying them, mothers, aunts, sisters, wives, who had no idea what might be really suitable, who wanted to send something extra, who were misled by the advertisements and the counter staff into ordering useless gifts to be packed up and sent. He saw bullet-proof waistcoats and fingered them in amazement remembering the bullets saw leather gauntlets too stiff and thick and hot saw ornamental swords and pistols of use only to gamekeepers, saw the shining new metal of entrenching tools and spurs.But he wanted to buy something then, something that was entirely superfluous, an extravagance, a gift to himself. He moved about among the women and could see nothing, felt as he had felt on a day's outing from school, when the money his father had given him burned a hole in his pocket and he was almost in tears at the frustration of finding nothing he desired to buy.He spent more than two pounds on a pale cane walking-stick with a round silver knob and carrying it out into the sunlit street, felt both foolish and conspicuous as though he had succumbed to the temptation of some appalling vice. The cane looked so new. At school it had been the worst possible taste to have an unblemished leather trunk with bright buckles: the thing had been to kick it, or to drop it several times from the luggage van on to the station platform. Now, he fell like a soldier who had not yet been to France, because of the cane: people looked at him and he wanted to shout at them. ""I have been before. I have been and now I am going back. I know.""",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test14/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Reading to oneself is a modern activity which was almost unknown to the scholar of the classical and medieval worlds while during the fifteenth century the term ""reading"" undoubtedly meant reading aloud. Only during the nineteenth century did silent reading become commonplace.One should be wary, however, of assuming that silent reading came about simply because reading aloud is a distraction to others. Examination of factors related to the historical development of silent reading reveals that it became the usual mode of reading for most adult reading tasks mainly because the tasks themselves changed in character.The last century saw a steady gradual increase in literacy and thus in the number of readers. As readers increased, so the number of Potential listeners declined, and thus there was some reduction in the need to read aloud. As reading for the benefit of listeners grew less common, so came the flourishing of reading as a private activity in such public places as libraries, railway carriages and offices where reading aloud would cause distraction to other readers.Towards the end of the century there was still considerable argument over whether books should be used for information or treated respectfully, and over whether the reading of material such as newspapers was in some way mentally weakening. Indeed this argument remains with us still in education. However, whatever its virtues, the old shared literacy culture had gone and was replaced by the printed mass media on the one hand and by books and periodicals for a specialized readership on the other.By the end of the century students were being recommended to adopt altitudes to books and to use skills in reading them which were inappropriate, if not impossible, for the oral reader. The social cultural and technological changes in the century had greatly altered what the term ""reading"" implied.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test15/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"There have been three periods in the history of post-war broadcast interviewing. The first, ""the age of deference"", when it was an honour to have you, the interviewee, on the progamme, lasted until the middle 50s. The second, ""the age of ascendancy"", when politicians in particular looked upon the interviewers as agenda-setting rivals who made them feel uncomfortable by their knowledge and rigour of questioning, came to an end at the beginning of this decade. Now we are in ""the age of evasion"", when most prominent interviewees have acquired the art of seeming to answer a question whilst bypassing its essential thrust.Why should this be? From the complexity of causes responsible for the present mediocrity of the interview form, a few are worth singling out, such as the revolt against rationality and the enthronement of feeling in its place. To the young of the 60s, the painstaking search for understanding of a given political problem may have appeared less fruitful and satisfying than the unfettered ventilation of emotion which the same problem generated. Sooner or later, broadcasting was bound to reflect this.This bias against understanding has continued. To this we must add the professional causes that have played their part. The convention of the broadcast interview has undergone little change of radical development since its rise in the 50s. When a broadcasting form ceases to develop, its practitioners tend to take it for granted and are likely to say ""how"" rather than ask ""why.Furthermore, these partly psychological, partly professional tendencies were greatly accelerated by the huge expansion of news and current affairs output over the last 15 years. When you had many additional hours of current affairs broadcasting, interviewing turned out to be a far cheaper convention than straight reporting, which is costly in terms of permanent reporters and time preparation. The temptation to combine an expanded news and current affairs service with a relatively small additional financial outlay by making the interview proved overwhelming.To be fair there are compensating virtues in interviewing, such as immediacy and authority, yet in all honesty I must say that the spread of the interviewing format has led to a corresponding diminution of quality broadcasting.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test16/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"Standing alone at the Browns' party, Anna Mackintosh thought about her husband Edward, establishing him clearly in her mind's eye. He was a thin man forty-one years of age. With fair hair that was often untidy. In the seventeen years they'd been married he had changed very little: he was still nervous with other people and smiled in the same abashed way, and his face was still almost boyish.She believed she had failed him because he had wished for children and she had not been able to supply any. She had, over the years become neurotic about this fact and in the end, quite some time ago now she had consulted a psychiatrist, a Dr. Abbat at Edwars's pleading.In the Browns' rich drawing room, its walls and ceiling gleaming with a metallic surface of imitation gold. Anna listened to dance music coming from a tape recorder and continued to think about her husband.In a moment he would be at the party too since they had agreed to meet there, although by now it was three - quarters of an hour later than the time he had stipulated.The Browns were people he knew in a business way, and he had said he thought it wise that he and Anna should attend this gathering of theirs. She had never met them before which made it more difficult for her having to wait about not knowing a soul in the room.When she thought about it she felt hard done by, for although Edward was kind to her and always had been, it was far from considerate to be as late as this. Because of her nervous condition she left afraid and had developed a Sickness in her stomach.

"San Francisco is where I grew up between the ages of two and ten and where I lived for a period when I was about 13 and again as a married man from the ages of 37 to 51. So quite a big slice of my life has been spent there. My mother, who is now 90, still lives in Los Gatos, about 60 miles south of San Francisco. Even though I have since lived in Switzerland and settled in London over 25 years ago, I have kept property in California for sentimental reasons.I was born in New York and I love the United States. It is still a land of enormous drive, strength, imagination and opportunity. I know it well, having played in every town and during the war in every army camp, I have grown new roots in London as I did in Switzerland and if I am asked now where I want to live permanently, I would say London. But I will always remain an American citizen.Climatically, San Francisco and London are similar and so are the people who settle in both cities. San Francisco is sophisticated, and like London, has many parks and squares. Every day my sisters and I were taken to play in the parks as children. We had an English upbringing in terms of plenty of fresh air and outdoor games. I didn't go to school. My whole formal education consisted of some three hours when I was five. I was sent to school but came home at noon on the first day and said I didn't enjoy it. I hadn't learned anything and couldn't see the point of a lot of children sitting restlessly while a teacher taught from a big book. My parents decided, wisely I think, that school was not for me and I never went back.My mother then took over my education and brought up my two sisters and me rather in the way of an educated English lady. The emphasis was on languages and reading rather than sciences and mathematics. Sometimes she taught us herself, but we also had other teachers and we were kept to a strict routine. About once a week we walked to Golden Gate Park which led down to the sea and on our walks my mother taught me to read music. One day I noticed a little wind mill in the window of a shop we passed on our way to the park and I remember now how my heart yearned for it. I couldn't roll my ‘rs when I was small and my mother who was a perfectionist regarding pronunciation, said if I could pronounce an 'r' well I'd have the windmill. I practised and practised and one morning woke everybody up with my 'r's. I got the windmill. I usually get the things I want in life - but I work for them and dream of them.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test18/index.html,englishteststore,{}
"The Times is not an easy paper to read. It would mean little to the two million adults in Britain who cannot even read more popular papers. It would also be difficult to understand for many to whom English is a second language.Yet even those who read The Times easily and with pleasure might have difficulty with official forms, leaflets and legal agreements.Ordinary people's lives are governed by forms and noticed from the moment their birth is registered until the day they die. Yet many can make no sense of the words on the bits of papers.It is 33 years since Sir Ernest Gowers wrote a book called Plain Words to guide civil servants in writing clear English. Sadly, officials who are writing now do not seem to have read the book.They excuse the fact that much of what they write cannot be understood by arguing that complicated schemes must have complicated explanations. They also claim readers would think it an insult to their intelligence to be addressed in simple English.They think long words and fine phrases make what they have to say seem more important. They do not care very much if customers and clients remain ignorant. Public ignorance makes their job easier.As a result we have forms that even people who can read well cannot fill in correctly. Important agreements are based on unreadable small print.Warning notices on dangerous materials are printed so small that few people would and understand them before an accident, let alone after it.The legal pressure on businesses to use simpler language has made difference, even if lawyers and counts themselves still use the language ordinary people cannot read. Companies can now make big profits from simplifying the language of contracts and complicated documents for fees of up to 10,000 for each job.In Britain an organisation called The Plain English Movement was set up in Martin Cutts and Chrissi Maher. They started by producing a newspaper in Liverpool for adults who had difficulty in reading. Then they ran an advice centre in Salford, simplifying forms and leaflets for people claiming unemployment and sickness benefits.The Movement has had some successes. Not least is that simplifying such leaflets to four pages with sentences averaging only 10 words has saved millions of pieces of paper a year.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test19/index.html,englishteststore,{}

Today, with his fellow tramps, he reads about yesterday's student demonstrations.Like many of the tramps who live under the bridges in Paris, Jules was not always so poor. A long time ago he was in the Navy, and like many who have been to sea for a long time, he has stayed slim and fit. Despite the strict organization on board ship, he loved the life, and had the opportunity to see many countries. He visited Poland and Russia, in South Africa he realized what he valued in each country was the people he met.He was always astonished and delighted by the ways in which the people he met differed from one country to another. Some day, he hopes, everyone will see the world as he does.After many happy years in the Navy, he had to retire. The good things in life always come to an end. His mother and father had long since died and he'd lost touch with his other relatives. He came to Paris and became an industrial designer. He was happy, although it wasn't the same as the sea. He never wanted to get married and have children.And then there was the period of darkness. He smiles sadly. He shrugs his shoulders and looks at his hands. There are tears in the corners of his eyes. This is something that he cannot bring himself to talk about. 'It all went wrong' he whispers.He was silent for a minute, then recovered.

"The 'Neighbourhood Watch' scheme all started a few years ago in the quiet village of Mollington after a number of burglaries in the village and the surrounding area. The residents of the village came up with the idea that they themselves could keep an eye on their neighbours' property while they were away on holiday. Since then, and with the support of the government and police, more than 50,000 'Neighbour Watch' schemes have been set up all over the country.The object of each 'Watch' group is to reduce the opportunities that criminals have in any particular street or area. Each resident who is a member of the scheme agrees to call the police whenever they see something suspicious. Everything is done calmly and discreetly-it is the police who actually check out each report and investigate what is happening. Residents who are part of the 'Watch' are not supposed to act as police or put themselves in any danger.When a new Neighbourhood Watch scheme is set up in an area, the first thing people notice, is the large, brightly colored 'Neibourhood Watch' sign. This is a great deterrent to most burglars and vandals, because very few of them will take a chance of breaking into someone's house if they know that there is a high risk of being seen by neighbours keeping a looking-out. Burglars also know that people who are part of 'Neighbour Watch' schemes are more likely to have fitted good locks to their doors and windows.There's another benefit too. In the time since the 'Neighbourhood Watch' scheme came into existence, there is growing evidence of a new community spirit. It is bringing people together as never before, and encouraging people to care for each other. New friendships are being made, and contact is often established with old people living on their own, who are often the most frightened and the most at risk.",B1,https://englishteststore.net/test/reading/intermediate/test22/index.html,englishteststore,{}
