"In January 1990, I was at primary school and in January 2000, I was at university! I left primary school in September 1990 and went to a secondary school five kilometres from my house. I got the bus every day at 7.30am and didn't get home until 5 o'clock in the evening. What a difficult life! My family bought a satellite TV in 1991 and a new video the next year. In 1994, my brother bought a computer and I got a bicycle the next year. I left my school in 1997 but decided not to go to university like most people: instead, I went walking in France alone for four months and then drove around America for three months with my brother.

Martin went to the check-in with his luggage. When the man who worked for the airline asked for his passport, Martin became very upset. Where was his passport? Martin realized he didn't have his passport with him. What a disaster! He jumped back into the taxi and told the driver to take him home.

Even today, you can still see many signs of the Romans. There is still the large city wall that they built with its three gates: Main, East and South. The wall is not complete but you can still see the three gates. Many tourists comes to Carston to see the Roman ruins. Carston is famous for its history, but it's also a modern town with 74,000 people. They work in many types of jobs.

"Daniel Jones If you've ever seen a pirate film in the past, you can save your money. This is one of the most predictable films I have seen this year. The plot is totally unbelievable and the script is something amateurish out of filmmaker college. There is some nice cinematography but the Hawaiian scenery is not enough to save this film. Great support acting from the Frenchman Thierry Montpasse as the evil Captain Scar. Angela Moore I just loved this fast-moving pirate thriller. The story moves at dizzying speed from one terrifying battle scene to the next and you really feel as if you are on the ships with these evil thieves and smugglers. Chief pirate, British actor Colin Williams, is given all the best, wittiest lines and the film has its share of laughs as well as scary moments. The storm scene at the beginning leaves you both exhausted and terrified. Max Court I found this film absolutely delightful. An inspiring cast is directed with great skill and invention by German Dieter Muller. There are plenty of surprises in the story to keep the audience guessing until the last minute. Some clever jokes give the film a surprising level of humor too, which I really wasn't expecting from a film about pirates.	 Deborah McGhee The Silver Glove promises much but delivers very little. The opening scene, filmed in a storm of lightning and high waves, is an exciting start but as the film takes you from one swordfight to another, it starts to seem a bit monotonous. Patricia Groves plays the doctor wonderfully and there may be an Oscar nomination for her in the new year. William Wilson The Silver Glove is an action-packed pirate drama in the best traditions of this genre. If you only want swordfights and buried treasure, you may be disappointed as this intriguing film also offers a complex plot which is never dull. Some of the language may be too crude for younger children but this is really my only complaint. Some fine acting completes this fun movie. Maria Thomson After all the money that has been spent on this simplistic pirate tale, you would expect more than this dull movie. The battle scenes are so repetitive that you may think you've seen the film before. Some of the camera work is inventive and is to be complimented. The ship chase creates a lot of tension and excitement that the rest of the film fails to do.",A2,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/2r4-the-silver-glove.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'The Silver Glove'}

My wife and I wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary with a good meal so we went to an expensive Italian restaurant in downtown Lisbon. We both had pasta to start and for the main course my wife ordered a steak and I chose fish. For dessert we both ate chocolate cake topped with fresh cream. Delicious! 2. I went to a restaurant yesterday evening with my sister's children. It wasn't very expensive and the menu was very limited. We all had a burger and French fries, and drank cola. It wasn't very good. 3. My boyfriend loves spicy food so this restaurant was perfect. The waiters were all really friendly and polite, and they played traditional sitar music which was very relaxing. The menu offered vegetarian dishes as well as meat dishes served with rice and a sauce - it depended on how hot you wanted it! I chose a mild beef curry but my boyfriend had a lamb 'vindaloo' - he also drank 2 liters of water!! 4. My class at the university went there last weekend. It's a very popular type of restaurant in my country. It generally offers one type of food (a kind of bread with cheese and tomato sauce) which you then choose what ingredients to add on top of it.

"I'm going to tell you about my Aunt Helen's house. It's not her main house, that's in the city. No, this house is by the lake. There was a small town by the lake called Miller's Ford, but all the people moved away when the fishing and mining stopped about sixty years ago. But the houses stayed, of course. My Aunt Helen uses that house as a vacation home and she goes there for a few weeks every year to relax. But staying in that house isn't a relaxing experience. I think the house is haunted! I think there's a ghost there from many many years ago. Helen says I'm silly and that I've got an over-active imagination. But there are many things that happen in that house that cannot be easily explained. One day, shortly after getting up, I went to find my Aunt Helen to say ""good morning"" and I heard her talking in a room that she usually never uses. I think it used to be the nursery of the house when Miller's Ford was a busy town in the 19th Century. I listened at the door and could hear Helen reading something out, or perhaps she was dictating a letter. I couldn't hear any other person in the room with her so it wasn't a normal conversation. I didn't want to disturb my aunt, so I went back downstairs and went to make breakfast in the kitchen, which I ate on the porch that overlooked the lake. It was a beautiful sunny morning. Half an hour later, I heard my aunt's car arriving. She had been to the local store to buy some bread and milk. I couldn't believe it! ""What are you looking so shocked for?"" she asked me. ""I thought you were in the old nursery, working on your letters, Auntie,"" I replied. ""I never go in that room,"" she said. ""I haven't been in that room for fifteen years."" A few other things like that happened over the next few visits I made to that house and I grew to dislike it very much. Then, one day in my local library, I found a story in an old newspaper with the title ""The Constant Babysitter"". The story was that a baby had died in one of the houses by the lake at Miller's Ford and the babysitter was blamed, a woman of 37 who was a family friend and had offered to look after the baby. But she spent all her time in the kitchen writing her letters and didn't know that someone had climbed in the baby's window and taken her. The baby was never found. The woman killed herself through depression after the baby's disappearance and local people then said her ghost stayed very close to where the baby was left by the parents -  in the nursery. I never went back to that house, despite my Aunt Helen's many invitations.",A2,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/2r12-pre-intermediate-reading-aunt-helens-house-multiple-choice.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'Aunt Helen's House - Reading Comprehension Multiple Choice'}
"Here are the instructions for next weekend's camping trip in Scotland. There are seventeen people going on this trip so it's important that you arrive at the meeting point early enough for us to be able to leave at 8am. There will be two minibuses and please make sure you are on the right one. Last week's e-mail gave all this information. We should arrive in the camping area at about 2pm, which will give us enough time to buy the food we need in the local supermarket and then go to the area where we will set up the tents, which is a long way from town. There will be a total of four large tents put up and each tent will have a tent leader, a person who went on this trip last year and therefore has the necessary experience. If you have any problems during the two days, you should always go directly to your tent leader and speak to him/her. We are not expecting there to be very bad weather this weekend in Scotland, but the weather situation in the Scottish hills is always very unpredictable and for this reason, we have advised everyone to take wet weather clothing with you. If windy, stormy weather arrives at the camping area, it may also be necessary to leave the hills and go down into the town. It's very likely that your phones will not work in the hills, so you must warn your parents of this. You will be able to use your phones when we are in the town, but not when we are camping. If you have any other questions about the trip, come either to me or Mrs. Sanderson.",A2,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/2r13-pre-intermediate-reading-the-scotland-trip-multiple-choice.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'The Scotland Trip'}
"Today, millions of people want to learn or improve their English but it is difficult to find the best method. Is it better to study in Britain or America or to study in your own country? The advantages of going to Britain seem obvious. Firstly, you will be able to listen to the language all the time you are in the country. You will be surrounded completely by the language wherever you go. Another advantage is that you have to speak the language if you are with other people. In Italy, it is always possible, in the class, to speak Italian if you want to and the learning is slower.  On the other hand, there are also advantages to staying at home to study. You don't have to make big changes to your life. As well as this, it is also a lot cheaper than going to Britain but it is never possible to achieve the results of living in the UK. If you have a good teacher in Italy, I think you can learn in a more concentrated way than being in Britain without going to a school.  So, in conclusion, I think that if you have enough time and enough money, the best choice is to spend some time in the UK. This is simply not possible for most people, so being here in Italy is the only viable option. The most important thing to do in this situation is to maximise your opportunities: to speak only English in class and to try to use English whenever possible outside the class.",B1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/3r1-learn-english-reading.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'Reading Comprehension - Learning English.'}
"I have returned to my hometown of Wilson Creek after an absence of 10 years. So many things have changed around here. When I left Wilson Creek, there was a small pond on the right as you left town. They have filled in this pond and they have built a large shopping mall there. A new post office has also been built just across from my old school. There is a baseball stadium on the outskirts of Wilson Creek which has been changed completely. They have now added a new stand where probably a few thousand people could sit. It looks really great. The biggest changes have taken place in the downtown area. They have pedestrianised the centre and you can't drive there anymore. A European-style fountain has been built and some benches have also been added along with a grassy area and a new street cafe. My street looks just the same as it always has but a public library has been built in the next street along. There used to be a great park there but they have cut down all the trees which is a pity. The library now has a large green area in front of it but it's not the same as when the park was there. Another improvement is the number of new restaurants that have opened in Wilson Creek. A Chinese and an Italian restaurant have opened in the town centre and a Mexican restaurant has opened near my home.

"He was believed to have been born on April 16, 1889. There is some doubt whether April 16 is actually his birthday, and it is possible he was not born in 1889. There is also uncertainty about his birthplace: London or Fontainebleau, France. There is no doubt, however, as to his parentage: he was born to Charles Chaplin, Sr. and Hannah Harriette Hill (aka Lily Harley on stage), both Music Hall entertainers. His parents separated soon after his birth, leaving him in the care of his increasingly unstable mother. In 1896, Chaplin's mother was unable to find work; Charlie and his older half-brother Sydney Chaplin had to be left in the workhouse at Lambeth, moving after several weeks to Hanwell School for Orphans and Destitute Children. His father died an alcoholic when Charlie was 12, and his mother suffered a mental breakdown, and was eventually admitted temporarily to the Cane Hill Asylum at Coulsdon (near Croydon). She died in 1928 in the United States, two years after coming to the States to live with Chaplin, by then a commercial success. Charlie first took to the stage when, aged five, he performed in Music Hall in 1894, standing in for his mother. As a child, he was confined to a bed for weeks due to a serious illness, and, at night, his mother would sit at the window and act out what was going on outside. In 1900, aged 11, his brother helped get him the role of a comic cat in the pantomime Cinderella at the London Hippodrome. In 1903 he appeared in 'Jim, A Romance of Cockayne', followed by his first regular job, as the newspaper boy Billy in Sherlock Holmes, a part he played into 1906. This was followed by Casey's 'Court Circus' variety show, and, the following year, he became a clown in Fred Karno's 'Fun Factory' slapstick comedy company. According to immigration records, he arrived in the United States with the Karno troupe on October 2, 1912. In the Karno Company was Arthur Stanley Jefferson, who would later become known as Stan Laurel. Chaplin and Laurel shared a room in a boarding house. Stan Laurel returned to England but Chaplin remained in the United States. Chaplin's act was seen by film producer Mack Sennett, who hired him for his studio, the Keystone Film Company.",B1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/3r9-charlie-chaplin.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'Charlie Chaplin's Early Life'}
"Rikki Mbaza has a very English name but his part of central Africa is suffering from a problem that few in England would have to put up with: a lack of rain so acute that Rikki's livelihood is literally evaporating away. ""I would love to have the English weather here in Chad. Then the lake would not go away."" Rikki Mbaza lives in the town of Bol near the shores of Lake Chad, a lake that has shrunk by 90% in the last 40 years. A lack of rain is only one of many culprits being blamed for this emerging disaster. ""I am a fisherman. For me, it is like watching my life draining away every day. The fishing is getting worse and worse in the lake. They are getting smaller and I think the fish breeding has been disrupted by the reduction in area and in depth."" Lake Chad is only a metre deep in most places. Rikki struggles now to provide enough food and income for his wife Achta and their four children. Achta has had to take up pottery in her spare time in order to try and boost the amount of money coming into the household every month. ""Our rent doesn't go down with the level of the lake unfortunately,"" Mbaza complains. ""We still have six mouths to feed but I need assistance from the government. They have left me to fend for myself in a desperate situation."" While one can understand Rikki Mbaza's frustration with his government, his accusatory tone is perhaps a little unfair. The Chad government has often seemed like a powerless, rudderless boat caught in the storm of international politics. Angela Muscovite at the Center For African Politics at UCLA sees little reason for optimism in the case of the shrinking lake in the African heartland. ""The story of Chad Lake is a modern day environmental tragedy. This is a body of water that, in 1960 was over 25,000 km2 in size - now it's less than 10% of that."" ""It has been so over-exploited and it is an issue the whole international community, obviously more so those governments in Africa, need to co-operate on to find a resolution. And that isn't going to happen any time soon. By the time it does, they'll be arguing over a puddle in the middle of the desert. It's sad but that's how I see things panning out."" The guilty parties, as so often in these cases, blame each other for the problems that now beset the lake. Charlie Vaughan, who teaches Environmental Science at Cambridge University in Britain, explains why the lake is going the way of the Dodo. ""The main culprit is geography funnily enough. Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon all lay claim to the waters of this lake and you only need a five metre shoreline to be able to extract water from it. The whole area has been a target for massive irrigation schemes over the last couple of decades with each country's agricultural ministry blaming the other three for the problems. In an area with plentiful rainfall, it wouldn't be so much of a problem. This is a dry area."" None of this gesturing and buck-passing will help Rikki, Achta and their four children in the near future. ""I am learning how to fix cars. I don't think cars will be disappearing soon and will certainly last longer than this lake will,"" muses the glum-looking fisherman. ""There won't be any more fishermen in this area in ten years."" And with that, he says he has to go and study how to remove and repair brake pads.",B1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/3r10-shrinking-lake.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'The Shrinking Lake'}
"Everybody loves a good wedding and I'm no exception. I've been to a load of them in my native Britain and I must say that I usually have a great time. I've also been to a few abroad, including the Caribbean and Spain, and most recently (last week in fact) to one in the mountains of Sardinia. No two weddings are ever the same and I really enjoyed this one for one or two of the differences from those in the UK. First, the two families spent at least three weeks before the big day preparing all the food, from wonderful home-made delicacies to simple traditional breads and pastas. In my experience, in the UK that onerous task is left to the caterers!  In the week leading up to the wedding there is a dinner or some form of celebration every day - training for the stomach I guess. I know that we have the traditional Bachelor party and Bachelorette party, but this is more family orientated and certainly a little less rowdy. This particular ceremony was in a beautiful country church and afterwards the couple was driven to the reception in a wonderfully decorated classic Fiat 500, which was really similar to what happens in the UK, even down to the string of tin cans trailing behind the car! The reception itself was also very similar until I realized that the seven tables in the hall each sat sixty guests (that's four hundred and twenty, for those of you who didn't study Math), an average number for Sardinia but would be considered a very large wedding where I'm from. The wine flowed, as did the chatter - the famous Italian exuberance showing itself to the full. There were the five or six courses of wonderful food, screaming kids running wild, the ceremonial cutting of the cake by the bride and groom - but no speeches! Not one. In the UK it's traditional for the father of the bride to propose a toast, followed by the groom and finishing up with that of the best man. His is meant to be he highlight of the lunch \ dinner, generally having a good laugh at the groom's expense, but here the groom was spared that particular discomfort. Instead there was a delightful custom which I'd never seen before, in which six or seven of the male guests pass round the hall banging trays, drums, pots, pans or basically anything that makes a horrendous noise, selling pieces of the groom's tie which has been cut into tiny bits. The money raised is then given to the happy(!) couple to help them set up their new life together. Really nice. Finally the evening saw a lot of traditional dancing, a little disco dancing and some karaoke. Pretty much the part I like best, and again I wasn't disappointed. Can't wait for the next one.",B1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/3r12-traditional-wedding.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'A Traditional Wedding'}
"What would your life be like if you were Albert Einstein. What clothes would be in your wardrobe if you were Marilyn Monroe? Or Madonna? Well now you can discover the answer to all these questions and many more at the Fame Hotel in California. Ten miles outside Los Angeles, the Fame Hotel promises to answer the question ""What if?"". When you check into the hotel, you choose a room. Each room has a name. There's Clint Eastwood on the second floor and Elvis Presley on the third floor. In total, the Fame Hotel has 32 rooms, most of which are named after stars of Hollywood or music. But there are also famous writers (Mark Twain and Agatha Christie) and even some scientists and sports stars, such as Mike Tyson. When you enter the room, you enter the life of that person. There are pictures everywhere. The owner of the hotel has tried to fill the room with objects, clothes, even food that he thinks the stars would have liked. Marilyn Monroe's wardrobe is full of beautiful white dresses, Albert Einstein doesn't have any socks in his wardrobe because the real Einstein never wore them! If you choose Mike Tyson's room, you'll be able to practice boxing in one corner of the room. And there's even a skipping rope too! I spoke to one guest staying in the Elvis Presley room. ""I love this hotel,"" he said to me. ""I wanted to know 'What would Elvis Presley eat for breakfast?' and now I know"". That guest eats pancakes and strawberry ice cream every morning, just as Elvis liked to do. On the next table, the Einstein room's guest is eating cabbage soup!

"Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hodgenville, Kentucky, USA. His parents were Thomas Lincoln, a farmer, and Nancy Hanks. His family was very poor. Abraham had one brother and one sister. His brother died in childhood. They grew up in a small log cabin house, with just one room inside. Although slavery was legal in Kentucky at that time, Lincoln's father, who was a religious Baptist, refused to own any slaves. When Lincoln was seven years old, his family moved to Indiana, and later to Illinois. In his childhood he helped his father on the farm, but when he was 22 years old he left home and moved to New Salem, Illinois, where he worked in a general store. Later, he said that he had gone to school for just one year, but that was enough to learn how to read, write, and do simple math. In 1842, he married Mary Todd Lincoln. They had four children, but three of them died when they were very young. Abraham Lincoln was sometimes called Abe Lincoln or ""Honest Abe"" after he ran miles to give a costumer the right amount of change. The nickname ""Honest Abe"" came from a time when he started a business that failed. Instead of running away like many people would have, he stayed and worked to pay off his debt. He has also been called the ""Great Emancipator"" because of his work to end slavery in the United States. In 1863, he declared that all slaves held in the rebellious Confederate States were free. He also sponsored the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Ratified in 1865, nine months after his assassination, that amendment completely outlawed slavery in the United States.",B1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/3r15-intermediate-reading-abraham-lincoln-true-false-questions.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'Abraham Lincoln'}
"RAF Upper Heyford - once the heart of allied defence against nuclear attack by the USSR - could become a Cold War 'museum'. Historians want parts of the base to be preserved as a heritage centre that could show future generations the struggle with Soviet communism 'in a way no document can'. Details of the latest recommendations for Heyford - now being called Heyford Park - have been put forward by English Heritage which has called for measures to prevent demolition of the 'irreplaceable' military remains. Current thinking comes from a detailed assessment of Cold War infrastructure across England by English Heritage experts. Keith Watson, the chief executive of the North Oxfordshire Consortium who are to develop part of the site for housing, said they were in full agreement with English Heritage's proposals. He said: ""We are quite content with what English Heritage is proposing. It has always been part of our scheme to retain these structures in any event. ""We are working with English Heritage to agree a consistent plan for the buildings.""  David Went, English Heritage inspector of ancient monuments, said many Upper Heyford features exemplify historical aspects of national importance about the Cold War. ""The sheer scale and bare functionality of the structures on the base can illustrate for present and future generations, in a way no document can, the reality of the struggle with Soviet Communism,"" he said. ""In our view much of this character would be lost by future ill-thought-out change and there stands an opportunity to ensure this does not happen. ""We recognize that preservation of the whole base exactly as it stands today may not be a realistic option but a sustainable future could be found which balances the need for preservation against other needs."" Mr Went said the English Heritage view was that the future appearance of the base should include the most significant monuments and should: The English Heritage study, submmitted to the Planning Inspectorate in advance of the public inquiry into planning wrangles over the base which started at Bodicote House yesterday, has revealed that much of the Heyford landscape prior to becoming an airbase was open common or heathland - a feature Cherwell District Council planners would like re-established as a local country park.

"It was only minus 28 degrees Celsius when we landed in Irkutsk. But that was cold enough to make breathing an effort - the air felt like ice as it scraped the back of my throat. Five minutes later, I needed a second pair of gloves and pulled my scarf tight over my nose and mouth. I was obviously a beginner at this.  At the petrol station, Mikhail the attendant laughed when we asked if he wasn't freezing. He'd spent the whole day outside with no more than his fur hat and a sheepskin coat for warmth. It was mid-afternoon and icicles were hanging from his moustache like Dracula's fangs. He said he never drank to stay warm - unlike many others.  Vodka There's a belief in Siberia that enough vodka will insulate you from the cold. It's been proved tragically wrong in the past few weeks. Dozens of bodies of the homeless or men walking drunkenly back from the pub were hauled out of the snowdrifts, frozen or so badly frost-bitten that many will never walk again.  The local hospital in Irkutsk is overwhelmed. Ironically, it's the burns unit that's taken all the frostbite victims - 200 of them in just two weeks in one town. Even here, icicles are hanging down on the inside of the windows, though the heating is on full power. The doctor was too busy performing amputations to talk to us.  Shortages But we could hear the screams from the operating room. They'd run out of anaesthetic after performing 60 amputations that week. The other patients could hear it too, and one girl in the corridor, clinging to her mother for support, was near to tears.  Nastya is only 16. Last week she missed her last bus home, so she walked instead - seven kilometres through the snow, in temperatures of minus 40. She had no gloves. Now her hands are bandaged and hang down uselessly. She'll find out soon if they need to be amputated.  She was far from the worst case. In one bed, Nikolai Dobtsov lay quietly staring at the ceiling. Underneath the sheets, blood was seeping through his bandages, from where his feet and hands had been amputated the day before. He was a truck driver, he explained, with a good job delivering wood - and recently there'd been a lot of demand. So he'd set out to deliver a last load upcountry. The weather forecast - just minus 25 in Irkutsk - seemed to suggest that the journey was safe. It wasn't. His truck broke down miles from anywhere, and for 6 desperate hours he fought to repair the axle. He even greased his hands for protection, and finally managed to get the truck going again. Somehow he found the strength to drive himself back and straight to hospital, but it was already too late.  I asked Nikolai what would happen to him now. He just laughed, and shrugged. Nikolai has no wife or family in Irkutsk - and invalidity benefit is a pittance. Life in an institution may be the best he can hope for, and he'll almost certainly never work again.  Resilience That incredible stoicism is everywhere. In Irkutsk at least, people seem simply to accept that winter is harsh - and this one especially so. It is without doubt the cruellest Siberian winter in living memory. Yet outdoors, everything appears to function normally - even schools re-opened as the temperature rose briefly to minus 25.  The trams and buses are back on the roads, though everyone drives slowly to avoid skidding on the layers of ice below the grit. The main street bustles with people wrapped in layers against the cold. But even indoors, the chill is inescapable. After her shift as a tram conductor, Natasha Fillipova comes home to a freezing house. She shows us the bedroom - where ice has built up on the inside walls. She scrapes it off with her fingers, but that has little effect. One night, Natasha says, she washed her hair before going to bed. When she woke up, it was frozen solid to the wall. The children are doing their homework in the bathroom - the only room warm enough to sit in. Natasha doesn't want to complain. But she is angry with the state and the architects for building shoddy houses.  The flats here are supposed to withstand up to minus 40 degrees. They don't, and her children are ill with coughs and colds. Natasha's anger is brief, and she seems faintly embarrassed about it. Siberians are used to cold weather, she explains. Here, she tells us, people prefer to rely on themselves - and the knowledge that eventually, spring will come.",С1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/4r5-siberian-winter.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'A Siberian Winter'}
"Three-year-old Teddy Lasry was napping yesterday in his cowboy outfit yesterday at his family's Fifth Ave. apartment when he shot up in bed screaming. A 3-foot-long black-and-white snake was coiled around his left arm and had just bitten his pinky.  ""The baby-sitter freaked out,"" said Teddy's father, David Lasry, who, along with his wife, Evelyn, was at work when the reptile showed up about 4 p.m.  The horrified nanny called 911 and the building's doorman. The doorman and two cable TV workers helped pry the snake off the boy's arm and stow it in a garbage bag, Lasry said.  Police rushed Teddy to Mount Sinai Medical Center, where his parents said he spent two hours attached to a heart monitor as a precaution in case the snake was poisonous.  It wasn't. Experts at the snakebite treatment center at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, where cops took the critter, determined it was a non-venomous California king snake.  But how did it end up in Teddy's bed?  A little sleuthing determined that the serpent had escaped two weeks ago from its cage in the apartment of a doctor whose family lives four floors below the Lasrys. The apologetic owner said his son's pet snake likely traveled up the radiator pipes and into his neighbor's apartment.  ""It's a very docile, very harmless snake,"" he said. ""It's handled by our family all the time.""  Lasry, 42, a fine arts publisher, said he believed the pet was simply hungry after two weeks of cruising. Teddy's mother, Evelyn Lasry, 37, said her son seems to have gotten over his fright by thinking of himself as a hero cowboy as he rode in the back of the police cruiser to the hospital.  ""I told Teddy he's a pretty snake, a nice pet snake who got out of his cage,"" Evelyn Lasry said. ""But he asked, 'Why did he bite my finger, Mamma?'

"Africa Check, a fledgling fact checking website, is attempting to pin down unfounded claims made by the country's leaders, media outlets along with widely held beliefs. There is a common claim in Johannesburg that it has the largest man-made forest in the world. It's easy to believe; the city has lush, green canopy that covers many neighborhoods. But it's not true, according to Africa Check, which found that the largest man-made forest is actually in China, next to the Gobi desert. Debunking bogus claims, politically charged fictions and unfounded statements, Africa Check is a website that challenges media, politicians and the occasional social media celebrity when they massage the truth, or ignore it completely, said Julian Rademeyer, southern Africa editor for the site. ""I think the fundamental element of our work is that we are trying to get people to question what they're told, what they read, what politicians say to them, and to look at what the information that is there and ask essentially what the fundamental question is 'Where is the evidence?' If someone makes a claim, where is the evidence to support that claim, and to actually interrogate those claims and not to accept things purely for what they are,"" Rademeyer said. Africa Check was launched in June 2012 by the Agence France Press foundation in partnership with the University of Witswaterand's journalism department. Rademeyer and a researcher are the site's two full-time employees. There is also a team of freelance reporters who work on fact checking assignments. Following in the footsteps of popular American websites like PolitiFact and Factcheck.org, Africa Check is the first media outlet in South Africa to solely work in fact checking. South Africa has a strong legacy of investigative journalism and photography that dates back to the apartheid era. But like many countries, Rademeyer says its news industry has been hampered by shrinking budgets and newsrooms. ""Because of the fact that newspapers don't have the resources they would've had in the past, or don't have specialist beat reporters,"" he said. ""It allows public figures and it allows politicians to make claims that don't go checked. I think that's where we play a role. We come in and look at those claims and we have the ability and the time to go through those claims."" Paula Fray, former editor for the Star Newspaper and a media consultant, says Africa Check may put a much-needed pressure on newsrooms. ""At the moment Africa Check is not known as much as I'm hoping as it going to be known,"" she said. ""I'm hoping that eventually journalists will be writing their stories and thinking if my news editor doesn't pick up that something hasn't been verified, Africa Check might pick up that it hasn't been verified. So I'm not going to put anything in my stories unless I can prove it."" She also hopes it will create a greater culture of accountability. ""I think the more organizations out there holding journalism to account the better actually for the industry,"" Fray said. The site also takes on myths that get repeated so often that they go unchecked. When a South African musician with 175,000 Facebook followers made the claim that white South Africans are being killed at an alarming rate, Africa Check looked into the facts. It found that most of the musician's claims were exaggerated or untrue. The site has also debunked claims made about traditional healers, South Africa's rate of asylum seekers and a BBC report about white squatter camps in South Africa. Long term, Rademeyer envisions the site expanding across the continent. ""I really do think as a project it could play a very important role,"" he said. ""We've done some very basic fact checking or fact sheet-related reporting on elements of the elections in Zimbabwe recently. We'd obviously like to do more of that in the next elections in Zimbabwe, for instance, and elections in neighboring countries. And try to expand our reach."" With presidential elections looming next year in South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique and Namibia, the site will be busy.",С1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/4r65-advanced-reading-new-website.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'New Fact Checking Website Arrives'}
"The couple banished from the hit ""reality"" series ""Temptation Island"" because they are parents of a young child have sued the production company and Fox-TV for defamation, claiming that producers knew about the toddler all along.  Ytossie Patterson and Taheed Watson claim in their Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit that producers edited an episode of the hit show to make it appear that they had concealed their status as parents and then chastised them on the air in an ""extremely condescending and humiliating manner.""  A spokeswoman for Rocket Science Laboratories, the show's producers, referred calls regarding the lawsuit, which was filed on Wednesday, to Fox, which said it would have a statement ""later in the day.""  Patterson, 34, and Watson, 29, were among four couples sent last season to an island off Belize in the Caribbean to film ""Temptation Island,"" which separates the partners and sets each person up on dates with attractive singles to see who will cheat.  Patterson and Watson were booted off the show midway through the season after the network said it had discovered that they had a two-year-old child together, making their further participation inappropriate.  The couple claims in their lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, that they revealed the existence of their child when asked during preliminary interviews with Rocket Science and were told that that was ""the wrong answer.""  Patterson and Watson claim that ""Temptation Island"" producers decided that it would boost the show's ratings if the child's existence were suddenly revealed during a broadcast.  During that broadcast, the couple claims, hours of conversation between them and producers was edited and ""manipulated"" to create a false impression that they had kept their child secret.  ""The footage was edited to exclude plaintiffs' responses to the producers questions and falsely portrayed plaintiffs as mischievous and immoral (and that) they had in fact concealed the existence of their own child and that they had nothing to say about it in the face of this disgraceful tongue-lashing,"" the lawsuit claims.",C1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/4r2-couple-sue-tv.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'Couple Sue TV Station'}
"An Ipswich mother, who allowed her son to go on holiday during school term, has been fined £400 after her son repeatedly refused to go to school. The 36-year-old mother, who can not be named for legal reasons, appeared before South East Suffolk Magistrates Court yesterday where magistrates heard her 14-year-old son was currently on holiday in Spain. She told that court: ""He just does not like going to school. Although he is getting better now and seems to be enjoying it."" The boy has had 145 unauthorised absences between October 15 last year and March 22 this year. His absences were blamed on a late-night life style. The mother has been attending parenting classes voluntarily and told the court that she thought they were helping her. Out of the last eight school sessions - there are two a day - he has attended five. Chairman of the bench David Coe asked her if she thought she could get her son to school in future. ""Yes I think I can with some help,"" she said. She told the court that he was on holiday during the time other pupils were doing work experience because he had not been given a place. On sentencing Mr Coe said: ""He is not in school and then he disappears on holiday. We would expect the local authority to bring this back to court quickly if there are further problems."" She was fined £400 and ordered to pay £50. Yesterday's case is the second to be dealt with by south east Suffolk magistrates recently. Last month a 37-year-old was fined £50 after her son had attended just 16 out of 182 sessions. And the cases follow national concern after Oxfordshire mother Patricia Amos was jailed for allowing her children to miss school. She was originally sentenced to 60 days' jail, but this was reduced on appeal.",C1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/4r3-mother-fined.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'Mother Fined For Son's Absences.'}
"A Hermosa Beach man who cried for forgiveness five years ago before a judge sentenced him for the drunken-driving killing of a Lawndale man was shot in a San Luis Obispo prison when he attacked a guard and tried to escape, authorities said Wednesday.  Scott Brockman, 33, taken from the medium-security California Men's Colony to a San Luis Obispo medical clinic for an X-ray on Tuesday, was shot in the back by the guard when he tried to run and jump a fence, police said.  ""He started bashing on the guard and ran off,"" said San Luis Obispo police Capt. Bart Topham. ""The guard was able to get up and chase him down."" Brockman, who had previously been convicted of drunken driving, was sentenced Nov. 19, 1997, in Torrance Superior Court to 14 years in prison following his guilty plea to voluntary manslaughter charges in the death of 27-year-old Jeffrey Dodley.  On Aug. 27, 1996, a drunken Brockman sideswiped a car on Hawthorne Boulevard, ran red lights in an escape attempt, and slammed into the back of Dodley's 1984 Nissan 200SX at Manhattan Beach Boulevard in Lawndale.  The Nissan exploded into a fireball, enveloping the trapped or unconscious Dodley.  Dodley, a teacher's assistant at a Lawndale elementary school who was starting a basketball league for children, died on his way back from a video store.  ""These last months (in jail), I cried out to God, asking why he didn't take me instead of your son,"" Brockman cried at his sentencing.  Brockman was one of two inmates taken Tuesday to the Raytel Medical Imaging office for X-rays. Lt. Larry Vizard, spokesman for the San Luis Obispo prison, said Brockman punched one of two corrections officers in the face and escaped out the back door of the building. The officer chased him, ordered him to stop and fired two shots.  One struck Brockman in the back and exited his abdomen without hitting any vital organs. He was treated at a hospital and returned to prison Wednesday.  Brockman, who had to serve nearly 12 years of his sentence before he is eligible for parole, now could be charged with battery on a peace officer and attempted escape with force.",C1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/4r4-prisoner-shot.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'Prisoner Shot'}
"Fears are growing that a rickety vessel loaded with boatpeople may have sunk as it headed towards New Zealand. The fishing boat, thought to be carrying 42 asylum-seekers, left west Java three weeks ago and looked to be heading along the northern coast of Australia. The wooden boat is so unseaworthy that one report said its propeller had fallen off. Indonesian authorities tracking the suspect boat reportedly lost it from their radar screens three weeks ago. The Australian yesterday quoted an Indonesian naval officer saying it was possible the wooden vessel had sunk. The newspaper said the boat was carrying 18 men, 16 women and eight children.  It quoted the Indonesian officer as saying the boat was heading for New Zealand, but said there were also reports that it could be heading for West Timor. Other theories being put forward last night were that it had turned back, or sought shelter in a secluded bay.  A spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff said there had been no word from the Indonesians and the Australians were not directly tracking the boat because it was yet to reach their territory.  ""The minister can't comment because we just don't know,"" the spokesman said.  ""It was always unlikely that it would get here.""  Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said intelligence services could not yesterday confirm claims that the asylum boat had sunk.  New Zealand officials have been in contact with their Indonesian counterparts about stopping illegal immigrants before they reached international waters.  However, it was believed the chances of the vessel making the hazardous voyage to New Zealand were always slim.  The New Zealand Government this week passed a law setting out tough new fines and jail terms for people-smugglers. The law, which Prime Minister Helen Clark said was designed to protect New Zealand's borders, introduced a $500,000 fine and/or 20-year jail term for convicted people-smugglers.  The Transnational Organised Crime legislation also gives police wider search and seizure powers, allowing them to board boats once they enter New Zealand's ""contiguous zone"", 24 nautical miles off the coast.",C1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/4r43-missing-boat.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'Missing Refugee Boat'}
"A commuter plane had to take evasive action after a Suffolk-based US fighter jet came within 800m of colliding with it, a report revealed yesterday. The pilots of the KLM UK Fokker 50, which was carrying 37 passengers, sent it into a dive and then into a climb to avoid the US Air Force F15E Eagle from RAF Lakenheath. The incident happened as the aircraft, from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, was coming in to land at Teesside Airport on August 13, 2001. The two US crewmen on the F15 had been on a training exercise and were heading south to return to Lakenheath. An Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) report said an air traffic controller warned the Fokker when it was approaching Teesside that a fast-moving aircraft was five miles away and closing. The turboprop plane's collision warning system sounded, prompting the 35-year-old captain to scan the horizon, where he spotted the oncoming jet. An alert saying ""Descend, descend, descend"" then sounded, and the co-pilot sent it into a dive – but seconds later, the warning system sounded again, telling the crew to climb immediately. As the F15 passed below, the captain's radar display showed it as being just 300ft below the Fokker. The captain then saw the plane moving away to his left. After the incident, which happened 35 nautical miles from Teesside, the captain asked a cabin attendant to check that no one had been injured. The report said passengers had been subjected to a force of 2G by the avoiding manoeuvre, but fortunately the 'Fasten seat belts' sign had been on at the time. The rear seat crewman of the F15, which recorded the incident with an on-board video camera, said he had seen the Fokker and estimated it was about 400ft above and would pass behind their aircraft. A report by the safety and quality section of the Manchester Air Traffic Control and Airport found that the controller managing the situation had acted correctly by not giving the Fokker any instructions, as they might have aggravated the situation. The AAIB report found that at their closest point, the two aircraft were 800m apart horizontally and 1500ft apart vertically. Had evasive action not been taken, it is believed the vertical separation of the two aircraft tracks would have been less than 100ft and the lateral separation less than 500m. There had been a previous near-miss in the same area involving a RAF Tornado and a Shorts SD-360 passenger plane in March 2000, the report added. As a result, a number of recommendations were put into force by the Civil Aviation Authority.",C1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/4r44-near-miss.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'Aviation Near Miss'}
"A nagging wife paid off big-time for a New Jersey man, who won $100,000 a year for life in the lottery thanks to his insistent spouse. Jeweler Rasen Patel was dead-set against going to work in Manhattan on March 5 because of bad weather. But his wife, Hina, insisted he go - and he picked up a New York State Lottery instant ticket on his way in. A few scratches of a coin later, and Rasen Patel was screaming with joy. Forecasters had predicted a big blizzard for that day, but the snowfall was light. And that prompted Hina Patel, an accountant, to push her husband to make his usual commute from their home in Edison into the city. ""I wasn't going to go,"" he laughed, as he and his wife picked up their first $100,000 check at a New York Lottery office on Long Island. ""I made him go because he was supposed to collect money owed to him,"" she said.  Rasen Patel bought a ""Set for Life"" instant lottery ticket in Penn Station on a whim and ended up never making it to work that day. Holding his winning ticket, he phoned home and told his wife, ""I'm a rich guy!""  ""I said, 'What are you talking about?' I didn't believe him until he got home and showed me,"" Hina Patel said. ""I am still in shock and can't believe we won. We can now pay for our children's colleges, and we also plan to help people who aren't as fortunate."" The couple has two kids, ages 15 and 10.  They'll keep collecting as long as they live - and the lottery will pay up to $2 million to their estate in the case of their early deaths. Two other lottery winners also accepted their prizes at the same press conference.  Victoria Ragone of Port Jefferson claimed a check for $4.5 million - her take-home pay, before taxes, of a $9 million Lotto win. ""I still can't believe it - I never win anything,"" beamed Ragone, a single medical-billing worker.  She said she wasn't going to go wild with her new fortune at first, but then changed her mind. ""I am going to do something crazy but I don't know what it is . . . maybe a little nip and tuck later,"" she laughed.",C1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/4r45-lottery-couple.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'Couple Win Lottery'}
"Asotin County in Washington State is a beautiful place. Tucked into the south-eastern corner of this western state, the name means ""place of eels"" in the local Indian language and refers to the huge quantity of eels that are found in the county's numerous rivers and other waterways. Asotin is also the home of the A-Team, four members of the local Sheriff's department who are involved in rescue and emergency services provision in the county. While their colleagues busy themselves with illegal hunting and speeding motorists, Kevin Pate, Raul Hernandez, Bryan Grant and Lucy Pigalle have, for some seven years, been at the sharp end of incidents as varied as landslides, flash floods, highway pile ups and even a bear that ran amok in the town of Anatone. ""We are the guys they call when things go badly wrong in the county,"" explains Bryan Grant, a handsome, rugged Oregonian who, at 31, is the ""baby"" of the A-Team. ""We used to be called the ""Asotin Alert Team"" which became the 'AA Team' but we changed it because we didn't want to be thought of as alcoholics!"" Forces of Nature I asked the four members of the A-Team, gathered for this interview in the Sheriff's Office canteen, what caused them most problems. Was it drunken drivers or the wildlife this region of Washington State is famous for? ""I would say it was undoubtedly Mother Nature,"" says Raul Hernandez. ""Just last week, we rescued a guy out of his car that had been swept away by a flash flood on the George Creek. His car was sinking fast but we managed to get the door open and the driver was able to swim to the shore. Unfortunately, he was driving with his Labrador dog and we couldn't save the dog in time."" Kevin Pate, 48 years old and the senior member of the rescue crew, agrees. ""We get some extreme weather in this part of the state. We've had everything from earthquakes to tornadoes."" Forest fires are also a big killer. Last summer, a large stretch of the Umatilla National Forest, which is situated in the west of the county, went up in smoke. Kevin continues. ""The firefighters succeeded in controlling the blaze and we were involved in rescue missions. A lot of picnickers and the like got caught up in the fire and many of them couldn't get out as they were more or less surrounded by towering flames in a gusting wind."" Part of the Job Lucy Pigalle, 36, recalls the Umatilla fires. ""Many people are just convinced that these things won't reach out and touch them. Until it's too late, that is. This one family of four was trapped in a picnic area with a wall of fire surrounding them. They couldn't get out at all. We managed to beat a path into the area and were able to get them out with about five minutes to spare. It was terrifying. Tragically, that day, four out-of-state visitors perished in the Umatilla National Forest."" Bryan Grant sums up the thoughts of the rest of the group when he states that, ""you get to see tragedy and death as part of the job. You almost become desensitized to it. You can't save everybody. You just have to remember all the people you managed to save!"" I left Asotin with a reassuring feeling that my safety, should tragedy strike, would be in the hands of these competent, brave individuals who would combat hell and high water to save me.",C1,https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/4r53-who-you-gonna-call.php,esl_lounge,{'title': 'Who You Gonna Call?'}
