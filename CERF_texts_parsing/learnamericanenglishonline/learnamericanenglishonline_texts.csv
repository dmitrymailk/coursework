"Its the end of the school year. Most schools in the United States close for the summer. They dont have air conditioning, and its too hot to be inside. Students and teachers can look forward to a summer vacation that lasts three months. Students are excited about the summer. Some students will go to summer camps. Others will go on vacation. Kids join sports groups and go to the parks and the beaches. Some kids take swimming lessons at community pools. Older kids have jobs. Its important to start saving money for college, so they find jobs at stores and restaurants. They cut lawns or babysit. Some kids help their parents on the family farm. Teachers also get jobs during the summer. Teachers salaries in the United States are not as high as they are in other industrialized countries. A summer job becomes necessary, especially for teachers who have large families to support. Nowadays, its possible for students to take classes online during the summer.

The bloodmobile will arrive in the afternoon. A bloodmobile is a large vehicle. Inside the vehicle nurses or phlebotomists take blood from blood donors. The donors sit in chairs while their blood flows into plastic bags.  Not everyone will give blood. Its voluntary. Volunteers choose to donate blood. Only students over the age of 18 can donate. Many teachers and staff will also choose to donate. Its important to find out what your blood type is when you give blood. Donated blood has to match the blood of the person who receives it. Blood is identified by the letters A, B, and O. Nurses test each persons blood before its donated. They also need to look at your drivers license or blood donors card.  The nurses want to make sure that were okay after we give blood, so theyll tell us to stick around for ten to fifteen minutes after the blood is donated. We will get something to drink and something to eat. Theres usually orange juice and cookies. It feels good to give blood. It feels good to help people who are in need.

"Skyscrapers are very tall buildings. They are found in many large, American cities. Skyscrapers in New York City and Chicago reach more than a 1000 feet into the sky (304.8 meters), which is about the length of three football fields. These huge structures are appropriately named ""skyscrapers"" because they are so tall that they seem to touch, or ""scrape"" the sky and the clouds. On a clear day, you can see a skyscraper from several miles away. Early skyscrapers were built with iron, steel, and masonry; modern skyscrapers are built with steel, concrete, and a lot of glass. Skyscraper construction is popular in large cities nowadays because land is very valuable. The only direction for the development of a large building in a busy downtown is up. Skyscrapers help define a citys skyline, and they help preserve land for parks and public plazas. The Empire State Building (right photo) in New York has more than 100 floors. Its a very famous building. Tourists enjoy going to the observation deck near the top of the building. From there, they have a good view of the city. The Empire State Building was the tallest building in the city until the construction of the World Trade Center buildings in the 1970s. The tallest skyscraper in the United States is the Sears Tower (renamed the Willis Tower in 2009) in Chicago, Illinois. The tallest skyscraper in the world is in Dubai (the Burj Khalifa). It stands at 2,717 feet (828 meters), which is about the length of eight-and-a-half football fields.

The bread is then topped with a slice of tomato, fresh mozarella cheese, and basil. For the main course, Patty roasted some chicken and some potatoes.

But when they get older, they can become quite large and very destructive. Thats one reason why its not a good idea to keep a raccoon as a pet.  Raccoons are nocturnal animals.

"Everything feels new and fresh with the arrival of spring. You can smell the change of season in the air. Soon after the snow melts, grass begins to grow again, and the trees and flowers begin to blossom. Its the start of the growing season. Among the first flowers to blossom are tulips. They can withstand the cool, early spring temperatures. Even a little snow fails to prevent tulips from growing. These beautiful flowers come in all kinds of colors: pink, yellow, white, purple, and red tulips pop up very quickly once the ground is warm and loose. The grass that reappears in spring is a bright green color. Its soft and spongy from spring rain. Birds search through the grass for worms and insects reawakened from a winters sleep. Both the dirt and the grass smell pungent and fertile at this time of the year. Trees produce flowers and leaves. The blossoming trees attract bees and other insects that hurry from one flower to another. They pollinate the trees and the flowers. Successful pollination produces fruit and seeds for the summer and the fall.",A2,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Red_Level_Reading/18_Spring.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/159248987&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false', 'title': '18.

"Everyone loves the summer. The days are long, the weather is hot, and school is out. For most people, this season provides many opportunities to have fun, do interesting things, or just relax. Many people in the United States go somewhere on vacation during the summer. They travel across the country to visit famous places, or they stay closer to home and go camping or visit a beach on the ocean or on a lake. Americans travel by plane and by car. The highways are busy. Hotels and restaurants are busy too. For people who stay close to home, the beach is a popular destination. Its a place where kids and adults can go swimming, or they can just sit on the warm sand and soak up the sun. Children play in the sand while adults supervise activity in and out of the water. During an occasional heat wave, beaches and community swimming pools are crowded with people seeking relief from the heat. There are also many festivals and cultural activities to attend in the summer. At state and county fairs, farmers exhibit their animals. They also put on display the crops that they grow and the machinery that they use to grow the crops. Rides and amusements keep everyone laughing and having a good time. Almost every town and city has some kind of summer event where the public is invited. Some people just like to stick around the house in the summer and take it easy. They tend to their gardens and maintain their homes. They invite their friends over for backyard barbeques and stay up late at night while their children play games and look for fireflies. In June, fruit trees begin to show their potential for the summer and fall harvests. Cherries and plums are ready to pick by July and August. Apples arent ready until September or October. If you dont have a fruit tree in your backyard, you can visit your local farmers market and find locally grown fruit. Its cheaper than the fruit sold at the grocery store, and its usually organic. Summer seems to linger on longer than the other seasons; however, all summers come to an end eventually. The sun rises a little later each day and sets a little earlier. Families make preparations for a return to school after Labor Day, and before you know it, summer is over. Cooler temperatures, shorter daylight hours, and autumn air bring forth a new season.",A2,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Red_Level_Reading/19_Summer.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/157690421&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false', 'title': '19.

"On Friday, Eduardo and his girlfriend, Tina, had some friends over for a backyard barbeque.They expected at least ten people to show up. Eduardo made hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken wings, and grilled vegetables for his guests. He likes to use his grill and eat outside whenever the weather is nice. He even cooks outside during the winter. Tina helped Eduardo to prepare the food. First, they went to the grocery store to get the things that they needed: hamburger and hotdog buns, ground beef, hot dogs, chicken, cole slaw, zucchini, green and red peppers, potato chips, pop, wine, and beer. They also bought a gallon of chocolate ice cream. Eduardos friends from college came over some time after 4 p.m. Tina invited some of her friends from work. They arrived a little later. Everyone sat in the backyard and talked until the food was ready. After dinner was finished, Eduardo and Tina gave everyone a glass of champagne. Champagne at a backyard barbeque? That seemed odd–until they made their big announcement. They plan on getting married! What a surprise! The wedding wont be until next year because they have a lot of planning to do. Their friends laughed at the surprise announcement and someone made a toast, but it wasnt really that big of a surprise. Everyone knew that they would eventually get married.

"Fall is in the air. The nights are getting longer, the days are getting shorter, and its getting much cooler. The warm days of summer are over. Now we can enjoy the beauty of fall as the leaves change their colors. During the fall, the leaves on the trees turn from green to gold, yellow, orange, brown or red. These are fall colors. Some trees, such as spruce and pine trees, remain green throughout the year. To see so many different colors on all of the trees at one time is what makes the fall such a beautiful time of year. As it gets closer to winter, the leaves fall off of the trees until finally the trees are bare. Are they dead? No, theyre still very much alive. The trees are just going to sleep for the winter.

"Wally worked on his house last weekend. He needed to replace an old deck that hung over the back of the house. The wood on the deck was beginning to rot. When wood begins to rot, its time to replace it. Wally figured it was a two-man job, so he called his brother, Steve, and asked him to lend a hand. Wally has almost all of the tools necessary for a project like this one. He owns hand tools and power tools. A good hammer and a cordless drill are especially helpful to have. He used the hammer to pound in nails and the cordless drill was used for the screws. Steve brought over his circular saw because Wally had only a hand saw to cut the pieces of lumber. With Steves help, they got the job done quickly. They removed the old pieces of wood that were rotting and replaced them with new lumber. They also sealed the wood to prevent it from rotting in the first place. Afterwards, they tested the deck by sitting on it to make sure it was strong enough to hold a group of people. They also double-checked all the work they did before calling a building inspector. The inspectors job is to make sure that construction work is properly done. Next week, Wally will go over to Steves house to help him pour concrete for a patio and a walkway. They enjoy working together. Not only does it make a job go faster, they learn from each other, and they enjoy each others company.",A2,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Red_Level_Reading/22_Wally_worked_on_his_house.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/162835485&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false', 'title': '22.

"I used to drive to work every day. The commute took almost 35 minutes each way, so the total time in the car amounted to over an hour daily. It never used to bother me until I started to think about how much time and money I spent in travel expenses. Driving to work was also a daily, nerve-wracking experience. Traffic congestion and construction delays would create unsafe driving conditions. It was also frustrating to drive during rush hour. Heavy traffic in the morning forced me to leave early so that I would not be late for work. Then, on days when it snowed or when there was ice on the highways, I was concerned about losing control of my car and crashing into another vehicle or driving off of the road completely. So when I changed jobs and found something closer to home, I was happy to learn that I had good alternatives to driving: I could ride my bike to work, I could take the bus, or I could walk. Now I try to ride my bike or take the bus whenever its possible. I also like to walk. It doesnt matter if it takes an hour to walk to work. An hour of walking counts as an hour of exercise.

"Americans drink a lot of coffee. They drink it in the morning, in the afternoon, and some even drink it at night. Every city, town, and neighborhood has a place where you can go to get coffee. Starbucks, Dunn Brothers, and Caribou are among the most popular coffee shops. Some fast food places like McDonalds or Burger King have it available too. There are also a lot of mom and pop coffee shops. These are small coffee shops that are owned by the people who work there. Coffee drinkers are very particular about how their coffee tastes, so they add things to it. Some people like cream, some people like milk, and some people put sugar into their coffee. People who take it black dont put in anything. I always drink coffee in the morning. Soon after I wake up, I head to the kitchen and go straight to the coffee maker. I always put in a little half and half. Two or three cups is all I need. If I dont have at least one cup of coffee in the morning, I get a headache later in the day.

"Do you need to get a drivers license? Its important to get a drivers license if you live in the United Sates. Without a license, a person cant legally drive a car. A drivers license is also useful when cashing a check or whenever its necessary to show proof of identification. If you dont know how to drive and you need to get a license, these are the steps to take: however, laws vary from state to state. Keep in mind that each state might have slightly different requirements. First, go to your local library to see if there are any books, manuals, or DVDs that explain the rules of the road. Look for books and manuals that are from the state in which you live. Make sure the books you find contain up-to-date information about state rules and laws you need to know. Second, if English is your second language, you should learn how to identify the important parts of a car in English. Wheres the glove box? Whats under the hood? How many miles are on the odometer? Basic English vocabulary will help you pass your tests. Third, obtain a permit to drive. This is a temporary, state-issued piece of paper which you can get after passing a written test. A permit will allow you to drive a car when a licensed driver is in the car with you. Some states require learners to attend a drivers education course. Fourth, after you get your permit, find someone who can help you practice your driving–but you must have the permit first! After you have enough practice, you can take a road test. Fifth, take a road test. Go to the state facility that issues drivers licenses. You have to fill out an application, pay a fee, and then take a driving test while an inspector watches you drive. If you do well on the road test, you will get your drivers license. If you dont do well on the road test, you will have to take the test again at a later date. Be prepared. If you study for your tests and practice your driving, you will be able to get a drivers license.",A2,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Red_Level_Reading/28_a_license_to_drive.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/172452172&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false', 'title': '28.

"Dan has to do his laundry today. The last time he washed his clothes was almost two weeks ago. He hates doing laundry. It feels like a waste of time, but now he needs something to wear. Its Thursday morning. This is a good time to get it done. In his bedroom theres a huge pile of dirty clothes. He puts them into a laundry basket, gets the detergent, and goes down to the laundry room in the basement of his apartment building. Fortunately, there isnt anyone using the machines. Sometimes Dan has to wait until another tenant is finished washing and drying clothes. He puts a load of dark clothes into the washer. These are mostly jeans, t-shirts, and shirts he wears to work. Then he goes back upstairs to do other things while the machine gets to work. When he comes back down to the laundry room, someone else is there waiting to use the washing machine. Its his neighbor, Suzanne. ""Hi Suzanne. How are you doing?"" asks Dan. ""Im fine. How are you?"" Suzanne has a huge basket of clothes balanced on her hip.

"Alex delivers pizza. He has been working as a pizza delivery man for the last two years after moving to Chicago from Ukraine. The job was very difficult at first because he didnt know the area very well. But because Chicago is on a well-planned grid, he quickly figured out how to use the grid system of numbers and directions. He learned how to go from north to south, and from east to west. Soon it seemed easy to get around. Most of the money that Alex earns comes in the form of tips. The average tip is two or three dollars, but some people dont give tips at all. Some tips are very large. The largest tip Alex ever received was $50. He got the money when he delivered twenty pizzas to a party. At first Alex thought he was in the money. The tips were good and he received a minimum wage of $8.25 per hour. With his tips and his hourly wage combined, he makes an average of $15 to $20 an hour; however, theres a lot of driving involved and Alex has to pay for all of his gas himself. This job has also put a lot of miles on the car he drives. Delivery people have to use their own cars, so the extra miles have resulted in a lot of extra wear and tear on the car. He needs extra maintenance on his car to keep it running properly. Alex isnt interested in delivering pizzas forever.

They havent decided on a wedding date. They also arent sure about where to have the reception after the wedding ceremony. They dont know if the wedding should be large or small, and they havent even decided on a church for the ceremony. Because weddings are so expensive, theyve considered the possibility of just having a very small wedding and using the money they save to take a long honeymoon in Europe.

"Jessica and Al are buying a house. Theyve lived in an apartment for the last four years, but now that they have a baby, they think they need more space, so theyve made an offer on a house, and the offer was accepted.  After looking for a few months, they found a three-bedroom rambler that they are able to afford. It has a big kitchen, a fireplace, two large bathrooms, a full basement, and a two-car garage. It also has a covered deck, so they can sit outside, even when it rains. The price for the house was $209,000 when they first looked at it. That was too much for them to pay. Then the sellers lowered the price to $189,900. Suddenly, the house seemed affordable. They offered $185,000 and their offer was accepted.  They estimate their monthly mortgage payment will be about $1,400. That includes the cost for insurance and property taxes. Theyll move in at the end of the month after they attend the closing. The closing is the time at which they sign all the necessary documents and agreements for purchasing the house. Theyre a little nervous, but they believe that this is a good decision for their family. Vocabulary: closing: a meeting during which ownership of a house is transferred from seller to buyer. The buyer(s) can move into the house after the closing. afford = to be able to buy or pay for something rambler = a one-story house. This style was very popular in the 1950s and 1960s, but some new houses are still built in this style. See the picture of the house to the right?

"Barb and Don recycle. They keep recyclable materials in a recycling bin in their garage. They put paper and cardboard, bottles, cans, and plastic containers in the bin. On the day when their garbage is picked up, their recycling is picked up separately from the garbage and taken to a recycling center. Barb and Don recycle because they know its the right thing to do. Recycling saves landfill space, and it reduces the amount of energy needed to turn raw materials into consumer products. Recycling also helps to reduce water and air pollution. In addition to recycling, Barb and Don keep a compost pile in their backyard. Instead of throwing away biodegradable waste such as fruit and vegetables or grass and leaves, they put all of those things into a large pile of dirt in their backyard. Occasionally, they turn the dirt over to mix the waste together. Over time, the compost pile absorbs the organic materials and then they can use the compost in their gardens to provide a rich source of nutrients for their plants. Vocabulary: bin: a large container for storing things biodegradable: natural absorption by the environment.  landfill: an area for the long-term storage of garbage. This is usually a large hole in the ground that is lined by plastic.  raw materials: natural materials that are changed into products intended for consumption.",B1,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Yellow_Level_Reading/6_Barb_and_Don_recycle.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://www.speakpipe.com/widget/inline/5ryg9bazycl85vel4wp05tr5k4wp056c', 'title': '6.

"A good diet and regular exercise should keep you healthy. Your body needs the vitamins and nutrients found in vegetables and fruit. It also needs enough exercise to strengthen muscles and bones and reduce your chances of getting sick. Paying attention to diet and exercise isnt that hard. If you do it, your life will be better. What kind of a diet is best? At the top of anyones list should be fresh fruit and vegetables. You also need to eat grains such as rice, wheat, oats, or corn. Dairy products in the form of milk and cheese provide your body with necessary calcium. Protein comes from meat and nuts. Dont eat too much meat, however. Eating too much red meat, in particular, is not good for your heart, and it might increase your chances of getting cancer. When it comes to exercise, adults need at least 30 minutes of daily exercise. That can include walking, running, riding a bicycle, or working out at a gym. You can also have fun while getting exercise if you like to play basketball, soccer, baseball, or other team sports. Avoiding bad habits such as smoking or drinking alcohol will also keep you healthy. Try not to eat junk food. Whats junk food? Potato chips, donuts, candy, and cookies are junk food. Many people who eat junk food fail to eat healthy food because they like the taste of junk food better. If you fill up on junk food, you probably wont eat healthy food. If your kids eat a lot of junk food, they will develop bad eating habits. Being healthy is not that hard. If you eat right, get regular exercise, and avoid unhealthy habits, you will thank yourself in the future.",B1,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Yellow_Level_Reading/7_A_good_diet_and_regular_exercise.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/162038001&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false', 'title': '7.

"Spencer has been riding a skateboard for many years. He started when he was thirteen years old, and hes been doing it ever since. Now hes twenty, and he has a lot of experience under his belt. His friends have also stuck with it, and many of them are quite good at skateboarding. Spencer knows how to do a lot of different tricks on his skateboard. He can do wheelies, pivot, and slide down railings. He also knows how to do ollies and kickflip the skateboard while he is riding on it. In the area where he lives, there are many hills. He can ride down a steep hill very quickly and stop the skateboard whenever necessary. All of these things he can do after years of practice and experience. Unfortunately, Spencer had a bad accident a couple of years ago as he was riding his skateboard to a class. A car hit him as he was going through an intersection. He broke his right leg and had cuts and bruises all over his body. He was taken to the hospital where he remained for three days before being released. It just goes to show that anyone can wipe out on a skateboard–even someone with as much experience as he has. Now that hes in college, Spencer doesnt have as much time to hangout with his friends and go to the skate park, but he still uses the skateboard for transportation. Hes a little more cautious these days due to the accident and his memory of being hospitalized, yet he refuses to let that prevent him from doing something that he loves.",B1,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Yellow_Level_Reading/8_Spencer_has_been_riding_a_skateboard.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/162039926&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false', 'title': '8.

If he knew that, he wouldnt be so tense.  Sergey has a reputation for being late to work. He always blames it on the traffic. Everyone tells him he has to leave his house earlier to beat the rush.

"Janice is a careful shopper, especially when it comes to grocery shopping. By being careful, she can save money, and then she can find the best value for her dollar. Here are some of the things that she does before and during her shopping trip. First, she always brings a list with her to the grocery store. By sticking to a list, she can avoid buying a lot of things that she doesnt need. Janice also uses coupons and she looks for special deals in the newspaper when she shops. Before she goes shopping, she finds and cuts out coupons in the newspaper for things that are on sale. She also loads up her shopping cart with food items if they are on sale. Janice then stores them in her pantry or in her freezer for future use. She usually goes shopping early in the morning because the stores arent crowded at that time, and the food is usually fresher. Eight or nine oclock in the morning is a great time to go. The worst time to go shopping for food is in the afternoon on the weekend. The lines are longer and its more difficult to get around crowded grocery aisles. Most importantly, Janice makes sure that she doesnt go shopping on an empty stomach. Grocery shopping while hungry leads shoppers to make bad choices. Janice puts the money that she saves into the bank. Over time, shell have enough money to make a large purchase, like for a car or a house.

On the weekends, he plays a guitar in a four-piece rock band. Janice thinks everyone should learn how to play a musical instrument.

"Miss Beano is a substitute teacher. Mr. Larson was out yesterday, so the American history class was taught by Miss Beano. Miss Beano has been working as a substitute for about a year. Shes eager to have her own classroom, but until there is an opening for a new teacher, she fills in for teachers who miss work due to illness or personal matters. The students she taught were not very cooperative. Immediately, when they found out that Miss Beano was their sub, students started to repeat, ""Miss Beano is a mean-o."" She could hear what the students were saying, but she chose to ignore them. Several students gave false names or exchanged names when Miss Beano took attendance. Steven became Patrick, and Patrick became Steven. Amy became Chris, and Chris became Amy. Oscar became Jose. All of the students thought the use of fake names was hilarious, but Miss Beano didnt know why everyone was laughing. When a paper airplane sailed across the room and hit Miss Beano in the back of the head, her face became flushed, first from embarrassment, but then quickly her embarrassment turned to anger. ""Who threw that paper airplane?"" she demanded. Of course, no one raised a hand. The students sat silently and looked away from Miss Beanos determined stare. ""I want the name of the student who threw that at me,"" she demanded loudly, again, but no one said anything. Some students began to hum. Because no one came forward to admit responsibility, Miss Beano told all of the students to close their books and sit in silence until the bell rang for them to leave for their next class. She told the students how unhappy she was with their behavior. She also said that she would write a detailed report so that the regular classroom teacher, Mr. Larson, would know what happened. This suddenly concerned the students. Most of them were scared of Mr. Larson. He is very experienced and effective when it comes to disciplining students. Being a substitute teacher is difficult. Many students have very little respect for a sub. They take advantage of the subs lack of personal knowledge about students. Some of the kids speak in a disrespectful manner. They would never behave that way with their regular classroom teacher, but for some reason, they think they can get away with it when theres a sub. When the day was over and all of the students had left the building, Miss Beano began to cry a little bit. She had never expected such bad treatment from students as she trained to become a teacher.

"Living in the city in the United States can be interesting and fun. There you will find a diversity of people, culture, and activities. If you are planning to move to the United States, think carefully about which city to live in. There are many great places to choose from. After you have made a choice for a city, youll have to consider which area or neighborhood best suits your needs. Downtown is the center of the city. This is the heart of the business district, and sometimes its the first place immigrants think to visit or live when they arrive. A citys downtown has museums, live theatrical or musical performances, and lively shopping districts. Youll know you are downtown because thats usually where all the skyscrapers are. The downtown area, however, can be very expensive. In order to save money, neighborhoods outside of the downtown are good alternatives. Its also important for you to know that most big cities in the United States have ethnic neighborhoods that identify with a particular nationality or culture. There are Mexican neighborhoods, Indian neighborhoods, Somalian neighborhoods, Russian neighbohoods, and so on. Whatever a persons nationality might be, theres an American city with a neighborhood that matches it. New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. all have large and diverse ethnic neighborhoods. Ethnic diversity is great because it means that there are many different kinds of food available. You can get middle-eastern food, Thai food, Chinese food, German food, or food from just about any country or region around the world. A person from Mexico who moves to a big city wont have any problem finding a Mexican grocery store or a Mexican restaurant. When people immigrate to the U.S., many of them find jobs in food-related business or they start their own business selling the cuisine of their native country. Almost all large cities host both amateur and professional sports teams. Whatever type of sport you like will be available somewhere. Soccer, known as ""football"" in most other countries, is growing in popularity, but the most popular sports to watch are baseball, football, basketball, and hockey. The one downside to living in a city is dealing with traffic congestion. Many cities dont have good public transportation systems, which means that people rely on their personal vehicles for getting around. This causes traffic jams and long waits when traveling to and within the city. The good news is that many cities are starting to deal with traffic problems by encouraging people to walk or ride a bike when traveling around the city. When thinking about a place to live, try to find something thats close to your job. Compared to cities in Europe, the Middle East, or Asia, American cities are not very old. If you want to go to a city rich in history, consider the east coast cities of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, or Washington D.C. If you are interested in more modern cities, travel to the west. Cities like Denver, Los Angeles, and Seatle are relatively new. Wherever you choose to go, it wont be boring. American cities are dynamic and interesting. Theyre places of great economic activity and opportunity. The people you see working and making money come from all over the world, and thats one of the things that makes living in the city a great experience.",B1,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Yellow_Level_Reading/21_Living_in_the_city.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218063533&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false', 'title': '21.

"Do you want to go to college in the United States? There are a few basic yet important things that you should know about attending a college or a university in the U.S.* First, most colleges require students to pay tuition. While a college education in other countries might be free or offered at a low cost, in the United States tuition for a full year of college can cost between $5000 to $50,000 a year. Most students have to take out loans to pay for their education; however, some financial help is available through scholarships and grants. Some schools require students to live on campus. Students who live on campus live in residence halls or dormitories. They share a room with one or more students. They also share bathroom facilities. Students eat together in large dining halls that provide a wide variety of food choices. Most dining halls are all-you-can-eat, so no one leaves hungry. Some students live off campus in apartment buildings, or they rent houses. Other students live in fraternity or sorority houses. Fraternities and sororities are college organizations that attract students with special interests in particular areas of study; however, the main purpose for fraternities and sororities is social activity. They are well-known for hosting special events, fundraisers, and parties. The first year of college is called freshman year. A freshman is usually 18 or 19 years old and away from home for the first time. Freshman students take general courses intended to provide a solid foundation for the academic courses that they take in the following three years. The second year of college is called sophomore year. Sophomores take general courses while considering a narrower focus on courses that are related to a particular major. A major is the main area of study that provides preparation for a career. Majors are offered for many different fields: art, economics, business, education, history, philosophy, architecture, computer sciences, and so on. A large university is very likely to offer a major that can match a students interests. The third year of college, junior year, and the fourth year of college, senior year, are focused almost entirely on a students major. By this time, he or she knows which academic area is the best fit. After graduation, students can enter directly into a career or they may attend graduate school to pursue an advanced degree. Although its expensive to attend college, the costs are well worth it. Some say this is the best time in a persons life because young people are so open-minded and eager to take advantage of the opportunities offered by a college education. They meet people who have similar interests and they learn how to focus on achieving success. Anyone with enough ambition and a strong desire to learn may fulfill his or her academic and personal goals at an American college. *Note: The words ""college"" and ""university"" are used interchangeably in the United States.",B1,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Yellow_Level_Reading/22_College_life.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232617785&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false', 'title': '22.

"The holiday season is upon us. It begins with Thanksgiving, and it ends with New Years Day. Its a time to reflect on the past year and make plans for the upcoming year. Family and friends frequently get together for parties or attend holiday events and church services together. Americans have to do a lot of traveling during the holiday season because its a time to be near the ones they love. On the fourth Thursday of every November, Americans celebrate Thanksgiving. People gather together with friends and relatives for a day to give thanks for our good fortune here in the United States. There is a lot to be thankful for! On Thanksgiving Day, we sit down for a big feast that includes turkey, potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and other traditional and nontraditional American food. The highways are busy and the airports are crowded as travelers go to and from their destinations. The day after Thanksgiving is called Black Friday.* Retailers make most of their money during this important shopping season. Thats why its called Black Friday. The stores are crowded with shoppers. They make purchases in stores and online in anticipation of Christmas when gifts are exchanged. The prices are usually a little lower at this time of year–but not always. Careful shoppers can wait for bargains to appear as it gets closer to Christmas. As Christmas approaches, the month of December is busy with parties, concerts, and special events. Christmas music fills the air. Lighted displays help brighten long nights heading into winter. Many Americans feel good that Christmas is coming. They get into the holiday mood with brightly-colored decorations and by putting up Christmas trees inside their homes. Others, however, will be happy when Christmas is over. They feel there is too much attention on just this one day. On Christmas Eve, people get together with loved ones. Everyone wishes each other a ""Merry Christmas."" They have parties, or they attend evening church services. Some people sing Christmas carols or watch Christmas celebrations on TV. Children wait for Santa Claus to arrive on Christmas Eve. Santa travels all over the world, bringing toys and other gifts to children who were good during the year.  When Christmas Day arrives, gifts are found under the Christmas tree. Children believe that Santa Claus left most of the presents. Stockings are filled with small gifts and candy. A Christmas Day feast may include beef, turkey, ham, or seafood. Some people visit family or attend a church service on this special day to commemorate the birth of Jesus. On New Years Eve, everyone counts down the hours and the minutes as the year comes to a close. There are parties with lots of food and alcoholic beverages. Champaign is very popular on New Years Eve. The bars and restaurants are usually packed. Most people want to stay out late on this night and be with friends. New Years Day is a holiday. Its the end of the holiday season and the first day of the new year. Most stores are closed on this day, so many Americans just stay home and relax. Some people have special New Years Day meals; others just watch football games on TV. People make plans to change their lives in the new year. They make resolutions to lose weight or end a bad habit such as drinking or smoking. The beginning of a new year presents new opportunities to live a better life and be a better person.

"Do you like to fly? These days air travel is a very common means of transportation. Its fast and its usually reliable, but not everyone likes to fly on an airplane. Why is that? Lets first consider that there are many good reasons for flying. Its fast and sometimes it costs less than traveling by car, or its the only real option for getting from point A to point B. However, changes to the airline industry over the last decade or so have made air travel a less desirable form of transportation. In addition to that, many more people can afford the price of a ticket for themselves and their families, so an increase in ridership has also increased the problems that are currently being reported. One of the biggest things to dislike about flying is airline security.  Although good security is necessary these days, it has resulted in long lines at airports. Travelers with flights to catch often have to arrive at the airport one to two hours early in order to pass through the check-in areas. In the United States, TSA (Transportation Security Administration) carefully checks luggage and screens passengers before they are allowed to go to their gates for departure, but this takes a lot of time, and sometimes people miss their flights because of lengthy screening procedures. After you have arrived at the gate, there is a waiting period to board the airplane. Prior to boarding, some unlucky passengers might learn that they have been bumped off the flight.  A passenger is bumped because planes are often booked to capacity, or they are overbooked. That means there are not enough seats on the plane for everyone. Bumped passengers might receive free air travel or a reduced rate for travel on another fight to compensate for their loss, but its still an inconvenient situation. Weather delays also cause problems. If the weather is bad at either the point of departure or arrival, a delay can mean an additional waiting period of hours, but in some situations that involve severe weather, it means that a flight must be rescheduled for the next day or the day after that. Once on the plane, passengers who dont have the luxury of flying first class find themselves uncomfortably wedged into small seating areas. Fellow passengers are sometimes rude, or their personal hygiene makes for an unpleasant seating arrangement. Spending four hours sitting next to someone who really needs to take a bath can be unbearable. Then there are those people who never stop talking, or they invade the personal space of the people sitting next to them. Others are just plain mean or obnoxious. Compared to the problems faced by a majority of people around the world, the discomfort or hassle of traveling by plane could seem trivial. This is what we call a ""first-world problem."" Furthermore, according to the statistics, its much safer to travel by plane than it is to travel by car or by train. However, the complaints typically heard these days about the airlines are causing some travelers to reconsider their method of transportation, perhaps choosing to drive if possible. So, what do you think? Despite all these problems and hassles, do you like to fly? (Personally, I always wonder how something so heavy and loaded with so many people manages to even get off the ground. )",B1,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Yellow_Level_Reading/24_Do_you_like_to_fly.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/254830285&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false', 'title': '24.

"Every two years in the United States there are national elections for members of the U.S. Congress and for governors of states. Every four years these contests include an election for President of the United States. This year is a presidential election year which concludes with a general election in November of 2016. The election season always seems long, but its especially long when it involves the election of a President. Campaigns begin in the year before the election. Candidates from each of the two main political parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, raise money and assemble campaign staff. They visit many different cities and states, shake hands with voters, and make speeches. The media pay close attention to what the candidates have to say. Newspaper reporters, TV journalists, and other political correspondents listen to speeches and candid remarks from the candidates, and then report that information to the general public. Some of what the candidates say may be misleading or untrue. Reporters try to find the truth. The news media are an important part of the election process. There are debates, primary elections, and caucuses before the big general election in November. Candidates debate each other within each party. Democrats debate against other Democrats. Republicans debate against other Republicans. The goal is to attract the largest amount of support prior to the primary elections and caucuses that are held in each state. The state of Iowa votes first. Then the residents of New Hampshire vote, and after that the remaining states and territories get their chance to vote. These state elections are an important part of the nominating process as they help to determine who the official candidates will be. During the summer of an election year, the two main political parties hold conventions. The conventions are where the nomination process concludes and candidates are officially chosen and announced. Delegates from each state announce their support for the nominee of their political party. There are few surprises at the conventions, but they are televised and many people like to watch what happens there.  Prior to the general election in November, the main candidates, usually a Democrat and a Republican, debate each other on the issues. They visit different areas of the country to make speeches and meet with voters. Candidates campaign hard during this two or three-month period of time. On almost every day there is a newsworthy event or speech, so the voters pay close attention. Finally, in November, on the second Tuesday of the month, elections are held. No one know for sure who is going to win, but there are always a lot of predictions. Whom do you think is going to win the election for President this year?

"Sylvia wants to buy a used car. She needs a car to get to work. She also needs a car in order to pick up groceries and make short trips around the neighborhood.  She has been taking the bus the last few years, but now that shes making more money from her job, she can afford to buy a small, inexpensive vehicle.  Every weekend she visits car dealers.  Most car dealers sell used cars, so she visits the used car lots and checks on the prices of used vehicles. Her budget is somewhere between  $4000 and $6000, which limits her selection, but there are enough cars in that price range for her to choose from.  When she finds a car she likes she asks a salesperson if she can drive it. She needs to know how the car will feel when shes on the road. Is it comfortable? Is it fast enough? Does it make any strange noises? Is it easy to locate the controls and read the gauges?  Salespeople are always eager to help customers, so they agree to let her drive a car that she likes. Sometimes they get in the car with her; at other times, they take a photocopy of her drivers license and let her take the car for a spin by herself.  A salesperson who helps a customer buy a car will get a commission, which is a percentage of the sale.  So, what kind of car does she want? German? Japanese? American? Sylvia likes the way that German cars feel when she drives them. She likes VWs, Audis, and Mercedes, but theyre really expensive. Japanese cars are much less expensive cars. She likes Toyotas and Hondas because they have good reputations. American cars are the least expensive, but shes concerned about their reliability.  Sylvia is also concerned about the age and the mileage of the car that she buys. If she buys a car thats too old, it might need a lot of repairs. If she buys a car that has a lot of miles on it, some parts might have to be replaced. Shes hoping to find a car that has under 100,000 miles and is less than ten years old.  Once Sylvia makes her final decision on a car, shell apply for a loan. She has $2000 saved for this purchase, but thats not enough to buy a good, reliable car. Shell have to finance the rest. Shes hoping to keep the monthly payments between $150 to $200.

He wants a job that is more challenging, more interesting, and closer to home. He also wants to make more money.  This is Boris.  The place where he works now, International Foods, is a good company, and it has a good reputation as an employer. Its been in business in St. Paul for over fifty years. When Boris first started at the company, he was involved with food preparation, making sandwiches and doing deliveries. He was quickly promoted to better paying jobs with higher salaries because he worked so hard. Now, Boris is a supervisor and oversees a staff of over 30 people! Boris figures he could probably stay at the company for many more years, but this seems like the right time to make a transition to a new job.    In the city and state where he lives, the unemployment rate is very low. Now is a good time to look for a new job. The worst time to look for a new job is when the unemployment rate is high. Without a lot of competition from other job seekers, Boris believes his chances of finding a good job near his home are quite good.  Boris has been working on his resume. Its been a long time since hes had to send resumes to prospective employers. He took a class through a community education program that helps people make transitions to new employment. Without the class, Boris doesnt think he would have been able to put together a good resume. Now he feels more confident with a resume that looks polished and professional.  Change is hard for some people. For Boris its particularly difficult. He would like things to stay the same.

The sculptures are kept outside year round, so they must be able to withstand precipitation, heat, cold, or constant exposure to the sun. Visitors to a sculpture garden are often pleasantly surprised by the wide variety of approaches to sculpture. Some sculptures are modern and abstract while other sculputures take on a more traditional form that resembles people or animals. Sculpture gardens can be found in many cities around the world.

"North America is home to people from all over the world. Some are the descendents of Native Americans who have lived on the continent for thousands of years, while others are the children of European immigrants who have lived in North America for hundreds of years or for only a few generations. There are also millions of people who descend from African slaves brought to North America as part of the transatlantic slave trade that flourished up until the 18th century.  Its believed that the earliest North Americans were people who arrived from Asia thousands of years ago and became the indigenous people we now call Native Americans. Historians theorize that Asians crossed a bridge of land or ice connecting present-day Russia and Alaska tens of thousands of years ago. They slowly migrated southward in search of more favorable climate. In the 16th and 17th centuries, people from England, Holland, France, and Spain were among the first Europeans to establish colonies. Long voyages across the Atlantic Ocean were made by people seeking economic opportunities, or they sought freedom from political or religious persecution in their homelands. The Spanish established colonies in Central America and what is now Mexico and the southwestern areas of the United States. The British concentrated on colonizing the east coastal regions, while French explorers, traders, and trappers settled in the midwest and areas around Canada. Today immigrants continue to arrive in North America from Asia and Africa. Immigration from European countries has slowed down dramatically with the exception of countries like Russia and Ukraine.

"Earth Day is celebrated every year on April 22. People from all over the world dedicate time and energy to increase an awareness that our planet Earth is in trouble. Problems are caused by overpopulation and the consumption of natural resources. But there are things we can do. We all need to conserve energy and resources daily; otherwise, future generations will suffer the consequences of the decisions we are making now. The first Earth Day was launched on April 22, 1970 because organizers believed we needed to restore the health of our ecosystem. At that time, many cities in the United States were affected by land, water, and air pollution. There were also concerns regarding nuclear power and toxic chemicals. Thanks to the leadership of concerned citizens, politicians, and some leaders in business, people have been made more aware of the problems that are caused by various forms of pollution. Now there are serious efforts to prevent individuals and large corporations from putting dangerous pollutants into the ecosystem. Laws have been passed by many countries around the world to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses which contribute to global warming. People who attend Earth Day events plant trees, clean up parks, and participate in rallies where speakers and musical guests promote lifestyles that are friendly to the environment. Organizers of these events want to educate the general public about the things that should and shouldnt be done to keep the planet clean.

"Are you concerned about climate change? This is a question asked by people around the world as weather conditions become more extreme and cause more damage to areas inhabited by people, plants, and animals. Is human activity the cause of climate change? If so, what effect will this have on the planet? If the climate is actually changing, is there anything that we can do about it? Scientists believe global warming is caused by human activity, and this leads to climate change. As fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and gas are burned to produce energy, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released into the atmosphere. These CO2 emissions have a direct impact on air temperature by absorbing and retaining more energy from the sun. This is also known as the ""Greenhouse Effect."" Scientists have detected a measurable increase in both CO2 emissions and in the average air temperatures around the world over the last 100 years. The relationship between the two is clear, but ignoring the effects of global warming could have devastating consequences.  Worldwide, increasing air temperatures have resulted in more precipitation in some areas while other areas have become drier. The severity of strong storms and high winds has increased. Ice that normally remains intact year round at the north pole is melting, creating more open water which absorbs more heat. Permafrost in Canada and Greenland is also showing signs of melting. All of these events indicate a warming planet. Meanwhile, climate change skeptics argue that a warming planet is not the result of human activity but due to other, natural causes. Some attribute a warming planet to increased solar activity; others admit that current weather conditions are noticeably different from normal patterns, but that this variability is due entirely to the natural rhythms of the planet. Some critics even go so far as to say that the scientists and the politicians who claim that climate change is a threat simply want to profit from efforts to curb it. Unfortunately, those most resistant to climate change theories live in the industrialized areas of the world that create the most pollution from greenhouse gases. While the science is debated, the prudent thing to do now is to develop alternatives to coal and gas consumption. Not only does this improve air quality, it also becomes a source for new jobs and clean industries that produce solar, wind, and geothermal energy. Additionally, the construction industry has seen a boom in recent years of new, dense housing located closer to places where people work. It has also been shown that corporations and consumers can save money by recycling, by reusing once-discarded materials, and by reducing waste. Actions taken to reduce a carbon footprint become a ""win"" for all who are involved. Ultimately, the truth of the situation will be revealed. Scientists acknowledge that the Earths climate naturally changes over long durations of time; however, careful measurements of air and soil samples show that human activity has greatly accelerated climactic changes in a short amount of time. The planet is now covered with cities, highways, machines, and human beings whose activities are directly impacting the environment. To say that the presence of nearly seven billion people does not have an impact on the Earths ecosystem is to live in denial of the facts and the evidence that prove the Earths climate is, indeed, changing.",B2,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Green_Level_Reading/7_Climate_Change.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/172202832&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false', 'title': '7.

The outage lasted until early this morning. When we first heard that the storm was coming, we turned on our TV. A meteorologist was giving a weather report on Channel 11. She said the storm was heading in our direction. She also said that high winds and possibly a tornado could cause damage to homes. We knew that we needed to prepare for the approaching storm.  We turned off and unplugged all of our computers, found some flashlights and candles, and then we waited. The sky turned a dark color. Suddenly there was hail. Then came the high winds and heavy rain as they were predicted. It was at that time we decided it would be a good idea to head down into the basement. The rain pounded our house for several minutes. It was very loud. We could hear water spilling out of the gutters and onto the patio in the backyard. Rain splattered against the basement window, and then the lights went off. The inside of the house was dark and silent, but outside the storm continued to rage. We lit some candles and turned on the flashlights. After the storm passed, we came out of the basement and looked outside. Even in the darkness, we could see there was a lot of damage. The wind blew over several trees on our street. We thought we were going to lose our old ash tree in the front yard, but luckily it survived. Without a television to watch or a computer to use, we found a Scrabble board and played for a couple of hours until it was time to go to bed. By early this morning, our power was restored. Repair crews were dispatched throughout the night to repair power lines that were damaged by the storm. As I drove to work, I could see downed trees and branches everywhere. We learned that a tornado had, indeed, passed through our town. A few houses in Minneapolis were destroyed by high winds or by the trees that had fallen on them. Fortunately, no one was hurt.",B2,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Green_Level_Reading/8_We_lost_our_power.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/145313389&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true', 'title': '8.

"Our class visited a community college. The trip was arranged so that my students could get some sense of what an American college looks like on the inside. None of the students that I teach had ever visited a community college before. Theyre all from different countries, and some of them have been in the United States for a very short time.  Whenever we take a field trip, the school district provides transportation. Usually its a school bus. If you ever see a big yellow school bus full of students in the middle of the day, it often means they are on a field trip. A field trip is an important part of the educational experiences offered by the schools. Upon arriving at the college, everyone was given a folder full of information about the cost of tuition and the programs that are available. Then we were lead through the school by an admissions counselor. She understood the kind of questions that my students asked because she herself immigrated to the United States from Argentina many years ago. Her name was Angelica. She was a very kind and patient tour guide. Angelica told us that a community college is cheaper than a four-year college. Many students who attend a community college are interested in getting a two-year associates degree, or they intend on transferring to a four-year school. A community college costs less than a regular college or university. Students save money on tuition, and they save on housing because they can commute from home. We looked in the classrooms. Some of the classrooms had students in them. We walked through the labs, and we were given a quick tour of the library. We were shown the cafeteria and the common areas where students meet and study. The school is very big. Over 3000 students attend classes in the college every day. Unfortunately, most of my students will probably never have the chance to go to college. Either they dont have the time, they dont have the money, or they dont really have an interest in attending college–which is okay. However, most of my students are raising children here in the United States. Hopefully, a visit to a college will inspire them to think about educational opportunities for their children.",B2,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Green_Level_Reading/9_Our_class_visited_a_college.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/179557082&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false', 'title': '9.

"Alice was taken to the hospital last weekend. She had recently been complaining of chest pains, and then suddenly on Saturday night she felt a sharp pain in her left shoulder. She also felt a little dizzy, so she called the hospital and they immediately sent over an ambulance to pick her up. When she arrived at the hospital, she entered through the emergency entrance. She was taken to the coronary care unit. She was examined by a doctor and several tests were conducted. It was determined that she did, indeed, have a mild heart attack. Nurses and doctors monitored her condition over a 24-hour period. She appeared to be okay, but shes only 57 and there are several things that shes going to have to do to take care of herself. First, she was told that she would have to cut back on eating red meat. Alice loves bacon, sausage, and especially hamburgers. In fact, she eats hamburgers almost every day because theyre cheap and delicious. But all of that red meat is contributing to her poor health.  A nutritionist told her to consider eating other forms of meat such as chicken or fish. She also needs to eat more fruit and vegetables. Because Alice is fifty pounds overweight, losing some or all of that weight through a proper diet should improve her overall health. Second, Alice was advised to start exercising more. She rarely exercises at all. At the very least, she should get 30 to 40 minutes of light exercise every day. Walking, biking, or swimming are good ways for a person in her condtion to get the recommended amount of daily exercise. Alice is now back at home and resting for a few days before she returns to work. Shes being monitored by health care professionals, and shes on special medication to help reduce her blood pressure and her cholesterol levels. But the most important thing she can do is learn how to take care of herself.",B2,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Green_Level_Reading/10_Alice_was_taken_to_the_hopital.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/233648262&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false', 'title': '10.

"Why are so many people wearing green today? The reason is because its St. Patricks Day. On this day, the rich cultural heritage of Ireland is celebrated. In the United States, millions of people can trace their ancestry to that country. Irish people wear green on St. Patricks Day to show that they have some sort of connection to Ireland. Many people go to parades on St. Patricks Day. Politicians, business people, and celebrities appear in the parade. In big cities like Chicago, New York, and Boston there are a lot of Irish people, so the day feels like a holiday. Some people take the day off in order to attend the parades. As an ethnic group, the Irish want to show how far theyve come in American society and celebrate their contributions. Its worth noting that the Irish were once highly discriminated against when they first stated immigrating to the United States. Starting in the 1840s, Irish people came to the United States in very large numbers to escape a widespread famine. But when they arrived, they found that some of the people here didnt like them. Americans didnt like the fact that the Irish were Catholic, or that their customs were different from traditional American customs. In contrast to people of British, French, or German descent, Irish people stood out in a crowd because of their red hair and pale skin. Names such as ODonnel and McCarthy revealed their heritage. It was very hard to hide the fact that they were Irish. Irish immigrants could only find the most difficult, dirty jobs that Americans didnt want to do.  Does all of this sound familiar to you? Nowadays, Irish people proudly proclaim who they are and where they came from. The days of discrimination against them are long over, but its important to remember what happened to them in the past. As other new groups of immigrants arrive on our shores from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, we find that the ugliness of prejudice and hate is still a problem to reckon with in the United States.",B2,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Green_Level_Reading/11_St_Patricks_Day.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://www.speakpipe.com/widget/inline/5ryg9bazycl85vel4wp05tr5k4wp056c', 'title': '11.

"While walking home from work one day last month, Oscar noticed a small paper bag placed neatly against the rear tire of an old truck that was parked in the street. As he got closer to the truck, he could see what looked like dollar bills poking through the side of the bag. ""Money,"" Oscar said softly to himself. He bent down to get a closer look, and sure enough, it was definitely money. He quickly looked up and down the street to see if anyone was nearby Then he looked inside. ""Holy moly! Its a bag full of money."" Oscars pulse suddenly started to race. He could feel his heart beating in his chest. Clearly, the money belonged to someone, but to whom? Putting his conscience on hold, and believing that he hadnt been spotted by anyone, Oscar stuffed the paper bag into his backpack. As he hurried back to his apartment, his mind was flooded with questions. Where did the money come from? Why was it underneath that car? Was anyone following him? Every so often, Oscar checked to see if he was being followed. He darted in an out of buildings, entering through one door and then leaving from another. He stopped at a coffee shop and sat in an empty booth for a few minutes, pretending to look for something on his phone. He felt confident that no one had seen him pick up the cash. When Oscar arrived at his apartment, he checked to see if his roommate was there. His roommate, Aaron, was at work, so Oscar knew he would have time to see how much money was in the bag, and perhaps, there woud be some clue as to where the money was from or who it belonged to. Before dumping the money onto a small kitchen table, Oscar remembered something he had seen once on TV. He put on a pair of gloves to avoid getting his fingerprints on any of the bills. ""Just in case,"" he said to himself. There were six bundled stacks of $100 bills, unopened and recently printed as indicated by the series dates just to the right of Benjamin Franklins face. Oscar knew that a stack of hundreds contained exactly 100 bills, so each stack was worth $10,000. That was $60,000 altogether laying on his kitchen table. Sixty thousand dollars would take care of a lot of problems, but this money could create some new problems, too. Oscar needed to decide what to do. What did Oscar do? This story is to be continued.",B2,https://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Reading/Green_Level_Reading/12_Katies_feelings.html,learnamericanenglishonline,"{'audio_link': 'https://www.speakpipe.com/widget/inline/5ryg9bazycl85vel4wp05tr5k4wp056c', 'title': '13.
