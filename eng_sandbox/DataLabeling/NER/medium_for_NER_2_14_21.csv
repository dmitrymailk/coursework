You're Experiencing Future Shock - It's Why You Can't Think Straight,"I used to look forward to the future.Now it paralyzes me.To deal with this, I slip on an Oculus headset my husband got last Christmas and sit there in the home screen environment, a warm cabin in the mountains under the northern lights. I don't play any games. Instead I pretend this is where I live, away from everything, in nature. I wonder when I'll be able to get to the real mountains again.After a while, my brain tells me screw the real mountains. These fake mountains are prettier. I want to stay here forever, in the fake mountains under a luminous green sky.This is future shock, a term coined by Alvin Toffler all the way back in 1970, in a book by the same name. It refers to the social and emotional paralysis we all feel, brought on by ""shattering stress and disorientation"" at the magnitude and velocity of changes we're going through.I find it highly appropriate.If we're honest, the future is looking darker these days - but there's a lot of artificial light to distract us from that.On the one hand, climate change might destroy the planet. We're living through a sixth mass extinction. On the other hand, a robot can give you a lap dance now. Cars can drive themselves. Gold has gone digital. We're a few years away from being able to live on other planets. Most recently, you get to work from home now.We're constantly torn about the future.Things are getting a lot worse and a lot better at the same time. We don't know whether to trust the artificial light or not. It seems to be causing a lot of the problems it promises to solve.Lately it feels like the only way to get through an entire day is not thinking about the future too much, especially in the long term. And yet, we also know we can't hide from the future. It's coming, whether we like it or not. We have to prepare somehow, so it doesn't catch us by surprise.We feel chronically unprepared.We used to worry about being replaced by someone younger and better educated than us, maybe better looking. That time is long gone. Now we're competing against algorithms and lines of code.One day, some of us will report to an artificial intelligence that knows our heart rate and credit history.People are already losing jobs and healthcare to pieces of software. The only way to stay employed is to become more like a robot, or a superhuman. You have to become evermore productive. Or you have to figure out what robots can't do (yet), and learn how to do it better. You have to be a creative genius, just to keep your head above water.Anyone under 50 feels a growing sense of overwhelm at the sheer number of skills we're expected to master today. We live with daily stress and unrest over which industries are going to transform us out of a career in five years, and force us to completely reinvent ourselves.Job security is going extinct.This fear of becoming obsolete is putting us on edge. Being replaceable or expendable means poverty and death. We're willing to do anything to keep up now. We'll pay more and more money for courses that promise to keep us relevant, so we can earn our livelihoods. We'll buy tons of e-books. We'll sign up for websites that teach us how to code.We update ourselves to survive.Thanks to the r/wallstreetbets movement, we all know what it means to short a stock now. You sell an asset at a high price because you think it's going to drop later. This move resonates with us because that's what we've been doing for the entire last year. We've been shorting the future.We used to daydream. Now we anticipate the problems we'll have to deal with, and how we can avoid getting trapped by them.We wonder which cities will be underwater in 15 years. We wonder which safety nets will collapse first, and where we can put our money to keep it safe when they inevitably do.We hedge our hopes.Giant corporations and billionaires are doing the same thing. They seem to understand that the end could be on the way. So instead of trying to save everyone, they're surging their pollution to maximize profits, so they'll be better off when everything goes to hell.We're all trying to eyeball that moment in the next decade or so when things start to get really bad, and when we might have to bail on society altogether. We anticipate a time when we'll have to protect only ourselves and those closest to us. If you have a conscience, it eats at you. It's painful and disorienting to only sort of believe in the future.It freezes your brain.A lot of us are entranced by old things now. We're binge-watching period romances, or just watching our old favorite movies on repeat. We love the past because it doesn't change.That lack of change provides deep comfort. It's relaxing to watch a movie where you already know what's going to happen.This is exactly why I can't finish Tenet, a film I'd been looking forward to before the pandemic. There's something deeply unsettling about a movie where the future is trying to kill you, and the only way to survive is to learn how to think backward and forward at the same time.The metaphor is too good.It's stupefying.The most troubling part of the future now is that it's forcing us to think in completely new ways. We're having to face hyper-objects, facts that escape our ability to deal with them through ordinary logic.Climate change would be an example. So would the economic shifts we're seeing now. It's hard to think about the consequences of entire cities going underwater in our lifetimes, or never retiring.And yet, we have to.We have no choice but to deal with the future. It's already here, washing into every crevice of our lives. We use technology to escape the stress caused by technology. We create new tech to solve the problems of old tech, which cause new problems. Every year the cycle speeds up, like a merciless Peloton coach. We have to pedal faster and faster.This doesn't leave you a lot of time to think things though.We feel the need to act now. Because if we wait a few minutes, the price on the stock or that cryptocurrency will go up.We'll miss out.We're living in an age where the richest man in the world can send an asset soaring with a single tweet, in just a few minutes. It's not the kind of environment that encourages deliberation. That's why people are acting so illogical now. There's huge amounts of displaced anger and anxiety. We're all rushing toward the latest thing to offer a slight advantage in this unpredictable landscape, full of artificial light.It's maddening, in the true sense.It's driving us nuts.Alvin Toffler recommends a handful of practices and attitudes to handle our future shock, and they're surprisingly on point for a book that was published more than fifty years ago. Here they are:Direct copingZones of stabilitySituational groupingHalfway houses and enclaves of the pastGlobal space pageantsStrategies of futureness.The larger point here is that you don't have to abandon the past. You just have to stop letting the future paralyze you. There's a lot about the future that concerns someone like me, including the recent craze over meme stocks and cryptocurrencies going main stream.But I'm altering my stance every week. I'm inching toward investing in some cryptocurrencies, even though I'm skeptical of the hype. I'm figuring out what new skills to learn so I can stay employed. I'm acknowledging that things will change, and that they always have been.You can't stop change. You can just get better at letting it rush over you and through you, like a cold stream.For the last year, I've found myself wishing for a time machine. I've been fantasizing about the past more than daydreaming about the future. It would be nice to just flip a switch and travel back ten years.Part of me would stay there.The past provides comfort and safety. It was a world where climate change and economic uprooting were only threats on the horizon, something you could spend a few minutes feeling concerned about before getting back to your day, something that didn't assault you every day. Back then, things like democracy and job security were sure bets.Wrapping yourself up in the past offers a temporary reprieve from the constant onslaught of the future, but it can never do anything more than that. A little bit can give you some peace of mind. Too much tricks you into thinking you can pretend to live there.You can't.You have to step into the future.Living in the future means letting go of some antiquated worldviews. It means unyoking yourself from old schools of thought. It means listening to our intuition and instincts as much as your logic. It could mean reaching even further back into history for ideas we'd forgotten about.It means letting go of the need for security. That need is what's causing our paralysis. We're trying not to change.This future isn't the one we wanted. It's cold and unsettling. It gives us chills. But we made the future. We're making it right now, minute by minute, for ourselves and for everyone else.Don't let the future shock you.Absorb it.",,https://medium.com/curious/youre-experiencing-future-shock-it-s-why-you-can-t-think-straight-2df30aaecba9,mental-health,0a7b5bd25a20b1f341d9db876e76ca55d99ebf753ee6c0140cd4d022
"Our Over-Quest for Optimization, and the Eternal Flattening of the to-do List","Picked my friend up at the airport yesterday. On the way there, I listened to this April 2019 podcast from Ezra Klein about how ""work is identity, and burnout is lifestyle."" The two guests are Anne Helen Petersen, who wrote a BuzzFeed article about millennials becoming the burnout generation - and Derek Thompson, who wrote the ""workism"" article in The Atlantic.Fun fact on that ""workism"" article: I was working at an agency at the time, one of those ""Everyone is so slammed!"" places, and one dude - Vadim, who was on my podcast - sent that article around. No one seemed to ""get"" it. It was a Slack conversation that died almost instantly. Ha.Anyway, the podcast linked above (not mine, the more popular one) has a lot of interesting points, especially if you can't really detach yourself from work - which wouldn't make you that unique, since we broadly deify the workaholic. Let's tackle two points quickly.Years ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I started using Trello because one contract I was on used it a lot. I liked it. So I started using it for work and personal. Eventually, my then-wife tagged onto my board, and we were doing work + work (each of us) + personal + home. Trello was like the base of everything. There was no line between work and home, personal and non-personal. (I guess everything is ""personal,"" so that's a stupid sentence.)Anyway, it became a never-ending to-do list. The to-do list was now flat. It just keeps going to the horizon line, then there's a new horizon line. It doesn't end, you see?Very few people in human history like sitting down and listing out all the shit they have to do in a day or week. You do it because (a) it helps you organize and (b) when you check off an item, you will get an endorphin hit. Now, we know from research that roughly 11% of people can even accomplish a full to-do list, so it's not really about being efficient. It's about feeling accomplished when you do the strike-through.But when the to-do list becomes flat and never-ending, that sense of accomplishment wanes. Because if you get to Friday and you've killed it at your M-F work job, awesome. Well, now it's Saturday and there's a new list. At some point, crossing stuff out over and over loses value. It's like what happened to the social media ""like."" How valuable is that anymore? It's almost meaningless, I'd argue.The joy disappears when the list flattens. You know?We took a bath in this shit because we all over-worship Silicon Valley and their ""growth hacks.""Here's the example Petersen gives on that podcast: let's say you need to take your shoes in to be fixed (""cobbled""). The modern mindset is, ""Well, I need to do this in an optimized way. I need to hack it. Is there a shoe app? Is there something disruptive?""It's like - listen Ashleigh, maybe just grab your shoes, grab your phone, grab some Air Pods, put on an informative podcast, and go walk to the cobbler and think about the issues being discussed in your ears. It might take 35 minutes as opposed to 2 minutes, but it's OK. Thinking and walking around and contextualizing things ... those are OK. It's very human to do that. Not everything has to be ""optimized"" or ""hacked.""That leads to a discussion about the grand promise of capitalism. Capitalism itself is a good system (yay) but the end promise of it is a complete lie. The idea at some point was, well, if we keep getting more efficient and productive, eventually we'll have all this leisure time on the back-end and all become Da Vinci or whatever. Almost the complete opposite has happened. As we've ""growth hacked"" everything, most of us work more, burn out more, and are more stressed. It's the inverse relationship of the grand promise.I have a friend who used to live in Texas; her and her husband run a little marketing agency type deal. Everything has to be optimized. Every second of every transaction and interaction. Now, in one way, that's awesome and hopefully it leads to some significant financial success for them - something I have lacked for much of the past year. But at another level, you know what I did Sunday? Read some stuff, watched a bunch of TV shows, and researched some true crime cases. Does that make me a worthless sack of shit that I wasn't ""growth hacking"" my Sunday? Sure, maybe. But it also makes me a person ready to come out and try to hit some targets on a Monday.It's OK to not optimize every single thing. There's not really always an app for that. Sometimes you can just stroll along a riverfront and contemplate the universe. It doesn't mean you won't ever be Elon Musk. Well, it probably does, but eh. You know what I mean.It really can't be, because work is transactional in most contexts. There is no reciprocity. You can be piped at any second; you can also choose to leave at any second. It's a part of what you do and where you go and how you spend time and what you spend energy and thought on, yes. Is it your entire identity? It shouldn't be. That's very dangerous.Thompson says this on the same podcast: religion, at least, there's kind of a ""no-failure"" clause to that belief. God is not coming down and laying you off because of a bad quarter. I'm not saying religion is perfect by any means. But if you want to wrap yourself in a belief that will give you a little more stability and hope, religion is probably a better choice than, say, work. God has an explanation and a place for Ted Bundy. Now ironically, Ted Bundy at a corporation would probably become a SVP ... and maybe that's a topic for a different post ... but the point is, work punches you in the mouth all the time. God embraces both good and bad.Now, let me get off this soapbox for a second and let's go back to the bigger discussion: how do you feel about to-do lists and the over-focus on optimization?",https://miro.medium.com/max/3072/1*BIe00qRjKWx6PBuW8eHaRA.jpeg,https://medium.com/curious/our-over-quest-for-optimization-and-the-eternal-flattening-of-the-to-do-list-5c3648912d88,productivity,0a7b0357ee4351631884ac3ad2633727e9376ab52462eb6953c2cc29
The Impatient Person's Guide To Creating Memories That Last,"Tell me if this rings a bell: You find a new television series and get hooked. The next episode is all you can think about, and you binge-watch it within a matter of days. Then, there's a gaping hole in your life. All of the excitement has vanished, and your memories of all the episodes blur into one.I've been there. In a rush to experience things, whether it be holidays or TV shows, you can sometimes forget to make sure the memories last. You didn't foresee the period after, and why would you? All you could think about was how excited you were before.This article is for all of the impatient people out there. The ones who sprint from event to event, tearing through time and inadvertently allowing memories to dissipate as fast as they were made.For the first 20 years of my life, I had never held a baby. So, when my housemate's newborn nephew visited us, I was apprehensive. I'm 6'3"" and having never held a baby before, his size completely baffled me (it still does). I held him, and immediately my heart flustered. I looked at his feet and wondered, ""How can someone so tiny grow into someone like me? How was I ever that small?"" I was constantly scared I would drop him. It scared me to death.That's what made it so unforgettable.I have more enjoyable memories from that year at university, but that one is one of the clearest. Fear is one of the strongest emotions there is, so while it may put you off, you'll certainly remember it for years after.Usually, I jump into an event head first in a quest to satisfy my impatient side. However, the fear I felt made me contemplate whether or not to hold the baby, and even as I held him, I was so afraid of dropping him, the moment felt like slow motion. Actively thinking about doing something might cause the memory to settle in before making it- giving it some legs to stand on in the future.There are two benefits to mastering the art of controlled-anticipation:Research published in the journal of Applied Research in Quality of Life has shown that the feeling of anticipation can exceed the happiness of the event itself.Untempered anticipation can lead to hasty consumption. Research from the University of Melbourne found that binge-watchers remembered less about TV shows they watched a few months later compared to people who watched one weekly episode of a series. Yet, a Morning Consultant/Hollywood Reporter poll reported that 60% of adults said they binge-watch television at least once a week.For the most impatient people, anticipation is a race. The next episode or holiday is all you can think about, so you binge whatever possible. To temper over-excitable anticipation, I've deployed a few tricks. Copy them if you like:By tempering anticipation, the memories themselves become the prominent force in your mind. Try not to let anticipation control you.The ""forgetting curve"" states that if you don't take action within a week of obtaining new information, you will forget 90% of it. As an impatient person, you may swiftly forget one memory as your mind races towards creating a new one. However, a memory that lasts needs more attention. So, here's a three-step process to creating memories that last.Once you've done all of this, you can always refer to your notes in the future. By dumping some out on paper or out loud, you're giving yourself a better chance of remembering it further down the line.Patience is useful in all walks of life. In terms of making memories, it can prevent you from wiping them away as soon as you've made them. They're the semantics that makes our lives exciting and the things you hold on to in your quietest moments.Memories deserve to last a lifetime. To ensure that's the case, consider doing those things:As an impatient person myself, I'm still battling my mind's need to chase the next memory. But what good are they if we can't remember them correctly?",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*VEgDJTstleD0R5aW5zQP1w.jpeg,https://max-phillips.medium.com/the-impatient-persons-guide-to-creating-memories-that-last-e309632c0766,mindfulness,0a551c4ea099c1aa52ec4474c4057f738510a1db1e076e9b75377078
She Had a Money Room,"Have you ever met anyone with a money room? I have. It seemed like a metaphor at first, but it wasn't. She grew up in a part of the world where people don't trust banks. There was a room in her mansion that had floor to ceiling money.""As a child, I always had trouble making friends,"" she told me. ""We were the only ones in the town with money."" Her father would bring her gifts that only famous people's children had, to appease her loneliness.""From a very early age,"" she said. ""I bought my friends presents. Very expensive presents, but I was never a close part of the group. I knew I was an outsider.""I was her friend, but as an adult. She bought me a Hermes scarf, expensive meals, fancy pens, and overpaid me for editing her work. English was not her first language. I took that insane amount of money for editing because I'm a gig worker. Who am I to turn down money? Especially when there's a room full of it somewhere.Her husband told her that she shouldn't hire me. He said she ruined all her relationships and when she ruined ours, she would lose a friend and an editor. When she told me that story, I knew that our relationship was on its way to being old milk. An expiration date loomed.Because I knew our friendship would end, I savored our time together, like she was a foreign exchange student who I only had for a semester. I wondered, as we shared meals in five-star restaurants and tried on expensive clothing, what would be the straw the broke the camel's back. I watched her watch me. I wondered what crack she would discover in my veneer. She spoke brutally about other people. She trashed people's marriages, their fashion, their writing, their itty bitty wealth. She had very little patience for what she perceived as imperfection. She was hawkeyes for human slip-ups, like a detective digging up cold cases, but her friends were in the lineup. I knew my quirkiness and enthusiasm would buy me some time, but eventually, she would see through me.Whenever we were out together, the feeling never escaped me that she was trying to catch me in a lie. I am a fabricator more than a liar. When I was a teenager, I lied, but as an adult, I'm pretty married to the truth. Lies are lazy to me, cowardly. If I'm thinking of lying, I realize there's a fear that I haven't faced.She offered me a place to stay in Indonesia. ""Whenever you want,"" she said. ""I will pay for your ticket. Business-class. I will buy your food. You will stay in my villa."" Anytime, she said, like Indonesia was an uber drive away.In real life, outside of her rocky relationships, she was famous for identifying bodies after plane crashes. The scientists and recovery people had a nickname for her, but I will not tell it. It's too easy to look up. She was who they brought it in when the bodies were long past identification. She possessed multiple specialties. She was a dentist, so she was an expert on dental identification. She was a chemist, so she knew how the body changed through chemical reactions created by temperatures. I wondered how you could do this for a living and also sit across from someone and share a plate of mussels. Her job was to scrutinize every flaw in the body in order to identify it for family members. That's not something you can just turn off. I wondered what a living person looked like to her.""Like a skeleton,"" she said.I think our relationship started to sour after the Hermes scarf. They stopped making that design and I could sense she wanted it back. I thought about it. I really did. But I also knew, that even if I returned the scarf, something else would end us. So, I kept the scarf.It turns out that when you have a money room, it's very hard to make friends. I think the problem arises when you think people only love you for your money and so you drown your friends in it. But she could never figure out what her money was buying her. She was paying for something, but she didn't know what.I miss the woman with the money room. I think about her and her sweet open childlike face and her indiscriminate generosity. Everything she wore was so soft, as if imperfect fabric would scratch her surface. I could have been friends with her forever. With or without the Hermes scarf.",https://miro.medium.com/max/11938/1*zGH4O_Ycf5i84cSzYpAk_w.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/she-had-a-money-room-1f7067cb4eed,fiction,0ad72b945484e1311c7be0ae81b5355f7e7bb18f5ec9c07d9d84a19e

Why unmoderated remote usability testing is an addition to - not a replacement for - your moderated user research practice,"I often hear a note of skepticism when I speak to researchers about remote, unmoderated research tools. ""Face to face research is essential for us. It's the heart of human-centered design!"" they might say. I was once like this - passionate about research and a little defensive about doing anything other than than the gold standard.Maybe you'd be defensive too, if, like many researchers and designers, you were worried about your work being diminished, de-scoped or de-funded. In particular, any suggestion to cut research back can trigger a knee-jerk response. It's often a result of many years of struggling to make research heard or valued in their company.But I'm here to make the case that unmoderated remote research tools aren't just research-lite, or research for those who don't have that buy-in. These tools have some huge advantages, especially when used in addition to moderated, in-person or other higher-investment research tools like depth interviews - but not necessarily as a replacement for those tools.So rather than trying to convince you to switch from your in-person chats to something like UsabilityHub, I'd ask you - why not both?As the saying goes, ""If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.""Just like your team, your research toolkit should be diverse. Different research tools allow you to investigate, test and measure with varying levels of specificity and precision.It's certainly true that in-person interviews are a rich and rewarding experience, allowing you to really see the participant as a full human being and empathize with them. But constantly forcing the team to prioritize and run depth interview studies can be time consuming, costly and - dare I say it - sometimes inappropriate. Eventually, trust in the research process can be eroded by insistence on using the heaviest methodology available at all times - especially for teams who are early on their research maturity development journey.UX designers new to research will inevitably be excited to get some face-time with users - but like all disciplines, the senior practitioner knows how to use a variety of tools. A good MVP research toolkit might consist of:Knowing how to design and run various types of studies using different methodologies is a critical part of building an efficient and effective research practice.So, assuming you know how to use all the tools in your toolkit - how do you know when to use which one?A good first lens is checking what part of the double diamond you're in. The UK Design Council's well-known double diamond is a helpful, high level illustration of the two big stages that we call ""the problem space"" and ""the solution space""In the problem space, you're still learning about what customers or users are struggling with and where their pain points are. This is where you deploy your depth interviews, card sorts, surveys and other types of exploratory/generative research. You may dip into the world of usability studies if you're benchmarking a user experience that is part of the pain point.In the solution space, you're testing the ideas you've formulated that you believe will help solve these customer problems. This is where you deploy evaluative research - usability tests, pulse surveys, tree tests and other responses to designed artifacts.The second lens that we use is around idea fidelity. I'm referring to how detailed and certain your idea is - is this a napkin sketch or a detailed hi-fi prototype? Is it a hypothesis or a pretty sure-thing, business-model-backed opportunity?For lower fidelity ideas, it's more appropriate to go deeper and broader, and as the ideas progress to higher fidelity solutions, you can be more laser-focused and specific. In particular, we use remote unmoderated usability testing in later, higher-fidelity iterations of a design, where we have discovered and validated the broader user problems and are now focusing on the finer details of the solution.The third lens we use to decide on which research tool is appropriate is a lens of risk. Sometimes, for example, it might not be necessary to spend a lot of time exploring customer problems if the possible solutions are obvious and - crucially - low effort.For example, in the case of a bug fix, where the problem is clear and the solution is clear, it's not necessary to run depth interviews with users. If your gut tells you that you need to still check something about the proposed solution, spend some time refining the exact risk you're worried about, and then run something lightweight where you can get results quickly.As much as we would love to eradicate all assumptions as we develop our ideas as designers and researchers, we can never entirely eliminate risk. In fact, the need to proceed only with perfect information can hold teams back when a lean build-measure-learn loop might be more appropriate.Often towards the end of the solution development process when we start thinking about launching our work to production, we may notice some new assumptions have crept in over the course of design and implementation iterations. As new people are involved with the project, new ideas and interpretations of various decision are woven in.Rather than forcing all of the creation of the solution to be policed by the design and research team, we prefer to allow input from various team members but make sure than any parts of the solution that have gathered their own assumptions are tested before we launch, especially if there is risk that of the design hypothesis is wrong, the efficacy of the solution might be diminished.For example, if part of the implementation means that we can't use the same layout as was tested in earlier iterations, we'll throw together a quick remote unmoderated usability test on UsabilityHub based on screenshots from the local development environment to double check that our target users can still achieve their goals. It's much easier and a lot better for the cross-functional team dynamic than being dogmatic - but it doesn't replace the earlier research done to develop the solution in the first place.Short feedback loops are critical in enabling teams to integrate research into their workflow smoothly. Not all research feedback loops are short - some longitudinal studies might take weeks or months to gather data, and that's even before synthesis has begun.As we go along the process from problem space to solution space, our feedback loops get shorter and our iterations faster. Usually in the early stages, we will be spending more time in conversation, going deep on data and thinking carefully about the implications of the work. But as we enter the solution space, those feedback loops speed up in order to allow us to test multiple ideas and learn faster.Toward the very tail-end of the process, we sometimes run our research rounds so quickly that the results are instantly integrated into the design iteration by a developer. At this point, it might even make sense for the developer to be involved in the research to get them the insights as soon as possible!We love using remote unmoderated research at this stage and really forcing ourselves to run short, sharp tests (rather than long, in depth ones) in order to stay laser focused as we push to the finish line. Earlier on in the process, it's unlikely we'll be running at that same pace, and other methodologies and tools are more appropriate.One huge reason why we have started using unmoderated remote research more is that it helps us diversify our participant pool.After emailing our beta tester list to be involved in some remote moderated tests, we noticed that the response rate was smaller than we expected. Rather than assuming, we sent a super quick survey to ask why they couldn't participate, selecting from the following options:We found that the majority of our participants simply couldn't find crossover in their calendar and ours as we are based in Australia. By shifting to unmoderated sessions, we were instantly able to test with more customers as they could complete the session on their own, in their own time.For us, this is important as our customers are spread all across the globe, but in general, being able to test outside of your local area is a huge win for research, especially when your users are not necessarily your neighbours.Another big advantage is that because we don't have to moderate every session, sessions can be done concurrently, allowing us to massively decrease the time from hypothesis to insights. Using the UsabilityHub panel allows us, for example, to turn around results from 50 participants in less half an hour - something that could take us close to 50 hours if we had to be part of every session.Obviously this would be less helpful for a conversation, and in that situation, a remote moderated approach is preferable. But where it's possible, we find remote unmoderated to be convenient for us AND for our participants, so it's a win-win.Hopefully I've convinced you that remote unmoderated research isn't just a poor imitation of in-person, moderated research, but instead a complementary tool that you can deploy in addition to your existing research practice.Sometimes you need to go deep, spend time, expand your feedback loop and invest in mitigating as many risks as you can, but sometimes speedy, lightweight and simple research is more appropriate.If you're looking to build a more complete research toolkit, head to UsabilityHub and start testing today.",https://miro.medium.com/max/936/0*fwtNF5zH132nsJ73.gif,https://io.usabilityhub.com/why-unmoderated-remote-usability-testing-is-an-addition-to-not-a-replacement-for-your-e1cb05b8964a,ux,0bb9ef9da39d5e8849f2ef365f287c1d1b11fa0c390bc62296dd2d2f
Dungy's Rule: Why You Should Shift - Not Quit - Bad Habits,"Have you ever gotten stuck in a poor routine, like ordering pizza every Wednesday, then tried to stop? Not easy, is it? Once you repeat a behavior a few times, it can quickly become a habit.Why? Because our brain loves to create habits. A habit requires less thinking, which means it needs less energy, and our brains love that. Studies show that habits - actions performed without conscious thought - make up 43% of our daily actions.If so many of our daily actions are habits, why aren't they easier to change? Because research shows that when we form habits, it literally rewires our brain. If neurons, the information messengers of the brain, fire at the start and end of a behavior, it quickly becomes a habit.That's why it's so hard to break a bad habit - we're not just fighting our cravings or desires. We're fighting our ingrained neurological patterns. That's why some experts say that it's easier to replace a bad habit than to quit one.To replace bad behaviors with better ones, we need to understand the underlying mechanics of habits. In the 1990s, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) decoded the structure of habits.They created the so-called ""Habit Loop"" that describes the neurological patterns that drive routines. There are three phases to the Habit Loop:In his book The Power of Habit, author Charles Duhigg describes how Tony Dungy, an NFL Hall of Fame football coach, helped players overcome ineffective habits by replacing, not quitting, them.When Tony Dungy became the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' head coach in 1996, it was clear he had a lot of work to do. Between injuries and a lack of key talent, the team needed to change. But unlike most new bosses, who often throw out old playbooks in favor of totally new behaviors, Dungy had a different strategy.Tony Dungy's strategy was to shift the Buccaneers' habit loops, not quit old behaviors for new ones. The team would use their existing behavior triggers, replace the routine with a new one, and practice the new routines until they became habits. Dungy's goal was to take thinking out of the game, because in his words:For example, a behavior cue for Player A might be to watch Player B to see if they were running left or right. If that Player B was running left, Player A then had to choose from one of five possible actions depending on what else was happening on the field. But what Dungy told his Player A was to watch Player B, and if they ran left, Player A only had to do one action in response.Another coach would've asked Player A to stop watching for Player B and look for a completely different cue. But Dungy knew that relearning habit cues was incredibly difficult, and a better strategy would be to shift the player's routine in response to the same trigger.Dungy's Rule, also known as the Golden Rule of Behavior Change, is the same strategy that makes it easier for someone to shift from eating a donut every day at 10 am to eating an apple instead.It took some time for these new habits to take hold, but in 1999 the Buccaneers won the division championship.Let's say, for example, you want to stop chewing nicotine gum (my vice). The three-step process below will help you identify your habit, its trigger, and a replacement routine.If you want to get started with replacing bad habits, what psychologists call ""awareness training"" could help. This is the process of identifying a habit trigger, after which you can choose to perform your replacement habit. Every time you feel the urge to perform the habit, write down what's happening around you and how you feel. After you perform the exercise a few times, you should be able to identify what's triggering your behavior.Sometimes, behavior is driven by a combination of addiction and habit. My addiction to nicotine gum was driven by the hit of nicotine the gum provided. But the habit of popping in a piece of nicotine gum was driven by specific cues.For me, there were two clear habit cues. The time of day - I'd use a piece in the afternoons to get a mental pick-me-up - and my mood. I'd use nicotine gum when my mental energy was flagging at work to give my brain a boost.In this case, I replaced nicotine gum with regular chewing gum. This simple behavior shift was a new routine triggered by the same habit cues. I was getting some reward for replacing my behavior (a minty taste from the gum that woke me up), without the bad side of the behavior (addictive nicotine).If you're looking for ways to shift your behavior, some alternatives for common habits could include:The key to replacing any bad behavior with a better one is ease. If your replacement habit is harder to perform, you're less likely to do it.For example, when I was quitting nicotine gum, I kept several packs of chewing gum on me at all times. That way, I didn't have to hunt for chewing gum when my habit cues appeared. And I didn't have to go to the store and buy more gum, where I'd inevitably buy nicotine gum instead.Behavior change is hard - there are no silver bullets. Building better habits is mostly down to doing hard things over and over, until they're not so hard anymore.That's why shifting your behavior, like Tony Dungy asked his players to do, can be more successful than forcing yourself to quit a habit. And improving our habits - actions performed without conscious thought - can lead to success, on or off a football field.

The Next Simulation,"Whether we want to believe it or not, we live in a simulation of perception.We appear as holograms.These holograms represent the 3D world we perceive as ""reality"".One might consider that we are 4D, 5D, 6D or 7D beings experiencing a 3D reality. Spirits inhabiting holographic bodies, and interacting with other holographic forms, in order to experience the dualities of the perceived physical world.Light, energy, sound and magnetism comprise the unseen waves that comprise us and connect us. What this author describes as the Internet of Waves. There is very real science behind this.As explored in this author's last piece, this science can be applied to web objects that represent the physical world in its true forms.Some believe we are conscious beings seeking higher or lower realms, what is considered ""ascension"" or ""descension"". That all of it is connected to a Source, or something greater than ourselves that represents everything that is.The difference between now and next is in whether we want to see this reality for what it really is and what it really can be, or, if we want to see this reality for what it really isn't or can be.And, that we are also the sources of whatever realities we create, and choose to see or experience.As such, a core question set arises out of intuition and inference: What is real, and what is really possible in making our realities ""better"" than they are right now?The first step in developing a new simulation of physical realities is to acknowledge that elements like plants are objects we can observe in their natural forms. These can be translated into representational web objects.For example, plants can be observed in their natural states, and their geometries can be mapped out.Taking this a step further, these geometries form a calculus of various equations from which we can see how these natural objects are interconnected and interoperable.And, we have plenty of quantum research to support this.So, you might consider a plant as a leading signifier of living operations in the natural or physical world.Now let's examine how this looks in terms of compiling information in the natural world or physical world with holographic representations.The simplest way to understand how we can model information in its holographic forms is in three primary geometric constructs: a square, a cube and a tesseract.Squares (2D) represent containers of information, such as what we see in flat media, or social media.Cubes (3D/4D) represent dimensions of those containers, such as what we see in motion graphics and data visualizations.Tesseracts (5D and above) are animated renderings of various containers, either conjoined, compared or aligned, to establish connections between points of information.5D models use methods such as extrusion, to visualize complex systems, and the connections between them.These types of models are then used to create multi-dimensional objects.Let's consider that there is no one model to see or understand information in holographic form.In the world of data science, we call this a ""model-free approach"".The vast majority of data harvesting methods employ reductionist approaches (such as market batch analysis) and look for things like statistical anomalies, or they make statistical connections that are not fully representational of the human or the environment in which they live. 23andMe is a good example of this.Emergent approaches look at specific groupings of data that are at once specific to the person and the environment, and are reflective of certain characteristics to which both represent an interplay between them.It used to be the case that we could analyze these interplays in online communities, by mapping the semantic or ontological pairings between groups.What we were unable to do, of course, is get a good understanding of why these groups or communities were connected in the first place, or, what might cause them to disband or have tensions between them.The correlations between the themes and topics of discussion would enable us to place them in physical locations, but much more digging would be required to get a handle on the real dynamics driving their interactions, and more importantly, how to actually help these people in terms of treatment innovations.Remember too that this is precisely where semantics have limited us in our information discovery, and the applications thereof.While the social technologies we have built have been very innovative, they still remain as 2D/3D containers that cannot enable us to see humans or environments in their full, natural forms.Each point of inference ""draws in"" other interconnected points, such that we can actually see causes and effects.Unfortunately, our current information systems focus on the effects, or correlations, to then make assumptions about ""what might be really going on"".For example, externalities, or side effects, are costs or benefits that are imposed on a third party who did not agree to incur those costs or benefits. Externalities arise throughout commerce systems as side effects of production or supply chain processes that typically do not take into account all the risk they assume when they operate.Typically, externalities are not factored into risk calculations in their full breadth, or simply not at all.This is where new frameworks come in.For example, this author has developed a holistic framework for factoring in externalities called natural risk amortization that uses an algorithmic quotient to determine price and demand variants based on production, distribution and consumption dynamics.It has always been the case that all the information we need is already ""out there"" and ""in here"", meaning within our grasp of physical reality.We can either see it, or intuit it, or both. Information in the form of data can substantiate what we see or intuit, rather than just confirm our preexisting biases and beliefs.With the ease, convenience and speed of modern technology, it is also the case that we tend to be less curious and less vigilant about seeking information, simply because ""answers"" can be fed to us in a Google search, whether they are true or not, complete or incomplete. Even worse, when we are fed answers, we tend to not ask more questions.Going forward, information discovery cannot be relegated to predeterminations about the world.As such, discovering the ""unknown unknowns"" is a noble and worthy pursuit.Now let's look at what information discovery means in terms of practical application.Here we begin to see the ""prisoner's dilemma"" that natural language and natural math present when information is not fully representational of nature itself.We must either test our assumptions against physical reality, and/or make the web objects we use fully representational of nature, and its natural laws.In doing so, natural math and natural language emerge in the patterns we see when we connect objects in fully representational, natural form.Conventional wisdom still maintains that if we connect a bunch of devices, we can see the world for exactly what it is. Yet, this is based almost solely on optics, rather than the true nature of physical forms, as described earlier.Where optics must be driven by structured data that is fed into the system by algorithmic predeterminations, or non-deterministic math, (like deep learning AI), the common logic is that the quantum object is one part fractal of the simulated digital reality, and one part a data assumption about that simulated digital reality.Alas, we may have found a solution for this.As mentioned in the last piece on Quantum Web Objects, the team at ORA has designed its HALO software to fully represent objects in their multi-dimensional wave forms. This means that each object is configured according to the quantum dynamics of the natural world, and that each object is fractal of the complex systems it represents.The team has already applied this groundbreaking approach in work with large software providers and health clinics, and we are forging a partnership that promises to redesign the web as an interconnected system of quantum objects that bring us back to nature, in the full majesty of all of its forms, its mysteries, and its offerings.Holistic approaches to data and their visualizations are already on avail.Now we have the unprecedented opportunity to solve environmental, social and health problems at quantum scale. This is the next simulation we are building.In doing so, we will transform the world according to our true natures.More soonest.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1472/1*54kRLDZIccVABkkWd2dKAg.jpeg,https://goonth.medium.com/the-next-simulation-8c9b6143ea57,science,0c5cf2231d841bc8602d2cb58ae2a13ce7bbcdc18be6d78655fece80
Will Ultra-Cheap Batteries Drive a New Roaring '20s?,"Batteries are very near a tipping point sought by entrepreneurs, tinkerers, and investors for a century and longer - a cut in average cost so low that electric vehicles can be profitably priced the same as their gasoline-propelled cousins. The coming price plunge for batteries is behind forecasts that, starting in the second half of the decade, EV sales will leap ahead of today's levels and eventually surpass internal combustion.The inflection point is a cost of $100 per kilowatt-hour, the metric for battery capacity. Some Chinese electric public buses are already powered by such batteries, and BloombergNEF forecasts that, at the current rate of improvement, the average price for all lithium-ion batteries will similarly drop below $100 per kWh at the pack level by 2023.At once, batteries have become a much bigger deal, evidenced by long new takeouts on the subject at the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and the Financial Times. Which has made me wonder what would be possible in a world of even cheaper batteries - like $56 per kWh, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised, or $40 per kWh, a potential cost cited to me last year by Gene Berdichevsky, CEO of Sila Nanotechnologies, a Silicon Valley battery startup. This is not just talk: The advances that could bring such prices - the commercialization of lithium metal and silicon anodes - appear to be already on their way in the middle to late-middle of the decade.As context to what such low cost could bring, the iconic Roaring '20s became an economic juggernaut on the strength of two intersecting technological advances: the affordable automobile and cheap electricity. Henry Ford dropped the price of his Model T from $965 to $269, and electricity fell from 30 cents per kWh to 10 cents. Now, when merchants began to sell the first comparatively sleek, affordable home appliances, too - the pop-up toaster, the iron, the washing machine, and the electric stove - consumers went loopy with excitement. A boom erupted in kitchen upgrades and automobile ownership, initiating the American love affair with the road and the age of convenience.In a story last month, I plumbed whether, a century later, we are entering a new Roaring '20s. And, if so, what are the products that could drive the boom this time? What I did not consider is how closely the present might be rhyming with the past - that the economy of the 2020s and beyond might also be driven by newly affordable automobiles and electricity, in this case EVs and lithium-ion batteries.In the 1920s, when Ford slashed the price of his Model T and then allowed people to buy them on installment plans, he unleashed an unimagined world: The number of automobiles tripled to 27 million by the end of the decade; four in five households now had one, compared with one in five in 1920. Road and highway construction went on a tear to accommodate these automobiles, and alongside the roads, crews built gas stations, cafés, and shops. Suburbs had existed for decades along railroad lines, but now ""the vast spaces outside the immediate radius of the lines begin to fill in,"" Robert Gordon wrote in The Rise and Fall of American Growth.There is no way to know with certainty how many electric vehicles will be made and sold over the coming years, but automakers are preparing for a substantial shift away from combustion. A forecast by BloombergNEF is that motorists will buy about 26 million EVs around the world in 2030, an eightfold jump from about 3 million last year. If such numbers materialize, they will require an enormous buildout of infrastructure, especially charging stations, but also all manner of newly equipped factories to make batteries, parts, software, and so on. EVs are described as smartphones on wheels - motorists will demand a digitalized ride including entertainment, which means more supply businesses for the vehicles. The various industries would add up to trillions of dollars in new business.But batteries costing $50 to $100 per kWh would be transformative in other ways too. Robbie Diamond, president of Securing America's Energy Future, a Washington, D.C., think tank, tells me that microcars will be much cheaper and that lanes will be created to accommodate them. ""Instead of shifting to walking and biking, which has never really been successful in much of the West, we will shift people out of cars into these vehicles,"" Diamond told me. He said, ""Start thinking vehicles whose wheels can be retracted, park sideways, and drive in micromobility lanes protected from large vehicles."" Such lanes might also accommodate delivery bots toting e-commerce packages.There are things to worry about, too. Just as the new technology of connectivity has brought many unintended byproducts, such as surveillance capitalism, this next stage of batteries is likely to enable products with the potential to disrupt society. One such technology is augmented and virtual reality, at once untethered from wall sockets and fully portable.On one hand, university life could be entirely reshaped when people can ""'physically' sit in a Harvard lecture theater with fellow students and superstar lecturers for a cheaper educational fee,"" said Simon Moores, managing director of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a London-based research firm tracking the lithium-ion industry. People living in isolated places will have greater chances to interact with people elsewhere. But people wearing such devices will also be on the move, not in their living rooms. ""It will blur the lines further between reality and virtual reality and encourage the user to spend more time in their fake world than real life,"" Moores tells me.Lighter, smaller, more energetic batteries would also enable mobile robots, which would suddenly be much cheaper to operate. Boston Dynamics has demonstrated astonishingly agile humanoid (and canine) robots. That could mean lost jobs if cheap, long-lived batteries mean such robots could wander around doing tasks for long hours. We won't know the job impact concretely until the time is here. But that they will be on their way with cheaper batteries seems almost a certainty.""I would say that fully functional autonomous robots are the next mountain for batteries to climb,"" Sam Jaffe, managing director of Cairn Energy Research Advisors, told me. ""Robots that are powerful enough to be useful are the 'toaster' of the next decade.""",https://miro.medium.com/max/7104/1*wB47LuCzGDF5scVus2A1JA.jpeg,https://themobilist.medium.com/will-ultra-cheap-batteries-drive-a-new-roaring-twenties-bc676c9acdaf,economy,0c89e3b0de29b7afe6c29b8c0b44af0f6d9c21f1d65c6f64c5a20597
The Mattress King,"The rain delay sent us into opposite corners. I sat looking out the window. On the other side of the Mattress King store, my son fiddled with his phone. We had been listening to the Phillies game on my dad's radio like I did when I was young, but then the rain came.The Crosley radio was still on, but the sound was just white noise. My boy Finn was seven, and I had no option but to bring him to work. It was a favor for my ex-wife. Some unexpected thing came up, and so my son I rarely saw spent the day with me at work, waiting, and bored.I was not expecting much action.Watching him, absorbed in the glow of the screen, pissed me off me for two reasons: no child should have a phone before twelve, based on studies I've clicked on, and no child should be named after a legendary Irish hero in modern-day New Jersey, even if the coolest thing about his father is his Finn MacCool tattoo.Finn had always been a Phillies fan, but now that his mom was dating a guy from North Jersey, he was getting interested in the Mets. Just horrible, really. This new guy, too, was instrumental in the new phone thing. So even when Finn was with me, he wasn't with me, thanks to this new dude.""If you want anything to drink, there's a fridge in the back room,"" I called to him.He didn't hear me with his earbuds. I noticed there were no creases in the binding of the new book I bought him from Amazon: The Once and Future King. I had loved those adventures as a kid, and I thought he would have liked it too.""We have another hour of this,"" I told him, knowing he couldn't hear me. ""Sorry, it's been so boring. And sorry for being a boring dad. And sorry for whatever happened to my marriage. The Mets suck!""Through the streaks in the window, I saw a silver sedan race across the parking slots. The cherry blossoms now damned the storm drains. A woman and a teenager exited and walked across the parking lot of the Peach Orchard Shopping Center. I grew up in this area of South Jersey, and while I'm not educated, I know irony. When we were young we would dare each other to steal a peach. I would run as fast as I could, hop up, pluck a peach, and race back to the smiles.Now I just sit, waiting.As the two drew closer to the store, half hoping they were shopping for phones at Verizon, I realized I knew the woman. We met at a singles dance, a PBSN event. Professional Business Singles Network. About four or five weeks ago. We danced and talked and had some drinks. I was rather vague about my sales gig, and I didn't have a card or a LinkedIn account that said The Mattress King. I looked her up online and showed my mom the Google pics.She said the woman was ""way out of my league.""""You said that about Morgan,"" I said.""And was I right?"" she said. I guess she was right.A year after the divorce, I wasn't having any luck with the bar scene. I'm a mattress salesman, so I'm not sure if that makes me a professional business single. On most days I mess around with a tie that I never fully clasp. My neck has sagged some. It's not like I sell the mystique of a Mercedes. The last time I buttoned the top button was on my wedding day. That it choked me tells you all you need to know.I guess someone in the major leagues would know all about a Windsor knot and cufflinks and buffed shoes. I'm not sure what type of car Faye drove - this woman from the dance was named Faye, but she was major league, I guess. I found it difficult to dance with her and keep my obvious arousal, let's just say, in the dugout.What was that they used to tell kids at dances? 'Keep enough room for the Holy Spirit?' Sound advice, I guess, but now there's enough room for the state of Texas. Well, that dance was the best chance I had since the divorce papers. Anyway, I called Faye. I didn't give a crap what my mom said. We got along well at the dance as I said.I left two messages, maybe three, and after a week, I just gave up.But now she was coming into the store.I would normally use my rain sales pitch, but seeing Faye again threw off my usual salesmanship. The reflection in the window helped me adjust my Chia-pet mound of dishwater blonde hair. I popped an Altoid as the bells above the door jingled. She wedged the door open with her black boot.""Will you get in here Justin?"" she said. The boy, despite the rain, lagged twenty feet behind, holding his phone. One day these phones will merge permanently into our DNA.She shook a dripping stub of a navy blue umbrella. ""You're getting soaked!""""Yep,"" Justin replied, strutting with black sneakers covered in pink cherry blossoms. The boy was probably fifteen. The kid pulled a black hat over his forehead. The rain had made freckles on his black shirt, half-tucked over his baby fat tummy.""Good afternoon,"" I said.She slowly unbuttoned her jacket and scanned the store. She was just as attractive as I remembered. She had plump lips and wore an overpowering perfume. Underneath her jacket, a tight orange blouse and low-rise jeans defined her reconstructed figure. She was around forty-five, I guess, with long red hair tied up. I know I fall in love much too fast. I guess it's stupid to call it love. It's probably what throws women off me.Too much enthusiasm.I imagined a nice dinner out with Faye, a quiet but busy place where I would not use a coupon or a Groupon, even though that's the only way I went out with my ex-wife, Morgan. I would pick a place where someone might know me, to show I was a local boy, well-liked, and all. I would purchase a bottle of red and white, not knowing Faye's preference. It would be no cheap box of wine that I would oxidate in the blender. That would break the ice, and get us comfortable while we talked about our sons and our careers and our break-ups. I had one book all planned to discuss: Hampton Sides' In the Kingdom of Ice about the first arctic expedition, and it goes nut crazy.And after dinner, we would catch a flick, and then maybe, afterward, ice cream. I can always tell how a woman enjoys sex by the way she eats - at least how Morgan didn't enjoy sex. She would play with her food, flicking this piece here and there and nibble nibble nibble and take most home that would crust over in the back of the damn fridge.I love true adventure stories. I'm not even sure my son reads all that much. I should ask my ex about that. What does the Mets guy read? The Wall Street Journal?""Good afternoon,"" I repeated with hesitation, approaching her. I half-feared she would recognize me, but after standing there like an idiot, I knew I was safe in my anonymity.""My son needs a new bed,"" she said flatly. ""I guess it's a twin size.""""Yes. And my name's Cormac,"" I said. ""Cormac. Like the famous author, Cormac McCarthy. It's Irish. Looks like he's outgrown a toddler bed.""""Are these the twins?"" the woman asked.""Yes, but those aren't the only twins on display. All of the models can be ordered as a twin. This model here, The Dreamstate Pose Sleep Excelsior II, is the lowest quality I wish to sell. . .""But she wasn't listening because she pulled out her phone from her back pocket. From her conversation, it seemed like she would be awhile so I eased back onto the bed. My son took no notice of the customers. I've always wanted to ask him what he thinks of my job. I want him to know that all work is valuable and that he really shouldn't be embarrassed.That guy from North Jersey may have fancy things, but I give him things that money can't, like bonding over baseball stats and stuff. The fluorescent light caught Finn's forehead for an instant: how long could I continue to bless Finn with Holy Water while he was sleeping? Morgan refused to baptize him, as she didn't know that my long-dormant Catholicism would suddenly gush a year after a pagan wedding.Faye snapped me back when she asked for a bathroom. I pointed through the store. ""I just cleaned it this morning,"" I said, but this for some reason startled her. Then it started hard: the rain on the roof and what rain. I approached her son Justin who was pushing down on each bed.""Can I ask you a question?"" I asked. ""If it's none of my business, you can just tell me to 'Back off, Once and Future Mattress King.' But what's with your hat that says ""dope?""The princely kid continued staring at his phone, his fingertips foxtrotting across the screen.""I have a kid myself, and I'm trying to learn the lingo.""""Whatever. It's just a word,"" the kid said.""Ah, like cool?""""Suppose.""""What kind of car does your mom drive?""""A Jaguar.""""Now, that's dope!"" The kid didn't laugh. I pointed to my car, parked all alone. ""You see my ride? A 2005 Honda Civic. Stick. 4 banger. 170K. And it goes 0 to 60 . . . eventually.""I realized he didn't want to talk about cars. I'm not sure he could make eye contact, utter more than a few syllables, or even shake a hand in a rigorous up and down motion. He would give the old limp fish shake. Finn had a few years left before those awful teenage years.Was I seeing the future with my own once and future son?I wasn't a punk kid. I followed my mom everywhere and didn't give her hell at all. I was a model teenager. Never caused waves. Horribly shy with women, too. And Morgan was my first, so late into my twenties, and now, for far far too long, my last. As I wondered what efficiency I lacked, trembling, with tears welling up, I glanced at Finn and wondered when he would start rebelling against me.Was today the day? Would he have the same problems with women? Would he find his path? His bliss? His calling?Perhaps the rebellion already started with the Mets thing, or not reading the book I gave him as a gift, or him being sore I missed his home opener. If I didn't have customers I would have walked over to Finn, hug him, and promise not to be a better dad. I would tutor him the way Finegas tutored Finn MacCool, like Yoda to Skywalker.My dad died when I was ten. But he taught me how to fish and how to avoid the banshees. My dad didn't live long enough to see the failure of his tutelage. What Death Star did I explode? I had to start working to support the family, and I never stopped. There was no one else, as I was the oldest.I asked Justin what his mom did for a living. She was vague at the dance as well.""She has her own company,"" he said. ""It's a dog walking service.""""She walks dogs?""""Yeah, walks dogs.""Faye startled me with a cough and, with the edge of contempt, asked, ""Were you helping us or not?""Embarrassed, I scrambled off the bed. I had been keeping an eye on her kid, making sure he wasn't up to anything funny, and I told her he was a fine boy.""He's a pain in my ass if you really must know.""""Then maybe it's you who needs a new comfortable bed, right?""Her son had moved to the Canyonland Rhapsody Pillowtop King.""Feel free to lie down,"" I suggested. The kid stretched out with his arms and folded them around his head. A mess of cherry blossoms dirtied the foot of the bed. He reached out and turned the knob on the radio. The knob came off.""Hey! That's my radio! My Dad's old radio!""""Alright, alright,"" he said, trying to wiggle it back. ""Who cares?""I wanted to thrash the rotten punk, but I wanted the sale and his mom, despite my allergies to pets, and so I joked that he mustn't be a baseball fan.""It's beat,"" the kid replied.""Beat? It's the All-American pastime.""""It's the All-American beat-time,"" the kid replied.""What do you think of the bed?"" the mother asked hurriedly.""I don't like this one.""""How about this one?"" she said, sitting on the next model. ""I like this one.""The boy peeled one of the cherry blossoms from his sneaker, rolled it, then sniffed it and smirked, ""Mom, that's a P.O.S.""""Watch your language young man!""He flicked the blossom like a booger and said, ""I didn't say a piece of shit.""""You shouldn't talk that way to a lady, young man,"" I said.Faye stared at me. ""Please. I can handle this."" Then she turned to her son. ""I'm warning you. We can leave right now. Listen. When it's your money you can...""Her cellphone rang out again. ""If this is your father again!"" Faye sat on my cluttered desk. Finn rolled away from her in my executive chair. The phone still held its mystical power over him. I wondered what he was watching. He liked to roll around the room, but now he just rolled closer to the wall, transfixed on the modern-day Lorelei.I was offended, really, that she did not recognize me. True, it was dark at the dance. True, perhaps she had a few drinks. But it wasn't that long ago. She couldn't have been too into me if she didn't start stalking me online, looking for any evidence not to date me.As she talked, she picked up the wooden frame with the picture of my son Finn in his baseball uniform. I suddenly felt inspired to help this boy so I asked him to check out the beds. I pushed on the mattress. I imagined taking his mom right there and then in a mad fit of passion, at least once in my life. ""This one's got the right amount of give.""""What?""""Go ahead. Lie down. Don't be shy. This one's just right,"" I said like Goldilocks.Just then I heard a thud and broken glass.""Oh,"" she said, looking down. ""I must have nudged it.""The oak frame fell. I said it was okay. It was a cheap frame bought with a 50% coupon from AC Moore. I picked out the chards from the edges of the frame. A jagged point sliced my finger. I snagged a tissue from my porcelain baseball dispenser and wrapped it around a bloody finger. The picture was not damaged.""That's Finn,"" I said, showing the picture. ""My son. Finn. He's over there. I named him after the legendary Irish warrior, Finn McCool.""She chuckled, I think. ""I can see the resemblance,"" she said as she glanced at her watch.I picked up the book. ""You ever read about King Arthur?""""Can't say that I have."" She asked her son: ""Have you tried every bed in the store?""""Yep.""""Which one does he like?"" she asked. I pointed to the one. ""How much is it?""""Just the mattress costs six hundred and ninety-nine. And ninety-six cents. And that comes with a full nine-year and three hundred and sixty-five-day warranty.""The woman said she couldn't see spending that much on just a twin, but I assured her they went even higher. As the boy tossed and turned on the bed, he said, ""This one is just right, this one is juuuuust right.""The mom said she wasn't expecting to pay seven hundred dollars for a mattress. Justin arched his back and pulled up his pants and smiled as he ran his hand over the white pillow top. ""It's Dad's money,"" he said.I nodded my head, and thought, touché, and pointed my finger like a gun.""Let me discuss it with my son.""I walked to the window, fingering the grooves on the golden knob of the radio, wondering about the game. What did it matter? Phillies fan, Mets, fan. Win, lose. The sun goes supernova. It's all a wash. Why should the result of a game interfere with my mood? And what did it matter what I said about the mattress? And what did it matter that I was a mattress salesman on a soggy Sunday afternoon? I just plug numbers and fill out forms and collect credit card numbers.As I waited, I chewed on the pen and noticed my tattoo through my white, threadbare shirt. I placed my hand over the tattoo and said an ironic prayer to a pagan prince. Even if they both walked out now, I wouldn't have cared. I'd track down a band-aid, follow the game, if the radio still worked, and hug my son. Then with a wave of her hand, Faye called me over. A summons. They decided to get the one the kid liked.""After all, it is his bed,"" she said.""Excellent,"" I said.As I collected her credit card and pulled the proper forms, the boy stood by my side wearing his black 'dope' hat. While I was happy with the sale, I knew I liked her less for her decision. She lacked sound, financial judgment. She lacked the ability to say no to her son. I couldn't be with a woman who had no sound money sense. I also noticed the dog hair on her outfit. And her son rode her like a horse.""Keep that thing off inside!"" the mother said. ""Don't you have any manners?""""Nope.""I wanted to call Finn over to calculate my commission on the sale. It's the way to learn math. I'm always showing him how much I save and how much the man takes out in taxes and Social Security, which I'll never see unless I reach eighty. Soon the rain was horrendous; like the monsoon scenes from third world countries, the rain that drowns oxen.""Looks like we're under Niagara Falls, huh?""She didn't hear or care. She just browsed through her phone when I asked, feeling my gut clench: ""Listen, don't you remember me?""The question didn't register. ""I'm Cormac. Cormac Nolan. Remember? That PBSN dance?"" I ask louder. ""We danced, had a nice time, and you gave me your number.""""When was that?""""A few months ago. It was winter then. Dark inside the club. Cold as anything.""""Why, yes, I do remember. I'm sorry. It's been so long.""""I left a message, two messages, a third with your son. How come you didn't call me back?""""Oh, I don't know. I don't think I ever got the messages.""She scanned the phone some more. Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. Then she said, ""Justin, this guy's ripping us off. There's a mattress on Amazon that gets rave reviews. Free shipping. It's got 4,703 reviews, and mostly all 5 stars. Plus, I get 3% back on Amazon. I didn't even think Amazon sold mattresses!""""They sell everything,"" he said.""It's only $350!""""So half price?""""I can put that savings into a college fund,"" the mom said. ""Those grades need to improve!"" She looked at me squarely. ""Because I want my son to go to college. It's essential nowadays, right? College.""I tried to save the sale: you can't trust reviews. You got to test a mattress. It's something you use every day for eight hours, and you can't cheap out on something so essential as lumbar support and what price can you put on a solid night sleep?But I knew I lost.So I showroom the wares, and when they click and find something better. I don't know if Tuft and Needle compare with the Ortho-Posture Valleybrook WhisperDream 3000. Everything goes by a different name, and I have to sit here day after day to make distinctions over quality. In another year, this store just maybe a yogurt store, or another burger joint, or senior urgent care.I asked if there was anything I could do. When she asked to bring it down to $350, I said there was no way I could compete at that price point. You see, now everything is just about price. There is no personality anymore. The middlemen are just cut right out.""Will you get over here, Justin?"" she demanded. ""This has already wasted enough of my day. We didn't even have to suffer through this."" She opened her navy umbrella. She insisted that Justin stay with her. ""Or you're gonna get really soaked!""I walked toward them. I didn't want Finn to hear. I told her that I may have lost the sale, but all may not be lost. I still had her number. I pulled it out from my wallet to show her, to prove to her that at some point in her life, I was just fine to go out with. ""Would you like to catch dinner? I still have your number."" I read it to her. ""I'd really like to hear more about your dog-walking business, Faye.""Faye hesitated and looked at her son. He just shrugged his shoulders. She raised her eyebrow and said she was awfully sorry, but she was rather involved in many things and didn't really have any spare time. ""Nothing personal,"" she said.""That's okay,"" I called out to her. ""If you have friends, tell them I'm having a rain sale.""I watched them cross hurriedly across the parking lot. The lights flashed on the Jag. Her perfume remained. I noticed that Finn sat by the radio now. He had reattached the knob. He turned on the volume and said the rain had stopped and the game was back on. That was a good thing, I said.And it was a good thing that I didn't go out with Faye. She would have cringed at the torn seat covers of the Civic. She would have quietly criticized the creases in my pants, the frayed edges around my shirt collar, the meat that was too well done, the wine that was not chilled enough, and that my nose hairs were not plucked to satisfaction.And I didn't need any of that. I can get that anywhere, even at home. And I can remain comfortable in my mom's crumbling two-bedroom rancher in Pennsauken that I will inherit after her death. There's a PBSN event at the Sheraton this weekend. And sure, I'll be okay. Hope springs eternal, right? Whatever happens, I'll be okay.I was about to sit down with my son. The Phillies were losing 8-nothing in the 7th inning. It was half an hour to closing when the bells jingled on the door. A woman in her early thirties walked in alone with a black umbrella. For once, I did not want to make mad passionate love on the mattresses. I simply told her that we were closing.""But the sign says you're open until five,"" the attractive woman said.""Sorry,"" I said. ""Can't be helped. It's an emergency. Try Amazon. They never close.""So I moved with Finn to the Honda, left the book on my desk for me to read on Monday, if I was slow, which it would be, and half-listened to the rest of the game.But the game didn't really matter to either of us. The fear of missing out on something online tempted him away and that loathing of missing out on everything in the world saddened me deeply. I looked at my thumb. Such a pudgy digit. It contained no such wisdom. For dinner, we ate soft-serve cones from McDonald's.He dumped his cone into a plastic dish. I told him I would like to see his next game. I wiped a glob from Finn's nose and asked him what his name meant to him. It reminded him of a shark fin. At least he didn't say ""the end"" in French. Underneath an overactive air conditioner, alone with my son, I told him again the legend of Finn MacCool.""His tutor Finegas caught the Salmon of Knowledge, gave it to Finn to cook, but Finn burnt his thumb on the flesh, and by sucking his thumb, received wisdom. And we became a wise poet, warrior, and leader.""""That's doesn't make any sense,"" Finn said. ""Sucking a thumb is for babies.""""Finn once said, 'A man lives after his life but not after his dishonor.'""""He didn't have to work hard,"" Finn said. ""Just stuck his thumb in his mouth? That's lame.""It was just an old Irish story. Finn had an excellent teacher. Taught him how to fish and asked him tough questions. It's what I wanted for him. My wife complained I didn't apply myself enough. When I lost the job at the print shop, I started taking a course at a tech school, but then stopped going. I don't know why. And then I realized something that made my eyes water.""Why did we wait for the game when we knew they were going to lose?"" Finn said.I didn't know what to say. He's no dope. It did seem like a waste of time. Maybe, I said, it's like a family, and when someone is having a bad day or a bad season, it doesn't mean you walk out, right?""Maybe your own dad is not actually the best teacher, I thought. Maybe the best thing for him was to be traded to another team.""It's all about hope for the future,"" I told him. ""Not for me, maybe for you.""He checked his phone. ""I'll check to see if the Mets won,"" he said.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3208/1*F5WibS_No5ZWOn1_p653nQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/the-shadow/the-mattress-king-325555cad64c,fiction,0cacebe5061faf72377563724a18ecaa34351929a423837ef4a9de0d
The Future Of Air Travel In The Post Pandemic World,"As part of our series about ""The Future Of Air Travel"", I had the pleasure of interviewing Alex Wilcox Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder of JSX.Born to a Swiss mother and American father in rural Vermont, JSX CEO & Co-Founder Alex Wilcox was a seasoned traveler and fascinated by aviation from a young age. Since his first invitation to observe a pilot in the cockpit and his first job in high school at Burlington International Airport in Vermont, Wilcox has rewritten the rules for simple, accessible and joyful air travel.After graduating from the University of Vermont and working for top-tier airlines including Brockaway Air and Southwest Airlines, Wilcox joined Virgin Atlantic Airways, where he met David Neeleman and was first introduced to the concept of low-cost carriers.David was the founder of JetBlue, while Alex was the first hire and they revolutionized the airline industry with a new, affordable flying option. After six years of cultivating JetBlue as one of America's top airlines, Wilcox moved to India to develop a brand-new airline, Kingfisher Airlines.After building Kingfisher Airlines from the ground to the sky, Wilcox identified a gap in the airline industry for businesspeople, families, and regional travelers needing a fast, affordable commercial flight option. As a result, Wilcox pitched his plan for a semi-private jet charter for businesspeople to Proctor Capital Partners, who were so impressed with his concept that they adopted the plan and named him JetSuite's President in 2007.In 2016, JetSuite evolved into JSX - an accessible, hop-on jet carrier that operates out of private hangars and minimizes travel time by up to two hours, eliminating crowded airport and long drives from the experience. Operating a fleet of Embraer 135 and 145 jets - which can also be chartered for private flights - JSX has revolutionized short-haul travel with Wilcox at the helm.Since emerging as a leading jet service in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington, Dallas-based JSX has been named the ""Best Overall Regional"" air carrier in North America in Airline Passenger Experience Association's 2020 awards season as well as one of Fast Company's top five ""Most Innovative Companies for 2020"" in the Travel category.By building an airline that combines the best of luxury travel - efficient check-in procedures, up to three checked bags, no additional fees for pets, Business Class leg room, and complimentary premium snack and cocktail services - while maintaining affordable pricing, Wilcox has carved out a new travel experience, offering a hop-on, private jet-like experience that is not just for the super-rich.Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dive in, our readers would love to get to know you a bit better. Can you tell us a story about what brought you to this specific career path?Thank you for having me! The pleasure is mine.Aviation has been in my blood from a very early age. I grew up in New York City, and my maternal grandparents lived in Europe. We flew to visit them every year. I remember being amazed that I could be at home in Brooklyn and, in a matter of hours, be in a completely different part of the world.But beyond the destination itself, the plane was just as magical to me and I loved everything about flying. In the mid 1970's, when I was only 5 or 6, I vividly recall walking up to a Swissair 747 with the big, iconic red stripe down the side of the fuselage. There were no jetways in Geneva back then, so being right next to that vessel - and taking in the immense scale of it -left a lasting impression on me and I knew very early on that I wanted to be a part of this industry.The red stripe must have also made quite an impression on me because it is a prominent part of our current JSX fleet design - except that our stripe is down the top and bottom of the plane.Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you started your career?I was recruited by an Indian billionaire to move to Mumbai and help start an airline for him. That airline became known as Kingfisher and it definitely resulted in many interesting moments - some of which are chronicled in the Netflix film ""Bad Boy Billionaires: India"".Other memorable experiences have stemmed from how excited and appreciative customers are of truly remarkable air travel experiences. In two instances, people were so happy that they literally prostrated themselves. The first time was by a customer on an inaugural JetBlue flight to San Diego. As he walked off the aircraft, he proclaimed his gratitude and genuine appreciation in a way I will never forget. My parents happened to be on that flight and saw it happen, which was a proud moment for me.It happened more recently a few months ago when we introduced JSX service to Reno-Tahoe. When the inaugural flight arrived from Burbank, a loyal customer that had been waiting for us to serve that destination, walked down the airstairs and literally bowed down to our team in front of the event attendees and media. It's in those wonderful and rare moments when I feel the impact that joyful air travel has on people's lives.Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?That had to be on my very first day of my very first real airline job. I was working ramp service for Piedmont in Burlington, Vermont and, right before the flight was to depart, the pilot told me he forgot the keys and asked me to grab them from the office. I sprinted a quarter of a mile to retrieve them before I realized they were playing a practical joke on me. Lesson learned? Transport planes don't have keys.Which tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not ""burn out""? Can you share a story about that?It's such a complex and challenging business - the priorities and dynamics shift literally every day. I've found that adopting the ""Ivy Lee method"" of writing down the six most important tasks at the end of the day, and then tackling them one-by-one in order of importance the following morning, has helped me stay focused on the ""main thing"" and avoid burnout.I'd also encourage my colleagues to just stop from time to time and take a moment to appreciate the fact that we manage to safely transport thousands of people - by air - every single day. We connect them to the places and people that mean the most to them - family reunions, funerals, births, vacations, important business deals. At the end of the day, this is a business about people, and it's an honor to be able to do what we do.None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story?The person that has had the biggest influence on me is David Neeleman (founder of JetBlue, Azul and Breeze). I've always had a lot of ideas but David, through his encouragement, mentorship, and leadership, gave me the courage to actually pursue my goals and aspirations on a meaningful scale.For example, when he had the idea for what became JetBlue, investment bankers didn't believe people would drive past La Guardia to JFK for a domestic flight. At the time, John F. Kennedy airport was wide open almost all day long, while La Guardia was congested and plagued with flight delays at the slightest bit of rain. David and I would get in my beat up old Saab and drive back and forth between JFK and La Guardia - timing the drive at different times of the day. It was never more than 20 minutes and David eventually proved that people would drive a few extra minutes for a clean, on-time flight with live TV. The rest is history.By showing me how big ideas can be turned into reality, and backing me at critical moments, David inspired me to pursue my own big ideas, including starting JSX.Can you share with our readers how have you used your success to bring goodness to the world?The mission of JSX is to provide a ""joyful, simple experience"" on every flight. I wake up every day focused on how to remove the chaos and stress often associated with air travel while providing hundreds of crewmembers (our word for everyone who works here regardless of job function) with a way to support themselves and their families, and hopefully having fun and enjoying it along the way.Can you share with our readers about the innovations that you are bringing to the Aviation and Air Travel industries?In the early days of aviation, flying was a simple and joyful experience - you showed up a few minutes before the flight, everyone dressed up and then you quickly boarded a plane and participated in the magic of flight.Somewhere along the way, the industry managed to screw it up, and air travel became a drudgery - requiring travelers to show up hours before a flight, standing in long lines only to be shoehorned into a tiny seat while being nickel and dimed for everything from bags to drinks. I like to say that if the Wright Brothers could see what became of the flying experience, they would have stuck to making bicycles.JSX exists to bring the magic and joy back to flying and the ""innovation"" is in removing the hassles and headaches associated with air travel today such as wasted time, sardine can packed planes, and mediocre snacks. Simply put, we found a way to carve out the bad parts of flying and keep only the best parts.Which ""pain point"" are you trying to address by introducing these innovations?All of them - but especially those that waste time.How do you envision that this might disrupt the status quo?One of the questions I get frequently is whether or not this model of air travel is scalable. The answer is 100-percent, yes. There are hundreds of undeserved, short distance, point-to-point markets in the U.S. alone. Many of them are huge, and some are small and seasonal and totally underserved. Before the pandemic, we were experiencing double digit growth year over year and had big plans to expand to new regions and destinations. Despite the dramatic decrease in demand, we were still able to introduce some new domestic markets, including a new regional network in Texas, as well as pop-up flights to Salt Lake City, and our first international route from L.A. to Cabo San Lucas that we are rolling out in February 2021.It's a proven fact that flying is safer than driving and I strongly believe that by giving people a more convenient alternative to driving between short distances - we are, in fact, saving lives.Are there exciting new technologies that are coming out in the next few years that will improve the Air Travel experience? We'd love to learn about what you have heard.Yes! I am most excited about the new hybrid and all electric aircraft platforms that are actively in development. There are half a dozen credible prospective aircraft manufacturers in this arena and it is my goal to be at the forefront of these innovations as a way to reduce cost and the environmental impact of travel while increasing the convenience for millions of people.That being said, I do not feel the same enthusiasm about UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and intra-urban ""flying cars"". In my opinion that is still a very long way off, while the hybrid and electric ""commuter aircraft"" are quickly becoming reality today.As you know, the Pandemic changed the world as we know it. For the benefit of our readers, can you help spell out a few examples of how the pandemic has specifically impacted Air Travel?Just as 9/11 forever changed air travel, so will this pandemic. It still remains to be seen what the long term impact will be but we have definitely seen a seismic shift in our customer mix. In the first few months of the pandemic, it was mostly essential workers such as nurses and hospital executives flying between medical facilities. In the summer, we saw a resurgence of leisure travel to both Las Vegas and areas with a lot of outdoor experiences - such as mountain regions. Usually leisure travel trails off in September, but it remained consistent throughout the Fall and into the Winter while business travel has stayed largely stagnant.Even with the vaccine distribution and the enhanced cleaning protocols in place across all airlines, I believe people are going to be much more mindful about not just where they travel to but how they get there and will seek the lowest exposure, most efficient options. For that reason, JSX has a huge opportunity ahead for growth and offering both leisure and business travelers that additional option they want and desire.Can you share five examples of how the air travel experience might change over the next few years to address the new realities brought by the Pandemic? If you can, please give an example for each.Cleanliness/Sterilization:Increased scrutiny on sterilization and cleanliness procedures and protocols are now a renewed focus and priority for all air carriers. Our enhanced cleaning program at JSX including our Simpli-Fly program, which we launched last summer is now a permanent part of our operation and something we will closely monitor on a day-to-day basis.Personal Space:People are now acutely aware of their level of exposure in crowded places - such as in airports and airplanes. At the start of the pandemic, we began innovating initiatives to give our customers more personal space onboard and rolled them out in record time. For example, in Texas, we introduced a fleet of Embraer-145 aircraft that are all single-seats (1x1), meaning you never have to sit next to anyone. For the other aircraft in our 2x1 configuration, there is never a middle seat and if you want more space you can purchase the double side to yourself at a discounted price.Charter flights:For the past couple of months, we have seen an increase in the number of companies and organizations wanting to charter an entire 30-seat plane in order to move groups of people safely between destinations. It remains to be seen if this is a long term trend but there is definitely more consideration being given to this type of air travel.Route Planning:The industry has seen a dramatic shift in the types of destinations being served during the pandemic and it will be interesting to see how these networks evolve over time.Travel Demand:With travel of any kind being out of the question for so many for the last year or so, I believe that we will see a surge of domestic travelers eager to get on an airplane for a change of scenery, or to visit family and friends they've only seen through their phone screens. We are already seeing more folks pursuing long weekend getaways, or to see loved ones across the Western U.S. and Texas. We are already rebounding as we head into Spring and Summer.You are a person of great influence. If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger :-)I wish there was a maturity pill that you could give people that could make them think before they speak, be sensitive to others and never engage in mob mentality - either online or in public. We all come from different perspectives and backgrounds, but we are all in this together.Thank you so much for these fantastic insights!",,https://medium.com/authority-magazine/alex-wilcox-of-jsx-on-the-future-of-air-travel-in-the-post-pandemic-world-8bb54dbd2b69,travel,0ced20c54cbed330648a4ee4bfdaa6f8a6a1f6ff0d230b43586452be
If You Want ToBe More Focused,"In the current times that we are living in, we all multitask. Texting while driving, eating lunch while finishing up that report that we are behind on, talking on the phone while washing the dishes. You name it; we are always multitasking.It seems like such a waste of time and inefficient if we are not doing multiple things simultaneously. I mean, come on, there is just so much to do.The problem is that while doing this, you are not able to give your full attention to anything that you are trying to accomplish. Research shows that multitasking is not as efficient as you may think and could even harm your health.Multitasking is the enemy of focus.I have been able to laser focus for as long as I can remember. Sometimes my laser focusing causes me to miss out on things. Sometimes even important things that I don't hear because of being laser-focused on the task at hand. This is usually when I am laser-focused on something that I shouldn't be focused on in the first place, such as scrolling aimlessly through social media.In his book, Limitless, Jim Kwik teaches what he calls ""Limitless Methods."" These are methods that unlock your potential to grow and to learn like never before.I highly recommend this book as it has been a game-changer for me. Jim Kwik is a brain coach who had several brain injuries throughout his life that caused him to have difficulty learning. Jim even got the nickname ""Boy with the broken brain"" from one of his teachers.This caused Jim to have a limited mindset that he had a broken brain and couldn't be fixed. Thankfully, Jim decided that he did not want to be known as the boy with a broken brain, and he set out on his life mission to prove everyone wrong that viewed him as ""The boy with the broken brain."" This included himself.Jim is now a learning expert and has made it his life mission to teach others how to learn. Jim states over and over in his teaching and writings that in school, we are taught what we should learn, but not taught how to learn.One of the ""Limitless Methods"" that Jim discusses in his book is focus.One of the main things that steal our focus is concentration.In the book, Jim teaches that to get better at concentrating, you must practice concentration.I got plenty of practice in concentration when I was 18 years old, working the meat slicer at the local Arby's that I worked at. Before the company had invested in a POS system with monitors, I remembered every sandwich called out. This was a challenge because I worked at one of the busiest Arby's in the country. I had 2 to 3 frontline cashiers and a drive-thru cashier calling orders out at the same time. It didn't help that Arby's also has an extensive menu and allowed ""special"" orders. It didn't take long before I had plenty of practice and learned the art of concentration. Otherwise, I would not have made it there very long.I ended up working there for over 17 years.To accomplish anything, you must be able to concentrate, and unfortunately, we've never really been taught how to concentrate. There is no class in school on how to focus and concentrate, but we were all hammered growing up that we need to concentrate more!However, as the Hindu priest, Dandapani said in an interview with Jim Kwick:Dandapani defines concentration as the ability to keep awareness of one thing for an extended period of time.The problem is that most of us practice distraction rather than concentration.As Jim Kwik stated in his book:The best way to practice concentration is to practice one thing at a time. In our busy world, we are always trying to accomplish more by trying to multitask.The problem is, as mentioned earlier, it is scientifically proven that multitasking does not work.Instead of trying to multitask, try and focus on the task at hand. For example, if you are on the phone, do not scroll through social media. Be present in the conversation.Trying to multitask while having a conversation is something that I struggle with. I can't count how many times my wife had said, ""Remember when I told you that yesterday?"" And I'm like, ""No.""I've always struggled with multitasking and thought that something was wrong with me because I'm not good at it. I have always liked focusing on one task, completing it, and then moving to the next.Now I know why! Multitasking is not the most efficient way to get things accomplished and steals us of our focus.If you want to be laser-focused and accomplish great things, then stop multitasking. Instead, focus on what you are currently trying to accomplish and then move to the next. If you are having a conversation with your wife or kids, then be present and listening rather than scrolling through your social media feed.If you want to be more focused, then you must not try and multitask. Once you do this, which will take a lot of practice, you will not believe how much you can get done. Also, how much you can actually remember because you could really be present in the situation.Your work will not only get completed more efficiently, but the quality will also be much better.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12032/1*aXYZV1qKUcvv6DnS9nxZ6A.jpeg,https://mrjohncooper.medium.com/to-be-more-focused-807860590444,productivity,0d3563c38d0a3c042ebb5a7e8a5ec128cd47c41b3d064e43fdfc96b2
"""Fake"" Sober Friends","I recently got back in touch with an old friend from high school. Like me, he had struggled with addiction but later managed to get sober.As we were comparing sobriety stories, he complained that he felt like most of the friends he had made in recovery were ""fake."" He said that he always had a feeling that they were only hanging out with him out of a sense of obligation, not because they actually enjoyed his company.His comments reminded me of similar feelings that I had experienced when I first quit drinking. I remember meeting other alcoholics, and actually being put off by how over-the-top friendly some of them were being.It didn't feel like they were genuinely interested in me as a person. Instead, I felt like they were just acting nice so that I wouldn't immediately go back to drinking.After one of my first in-person meetings, a couple of fellow addicts invited me to get some coffee at a nearby Waffle House. As I sat there talking, I just kept thinking that I was a burden on them, and that they had only asked me there out of some sense of obligation.What amplified these feelings is that they were both incredibly cheery, while I was pretty miserable and not doing a thing to hid it. My emotions made sense - after all, I had just quit drinking - but it left me feeling like I was somehow killing everyone's mood.Despite that, they kept including me in the conversation and doing their best to get to know me. This only made me feel more suspicious. I wasn't used to people being interested in me, so it felt fake, or as if they had ulterior motives.Now that I've been sober for several years, I see these early interactions in a different light. One of the things that I've learned since quitting drinking is that it's surprisingly easy to become emotionally invested in fellow addicts. I find myself caring about people that I've just met moments earlier.There's an immediate sense of kinship whenever I meet someone else who has struggled with addiction. Although we might have totally different personalities and lives, I know that we do share this one massive thing - our addictions - in common.Knowing that someone is an addict means knowing that we've more than likely shared many similar experiences and even similar thoughts. They can relate to certain aspects of my life better than even my closest non-addict friends.That connection makes me instantly care about someone, even if they're still a stranger. I've never felt like I was ""faking"" it when I was friendly towards a fellow addict.I'll admit, however, that maybe the question isn't completely black-and-white. I do know how difficult it can be to quit drinking, so when someone is newly sober, I tend to be a little nicer than usual because I understand what they're going through.This isn't coming from a sense of obligation though. It's just that I genuinely want every recovering addict to succeed. I don't think that treating people differently when they are going through one of the hardest times of their life is being ""fake."" I think it's just being empathetic.One of the things that my old friend said to me is that he felt like the people he had met in recovery were only friends with him because they had all gotten sober.While this might be true, I don't think that it makes the friendships any less legitimate. Friendships almost always start because of some type of shared experience. Either you go to school together, work together, or share a hobby. Why should getting sober together be any less real or meaningful?Not everyone that you meet in recovery is going to end up being a good friend. There are some people that you just won't connect with. There are others who are total jerks. However, if you do end up becoming friends with someone, I think it's unfair to write off the friendship simply because of how you met.My addiction was such an isolating experience that I often forgot how easy it can be to start caring about other people. If you've learned to care about the friends that you've made in recovery, chances are that they've learned to care about you too.",,https://medium.com/exploring-sobriety/fake-sober-friends-7604479f41c7,mental-health,0de64cff522c479441267ccdf23ec01cf89b6eec233fa26461d70073
Shhh...Don't Tell the Boss,"I was working the lunch shift, and my customer asked for a maraschino cherry in his whiskey sour. My boss, running the bar, informed me that we were out. Cool, no problem.However, later I saw a jar of cherries on a shelf, slightly out of sight.I went to the front and let my boss know.Her baffling response:""No there isn't""I went back and looked again, Yup, just out of reach, an ordinary jar of cherries.I went back to her and carefully said, ""I don't know if those are being saved for something else, but there is a jar on the shelf above the sink.""A few minutes later, that boss stomped towards me and threw the jar of cherries on the floor next to my feet. The glass shattered as crushed cherries stained my apron and white shoes a bloody red.""There are your fucking cherries. Don't ever correct me again.""You can imagine how many times I brought up any new ideas or shared concerns again.Psychological safety is all the rage nowadays, and for good reason. A culture where employees are encouraged to share their voice is one where they can contribute authentically, it creates a positive and productive workplace, and helps to win the war for talent. It empowers employees to discuss mistakes, share concerns, and highlight small problems before they escalate.Creating a culture that enables innovation, one that hears problems before they happen, and encourages employees to be vulnerable enough to share is all well and good.So why isn't this happening?For an employee to feel invested in their company, they must feel invested in. Employees share their voice because they believe something will be done in response - things will change, concerns will be addressed, solutions will be implemented, misconduct will stop.When things don't change without closing the feedback loop- trust is lost. The employee no longer sees the point in bringing things up.Research by the Harvard Business Review looked at two types of employees in two different situations:As you might expect, low-approach employees spoke up less often in both situations, and high-approach employees spoke up more often in both. However;""-the extent to which or how often a person speaks up with constructive ideas or issues at work is almost completely independent from the extent to which or how often they intentionally withhold ideas or issues. In fact, in several studies and organizations included in our meta-analysis, we saw that people quite often volunteered ideas in order to help their teams even as they silenced their fears."" - Harvard Business ReviewThis shows that even the employees who routinely share their ideas cannot be counted on to speak up in a difficult situation if the foundational trust hasn't been established, or when bringing up an unfamiliar topic.NLI's review of the research on conversations, showed that people will speak up in threatening situations only if they believe the threat level is low - meaning they feel psychologically safe and know that sharing their concerns won't result in punishment or retribution.If employees think there's more to lose than gain, they'll probably keep quiet.The default is to keep quiet, whether about positive ideas, or concerns. Building the bridge of trust to go from silent to open isn't a one-directional line. The research above shows that those who speak out often likely aren't speaking out about everything.When a high-approach employee brings up a long-standing concern, it's confusing for their leader. But when the immediate response is ""Why didn't you speak up earlier?"" the newly-built foundation of trust may be rocked. The employee now feels at fault for not having the trust built before and are unlikely to bring up concerns again.Companies benefit when employees speak up. When employees feel comfortable candidly voicing their opinions, suggestions, or concerns, organizations become better at meeting challenges as well as finding opportunities.So what causes employees to feel unsafe when sharing their voices?According to research from FastCompany: 41% said leadership doesn't value innovation, and 67% said leadership operates on the old maxim of ""this is how we've always done it.""Sharing ideas and concerns is work, and if they routinely don't see value in their work, they will stop doing it. They will turn that mental energy to other work that provides value - whether continuing to do their jobs in the same old way, or using that energy on more personally valuable work: starting a side gig, improving their skills, or figuring out their next move.In that same research, nearly half of employees reported not being regularly asked for their insights.""But my door is always open!"" I hear you yelling from the other side of the computer (hi!) - but that isn't enough for most employees to feel that they've been genuinely invited to the table.Asking directly, and often, while demonstrating that something will come of it is how to genuinely invite collaboration.Forty percent of respondents reported a lack of confidence when sharing their ideas. When silence and just doing your job is the easiest and safest option, and the reward for speaking up is vague or absent: why should anyone speak up? Especially as modern-day breadlines dominate the news. Would you rock the boat?Most employees think that their voice will be ignored, so why bother? This is especially true when employees HAVE shared their thoughts and nothing was done. Fifty percent of the employees surveyed said they believe that if they share an idea, it won't be taken seriously, or they won't get credit (56%).If the feedback loop is broken, innovation will stop. No one wants to make contributions that aren't recognized or valued.""It's human nature to stop trying and redirect energy where you believe it will do some good. Our research is filled with examples of smart, creative people, even at the executive level, who made deliberate decisions to stop bringing new ideas because they felt it was a waste of time,"" - David Dye, Courageous Cultures.Who wants to be known as the negative one? The Karen? The whiner?Employees often keep quiet about an issue often because they're worried about being labeled a ""complainer"" or fear losing credibility. In a study by a leadership training company, Vitalsmarts, more than a third (37%) were afraid that bringing up concerns would brand them as a complainer, hurting their careers.Understanding your company culture and how you encourage and/or stifle voices is a complicated matter. It's not as easy as asking anyone who has a problem to speak up. It is not as easy as assuming that those who do speak up feel open to do so in all situations. This work takes time, patience, and a heck of a lot of emotional intelligence.However, the organization that gets this right, is the organization that succeeds.",https://miro.medium.com/max/450/1*kDOMN0cJ9cdR5lNAuxlrGg.jpeg,https://samseaster.medium.com/shhh-dont-tell-the-boss-97169655ea58,leadership,0df9038b3ae72e13f68400731326a01b77b8101067d1786d33787ddc
"How ""Girlfriend Reviews"" Pulled Off The Perfect YouTube Debut","A basically step-by-step guide on how to make it on YouTube.Nearly everyone is familiar with the experience by now: you're browsing your favorite website or social media black hole, and you come across a link. For many, it's Reddit. For far more, it's YouTube.It's a link to a video. The video's title is compelling, or its thumbnail somehow attention-grabbing. Maybe there's a picture of a young kid and his friends both doing the ""Home Alone"" face next to a Lamborghini that's, I don't know, covered in peanut butter or something. Dumb stuff, a lot of the time.Or maybe it's something less flashy and more just, compelling. Something that appeals to a thought you might have had but never really explored. Something that makes you pretty sure, before you even click, that it's going to be at least interesting.You've walked down the aisle of a grocery store and thought to yourself ""how much would it cost if you bought out the entire store?"" Well, here's a guy doing it himself to find out (and then giving everything to charity).You knew there were mechanical instruments out there that could flatten massive objects without flinching - car compactors and what-not. But what would happen if you put a bowling ball under one of those things? You probably never even thought to wonder.Or you watched Rob Lowe describe an aggressively gourmet eleven-piece turkey burger on an episode of Parks and Recreation and thought ""what on earth must that taste like?"" Not only is there a dude out there that cooked it from scratch for you to find out, he filmed it with a Sony A7S Mark III camera and put that Ratatat song you like in the background.This is what makes YouTube and online user-generated content exciting to many. People - just random, normal people - can hit on the most random and specific ideas and urges a viewer could have, and express them so artfully that one wonders how it hadn't already existed in the first place.And so, if you had ever thought to yourself, ""man, girls across the country must be so annoyed with their boyfriends playing loud violent video games on the TV all day, I wonder what they actually think about them"" you know what felt like to be browsing Reddit on the day the video Should Your Boyfriend Play Red Dead Redemption 2? was uploaded.As part of an ambitious media rollout, the video game Red Dead Redemption 2 had bought out billboards and advertising spaces in New York and Los Angeles in much the way film and television usually do. They had flooded the internet with advertising: pre-rolls on YouTube videos, banners on tech and entertainment websites, and in emerging spaces like Instagram and Snapchat. Someone browsing the internet would have had to scroll past headlines and memes about the game for days and weeks. Everyone knew this game was coming out. The advertising worked. This was the landscape of the Internet that week.Then, someone scrolling on Reddit would have come across a link to a video.""Girlfriend reviews what it's like living with boyfriend obsessed with Red Dead Redemption 2.""So ensued the typical routine. Oh, what's this? Funny idea. Click.The video started off with a female voice making a straightforward statement: ""So Red Dead 2's been out a while and this game takes up a lot of my boyfriend's time.""Intro beat. Little joke.""He's played all day every day for three weeks and has actually begun to start talking like a cowboy.""And we're off. There was the simple premise, and the simple joke to support the premise. A viewer is intrigued. As the video's creator, you've just bought yourself another 25 seconds, until she gets to this line:""This isn't a review of Red Dead Redemption 2. This is a review of the experience of living with someone who plays Red Dead Redemption 2.""From there, things were presented plainly, almost like a pep talk from girl to fellow girl, of what someone in this situation was likely going to have to deal with. All practical advice.""So let's start with all the stuff you're gonna have to look at.""And it was expressed plainly, from a distinctly non-gamer perspective. She didn't even really engage with it as a game at first, but rather as a collection of images and sounds she'd glanced at or overheard for the past month.""This game, I'm not gonna lie, I won't hate on it, is gorgeous."" Cue the shots of sweeping landscapes and graphically-rendered wildlife. Sunsets over a mountaintop. ""On the other hand, there's a lot of violence."" Cue rabbits being shot, and horses running off cliffs. ""There's a lot of murder of innocent little woodland creatures.""""And even if you don't like to sit and watch your boyfriend play games you've had to at least listen. Your house is going to be filled with the sounds of gunshots and animals gasping for life.""Right away, lines like these made me realize how special her perspective was. Who else would zero-in on minor elements like ambient noise? It's the kind of thing that only really sinks in to a passive listener. But it actually got straight to the heart of the game's construction and the things it focused on.""There are these beautiful albino moose and the game seems obsessed with getting you to kill them.""And there was a delightful distance at play between the game and the experience of the game. Usually, a game review is kind of mired in the fact that your game reviewer is also a gamer with decades of experience and jargon swimming in his head.Instead of a sweaty dude saying that ""the control apparatus wasn't precise,"" we had this nice woman kind of sympathetically telling you ""talking to someone and pulling out a gun is apparently the same button and that makes my boyfriend very frustrated."" And her version might even help you better understand the issue, especially if you were a layman.It was a fascinating experiment in perspective and subjectivity. It was also very funny.""Will your boyfriend let you play this game? Yes, once, but you'll kill his horse and he'll never let you play again. Will you cry at the end of the story? Yes and I still don't wanna talk about it.""""I don't know what it's like to play, but if you're going to watch your boyfriend play, I give that experience a 5 out of 10. Lots of pretty pictures but lots of brutal murder sounds.""The video did very well. That initial Reddit post helped it blow up initially, and it was re-posted to a Red Dead-specific forum. You would click through to the original posting of the video on YouTube and find, fascinatingly, an empty channel with no other videos. The only other clue was a slapped-up profile picture with the anonymous face of a girl and a dog with its tongue out.Comments under the video uniformly praised the humor, editing, and of course, the conceit. And one sentiment was voiced over and over again:""You have to make more!""She had after all finished the last video by saying, ""Thanks for watching. I don't really know what I'm doing but I'll make more if you want.""So imagine those commenters' delight when four days later the channel uploaded Should Your Boyfriend Play Fallout 76? And then three days after that when they uploaded Should Your Boyfriend Play Spider-Man for PS4?These both followed the same format as the original video. Plainly expressed observations, told from that same distanced observational perspective. Very solid jokes. A kind of running theme and voice.Production quality over these three videos were high, and more interestingly, consistent. There were motion graphics and gameplay captures and properly mixed audio. And, as many commenters were quick to point out, it was sharply and cleverly edited. Every joke had a cue, and every beat was hit frame-perfect. The rhythm felt professional.It was right around the level of production quality that seasoned and talented YouTubers get to, only after years of working to improve, or after hiring professional producers and editors. And even then, those channels would still often only produce one video a week. So how were these complete unknowns doing this, out of nowhere? Three episodes in a week?By the end of the run of the Spider-Man video, comments had started to drift to theorizing explanations for their output. Many concluded it couldn't just be this one girl doing all this work by herself. Editing, writing, voiceover, producing, publishing, managing? Did they record the video game footage themselves? Did they source it from somewhere else?Some thought it must have been ""a full team"" of producers, editors, and writers. But what team could come together and make videos with no guarantee of revenue, and especially to make so much so quickly?Another seemed convinced ""they were a fake shadow prop by a corporation."" The next guy said ""they're probably paid by Sony for publicity.""But it still all seemed too reasonably natural. For all their professionalism, things were still a certain level of raw, as if they were still figuring at least some things out. And in in-between moments and at the beginning and end of videos, you could catch little asides from the narrator that betrayed that she had no idea what was going on.Four days after that first blitz of videos came Should Your Boyfriend Play God of War?That one started off with a first acknowledgement: ""Okay, 70,000 subscribers in a week, here we go, no pressure..."" And it ended with gracious appreciation: ""You guys. We can't believe the love we've gotten from YouTube and Reddit. Thank you so much for subscribing!"" As well as a promise: ""We are definitely going to be uploading at least once a week so leave a comment to let us know what games I should watch my boyfriend play.""By now I had realized that Girlfriend Reviews had set off on a familiar path for online video content creators, especially those on YouTube. Enough people have followed the exact track at this point - going from unknowns to viral stars overnight- that you could almost write it out as a blueprint.The process is deceptively simple.First, the hardest step of all: break out with a piece of content.To do that, you need a good idea. Also usually required: the talent and dedication to execute it. Simply, make something.Then, have that first thing you just made explode in popularity.For many, that explosion in popularity comes much later, only after they've made their thousandth thing. Some work for years, or a decade-plus, or their whole lives, and never break out. It is by no means a guarantee.But, you can hack it. You can jump on a trend, or an already-popular category with high turnover, like gaming. (As internet entertainment culture has matured over the last decade, we've noticed that people experience a more cyclical kind of stardom - trends that make stars tend to come in waves.)If you manage to break out, that's it. Hard part over.Step two: once the video has hit, sit there, refreshing the page disbelievingly, slack jawed, for an hour or two. Watch the numbers tick up and comments fill in. Don't bother trying to stay calm - there's no fun in that.If you're able to gather yourself over the next six to eight hours, pop in the comments of your video, or post a tweet, or both, saying, ""oh my gosh you guys I am totally overwhelmed with the response!"" ""Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined..."" You know the drill. For bonus points, throw in something like ""I read every single comment. You're all so nice.""Then, write the same thing into your script for next week's video, which of course you already have prepped. Wait a day or two, and post that one.Exhaust your vault of pre-prepared content. Then get busy making more.Rinse and repeat for a few weeks. Watch the numbers climb. Keep jumping in the comments if you're brave. Roll out an upload schedule that you know you can keep - daily, weekly, Monday-Wednesday-Friday, whatever - and stick to it.After a couple months, accept a compulsory email from YouTube inviting you to the YouTube Partner Program. Install pre-roll and pop-up ads that will occur before, during, and after all your videos. Don't worry - audiences are used to them, and those that can't take it have already installed ad-blockers.Wait 12 hours, then log into your account and freak out at the first AdSense dollars rolling in.Use that money initially to buy food, or as padding for a rainy day fund. You're probably not at the ""quit your day job"" stage yet. But a couple weeks or months later, try paying yourself with revenue and realize it might be sustainable.Continue, somehow, to pump out videos. Remind yourself, even as you're clawing at the edges of your brain for any last creativity or idea, that consistency is the number one most important element to your output. Put a video out on time no matter what. Worry if it's good afterwards.Once you're in a rhythm, start a Patreon account. Design a bunch of reward tiers for different levels of contribution. Promise even more content that you don't have the extra time to make, this time provided exclusively to people who hand you $5 or $10 or more every month: hours-long livestreams that will exhaust you, merch you'll have package and ship yourself and will almost certainly lose you money, and if you're really crazy, an extra bonus video every now and then made just for them.Advertise the Patreon in the end-roll of your next video. Say the Patreon money is going to go right back into the channel - a new better setup, more expensive equipment. This will be totally true. Also, reminder: you're selling merch now. Make sure to mention that there's a link in the description. There will also be a link to your new website that you got for free from your new sponsorship with Squarespace.After all, you need a new microphone. A new computer. Maybe a new capture card. Maybe actually pay for the editing software instead of illegally downloading it.The audience will see the video quality slowly rise. Soon, you'll be able to do more with each video, and in less time. After a while you'll look back at your first videos and wonder how they could have been that bad and how people could have liked them at all.Start a Twitch channel and broadcast live whenever you can. Now you can cut clips from the livestreams to add to your videos, and then post highlights from both across Instagram and, why not, TikTok. Insane people and young kids will actually just send you money on Twitch for no reason - that's one of the best parts, you're gonna love it. If you can find the time in the day, start adapting your content directly to each social media platform - aspect ratios, length, audience - and see if you can grow there too. As more creators like you flood into these platforms every day and start taking revenue share, the pie gets smaller. So get your fingers in, like, at least three or four pies. Seven to eight to ten is probably the maximum. You'd be surprised what other creators can handle, especially as they grow and maybe even hire teams.Now, ride off into the sunset. Film a profusely appreciative ""thank you for 1 million subscribers"" video (which often coincides with the ""YouTube is now my full-time job"" announcement thrown in the pre-roll of a video) and put your head back down. Try to ride the train of regular views and consistent work as long as the market will allow.Congratulations. You made it through a super complex gauntlet of luck and trends and potential pitfalls and assembled what is essentially a fully-profitable small business with a multi-platform new media strategy, in real time, with thousands of people watching and critiquing your every move.And now that those thousands of people are here to stay, a community is established. You represent something to people. You bring joy to their lives.The craziest thing is that Girlfriend Reviews hit every beat on that path.By Episode 2, GFR had an Instagram and Twitter set up, linked in the description of every video. Often someone would finish watching a video and want to stay in their little universe - those social pages would allow that, and pipe them into more content streams like Twitch streams and Reddit discussion threads, and maybe back for more videos.As the weeks went on, more details were revealed. There were only two people behind the channel, the ""Girlfriend"" and ""Boyfriend"" in question. Their names were Shelby and Matt, and they lived together with two dogs and two cats. Matt wrote the scripts, Shelby recorded the voiceover. Matt, a professional editor in his day job, would edit the videos. Shelby, a musical theater performer and aspiring actor, would write and perform all the songs. Nearly a year in, they would finally reveal their faces, and film Q&A videos that revealed more details about their process, with glowing speeches about how their viewers helped them literally make their dreams come true.Theirs has been the best executed and most ""perfect"" version of the path I've seen in my time as a YouTube viewer. There were no real missteps that I could see. Growth was steady - not too slow or too explosively fast.Their success was so clean and sudden and out-of-nowhere that some skeptics even began to accuse them of manipulating votes on Reddit and using bots to boost view counts. The foul-cries got so loud that Shelby felt forced to make a statement on their Reddit account. ""We've never manipulated our numbers anywhere and we were just as shocked at our initial growth as anyone.""""It's hurtful to see people talking about us being fake.""And it's the most hurtful perhaps, because they likely deserve the most recognition for their organic success of anyone - for winning what one might consider the combination of the lottery of opportunity and the Olympics of creativity at the same time.Their's is a Malcom Gladwell-like story: the phenomena of the right people, with the right abilities and foresight, choosing the exact time to make their move, and executing on their opportunity. It's worth noting because that hasn't even happened that much, relatively speaking, in recorded history. But it has happened by far the most often on the internet.And wrapped in all of it was the allure of it being an almost accidental success story. From the beginning, things were positioned as ""I made this one video on a whim and never expected anyone to see it and never envisioned having success."" And there was something charming about that. It's how we like to think of success stories - like they could happen to anyone.But think back to the end of the very first video and how she threw in the comment, ""Let us know what you want to see next. He's been playing a lot of Fallout 76 recently; I've heard that's pretty controversial."" We now know that they already had that video recorded and edited. There was a fully-produced song in that one, too. It was posted two days later. They knew exactly what they were doing, from the beginning.That's the balance in mindset that any aspiring creator needs to strike as they attempt to make a career. You need a healthy degree of both the sky-high imagination that makes you consider doing it and the serious pragmatism it takes to execute your plan effectively, or to accept if and when it just doesn't work. That's why statements like ""we were not prepared for the amount of people that saw that video"" are absolutely true, as are the fact that they had multiple videos pre-made and ready for launch in that one week.But at the end of the day, against all odds, and because they did everything right while being immensely lucky, they pulled it off. They made it. And now they find themselves on the other end of the wall.After a little more than a year, there they are again on Twitch, playing Cyberpunk 2077. There's a video due in four days. People are anxious to hear their thoughts on it. This is their day job now. It's a pretty great one if you can get it. And no one can say they didn't earn it.",,https://robincopple.medium.com/how-girlfriend-reviews-pulled-off-the-perfect-youtube-debut-9bc5a91678e4,social-media,0ec8c429f4b8a52e4e497411ed896eb07b4d54a9e26262b43741671a
Meet Chinny Ugoji - The Woman Who Innovated Faith-Based Marketing Communications in Nigeria.,"That could have been career suicide but Mercy said No. Also, Chinny is not one to run away from a challenge. She brought her marketing comms skills to shore and redefined the role of media and communications in helping to grow the 'startup' to one of the largest faith-based organizations in Nigeria (Yes, I know I could just say 'Church' but then what's the fun in that).Communication Professionals in faith-based organizations rarely any industry recognition or awards, yet they help build some of the biggest brands in the country. But I digress.Chinny Ugoji has pushed beyond the conventional 'churchy' way of attracting 'customers' (you know what I mean).I have watched for years in admiration of how Chinny leads her team as a full-blown marketing communication and video production agency. Some of your favorite video production agencies pale in comparison. She leads her team to deliver several comms campaigns weekly and to produce all the contents in-house.Her media and comms team does it all;Chinny Ugoji and her team are proof that despite your incredible product/service, your marketing comms efforts will be one of the defining success factors - driving brand awareness, consideration, conversion, retention, loyalty and advocacy.

The War On Pineapple Pizza Predicted The Capitol Riot Over A Year Ago,"In July 2019, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) claimed that they had ""no evidence of Russia actively carrying out information operations against pizza toppings,"" but that didn't stop the agency from using the benign controversy as a teachable moment; demonstrating how easily actors with nefarious intent foment unrest online that spills into the streets. CISA's ""War on Pineapple"" succinctly describes how foreign agents influence social media to cause division and social unrest. If only we had listened.CISA, a division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, crafted an infographic that revealed the playbook used to influence and escalate online division to real-world activism. Developed as a cautionary reminder of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the infographic's prescience is uncanny in the wake of the Capitol riot on January 6. Indeed, planning for that day didn't happen overnight. It requires specific ingredients to bake over time before the cheese is heated to eruption.This is the recipe for inciting a riot.Online trolls are always looking for opportunities to engage and enrage; not meme debates like ""laurel versus yanny,"" but ones that can be divisive. The topic might be gun control, women's rights, questions about the election, or racial injustice, for example. In the infographic, CISA uses the question about whether pineapple belongs on pizza.Trolls don't care about the outcome of a threaded debate; they don't even need to win. Be on the lookout for those that just want to spark division.As the troll prepares to engage, they might change their avatar and profile to match the stance. Older, established accounts may have greater reach by follower count and assumed authenticity by virtue of longevity. To activate these accounts, CISA suggests the profile names might be changed rather than creating brand new accounts. That's because a new account with a handful of followers would be like a tree falling in the woods with nobody around to hear it.In addition, CISA notes that multiple accounts are typically controlled by the same user, or in some cases, a farm of operatives. This allows the dubious actor to game the social feed algorithm so posts can be carried by a tsunami of likes and retweets into extended network feeds.One of the hallmarks of a troll is the use of misinformation or the citation of unreliable sources as evidence for an inaccurate claim. Quotes may be taken out of context or entirely fabricated to fit a narrative.Even when they're amusing, they can still be damaging. Last week saw more Mike Lindell (the pillow guy) bashing on Twitter, with retweets devoted to an attributed quote where he allegedly said the Capitol ""rioters were hypnotized by Antifa temptresses who hid psychoactive drugs"" between their legs. As wacky as his claims are of election fraud, Lindell did not say this. But that hasn't stopped the raft of people from spreading the fake news as accurate.Why? Because it's posted on a WordPress site with a legitimate-sounding name - The Business Standard News - yet it hides the disclaimer about being satirical on a separate page, rather than on articles. Also? A review of their ""About"" page reveals another deception, as it directs users to ""their"" Facebook profile, which is the seemingly legitimate South African Biz News Facebook page.But nobody ever triple clicks to verify a post. Trolls know that most people just blindly like and drive-by retweet.When the debate reaches televised mainstream media, trolls have hit the jackpot. As CISA notes, the ""meddling is legitimized"" as the message is amplified across the nation. The point is, if it's on the evening news, regardless of the channel you watch, then the topic is worthy of attention. Expect pundits to weigh-in on the matter as the controversy snowballs.I mean, really, who are these people that put fruit on pizza? We need to put an end to that.CISA claims that dark money injects funding for events or organized events to influence people off the couch and into the streets. But it isn't just anonymous agents. Once the big lie hit the mainstream, some donors supported the ""Stop the Steal"" campaign with wads of cash. One gave $2.5 million and later sued to get it back. Another $300,000 was donated by an heiress to a supermarket chain.It stands to reason that the campaigns, online agitation, and paid travel, certainly influenced and manipulated many to action on January 6. Consider this head-shaking revelation by CNN - some at the Capitol insurrection did not even vote.Let that sink in for a moment. Some people who destroyed property, claimed Joe Biden was an illegitimate President-elect, and violently stormed the Capitol building as part of ""Stop the Steal"" had not voted for any candidate - not even Donald Trump. So, what got them off the couch?The protest and violence of the day might not have their origins in a single social post. But the confirmation bias over time may reinforce beliefs that ultimately lead to blind, ignorant rage.CISA falls short in the illustration; however, it is evangelizing the notion that disingenuous influence only originates from foreign soil. Domestic extremist groups have also co-opted the social universe to peddle divisive notions, even recently. Last month, far-right activists and conspiracy theorists used the Gamestop chaos to amplify anti-Semitic rhetoric and hate speech to drive recruitment, as reported in Newsweek. Some used the massive online ""pump and dump"" scheme masquerading as another ""Occupy Wall Street"" movement on Telegram to foment violence, with some urging the need to ""stock up on weapons and ammunition.""And it wasn't just anti-Semitic tropes. In jumping on the Robinhood ""eat the rich"" bandwagon, members of multiple groups affiliated with anti-government or far-right were explicit in tying incendiary commentary to election conspiracies. ""The people that can shut down multiple Wall Street stocks in the middle of a trading day are the same people that can shut down vote counting in the middle of the night,"" referenced one account in the Newsweek piece. ""The same people who control our political system also control Wall Street and big business.""CISA's ""War on Pineapple"" reminds us to be alert and to identify social influencers with dubious intent. Even after the great Twitter purge of bot accounts, I've seen countless new profiles emerge with creation dates since Election Day with less than a handful of followers attempting to troll on topics related to the election, the inauguration, and the impeachment of Donald Trump. Unfortunately, I see users falling into the same old trap, being egged into debate before scrutinizing the author's legitimacy. If only we decried ""fake users"" as often as we heard the phrase ""fake news.""As to whether pineapple belongs on pizza? It's hardly worth debate because it doesn't.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2198/1*K_IBGoKVCC7pxVWYerlFow.png,https://dleib.medium.com/the-war-on-pineapple-pizza-predicted-the-capitol-riot-over-a-year-ago-82c485c8c057,social-media,1b9d7211fe623b9da98f94a834cd88cb5b72ff0d68aaf84b5f4ee1cb
Discover Freelance Business Expenses to Lower Your Taxes,"Learn about the business expenses you can claim as a freelancer including communications, technology, home office deductions, patent processing, and more.Your freelance business takes on unavoidable costs as you manage clients, run your operations, market yourself, take payments, and more. Many of these costs can be deducted as freelance business expenses - money that you've paid out to do your work. These expenses can be deducted from your business revenue when working out your profits and taxable income.This is good for you because it means you don't pay unnecessary federal, state, or self-employment taxes on the money you've already spent. That's why I've created this (relatively) complete list to freelance expenses. I've based it partly on my own understanding of taxes over the years, partly on what the IRS says, and partly on many of the other excellent expense guides out there.I hope this particular expense guide provides value because it's specifically for freelancers. You can use it when working out expenses for your own freelance business.I am not an accountant or qualified tax professional. These guides are intended only as general information, not as specific advice or recommendations. You should not rely on any of the information in these guides to make financial, tax, or other decisions. Always use official sources like the IRS website or your state's Department of Revenue to get accurate, up-to-date information.You should always speak to a qualified tax professional about your unique tax circumstances. These guides only apply to freelancers filing taxes as sole-proprietors or single-member LLCs in the United States. You'll find a disclaimer at the end of this article.Fortunately, I wrote an entire guide on revenues, expenses, and profits that which explains things further. Please note that in this guide, I use the terms ""expenses,"" ""costs,"" and ""tax-deductible"" interchangeably.If you make a purchase or use a service for both business and personal use, you can only expense part of that cost to your freelance business. For example, the cost of a cell phone that you use partly for business and partly for personal calls. I explain how to calculate this in the revenue, expenses, and profits guide.Depreciation means you need to spread the cost of certain purchases over several years, and you can't claim all the expenses at once. Depreciation can also apply to smaller purchases or expense claims, for example for business use of your home. Talk to your accountant.Your expense claims must be supported with evidence - for example, a receipt or other proof that you spent that money. Only claim expenses for legitimate business costs where you have a way of showing you paid that expense.Your freelance business expenses are completely separate from your 1040 standard or itemized deduction. You can claim both your business expenses (on a Schedule C) and your deduction, on the first page of your 1040.Finally (at last!), getting your expenses right relies on really good bookkeeping, and how you choose to categorize your business spending. Do I have a guide on freelance bookkeeping for taxes I hear you cry? Well yes, I do! You can find it here.Alright, I think we're ready. Let's start with what you won't find here.There are lots of expenses small businesses can claim, but several of them are not likely to be claimed by freelancers. Because of that, I haven't included information on the following areas:If you need information on any of these, there are plenty of other good expense guides available, and you can speak to your accountant.Alright, now I've explained what isn't included, let's get into what is.I've broken this down into a few separate sections.Before we get into the article itself, a quick reminder: I am not an accountant or qualified tax professional, and these guides are only intended as general information, not specific advice. Everyone's tax needs are different, and you should always speak to a qualified tax professional about your unique tax circumstances. These guides only apply to freelance writers and other creatives filing taxes as sole-proprietors or single-member LLCs in the United States. You'll find a disclaimer at the end of this article.Your freelance business can typically deduct a proportion of each of these costs, depending on how much they are used for business vs. personal activities:You can deduct costs for computer hardware based on the percentage used by your freelance business. This includes:You can deduct all of the costs for freelance business software, whether you buy it outright or pay a regular subscription. Types of software might include:Many freelancers have websites where they describe their services and show samples and portfolios of their work. The costs related to hosting and creating these websites are tax-deductible.It's worth explaining the home office deduction in some detail, because it can get complicated. Essentially, the IRS lets you deduct some home office expenses in one of two ways:You cannot claim both of these deductions, only one or the other.To take either of these deductions, your home office must be used regularly and exclusively for running your freelance business and providing freelance services.The home office deduction is different to and distinct from the other office deductions listed in this freelance expense guide. You can take one of these two deductions in addition to, for example, the cost of maintaining your office or buying office furniture.It's simple:This is the method I use, as it's much faster and easier than the other method, and there are no extra IRS forms that need filing. However, in some cases, the other method may make sense.Here's what you need to do for the other method:The bills and expenses you can typically apply this to include:Note that if you take the simple, standard deduction ($5 per square foot), you cannot also take the deductions above.If you use the percentage of the home method, you will need to complete and file a Form 8829, Expenses for Business Use of Your Home. This form is filed with your 1040 and Schedule C. This method may also have an impact on depreciation and capital gains tax when you sell your home. Speak to your accountant.You can normally deduct 100% of the cost of furniture, fixtures, and fittings that you use exclusively in your home office, for example:You can generally take these expenses in addition to your home office deduction.If you need to spend money to repair and maintain your home office, then you may be able to expense some or all of the cost:Repairs and maintenance might include things like pest control, a cleaning service, repairs to house-wide systems, etc.You can generally take these expenses in addition to your home office deduction.You can deduct miscellaneous and sundry costs based on the percentage you use for business:You can generally take these expenses in addition to your home office deduction.These are some of those hidden costs that we don't often think about, but they add up fast! Essentially, these are fees that you pay to receive payment from individuals, businesses, freelance platforms, and others.There's a whole wealth of finance-related expenses that may be partly or fully deductible as a freelance business expense. Some of these are complex though, so speak to your accountant.Some types of retirement contributions are deductible from the amount you pay on your federal and state income taxes. Retirement contributions are not typically deducted from your self-employment taxes.The types of retirement contributions you can deduct are those made to a personal, traditional IRA, and those made to a traditional retirement plan, like a 401(K). Please note that these contributions allow you to avoid tax on the contributions you make, but you will pay tax when you withdraw from these retirement accounts when you retire.Contributions to a ROTH IRA, 401(K) or similar are not deductible for taxes now, so you will pay normal income tax on those contribution amounts. However, they are tax-free when you take money out of those accounts in retirement.There are contribution and compensation limits for retirement accounts and taxes, and they can get complicated, so talk to your accountant.You can hire other businesses, freelancers, and contract workers and make use of their services. You can normally deduct 100% of the cost, provided the services are exclusively for your freelance business. If you pay a contractor or freelancer more than $600 a year, you will need to file a Form 1099-NEC with the IRS and also provide a copy to the individual or business you hired.The money you spend on professionals to help you run your freelance business are generally fully tax-deductible. These fees might include:You can completely deduct the cost of any training, learning, or materials designed to enhance your freelancing, business, or similar skills.If you use professional equipment in your freelancing work, you can normally deduct the entire cost. This might include:Your freelance business can typically deduct 100% of the costs for:Some freelancers will work exclusively online and probably won't have a need to travel, but others, for example, photographers, may need to travel to see clients and perform services.Alright, I think that's it for this expense guide.

An Intro To The World of Connectomics,"The brain is a miraculous organ, and that's not a secret to anyone. Our brains may only be 3 pounds, however, it's the powerhouse of intelligence, interpretation, initiating body movement, and is the steering wheel that controls all of our behaviours.Although the brain is one of the most important organs within all living organisms, neuroscientists still don't understand nor can comprehend how some components within the brain work. If neuroscientists don't even fully comprehend how information is processed within the brain of a tiny worm with a few hundred neurons, we shouldn't be surprised that the human brain with 80-100 billion neurons, is still a mystery to us.What if we want to ask more questions about brain activity? Like how neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's and ADHD develop?Through the study of connectomics, we can ask better questions about specifics within the brain.In this article, I'll be giving you an overview of the world of connectomics.In order to understand connectomics, we need to have a basic understanding of communication within the brain.I don't know about you, but when I hear really good music, I automatically start dancing. I don't care where I am, good music calls for a dance party at any moment.When someone throws a ball at me, my first instinct is not to dodge it, but rather run towards the ball and catch it.Occasionally, when my mother asks me to put away my dishes, I run downstairs to put them away before my mother gets annoyed at me.How do we instinctively know how to do these tasks?The brain is made up of billions of cells referred to as neurons.These neurons carry information that consists of electrical pulses, and whenever you perform any action, neurons in your brain fire off.A neuron has branches that look like a tree, and they are called dendrites. The dendrites receive signals, and a longer projection that looks like a tree trunk, called the axon, sends signals.These electrical pulses can jump from neurons to neurons through the use of the nerve releasing chemical signals called neurotransmitters.At the end of the axons, we can find synapses that act as a channel for neurons to communicate. The neuron transmitters will then use the synapses as a tunnel to travel from different neurons, creating new electrical waves where it travels.The connectome is a comprehensive map of the neural connections within the brain of an organism. It's often thought of as a wiring diagram that maps all the neural connections within the nervous system of an organism. A connectome can refer to the mapping of a brain of an entire organism, or the mapping of brain subsystems, such as hippocampal connectomes, thalamic connectomes, or cortical connectomes.Currently, the only organism that we have a complete connectome for is C. elegans , which is a one and a half millimetre organism. This organism has a very small neural network, consisting of around 300 neurons and around 7,000 synaptic connections.Construction of the C. elegans connectome took a very long time and involved very tedious scientific manpower. Every individual neuron was identified, located, and traced, just through manual visual recognition. This means that individual scientists had to follow the organism's neuronal pathways with their own vision, and the convoluted paths were tracked through many microscopic images.Unsurprisingly, the human brain is far more complicated in comparison to the brain of C. elegans. In fact, our brains have 80-100 billion neurons and an estimated amount of 700 trillion synaptic connections. Today, completing the human connectome is out of our reach due to the existing technology we have. The first reason is that there aren't enough electron microscopes in existence to make imaging of the large amounts of tissue in our brains feasible. Second, interpreting these images and tracing projections from each neuron is still carried out through humans clicking through images, which is not efficient what so ever.If we want to accomplish building a single human connectome, we will need many electron microscopes and artificial intelligence that can accomplish the task of visually tracing neuronal projections and recognizing and recording synaptic connections.Although there are possible challenges related to mapping the human connectome, there are many opportunities that create optimism for this possibility.Electron microscopy is rapidly improving and decreasing in cost, and there is a promising future of faster and stronger prototypes of these microscopes. Additionally, artificial intelligence is being pursued in many labs to accomplish the tedious task of visualization that comes with mapping a connectome.Human mental behaviour, such as intelligence (general abilities), depression, ADHD, and schizophrenia are hypothesized to be related to different parts and features of the human brain. Currently, we lack the tools necessary to investigate such theories. However, once we can fully construct human connectomes, scientists and doctors will solve many mysteries related to the correlation between our brain structure and abilities and behaviours. By comparing wiring diagrams of different human brains, it is likely that with this information, we will be able to develop target treatments such as better drugs, neural prostheses, and different surgical practices.Hi, I'm Ashley, a 16-year-old coding nerd, and an A.I. and neuroscience enthusiast!I hope you enjoyed reading my article, and if you did, feel free to check out some of my other pieces on Medium :)Articles you will like if you read this one:💫 A Crash Course On Brain-Computer Interfaces💫Neuralink: Making Mind Control Possible💫NeuroPace- The Device That Stops Seizures Before They Happen💫 Detecting Pneumonia Using CNNs In TensorFlowIf you have any questions, would like to learn more about me, or want resources for anything A.I. or programming related, you can contact me by:💫Email: ashleycinquires@gmail.com💫 Linkedin💫Github",https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/0*6w4ijdoXdCsMZxyp.gif,https://ashleyy-czumak.medium.com/an-intro-to-the-world-of-connectomics-84934c29047e,neuroscience,01bab62a6d57c00c05be25a4342b99597f75cd79472fc8bc434f4434
How Paralyzed Mice Were Able To Walk Again,"If the brain is the master of the body, then the spinal cord is its obedient messenger, carrying its signals across the body. Breakage of the spinal cord can have disastrous effects, since it effectively cuts off access to the lower half of the body. Even worse, the nerve cells that make up the spinal cord don't regenerate regularly, making it practically impossible for the body to gain back the ability to walk if the spine is broken. To this date, there are currently no therapies that can reduce nerve function if it is lost. Paraplegia, or paralysis of the lower body - usually caused by breakage of the spinal cord - leaves more than 5.4 million people in the US unable to walk for the rest of their life. However, a new treatment in mice shows much process in triggering the regeneration of nerve cells, even going so far as giving the mice the ability to walk again in just two to three weeks.Searching for a way to regenerate spinal cord neurons, the researchers came across hyper-Interleukin-6 (hIL-6). hIL-6 is a designer cytokine. Cytokines are proteins that are usually released by immune cells in order to trigger some sort of response in another cell. We call hIL-6 a ""designer"" cytokine because it isn't naturally occurring; researchers manually created this protein so that it could trigger regeneration in nerve cells.hIL-6 had already been found to stimulate the growth of nerve cells in the eye, so it was a natural choice in order to see if it could heal the spinal cord. However, since hIL-6 is a protein, it's too big to pass through the cell membrane and actually reach the inside of the cell to trigger nerve cell replication.To get around this, the researchers used an innovative solution: viruses. Viruses work by forcing entry into a host cell, and then releasing genetic material into the host cell. The genetic material is used to produce proteins that eventually build multiple copies of the virus, allowing it to reproduce.The researchers generated a modified virus that forced the host cell to produce hIL-6. When this virus was released into the brain and on the spinal cord neurons, they began to replicate and were eventually able to rebuild the broken spinal cord.To test this in a living animal, the researchers severed the spinal cord of several mice, leaving them without the ability to walk. The virus was injected into the area with the broken spinal cord and into the area of the brain that controls motor functions. Surprisingly, in just two to three weeks, the mice were able to walk again and the spinal cord was completely restored.The researchers are currently working to see if they can use this technique in humans, and if possible, this could have groundbreaking significance.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20112-4https://neurosciencenews.com/paralysis-designer-cytokine-17578/http://sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/01/210115110306.htmhttp://sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/01/210115110306.htm",https://miro.medium.com/max/1670/1*lXkewENmFz4Toe60c2hoVA.jpeg,https://medium.com/predict/how-paralyzed-mice-were-able-to-walk-again-a403c5a6401c,neuroscience,1c66a72c97e4ad722ba008c3c699f3c10f91bb21d4f07912082f71d9
"How I Got over 16,000 Followers on Tiktok in Less than Two Months","On December 13th, 2020, my wife filmed two cute videos of me on Tiktok being sad about transitioning our infant daughter from her bassinet to her crib.We posted the videos, and then I didn't think about it again.Three days later, my wife called me.""Have you checked your Tiktok?!?"" she shouted.""No,"" I told her.""You have more than 200 followers and your one video had 28k views!""I quickly opened up the app and saw the hundreds of notifications I'd missed.As of the day of this writing, 2/9/2021, I have 16,121 followers.Tiktok has a lot of potential for any individual or business to go viral. My account is just one example.Today, I make money every single day off our Tiktok videos through a combination of affiliate marketing and the Tiktok Creator Fund (which pays out to creators that have reached a certain threshold and been accepted to join). As of this writing, my wife and I can comfortably pay off several bills with the money we're earning, and it'll only get better the more we gain a following.Here's how we got the followers we have, and how you can start building your follower base today.Tiktok has very specific community guidelines that precludes hate speech, harassment, etc. The app has put a huge emphasis into more ""family-friendly"" content, so no profanity, sex topics, etc.If you want Tiktok's algorithm to push your videos to the ""For You Page"" (much like a social media homepage, or where people who don't follow you can discover you) which is likely the only way it'll go viral, then creating content that's G/PG should be your emphasis.Just like you can't plagiarize your articles, you shouldn't be plagiarizing your content ideas on Tiktok. You cannot join the Tiktok Creator Fund if all you do is copy the ideas of others or just do a bunch of dance videos.Think of this finding your ""voice"". What makes you...you? What do you care about? Creating videos like those will have a greater impact on the Tiktok audience because they crave raw and real, unlike Instagram, which is all about the polish.If you look at my Tiktok, all of my videos are about me and my family. I'm a guy that really loves his family, and I try to show the day-to-day of living with our surprise Babygirl after I became a dad again at 44.My followers identify with that.My most viral video was about me not wanting my Babygirl to get her two-month shots because I didn't want her to be in pain. That video has been viewed more than 2.6 million times.As our account grew, we added in more educational content as well as product recommendations that we stand behind.Your videos on Tiktok should have a takeaway, something you want your viewers to feel/think/know. What would you want your audience to understand better about you/your product/business, etc.?While some people will tell you to ""niche down"" on Tiktok just like they might recommend it to you on other social media, I think if you share what you're passionate about, YOU can be your own brand and people will keep coming back for that.A video I posted in December about how my wife and I got pregnant with our Babygirl still gets hundreds of views a week. That's an example of ""evergreen"" content. It's a feel-good story that isn't dependent on something happening right now.Trends (like the latest dance or song on Tiktok), news-worthy moments, etc. will come and go, but if you're looking for longevity, consider focusing mostly on producing content that's timeless.I've done a couple of trends, but mostly in regards to using some trending music. I'm not ever going to dance, but if that's your thing, sprinkle it in or do the dance and provide something of value at the same time, so you're linking the two.It's easy to get discouraged on Tiktok if you post something and it doesn't get the kind of views you thought it would.Keep posting anyway.I try to post 2-3 times a day. That's not always possible because I have a full-time job and a family, but sometimes I can video something really quick and throw it up there. I never know when something's going to do well. My most viral video took all of three minutes to record, do the text, write a caption, do the hashtags, and then post!My videos that have done the best have been under 20 seconds. Some Tiktok experts will tell you that videos around 12-15 seconds do even better.I don't know a magic formula, and I don't think anything is guaranteed, but remember we all have a short attention span right now.If your Tiktok video appears on the ""For You Page,"" you have only 1-3 seconds to hook a viewer before they'll scroll past it. Grab your viewer in the beginning just like you'd like to grab your reader in the title/subtitle/first paragraph of an article.You also definitely want to end with a call to action. I didn't always do this on my videos, and I regret it now, but it'd be helpful to remind your viewers to like your content and follow you if they want to keep seeing content like it. It's really not all that different from articles ending with a suggestion that the reader join an e-mail list.Having a Tiktok ""Creator"" or ""Business"" account (which you do when you set up your account) vs. a ""Personal"" account allows you to have analytic. You can see how people saw your content, when your followers are mostly online, etc.If something's working, try to figure out why. It could have been when you posted it, a hashtag/trending sound you used, the type of content, whatever.I did a series of videos on weight loss tips that did poorly in relation to my other videos, and they took more time to make because I was speaking to the camera, was nervous, kept messing up, etc.If that's not what my followers wanted and it was a time-suck, why would I keep putting the energy in when I had a better idea of what was already working?While these steps won't necessarily guarantee you a certain number of Tiktok followers, I hope it encourages you to try out the platform. There's so much potential there to connect to new fans, and if you're lucky, you'll eventually be able to leverage that into something lucrative the way I've done with mine.",https://miro.medium.com/max/5184/0*J1LRLnKqENuslH71,https://bdb2021.medium.com/how-i-got-over-16-000-followers-on-tiktok-in-less-than-two-months-d9a8a51a7192,social-media,1ce167c511b2de6f94143de17aa0ad97791ad943fb88f55314da05e5
A Ban on US Banks Issuing Dividends Would Be Bad Policy,"Economic turmoil related to the Covid-19 pandemic has spurred calls for the Federal Reserve to prevent US banks from issuing dividends, following similar moves by regulators in Europe and the UK. Such action would produce little to no benefits and substantial costs. In fact, a ban could strain banks' ability to support lending and economic growth, both now and over the long term.Thus far, US banks have been able to meet much of the unexpected demand for capital and liquidity created by this abrupt decline in economic activity. US banks dramatically expanded their lending at the onset of the health and economic crisis. While Fed lending has risen by about $120bn, bank lending has risen by $800bn, mostly funding companies drawing on their lines of credit.The banks have further capacity to lend. Post-crisis regulations require larger banks to operate with huge capital buffers above their regulatory requirements. As of the end of the first quarter, the largest banks - those with more than $100bn in assets - held more than $245bn in capital above those requirements, including all applicable regulatory buffers. That translates into lending capacity of more than $2tn.US banks also remain highly capitalised, with buffers intact even after taking large earnings charges in the first quarter to establish reserves under the new "" current expected credit loss "" (CECL) accounting standard. This new rule, similar to Europe's IFRS 9, requires banks to establish an allowance - basically, a reserve - for every loan, based on its expected losses under the current economic outlook. The largest US banks added about $60bn to their allowances in the first quarter of 2020 - yet still maintained a high average common equity tier one capital ratio of 11.4 per cent. That is well above the minimum level of 4.5 per cent.Of course, if the recession were to deepen, banks would need to build their reserves further. However, banks continue to generate earnings that can be used for this purpose. And buffers could be used to fill any gaps.In the US, the Fed also governs the ability of banks to pay dividends through its annual stress test. Under that test, banks must capitalise the next four quarters of dividends - that is, pass all the minimum post-stress capital requirements even after pre-funding a year of dividends. Those proposing a blanket ban would effectively abandon this process.Leaving aside its putative benefits, a blanket dividend ban imposed outside the current regulatory framework would come with a substantial cost. It would make it difficult for investors to value banks, and thereby make them decidedly less investable. Investors might logically prefer companies whose boards of directors retain authority to maximise value for shareholders, so long as all regulatory requirements are met.This would continue a worrisome trend. The market value of US banks, relative to their book value, has fallen over the past 10 years due to a variety of factors, including heightened regulation. As a result, US banks included in the S&P 500 index are trading at an average of 1.1 times their tangible book value - compared with 9.9 times for the index as a whole.At this point, then, the big attraction to investors of highly regulated banks is the ability to produce a stable stream of dividends. If that ability were taken away arbitrarily, the investment case would become difficult to understand.Moreover, the European and UK experience provides no support for the US following suit. While US banks in 2019 accomplished approximately 73 per cent of capital distributions through share repurchases and only 27 per cent through dividends, European banks distributed 4 per cent through buybacks and 96 per cent through dividends. Large US banks have already announced a voluntary halt to share repurchases through the second quarter.More importantly, the European and UK experience may serve as a cautionary tale. The UK's Prudential Regulation Authority announced its dividend ban on March 31, which increased the combined book value of UK banks by about £8bn. But at the opening of markets the following day, the market value of the relevant UK banks fell by £35bn, or £43bn including the lost dividends, despite broader equity markets being generally flat. So: eight steps forwards, 43 steps backwards. UK and European banks now trade at an average of just 0.4 times their tangible book value.In short, those advocating for government-mandated halts to dividends appear to have adopted an ""if it ain't broke, let's break it"" approach. While perhaps politically expedient, such an approach is bad policy and a repudiation of the good work that both banks and their regulators have done since the last financial crisis.The writer is president and chief executive of the Bank Policy Institute, a Washington, DC-based advocacy groupOriginally published at https://www.ft.com on May 25, 2020.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1800/0*q0UaqwCy5UFcqsw2,https://medium.com/bank-policy-institute/a-ban-on-us-banks-issuing-dividends-would-be-bad-policy-abeb348fbb62,economy,01de61f6ea19d7f1cfff894b4b268030602c5da7918939c188703b91
Are You As Productive As You Think You Are?,"Subscription escapism and the calamity of not getting true rest.Our work culture demands workers jump into the fire. Without a safety net. ""Get this, this, and that done, and, oh yeah, that one."" We get home exhausted and drained, unable to make the most of our off time. We build a life for ourselves we can't appreciate.Statistics are dismal when it comes to work/life balance. 46% of workers say they are underpaid. Studies show U.S. employees overwork by 269 hours compared to the country's economic output. There are many reasons, but I want to focus on two intertwined issues. Issues that answer the question: are we as productive as we think we are. I say, no. Why?We aren't resting right.This claim demands context. I think our current rest is not true rest. When we take work breaks, we submerge ourselves into problematic activity. To me, our productivity is proportional to the true rest we get.No wonder workplace fatigue is on the rise.What does productivity mean in this context? To me, the traditional definitions don't apply here. Productivity once equated to producing more with fewer hours. We became automata, stuck in a loop of constant production. With little regard for our well-being, we became convinced our work was more important than us. We didn't see 'us' and our 'work' as intertwined.Today, we know that mentality makes shoddier products. So, we promote attentiveness and care.Thus, I define productivity as the balance between work and rest. By defining our output this way, we factor in ourselves as a key component to the result. We humanize the process and commit ourselves to self-improvement.So, the question bears repeating: are you as productive as you think you are?In another article, I mentioned studies that show the flaws of the eight-hour workday. It mentions how workers, for half of the day, spend it on mindless activities. I even talk about how my current work schedule is more productive than my old office schedule.That's because studies continually show the most common work schedules are hurting us. But I will add that our approaches to true rest are toxic to our mental and physical health.Cal Newport, in his 2019 book Digital Minimalism, says this about teenagers and social media, which applies here as well:Cal Newport's point, like the rest of the book, focuses on the need for our minds to rest from external stimulation. The point stands with work productivity. Our minds and bodies, no matter the profession or circumstance, needs invigorating rest. You don't exercise the same muscle two days in a row. You let it heal. So too with our minds and bodies.Constant work for eight hours harms our capabilities.Our society encourages us to work beyond our contracted salary or hourly wages. We become pressured to give our health for company profit. We edge closer to the precipice's edge until there's no room left to give.No wonder 23%-44% of the workforce report some form of burnout. It's even worse for those working in the tech industry, where 60% of workers report burnout.When we have true rest we return to peak awareness. We get through our work at a faster rate, with better results. A half-hour or hour break to split an eight-hour day doesn't cut it.What type of rest do I mean? It can vary, as can the work/rest period structure. What's crucial, though, is to not overstimulate your mind or body. You need to let yourself reset and restabilize.To be clear, true rest does not equate to laziness. Your boss will tell you otherwise, of course. True rest allows you to jump into that fire...with the capacity to get back out before you burn up.I've discussed at length elsewhere how much of our media is no longer owned by us, the consumers. Rather, it's owned by corporations who hand us access through subscription services. If you leave their services, all the media you bought through them disappears. Amazon, Spotify, Sony, Microsoft, Netflix, and countless more are like this. But subscriptions are not bad by themselves. Your subscription can provide you meaningful content, like here on Medium.The issue comes when you are trapped in what I call subscription escapism.Subscription escapism is the act of buying into more content than you can realistically consume.For example, having subscriptions for Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO Now. Having that much access to streaming content may seem nice, but it's unnecessary. You can't consume all this content to make the annual $551.52* worth the buy-in. You're handing your money, time, and energy to a faceless entity.But that's the problem, many people do subscribe to more than is necessary. What's the result? Lots of mindless browsing while stacking up a long list of 'things to watch' that will never be finished.The actual browsing itself counteracts your productivity. You end up spending hours of your life browsing for that next show. Only to place it, forgotten, in a 'to-watch' list. You build up anxiety because you're behind on other things, and here's the kicker.When you add a 'to do' on top of a subscription-based platform, you are building a stress conduit. It's understandable because there are so many options and you don't know what to choose. But entirely avoidable.So the nature of subscriptions is to keep you stuck to the screen. The more views and clicks, the better. It's easy to think you're not spending as much money or time as you are on subscriptions.It's designed that way.When we immerse ourselves in subscription escapism during rest, two things happen.Thus, the escape mechanism increases while your capacity for productive work decreases. You plummet into a downward spiral of self-deprecation and depression.It's a situation like quicksand; it becomes harder and harder to get out the further in you get in.So, how do we fix this?The keywords are active and meaningful.It is easy to get lost in our subscriptions, and easy to dismiss taking more rest periods during the day. Our work culture dismisses true rest as laziness, yet we need to be active in our self-maintenance. We need to look at how we rest with critical eyes. Are we letting our bodies rest or are we stressing ourselves out with too much external stimulation?Our media consumption needs to be meaningful. The same critical eye needs to reflect on how we interact with our subscriptions. We need to approach content with intent, instead of relying on stacked up, forgotten lists. Ask yourself, ""Is this something I will actually use/watch/do?""When I started adding true rest to my workday my productivity increased exponentially. Even when I am energetic, I keep my routine. It allows me to step away and refresh. I now put out better work than I ever did before. Considering my situation, that's incredible.We owe it to ourselves and the work we are passionate about to have meaningful rest. When we are mindful of our needs, that attention redirects into our work. We produce at a higher level.The only price is caring for ourselves.___Do you have a particular resting method you recommend?How could this apply to your work?Do you feel you need to add more rest to your day?*Calculation made using monthly payments for basic Netflix, Disney+ Bundle, Amazon Prime, and HBO Plus.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*UM_9uqjC0HXVJR-_hsucIw.jpeg,https://nate-ansari.medium.com/are-you-as-productive-as-you-think-you-are-abecbd3838ce,productivity,1e9efb8b2db8087b55f954610562c183bc788b486f2a4a68223e6222
The Road to Recovery Led Me Back Home,"Almost two years ago I decided to leave the only home I'd ever known, in search of something I never had the opportunity to call my own. Therapy me, probably would not act so impulsively now. After all, I had no university place, I had no qualifications, but what I did have was all the audacity possible to make the jump. I needed time to stand still for a moment so I could think. Now, this is scientifically not possible (yet), so I went for the next best thing. So for 3/4 of it, it was just me, my laptop and the Zimbabwe heat. When I began university, I had made a plan to explore South Africa in my free time. But then the pandemic happened so for a year it was me, my laptop and remote learning.Like many, you will most likely hear me claim that the past year was a waste but if I was to be completely honest, I would say that it was a year of forced stillness I didn't know I needed. A year in which I had to face myself and realise my faults as well as others. It was a year of healing, forgiveness and mourning. A year of being made to let go of control and go with the flow. The year I found love.Ask me to write about trauma and I will probably smile smugly before showing you an archive of my work. Name a mental health disorder, baby I got it. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), anxiety, depression. I even have a test for adult ADHD in the next few weeks. I am back on antidepressants, dosage doubled twice. I am in a constant battle with my eating disorder. I think my signature scent is burnt bridges. BPD is characterised by unstable relationships with other people, unstable emotions and an unstable sense of self. So, to write about love is pretty . . . ironic? After all, many anti-BPD groups would like to claim people like myself are incapable of love. But we are.Now, I don't want to rehash too much of the past but I will note that I had a difficult childhood. Now, my brain being smart devised ways of working as a means of survival and protection. A big part of my therapy journey has been realising that this survival program isn't necessarily nefarious, but it is outdated. Therapy is in essence, a software update.A part of this update has been the realisation that decisions I had made were born from survival. And though I meant these statements at the time, they do not apply to the person I am now. It has been a long journey, but in it, I have found a home within myself. I have found forgiveness for the past and love for myself. I decided to no longer let my past trauma's define how I come to find and receive love. Because I am capable and deserving of love.Generational trauma has Black people (in particular), by the throat. Couple that with systematic discrimination, racism and the violence we experience and view day in and day out, it is amazing that we are still standing and optimistic for the future. Our stories of love tend to be shrouded in misery and pain, for good reason. But I want to be a vessel of love.At the start of this year, I made a giant leap towards this by coming out to my dad. He told me that all he cares about is my future happiness. The other day we went for a walk together and we spoke, not as father and daughter but as two people who had gone through life together. He shared with me some of his past regrets that he had and it was a conversation of healing. Today I am reminded of when I stated that I would sooner be dead before hearing my parents admit their fault. I can smile knowing that technically I was right. That version of my father and I, died a long time ago and we are who we are now.Now, I realise I can only speak from my own experience but I believe we have a duty as Black people to find and receive love. We are constantly barraged with information that hints at the fleetness of joy for us. But we must stop letting our past trauma write out our lives.For me, the most loving thing I did for myself was to start therapy. It helped me work through and set alight my baggage. I am nowhere near done on my journey but it was here in South Africa I realised my desire for my own family someday. Valentine's Day being nestled in US Black History Month means I thirst for Black love stories and clichéd happy endings.Though I am still on my journey, I hope fellow Black people reading this piece share their love stories to anyone who will listen. I hope some will endeavour to create works that represent us as we are. Our stories are ones of pain but they are also stories of hope.If you were to ask me to write a piece on love, I probably wouldn't know where to start. I have not had much positive experience in it but I am slowly filling up my bank so that I can create. I hope that all of you will join me.",,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-road-to-recovery-led-me-back-home-84f10ed7e999,mental-health,1f73c84e09afc44d7ab918a5c9613620328e6de0a9243ec2eb4463a2
Can We Earn More Money and Still Keep Our Sanity?,"I don't have a 9-to-5 job as many do. Even before the pandemic, I worked for myself to figure out what people wanted to read and consume on the internet. I don't have a regular job because I am mentally ill, and even though I've seen improvement in the past couple of years, I still have a long way to go to function in a typical workplace outside my home.In 2018, I felt I couldn't manage to deal with freelance ghostwriting's stress and deadlines. I had been hoping that freelancing would help me generate enough money to rid myself of the monkey that is Social Security Disability (SSDI), but like having a real job, I couldn't make commitments or keep my deadlines because I was constantly checking out for weeks at a time.The nature of my illness is that I operate in cycles. I can sometimes go a few weeks without taking time off to recover from a psychotic or depressive episode; sometimes, I can only manage a few days.In 2018, I found Medium, and although I haven't made enough money here to support myself and my family, it has opened up a few opportunities for me and gave me the confidence I needed to write well.In 2020, I found two other opportunities. I signed on at News Break, and I started a YouTube channel. So far, I haven't made enough money to feed my family, but I am working toward that goal.I don't have a regular job, but I do find myself working more than I probably should.My prime writing time is between midnight and 7 am. I have a family with a growing baby, and my wife works full-time during the day. The only time I can work is overnight when everyone else is asleep.I try to catch enough sleep during the day - a few hours when the baby naps in the afternoon, and a few more at night before I get up, make coffee, and start writing and making videos.When I am not sleeping, I find myself attached to my phone, researching article and video ideas, catching up on my reading, and trying to keep up with social media. To produce all the material I do every day, I need to be feeding my brain with books, blogs, videos, podcasts, pop culture websites, news, and even music, which helps keep my creative mind primed and ready.I do it during the day to focus entirely on writing and editing videos at night.I have an enormous amount of work I must complete if I want to hit my goals and continually grow financially to support my family and realize my dream of being free of SSDI.But all this is only my second most important job.I am first a father. I am always a husband. If my wife asks me to do something, or I see something that absolutely cannot wait, I will try to get it done before my stressed wife has to ask me.My family comes first before anything else.I work at night because any other time, I have to worry about diaper changes and cooking hot dogs for lunch, washing bottles and sinks full of dirty dishes. My life as a father and husband is more important than anything else, and I prioritize my family before everything, even earning money.But this is a problem.I'm starting to realize that this is not sustainable. My mental health has not been an emergency, but I slog through my days with fatigue, depression, and anxiety. Voices follow me wherever I go. And worse, the relationship with my wife is suffering. We just can't seem to find time for romance.But the problems don't end there. I'm finding that I need to spend more time writing and creating videos, and I don't know where I am supposed to get the time. Like everyone else, I only have 24 hours.What has to suffer for me to get the time I need to push my earnings higher? As a family, we can no longer survive on what I manage to earn and what I get from SSDI. I've spent too many years as a sick person, and I am so far behind where I need to be.How will I ever get out of this hole I've been living in my whole life?Yeah. My overall problem is money. Time is important only as a way to get more money.I don't particularly appreciate that I am so focused on money, but I'm in dire straits. times are hard and it is far past the time when I could feel bad about it.Before the election, I knew it was only a matter of time before Trump and the GOP succeed in kicking most of us on Social Security Disability to the curb. And even now, with Biden, I still worry that at any time, the higher-ups at Social Security could decide that I am no longer sick and take away my benefits.It's happened before, and I was almost homeless because I didn't get my benefits for a year. I still rely on SSDI because I can't keep a job with my psychosis and episodes of depression and anxiety. My success as a provider for my family is very much at stake here.I am hardly getting through each day working for myself - there is no way I could manage to keep a job. I don't have deadlines now, and I don't punch a clock, but there is still incredible stress to produce and earn, and each time I have an episode and have to take care of my health, I get further behind.I'm not making enough on Medium, News Break, or YouTube yet to cover for the loss of Social Security if it goes away, so I need to be doing everything I can to make more money to support my family.These issues leave me in a very tricky situation. Do I ignore my wife and kids to work more on earning and making money, or do I forget what I need to do to make my creative work more profitable and focus on the family?As much as I don't like it, we may have a solution. It involves my wife and I not trying to be superheroes and do everything ourselves. It involves stepping back and asking for help.If we didn't have to follow around a fussy but lovable baby all day, we could spend the time doing what we need to be doing. My wife wants to take on more English classes and teach more, and I need to increase the time I spend with my writing, video production, and everything that goes with it.We found someone who can help by watching the baby, cleaning the house, cooking meals, and just helping out for a few hours a day, several times a week. We also will be taking the kids to the grandparents more because they always say they would like to spend more time with the grandkids.We are not planning on disappearing - we will still be here to help and do our share. We will always be making the family our primary focus.But my wife will be working longer, teaching more classes, and I will be putting more effort into creating and doing what I can to start earning the kind of money we need to get out of this financial hole.I have to admit it feels like I'm selfish, letting someone else do what I should be doing. I'm used to always being available. I'm used to sacrificing my work time to take care of the family, and it's going to be a bit strange focusing on my work instead.But I know I'll get over it. I have to. I have to step up and figure out a way to make more money, so I'm not at the mercy of Social Security, the GOP, and their crooked ways.As crappy as it feels to say it, I must be spending more time working and earning - away from the focus on my wife and family.Sometimes, you must do it for the good of everyone, and that is the lesson in all this.Unfortunately, we need money to survive - because capitalism. And as much as it would be ideal that my wife and I could manage to work and take care of the kids and everything around the house, it's just not sustainable.We both have to work right now, and that means freeing up time.You may be in the same boat as we are. The pandemic had made things harder for everyone, and we all are in situations that we would rather avoid.The best thing we could do is not beat ourselves up for choosing to earn more money. In the long run, it's all for the greater good. Sadly, we have to take time away from our kids, but that is life.It's essential that the time we spend together is fulfilling and we spend quality time focusing on each other.After all, why are we doing this anyway? Why are we working so hard?",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*tIS3kBpZ5sJYfD1oOJJE3w.jpeg,https://medium.com/the-personal-essayist/can-we-earn-more-money-and-still-keep-our-sanity-bc069e2d7be5,freelancing,2aca2b9893e5aab9109d23328bd4ce8d0b974c13ff46249f9362747e
A fitbit® for center pivot irrigation,"A center-pivot irrigation system is a method of crop irrigation in which equipment rotates around a pivot and crops are watered with sprinklers. This is basically a 200m long pipe that rotates around a center point. The pipe has a lot of sprinklers, and as soon as the pivot is rotating it is irrigating the land below. These are well adopted worldwide.Some months ago, one of our customers come to us with a new challenge, how can we monitor a pivot irrigation system without voiding the warranty?Our first question was why? Why do you want to monitor it? What is important?It looks like, these little beasts get stuck. Naturally, it is heavy machinery which can easily weigh more than 2 tons. So, as soon as the soil gets wet, the wheels get stuck, and this stops the system from spinning.Generally, when the farmer finds it out is too late. One-half of the crops are over irrigated while the other half is dry.Just in the USA, there are more than 125.000 pivot irrigation systems. Some of them have telemetry incorporated, but adding telemetry generally requires having the latest model of the pivot system, which is often not the case.So our customer requirement made us ask ourselves, ""How can we connect a pivot to the internet without touching it?"".This is how we ended up manufacturing Pivotsense, our intelligent sensor for monitoring central pivot irrigation systems. For its installation, it only requires 2 minutes of work and a screwdriver. There is no need to connect it to the mainboard nor to the electricity. It is powered by solar energy.Once it is installed, the user only needs to turn on the device, pushing the power button. Pivotsense will connect to the internet automatically, it will configure itself and it will start sending information to a cloud web dashboard where you can see statistics about your pivot in real-time!What is more, it can be configured with alarms that inform if the irrigation device stopped moving or if the amount of irrigated water is below the needed level.Now that we've been able to measure what's going on with these giant irrigation machines by instrumenting them with autonomous solar-powered sensors, the next step is to merge the gathered data from the different variables regarding the pivot and create alerts and reports to obtain much better insights of the situation in the field, making the process much easier to manage for the farmers in charge of getting the best performance out of their irrigation system.If you are interested in learning more about our products, feel free to drop me an email at sebastian@lessindustries.com or check out our website www.lessindustries.comAt LESS, we develop Industrial IoT solutions that, combined with AI, enable our clients to make better decisions.

CDC Issues Welcome Guidance on Quarantining for Vaccinated People,"On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shared a welcome new change to their quarantine recommendations. Now, people who are fully vaccinated will no longer need to quarantine if they have been exposed to someone with Covid-19.The CDC's general guidance on quarantining recommends that all people who come into contact with someone who has Covid-19 should quarantine for 14 days, with the exception of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 in the last three months and recovered. Now, people who are fully vaccinated have been added to the list of exceptions.On Twitter, Brown Emergency Medicine emergency physician Megan Ranney, MD, MPH, said: ""THIS IS HUGE"" (caps hers). In a thread, she answered questions about whether such a move is justified. While Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines have been shown to be highly effective at preventing disease, it's not clear yet whether they can actually prevent people from becoming infected with and spreading the disease to others.The changes to the CDC's guidance imply that a person who has been fully vaccinated is not at risk of becoming infected with Covid-19 after coming into contact with someone who has tested positive.Is this true? Ranney says that increasing evidence points to yes. Studies she noted in her thread suggest that people who are fully vaccinated may get infected but if they do, they have a lower viral load (less virus in their bodies), which means they are less likely to transmit it to others.There are caveats, of course. The studies she cites are preliminary, and the CDC says these new quarantine guidelines apply only to people who are fully vaccinated - at least two weeks after getting both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single-dose vaccine (remember, immunity takes some time to kick in). These guidelines also apply only up to three months after full vaccination, at least until more is known about how long immunity lasts.As a reminder, people who have been fully vaccinated are still recommended to wear masks and socially distance.Despite the many caveats, this is encouraging news. As more people get vaccinated, fewer people will find themselves spending 14 days in quarantine - and fewer people will encounter people who test positive for Covid-19 in the first place.Read the full CDC guidance here.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8676/1*buwFcSc1_DOMYjKA9ynNJg.jpeg,https://coronavirus.medium.com/cdc-issues-welcome-guidance-on-quarantining-for-vaccinated-people-93e9ff7f7e6,science,2bf62496bcaf812b344d0ae3f3ebd99b9ed13c51fe73a208f0c56e4e

Clubhouse Is Suggesting Users Invite Their Drug Dealers and Therapists,"When you join the fast-growing, invite-only social media app Clubhouse - lucky you! - one of the first things the app will ask you to do is grant it access to your iPhone's contacts. A finger icon points to the ""OK"" button, which is also in a bolder font and more enticing than the adjacent ""Don't Allow"" option. You don't have to do it, but if you don't, you lose the ability to invite anyone else to Clubhouse.Once you've agreed to upload your phone's address book, Clubhouse uses it to recommend people to follow who are already on the app, which is common practice for social apps these days. But it soon becomes apparent that Clubhouse also takes it a few steps further, in ways that are both creative and a little creepy.When I granted the app access to my contacts, within hours it was nudging me to invite my former pediatrician, barber, and a health worker who once cared for my dying father to join Clubhouse - and sending me push notifications every time someone from my contacts signed up so I could welcome them via private chat and ""walk them in.""Granting an app access to your contacts is ethically dicey, even if it's an app you trust. If you're like most people, the contacts in your phone include not just your real-life friends, but also old acquaintances, business associates, doctors, bosses, and people you once went on a bad date with. For journalists, they might also include confidential sources (although careful journalists will avoid this). When you upload those numbers, not only are you telling the app developer that you're connected to those people, but you're also telling it that those people are connected to you - which they might or might not have wanted the app to know. For example, say you have an ex or even a harasser you've tried to block from your life, but they still have your number in their phone; if they upload their contacts, Clubhouse will know you're connected to them and make recommendations on that basis.Some social networks even use this sort of info to start building secret dossiers on people who don't use the app, sometimes called ""shadow profiles."" (Facebook is a notable example, though almost certainly not the only one.) For instance, if User A uploads the number of a person named C who isn't on the app, and User B also uploads the same number, now the app knows that C is connected to B and A, even though C has never used the app at all. While Clubhouse did not respond to my request for comment, it seems evident from the app that it is collecting at least some information about non-Clubhouse users, linked to their phone numbers.There are at least two additional ways in which Clubhouse appears to take users' contact data further than the norm.The first is that as soon as someone who was in your address book joins Clubhouse, you'll get a notification from the app that they've just joined, prompting you to ""welcome"" them and ""walk them in."" Tapping on that notification takes you to a private Clubhouse room with both the new user and any other user who may have also had them in their contacts.There's some potentially delightful serendipity here - I joined a welcome room for a person I hadn't talked to in years on a whim, and while they weren't actually there, I wound up virtually meeting some other random mutual friends of theirs. Which is cool, although you can probably also imagine scenarios in which being thrown into a private room with people you've never met might be less delightful. Still, it's a sort of high-touch approach that heightens the, well, clubby feeling that has been a big part of Clubhouse's early appeal.The second surprising way that Clubhouse harnesses your contact information is revealed when you go to invite others to the app. Tapping on the ""invite"" tab pulls up a list of what seems to be all the contacts in your phone whose numbers aren't already associated with an account that has been invited to Clubhouse. The twist is that the list also shows you how many ""friends on Clubhouse"" each of those people already has - and ranks them from most connected to least connected.Generously interpreted, the feature is probably based on the assumption that people who have lots of contacts already on Clubhouse are more likely to want to join or to find it useful once they do. But there's also something a bit icky feeling about ranking the Clubhouse connectedness of people who have not chosen or agreed to have anything to do with Clubhouse-and who may not have even chosen to be in your phone's address book, for that matter. Without knowing what other ways Clubhouse might be using this data, it's hard to pinpoint the potential harms, aside from the fundamental lack of consent involved in collecting data on nonusers.Then there's the matter of who people are finding atop those recommendation lists - that is, what the rankings are really optimizing for. Some of the top names may be friends of yours who are particularly tech- or marketing-savvy or who happen to belong to social groups that are well-represented on Clubhouse and for whatever reason just haven't had the opportunity to join yet. Great.But in a lot of cases, at this point in Clubhouse's growth - it was recently reported to have at least 2 million weekly active users - your contacts who are most connected to other Clubhouse users are likely to have already joined, or at least have been invited by someone else. And so instead, the names you see near the top of your invite list likely belong to entities that people have intentionally avoided inviting, despite their high connectedness.For instance, two of the names at the top of my invite list were not people at all, but restaurants - a pair of South Harlem Southern-food joints, one of which closed two years ago. Clubhouse also thought I might want to invite the psychiatrist who used to prescribe my ADHD medication, who I now know has 62 friends on Clubhouse. Fortunately, it doesn't show me who those 62 people are - but Clubhouse must know and have that information somewhere in a database.I'm not the first person to find this awkward. It was a nudge from Blake Eskin, an assistant professor of journalism and design at the New School, that prompted me to look into this.A quick Twitter search turned up plenty of further examples, some queasier than others. (All of the following are used with permission of the author.)Again, it's hard to predict the exact ways in which this could go wrong without knowing Clubhouse's policies around this data. One speculative scenario might be a subpoena in which Clubhouse is asked to turn over a list of who a given suspect or political dissident is connected to on the service. Even short of that, just imagine that drug dealer's surprise if she knew an app she's never downloaded was compiling a list of all the people who have her number in their phone.Clubhouse may or may not be the worst offender in terms of how it handles contacts that users upload. It's conceivable that the company has thoughtful data-handling practices that mitigate the risks, although its nonresponse to my inquiry isn't the most encouraging sign. What's clear, though, is that Clubhouse makes these connections more visible than most - and that new users should think twice before clicking the ""OK"" button to grant the app access to your contacts, no matter how urgently Clubhouse nudges you to do so.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1656/1*GSmOPPI0dMRC6dtkeWpTpQ.jpeg,https://onezero.medium.com/clubhouse-is-suggesting-users-invite-their-drug-dealers-and-therapists-a8161b3062fc,social-media,02dcc6c5c514a2a2cdb7b1d730463f92c37cfdea7fb3db70970db1d0
Quantification in Criminal Courts,"The intrusion of the predictive analytics or risk assessment tools into judicial settings is exemplified with the implementation of 'COMPAS' into the USA (Wisconsin, back in 2012, after years of development since the 1990s). Such algorithmic software uses machine-learning techniques that find patterns or correlations in vast quantities of 'data'. Judges use them to assess an offender's likelihood of recidivism while making parole, probation, bail, and sentencing decisions - who is likely to re-offend at some point in the future or to fail to appear at their court hearing.Since the justice system already has traditional problems that require solutions, the recidivism risk scale as the outcomes of powerful high-tech solutions is being chosen 'as a potent, pervasive, unstoppable force'. In fact, such risk assessment algorithms are repurposed, (Završnik, 2019)[1] and intended to transform traditional bail and sentencing systems, and minimize 'human biases that lead to unequal application of laws' (see Samuel Greengard, 2020). No doubt, such a quantified risk-scoring method to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of the courts' decision-making process makes a vivid shift in the criminal justice paradigm in the name of predictive justice.But the existing literature and studies suggest that they instead raise robust concerns - creating a system of codified justice with ""bias data produced through histories of exclusion and discrimination,""[2](see e.g., ProPublica, 2016; Dressel & Farid, 2018; Deeks, 2019). Accordingly, such quantification (Angèle Christin, 2015) in the justice sector is, at the same time, alleged to be obviously impactful and ""constitutionally, technically, and morally troubling"" (Starr, 2014); which would eventually promote unfair practice in the decision-making process. Now, let's see how and why such a method raises concerns over the effects of quantification and unfair practices in courts.The new trend of the 'codified-justice' (see, e.g. Richard M. Re et al., 2019) favors uniformity and standardization above discretion. The proponents for criminal justice algorithms argued that they are preferable because they could increase the courts' efficiency, accessibility, and consistency by technological means; and also reduce judges' bias, discretion, and arbitrariness. So, quantification and standardization in justice settings persuade judges to promote the cause of codified justice, although it has the potentials to limit their judicial discretions. In delineating the benefits of limiting discretion, it may be argued that AI algorithms are presented as an easy solution for making judicial decisions more consistent and efficient; which would 'help to determine judges' and prosecutors' accountability for their decisions.But a good number of cutting-edge researches and studies have already shown that lack of algorithmic transparency and explainability is seriously impactful in the justice context, and undesirably undermines the due process principle and the principle of fairness in the court practices. In a given justice system, there is no skepticism that the principles of equitable and individualized justice or discretionary moral judgment are of paramount consideration.Accordingly, the underlying values of the judicial system would be undermined; which ""tends to strengthen codified justice at the expense of equitable justice""(Richard M. Re et al., 2019). That's why, whereas such judicial use of the power of quantification and smart computation arguably makes a shift in judges' attitudes and courts' practices, the ideal of equitable principle and justice teaches us to minimize those harms.However, exponents of predictive analytics also posit that there is still room for sufficiently individualizing a criminal case while dealing with bail, sentencing, and probation. It is so because the recidivism risk scoring might not be the sole basis for a decision to be made, courts still should have the discretion and information necessary to disagree with the assessment when appropriate.[3] But opponents find the problem elsewhere, because 'such cautions may not works when it favors the quantity of information provided to sentencing courts over the quality of that information', which eventually could result in a 'more severe sentence' (Christin, Rosenblat & Boyd, 2015) based on an 'unspoken clinical prediction' (Hyatt, Chanenson, & Bergstrom, 2011).Furthermore, it is the fact that these scores rely on group data, so the recidivism scores are unable to identify specific high-risk individuals; it rather works on the probability. Additionally, for it lacks transparency, and explainability, little is known about the efficacy of such interventions in the judicial forums.However, contextualizing the fairness and equal opportunity in the justice systems, it can also be opined as such that algorithmic intelligibility only to experts cannot offer level playing evenness to all its users and subjects in clear terms; which justice institutions, particularly courts, are pledged to do so. Likewise, it may be opined that in issuing these cautions (of unfairness and illegitimacy), 'the Loomis' court made clear its desire to instill both general skepticisms about the tool's accuracy and the tool's assessment of risks posed by minority offenders'.In another sense, it is aptly argued that machine-learning algorithms cannot be befitting according to communicative theories of punishment.[4] But such a narrative is not out and out applicable in cases of pre-trial bail, or predictive analytics in policing, which occurs before determining one's guilt (Chiao, 2019), it is also aptly argued that risk assessment does not per se impair the communicative potential of punishment, or would not necessarily be incompatible with Morris's theory of 'limiting retributivism' (Garrett and Monahan, 2019).Then again, it is, however, not refutable that sublime considerations of retribution, deterrence, and rehabilitation are not embedded in the current versions of these algorithms (Angèle Christin et al, 2015). Besides, risk-assessment does not sufficiently incorporate causation, instead it 'emphasizes one major justification at the detriment of the others: incapacitation' (Harcourt, 2005). Even ""there is no persuasive evidence that recidivism assessment tools outperform judges' informal predictions' (individual-clinical-judgment to assess risk), or are less discriminatory alternative instruments""(Starr, 2014). Hence, it is of course an issue that such kind of unfairness is ever ignoble in the justice context.In conclusion, it is germane to refer to the Electronic Frontier Foundation's (EFF) proposal which imposes restrictions on the use of scoring systems. It vividly underscores that an actuarial tool should ever be the deciding factor in a decision to detain an individual for such tools can replicate the same sort of outcomes as existing systems that rely on human judgment - and even make new, unexpected errors (Jamie Williams, 2018). Since justice systems are always sensitive ones which must be fair and trustworthy, any AI methods are expected to 'do more than eliminate bias; they also explain their results, interpret them for users, and provide transparency in how results arrived at' (Colin Johnson, 2018).In other words, any defendant should have an opportunity to see and question the 'data' used to train the algorithm and extend of 'weight' assigned to each input factor, not only the source code (see Chander, 2017. In summation, fairness would also be advanced and promoted in the court proceedings if there is transparency, explainability, and interpretability in the computational methods in use. However, whether algorithms should be used to arbitrate fairness in court decisions is still a complicated question. Thus, there is still a greater question of whether they reduce existing inequities or make them worse.[5]Notes & References:[1]See also Aleš Završnik, Algorithmic justice: Algorithms and big data in criminal justice settings, EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY 1 -20 (2019).[ this paper mentions that ""AI tools will achieve more with less, and vaporize biases and heuristics inherent in human judgment and reasoning"", which will, in turn, increase the legitimacy of criminal justice agencies and confine infliction of punishment to 'pure' scientific method and 'reason'].[2]See Ruha Benjamin, Race after technology: abolitionist tools for the new Jim code (2019) [especially for bias and default discrimination].[3]State v.

Everyone Should Have Equal Say in How Monetary Values Are Distributed,"As kids, we all probably exchanged one thing for another thing that we thought was more valuable to us than what we had at that particular time; I, in particular, exchanged toys that I didn't like or I have gotten tired of. What we didn't know at that time was that whatever we exchanged with/for, can be also referred to as money, mostly due to the fact that we knew the recognized fiat currencies, and they were definitely weren't toys.The first point is, money in itself has no value, the value is dependent on the importance you and I place on it; if we decide that the dollar is not important and we cannot use it for transactions, then it cannot be called money. The evolution of money is also very symbolic; it signifies that money in itself can change and we must be open to such changes. At first, people bartered - exchanging one valuable item for another corresponding one of similar value, people exchanged silk, salt, metals, etc.However, it became increasingly necessary to have a unified measuring system for ensuring no one was cheated by barter, hence the introduction of metal coins, gold, paper currency, and the likes that exist now.Money, like air or water, is necessary for human sustenance. But unlike air and water that occurs freely in nature, money is a human invention. And it is the few elites that are in charge of this invention process that controls the distribution of this vital human good, which is to some certain extent wrong.Thomas H. Greco said in his 2018 paper, it is those who control the creation and allocation of money that are able to control every other aspect of our society. The greatest incentive for anyone to do anything is money. The few elites know this. Control money, finance, and the banking system and you can control almost every other aspect of human life. And this is why these elites have labored to consolidate their grip on the monetary system.However, like every other thing in this ever-dynamic world, money has continuously been evolving and improving and two critical drivers in the evolution of money are the speed of transactions and the necessity to meet the population or corresponding evolving lifestyle.The currency for any era was one that people always felt would make transactions faster as everyone already knows the value of every currency to be spent, and with regards to speed and productivity, technology(automation) has always been the driver of productivity and speed.The same applies to money, not only did the currencies evolved, but the processes involved in producing them also evolved to keep up; presently paper notes are being minted. Humans may identify problems but to optimize solutions, technology remains the best tool; automation is the major contributor to human advancement in every sphere of life.Firstly, automation speeds up processes, it reduces/removes errors and consequently increases productivity. However, one thing about technology is that as it evolves, it also changes 'face' or platforms. And the present face of technology is the internet. The internet is the platform by which almost every advancement in technology is built on.Consequently, the internet has also caused a shift in the lifestyle and culture of people. These days everyone prefers anything digital or online; the number of digital solutions and innovations across industries is endless. And no statement best describes this than that of famous Silicon Valley investor and Entrepreneur, Naval Ranvikant.It's no surprise that money has followed suit, with fin-tech one of the most profitable and scalable industries in the world; the fin-tech space has seen a lot of innovation crop up like USSD, mobile banking, tokens, credit cards, financial APIs, and other forms of digital payment and financial solutions.However, the internet has actually failed to fulfill the initial purpose of its creation. The internet was created to be a decentralized system that gave everyone equal access and control. The reverse has actually been the case with the internet and its derivatives now monopolized and its control skewed on different levels.Many people complain that they don't see Instagram posts by their friends and families any longer because the paid adverts are more prioritized by the Instagram algorithm. And a lot of the super and widely used app is being developed in a few selected places like silicon valley due to concentration of talents.The Ponzi like institutionalized VC mechanism in these tech hubs(cities); emerging markets like Africa can barely produce a solution that can compete globally due to systemic market entry barriers. And they have to settle for titles like ""The Facebook of Africa"", for their digital products; data privacy and infringement is now a big problem as complaints of data privacy infringement keeps increasing and a lot of people contemplating boycotting certain services in order to maintain their privacy and safety.This question is a two-way one because of the two major factors at play here: money and technology (the internet). The solution or attempted solution for a better money system must also take into consideration the dynamism and importance of technology.Hence, the proposed solution in this article is in one sense realistic, well-thought-out but in some other ways also hypothetical and predictive; I acknowledge the constant innovation the internet keeps undergoing and that we can only make predictions about what forms of innovation will crop up in the future around it.In view of this, I identified some major factors that simultaneously affect the improvement of money and the internet respectively. So what are these three key factors that can really provide the money system that we crave for and still be in line with the advancement of mankind in the field of technology ensuring that our money system is not backward?These three factors are the security of the money, the reach of the money, and the access to the money.Before I tackle each highlighted factor in the previous paragraph, it is pertinent that I first lay a necessary groundwork for any of the proposed solutions to work; centralization remains the major driver of the present money and internet problems; the continual existence of powerful financial and technology gatekeepers will make any proposed efforts to satisfactorily improve the distribution of money, futile.For us to give everyone equal access and influence on money, we need not necessarily tear down already existing centralized financial institutions, we however must totally decentralize the financial system and give every individual autonomy.Hence, the money system that will be able to actualize the benefits to be highlighted in this article, must be one that is decentralized.DeFi (Decentralized Finance) immediately comes to mind with respect to the last sentence, but that's not the point here; this is not an article on the benefits of the present features of DeFi; as I have stated before, technological innovation is something that is hard to predict, so Blockchain may not even be at the heart of the solution that I am even proposing, however, the core concept of Blockchain is decentralization which means we will constantly refer to Blockchain for illustration, simply think of it as me using something you are aware of, to prove a point about what would most likely work in the future.Are our monies really safe? I know a few people who refuse to use the ATM or conduct any online transaction and will always visit the bank physically or pay for services in cash always, yes, here in Africa. The reality is their money is most likely safer than ours, especially with the recent increase in cybercrimes, internet fraud, and data privacy infringement.However, as I said before, it is not possible to have a financial system that is moving in the opposite direction; the whole world is going digital, imagine if everyone had to behave like these people who insist on doing every transaction offline?Imagine how slow and tiring economic activities would be if despite all the digital mechanisms our finances and payments still all have to be offline all in the name of financial security and data privacy.Hence, it is the duty of the financial system to find a way to keep up with human advancement and simultaneously ensure security. Presently Blockchain is the only system that can guarantee absolute security and autonomy at the same time for every individual; with Blockchain every individual data is secured.Blockchain technology is presently the most secure and transparent technology in the world because it stores data in several databases by using peer-peer nodes thus by-passing any central authority by giving every user absolute autonomy.The technology is at the backbone of digital currency and can be applied to various aspects of online transactions and dealings like identity management.By securing the data of every individual, you take away the risks and unethical consequences of money; internet fraud will be absent in an internet that is completely built on a decentralized system like Blockchain.This potentially creates a world where every individual in the internet space will look for ways to uniquely create value for other people, which is exactly what the internet was designed to be.The inability of anyone to exploit the data of others also levels the playing ground and ensures that value creation is the engine that drives innovation. These positive ethical and systemic effects of a secure internet and financial system means we may begin to see more ethical expression and manifestation of money that we hope for.Furthermore, apart from the issue of data privacy, we need to ask ourselves this question again. Is our money really safe? In the current monetary system, the safest place to put your money is in the bank. Whilst this reduces or completely eliminates the danger of someone stealing your money or even wastefully spending it, it leaves savers vulnerable to inflation. If you put $10,000 dollars in your bank, inflation means when you go back to withdraw the money the $10,000 you will be taking home worths less than the $10,000 you put in.Another thing is this, your bank might not be able to return your saved money if, for example, many other depositors get in line before you. This is because banks usually loan out as much as 90% of their total deposits. So when depositors come in simultaneously requesting their money, the banks would most likely not be able to provide it.As much as every currency is being influenced by the market forces of demand and supply, there still exists systemic barriers that favor some people than others; a selected few continue to benefit from systemic financial or market barriers, especially the upper class.Take for example the respective experience a rich and average business owner has when trying to process a loan from a conventional bank; someone summarized it with the following statement:What this statement points to is the collateral system involved in getting a loan and how an average business owner will struggle to get a loan for his/her business which has made many SMEs fail, while on the other hand, we have even heard cases of some banks that went bankrupt because they failed to ask for collateral all just to make sure that their rich customer has a ""smooth service"".Obviously, the internet with the help of Fin-tech platforms have tried to considerably close this gap (another testament to why the internet has been a significant driver of financial inclusion); a lot of payment and digital microfinance platforms have been rising to drive financial inclusion especially in developing countries, however, this financial inclusion will not be total until the structures built to favor accumulated advantages for a selected few are completely removed and everyone is made to be his/her own financial institution.When you put, say again, $10,000 in a bank. The money does not just sit idle in the bank's vault. They use your money to give out loans to other people with a significant interest rate. That's how they make money. But then the individuals who made this possible by giving these banks their money in the first place do not benefit from the profits these banks make off their money.This is also similar to people who invest with hedge fund managers. When there is a high turnover in profits, the hedge fund takes a large chunk and distribute little to their lower-class investors. And in instances when these investments fail, and sometimes they fail spectacularly, it is the individual investors who suffer the brunt of it. Some have their entire savings wiped out while the banks and hedge fund takes a less severe hit mostly due to government bailouts like in the great recession of 2008.The control of money goes beyond loans, it has to cover everything from transparency, security, market-entry, foreign exchange, payment, and even trading. People must have absolute autonomy with regards to their finance for there to be equal opportunity in the long term. The rise of Blockchain and its digital currencies like Bitcoin is already a pointer to what can happen if we digitalized all currencies and completely decentralized the internet. With a completely decentralized currency and the internet, there is the complete removal of systemic barriers or borders (not absolute).This final factor is more of a corollary or consequence of the previous two. Provided, there is a completely decentralized internet and a general currency that is built around this technology, the access to money is completely fluid.Note, when we mean access to money, we mean access to all the forms of 'money value', as I explained in the opening paragraph of this article, it's not necessarily about the money(currency) but the value we place on it, which is obviously dependent on the value we all derive from the money.The present system cannot give everyone equal access to the value that money is supposed to give; firstly, the fact that the money is not yet digital means there isn't yet a complete correlation between where the market is heading and the 'language of the market'(money).Secondly, the lack of absolute transparency means not everyone knows and can influence the dynamics of all the value in the 'money value chain' and finally, the uncertainty around financial and data security means a few people are still skeptical about online transactions or eCommerce as in the case of Africa and some exploit the existing security loopholes to cheat or use people's data for completely selfish reasons.Access can only be achieved when individuals have absolute control and autonomy over their money and feel their money is secured and not vulnerable to the whims of selfish hegemonies. This is the reason why the case for a decentralized digital currency is a powerful one, and it is not a question of if but when these switches will finally occur.Conclusively, these three factors: access, control, and security which this article revolved around, are not specifically referring to the money itself. This is not about a certain currency that everyone should be able to touch, control, and secure, no, that's not the point; the point is if money is a general commodity then everyone should have equal access to all its value, control how these values are fairly distributed and everyone must be able to trust the system because we all know it is secure.The emphasis is on value; a currency is only as useful as its value, why then should everyone not have equal say to how these values are distributed? Is Blockchain the answer? Presently it seems to be the only system that can at least guarantee these three factors, and maybe Blockchain is not the solution, but regardless we must not settle for less, we deserve transparency, we deserve security, we deserve autonomy, after all, its everyone's money.",https://miro.medium.com/max/6830/0*Z1pAPj6P9hI4Ds2g,https://medium.com/swlh/whats-wrong-with-money-and-how-to-fix-it-fee8978d52a8,economy,02ed7968842b14e3fbba522f64d5e892f06e225ff0a8edd7f6e736f3
"How can you make UX research insights visible, traceable, and fun?","Research analysis and synthesis can be quite extensive and energy-draining steps within the UXR process. Yet both are key to distilling relevant actionable outcomes for dissemination, if you are navigating a fast-paced, disruptive professional reality like Glovo - where 'GAS' is one of the driving values - your UXR process should have quality, speed, and pragmatism in good balance.While working remotely with my fellow researchers, designers, and stakeholders in Glovo, I have been exploring ways to document my work systematically and time effectively, leveraging Miro. This approach helped me speed up my analysis/synthesis process in a way that felt smoother, more enjoyable, and giving me a sense of control all along. Digital tools can help you a long way! In this article, I aim to share my process and its benefits, as an inspiration for other professionals juggling remote dynamics these days.The first step is to lay the foundation of your analysis by creating a simple yet complete template in Miro, to be used for each user session. It should be in line with your research objectives: the key sections and/or tasks composing your interview/usability test script should correspond to mirrored areas in the Miro. By embracing a clear consistency standard for yourself (and the ones you are collaborating with) to apply in each user session, you'll never lose sight of what really matters - your research questions.In the case of small/medium qualitative studies with 5 to 10 users, assigning one unique colour to each participant helps you to trace back faster your data. Whenever wondering about the context of a certain statement or behaviour, the colour of the post-it can lead you back in a second to the whole picture.In case of more extensive projects above 15 users, I recommend using one colour per target group instead, when possible. Miro allows a maximum of 16 post-it colours and nonetheless, it'll make your framework more manageable.We recently moderated 20 usability tests, in collaboration with one of my fellow UX Researchers: 10 sessions in Spain and 10 in Ukraine, in parallel, with two target groups per country. In this case, I chose 4 colours guiding my process in Miro: 2 colours to identify the countries, and 2 gradings of the same colours to respectively identify the target groups. These visual details made it easier and logical for me to digest the data, however, you might find other tricks of greater help: whatever works for you, try to go for the simplest, most intuitive combination easing your work.Make sure to transcribe the relevant data into your template, either right after every session when still fresh in your mind or simultaneously by one of your collaborators. In case you are lucky to have multiple observers taking notes during the session, try to schedule a debrief and approach the filling in of the template collaboratively: 4 or 6 eyes and ears, are certainly better than 2!If you have structured your template well enough, it'll be a matter of filling in the blanks quite systematically, no brainers. The template will help you screen what should be in (relevant for the study) and what to leave out or to address as secondary (extra, bonus findings). To prevent from rewatching videos extensively to check on specific behaviours and/or capture additional quotes, add strategic reminders into the template in the first place to keep the focus.Aside from colour-coded post-its, research nuances can be further highlighted, if relevant, to make each piece of data able to stand alone once detached from its original template. Miro allows you to put a spotlight on any criteria/driver of your interest (age; city; behaviour etc.) via emojis or tags. Emojis are a subtle, fun yet visible additional touch to mark the post-its for visual reference. Tags, on the other end, hold the benefit to be retrievable via the Miro search function.In one of her fast-paced UXR projects with 5 users in Spain, my colleague Mariana Itza de Miguel leveraged Miro to transcribe key data and used a more granular template set-up like the one below. She added extra rectangular post-its as a way to classify data even more while filling in the template. This example is just to show the variety of tweaks and ad hoc adjustments that can be explored to match your specific challenges and personal work styles. Test out variations and simply iterate upon them for optimal results!As the last step after performing all user sessions and transcribing key output consistently into the templates, it's the actual analysis and spotting of themes and patterns. As we know, sometimes conclusions are clearer, others require more granular decoding and reframing before you are confidently able to synthesise the insights uncovering a path forward.Depending on the study type, I either read through the templates per topic scanning every one of them in that specific section, or I take post-its out from the template and create visual clusters. You can approach this in multiple ways, but certainly, the template will already clarify which ones are the relevant clusters to consider. And here you are, ready for dissemination!Whatever dissemination format, media or channel you intend to leverage, it's good to remember about Miro as a potential asset on the matter. Depending on your audience and the purpose of your presentation, you can arrange your clustered synthesis board with a suitable content hierarchy and data density. Also, Miro allows displaying portions of the board like a slide show and you can link user session videos to the board if you like.As part of a large project split into two phases - discovery and validation - I found myself juggling a tight presentation deadline where I was supposed to report on the discovery results, to inform the pre-validation work for the design team to pursue. Using Miro as a presentation tool has been a great time saver preventing me from compromising the due attention on data analysis. No need to switch to a formal report: I had all I needed in one place, from user session outcomes plotted out on a side to the actual synthesised results.What worked for me was separating key information at the top enlightening a direction in just 10 mins, and more granularity at the bottom to access more context if needed. Sharing the link of the board is a good practice to give your audience the optional chance to dig deeper if wished, before or after. Here below is an example of the structure I tested, for reference.I hope my explorations in Miro will spark your curiosity over testing a wider range of digital tools in UX Research.

I'm A Lost Girl of ADHD - This Was My Inner Voice,"If I just tried harder, I'd be more successful.If I could just figure out what's wrong with me, maybe I could fix it.Life seems so much easier for everyone else; I must be doing it wrong.These harsh words were my inner voice, my unwelcome mantras, for decades. They were the fallout from hearing, over and over again throughout my adolescence, ""You're just not living up to your potential.""If only my teachers had known that I couldn't claw my way to my ""full potential"" by sheer will alone. If only I'd had the words to tell them.In elementary school, I'm labeled gifted. I win the school spelling bee in the fourth grade, out-spelling even the fifth graders. My favorite teacher presents me with a citizenship award. Already a book lover, I create a volunteer position for myself in my elementary school library.But the year I turn eleven, everything changes.As my hips widen, my grades plummet.""Your science teacher says you're always looking around during class. Do you know what he means?"" my dad asks me after a parent teacher conference. I shake my head, stare at my feet. I don't know why my mind roams like a stray dog during math and science, why segments of school have suddenly become hard. I don't know about the floods of estrogen and progesterone that course through me, creating havoc.I'm profoundly disorganized: my folders, my backpack, my locker, my bedroom all brim with chaos.My emotions feel like external events, fierce storms that descended upon me.I'm ""too sensitive"" - to light, to sounds, to criticism (real or perceived).My mind overflows with a million great ideas, but I can never seem to execute them.I used to be smart, I think. I just need to try harder.It will take decades to understand that it's possible to be two things at once: Sharp and scattered. Creative and cluttered. Gifted and challenged.When I'm 20, lounging on my gray futon in a cloud of marijuana smoke wondering when my life will actually begin, I catch an episode of Oprah about girls with ADHD. Inattentive. Daydreamer. Disorganized. The words are a poem that spells my name. I glance around my studio apartment as if for the first time: strewn with books and CDs and sweaters, slivers of paper holding the stunted rumblings of writing dreams that never quite liftoff.I pull my phone book from one of the piles and find a therapist with an office nearby.""I don't know if you have ADHD,"" she tells me after I fill out a bunch of psychological paperwork, ""but I do think you're depressed.""I move back to my parents' house and start antidepressants. The hopelessness lifts, but life continues to feel like an uphill trudge.Like many women who are diagnosed later in life with ADHD, motherhood is the role that tips my life into utter unmanageability.Moms are the heartbeat of the household, the engine that powers the machine. With children, the love arrives out of nowhere, vast and inexplicable and fierce. But the rest of the costuming of motherhood - the ability to plan meals and come up with crafts and keep the house clean and regulate my own emotions - are all garbs I can't seem to find no matter how hard I search.Perhaps they lurk somewhere beneath the piles of dishes and dirty laundry. Or in some dusty corner of my mind, beneath the books I've yet to write, the mother I've yet to become, the streamlined life that glimmers on the horizon.One afternoon while I'm giving my daughter a bath, I stumble on an article about women with ADHD. I possess nearly all the traits the author lists, from hypersensitivity to holiday overwhelm to career struggles. It's like someone's been spying on me and jotting down all my struggles, all the loose threads of my life that never made sense, and wrapped them up and handed it to me, a single cohesive and glimmering package.I think about the Oprah show I saw 20 years earlier. I gaze back at the scattered clues of my life:It took me nine years and four colleges to get my bachelor's degree.Once I found a school where I could hyperfocus on my passion - creative writing - and ignore subjects I struggled with, like math and science - I excelled.I lose my debit cards so often they almost never have a chance to expire.Overwhelm is the central, pulsing theme of my life, my constant companion.I've spent decades in therapy, yet I never progress enough to graduate.I've tried medication, meditation, 12-step programs, acupuncture, exercise, prayer and professional organizers, but I never seem to reach ""normal.""The book I've been trying to write for 20 years that's still not quite finished.The alarming restlessness that haunts me.The disparate clues float and slide into formation.My mind sparks and shimmies. What if this isn't all my fault? I wonder. What if there's a way to make it better?I hyperfocus on ADHD in the same way I hyperfocus on anything that catches my interest. I learn as much as I can - about the ties between ADHD and sensitivity. About the way the ebb and fall of estrogen affects ADHD. Stimulants, I discover, are the first course of treatment for many. And yet, I avoid trying them for several years because I worry they'll exacerbate my anxiety.Finally, at 45, a few years after my breakthrough during my daughter's bath, I become desperate enough to seek treatment.I come home from my first appointment with a prescription for Ritalin. I feel guilty, as if I've stuffed my pockets full of shortcuts. Like I'm a college kid cramming for midterms.I swallow half a pill and wait for my anxiety to spike.It doesn't.What happened instead is something I never could've fathomed.Stimulants slow my brain down. They allow me to experience one thought at a time. I no longer pepper my husband with (as many) questions during action movies. I no longer get overstimulated and have panic attacks when I'm driving on the highway. I can complete simple tasks that once eluded me. I'm learning, like a child, to prioritize and organize.I feel... hope.Space.Drive.I believe I'll finish my memoir and write additional books.   And yet, I can't help but mourn for all the lost years. For the decades I spent thinking I just wasn't trying hard enough, that I was lazy and unmotivated.For all the time I spent thinking there was something wrong with me.For the books I might've written by now.For my shitty self-esteem.For all the stress that chronic overwhelm unleashed upon my body.For all those years I believed I wasn't trying hard enough. Wasn't ambitious enough. For all the conversations about my vaporous potential that should've instead been about dopamine receptors and executive function coaching.It hurts, and I'm healing. I'm learning to reframe my inner voice: It wasn't your fault. We're learning. Better late than never.I sometimes think about that younger version of me - the one toppled by puberty, the one who believed the story that she just wasn't trying hard enough. That she'd somehow wandered from brilliant to broken.With time, with treatment, I'm learning to see that girl who has become this woman as she was and is - gifted and challenged. Stumbling and starlit. One hand grasping grief, the other glossed in gratitude.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/1*w7dkVwKViu0-VbCopmfW7A.jpeg,https://lynnlshattuck.medium.com/im-a-lost-girl-of-adhd-this-was-my-inner-voice-7c0822e5ba86,mental-health,2fd5287da3c5f04fd424bae57fd27788b649fb50bce1f30cd73e04c3
Struggles of Making Games from a Game Design Perspective,"Working as a Game Development & Game Design teacher for over 5 years so far, I have the opportunity to oversee and guide a high number of beginner game designers in their initial efforts. Most recently, as part of my job as a lecturer at Saxion University of Applied Sciences, I am responsible for supervising the concept and development of almost 100 students' games per year.This experience allowed me to identify recurrent pitfalls and difficulties beginner game designers have. However, although repetitive, I hardly observe any of those issues cited in texts and pieces about Game Development, which is odd: there is plenty of great literature out there with good advice on problems (beginner) game designers face.Upon a more dedicated analysis, I figured that it seems that most of the articles on this theme tend to be more about Game Development than Game Design. For Game Development, we can understand the entire process of developing a game, from coding to drawing. In contrast, Game Design is related to ""how do you play the game.""Although the distinction between the two terms is far from scientific, it helps us divide the concerns and good practices in distinct aspects. Choosing the technology, deciding on planning methodologies, or adopting a visual style are Game Development concerns, but not directly Game Design concerns.This article, on the other hand, analyzes the common and repetitive problems while making games from a Game Design perspective. However, instead of simply enumerating them, this article presents them in the form of simple questions that can help you identify these problems.Still, due to their Game Design nature, these problems are inherently creative. For that, there are no perfect rules or strategies to overcome them. On the other hand, after being identified, it is only a matter of time, effort, and, obviously, creativity to succeed.Without further ado, let us then dive into the Struggles of Making Games from a Game Design Perspective.Curiously, most of the teams starting to design games stumble and stutter while answering this question. Since we are used to consuming games as a whole and not as a collection of mechanics, we also tend to start the creative process at a higher level of abstraction, ignoring simple directives such as how the game is played or which mechanics it has.More specifically, this question is either consciously or subconsciously ignored for many reasons, but three of them stand out the most, which are:The most straightforward approach for all three reasons is to start small: select ONE simple game mechanic and start from it. The game is going to be played by repeating this very mechanic until a specific goal is achieved. Doing so should ease the technical burden and allow for the game design process to really start.All of these reasons are rotted in the same cause: anxiety over making wrong choices. While the 1st and 2nd reasons delay the decision making by producing more, usually hasty and uneducated, decisions, the 3rd one simply stops the entire process in fear of ending up with a bad result. But do not panic! The game development and design process can and should always be adjusted according to the test and results. Wrong decisions can be reverted as soon as they are spotted.If the answer is not apparent, you might be in one of the three situations described above, then decide on the most straightforward step you can take and move on. In most cases, you need to define an easy to implement mechanic.If the mechanic turns out to not match your game's visual style or any other creative aspect, change it (or the other elements). A creative process, such as Game Design, hardly succeeds entirely on the first try. Bad decisions will happen, then make them already and proceed.The main issue with this problem is not necessarily answering it but responding to it from a Game Design perspective. Often, game designers confuse this question as a Narrative Question: how does the story end. However, the story's finale does not answer how do you win the game.To be more precise, most designers think of this as the story's resolution or envisioning the game world's end state. For example, that the evil antagonist is defeated or that world peace is achieved. From a game design perspective, and following the answer of Problem 1, none of these examples are connected to the game design or its mechanics.Winning the game must be achieved by using the game mechanics. Thus, the answer to this question must be stated in terms of the game mechanic. If the evil antagonist must be defeated, the mechanic must enable this victory. For example, if the mechanic is shooting arrows, then we can establish that:Notice that the example has a specific amount of arrows. This is important because it allows the overview of a complete prototype: a prototype that can be played until the end condition. Only after achieving a complete prototype stage, the game can be truly tested. Surely, this amount can be changed later for progression or balancing matters, but you have to start with an actual value.Moreover, this decision is unrelated to the narrative perspective. The example used requires 10 arrows to be shoot at a specific target (the evil antagonist), but the target can be altered to fit whatever other narrative or story device necessary.If the answer is not apparent, you need to review the game mechanic and decide ONE simple goal that can be surely achieved using it. The goal chosen will be the answer to the question.Again, if the goal does not suit the game properly, you need to revisit the mechanic or change the goal. Both are excellent decisions. The game is only done when it is done. Iterating over its elements is part of the process and can surely lead to better results.Arguably, this question does not suit every game, but it is still worth asking during the game development. Understanding how the game elements evolve to match either the player's capacity (also refered to as ""power"") or improved skill leads to a better sense of progression.Another important aspect of this question is that it puts the game's mechanic under scrutiny. Responding to this inquiry, or even just brainstorming its answers, might show that the main mechanic is too simple or limited. When that is the case, the game is either too simple (which can be a good decision), or the game designers will urge to add more mechanics to compensate for it (which can be good, but design-wise hard to achieve).Moreover, deciding on the existence or lack of progression in terms of difficulty must be a conscient decision, instead of a collateral effect from the game mechanics. Thus, answering this question must not only establish this point but raise awareness of its consequences.If you do not have an immediate answer to this question, first analyze its consequences and the effort involved. Focus on the current game mechanics and how they enable different forms of progression.Additionally, ""difficulty"" can arise from interactions outside the game, such as having other human players involved. Having different skilled players or even being aware of how more seasoned players must use the rules differently can create complexity/difficulty on its own.Another common issue with beginner game designers and their games is a lack of clear division between random elements and strategy. A random element, such as rolling a dice, is unpredictable and expands on the game possibilities since the players cannot completely predict their actions. On the other hand, the strategy is the exact opposite: when the player makes decisions based on their predicted outcome - usually, how that can help them win the game (remember Problem 2?).What usually happens in Game Designing's early stages is sticking too much to one of the extremes, either randomness or pure strategy. Even though the game mechanics are being thought of as decisions with both predictable and unpredictable results, in practice, they either play as completely random (chaotic) or completely deterministic (boring).The easiest way to spot both extremes is playtesting the complete prototype and identifying one of the following scenarios:Surely other reasons can cause these scenarios, such as problematic balancing or unrealistic goals. Still, the players' behavior is usually pretty clear when they struggle against chaos or breezing through an anticipated (and boring) strategy.Consider how the player's options impact the game: are they too sensitive to random outcomes or easy to foresee? If the answer is hard to grasp by just brainstorming, then do more playtesting and analyze how the players behave.Even in games with limited options and a small set of mechanics, the player should make meaningful changes to the game state. On the contrary, the game is more of an interactive experience than a proper game. Not that the former is a bad medium, but it might not be your end goal.This is certainly the harshest question, but probably the most important one. Regardless of all its other qualities, games are likely to succeed mostly on their fun factor above all else. However, making fun games is a big challenge.This question is not meant to be answered upfront. Most games need a good amount of playtesting and iterations until their mechanics and elements are solid enough to trigger players' emotional reactions.Yet, the game designer must continuously ask this question during the process. Fun can be spotted in very odd places that were not initially thought of. The popular phrase ""it is not a bug, it is a feature"" reinforces this idea: for many games, elements that were not part of the initial design and were later responsible for making the experience fun for the players.Space Invaders is a famous example of this case. Its difficulty progression, i.e., the aliens' ship velocity increasing as fewer enemies were on the screen, was actually a side-effect caused by the hardware not being powerful enough to render so many sprites at once. It was not intentional but became a game's trademark element.Continuously ask this question while developing and testing the game, but do not let it shudder your efforts or demotivate you. Finding fun is hard, and it takes iterations and iterations until a solid base is created.Besides, people with different tastes, backgrounds, and skill-level will react differently to your game. You might not be able to appease everyone, but there might be a group of people that might really enjoy it. Furthermore, do not forget to have fun yourself with your game and while making it.Yet, it is possible that some games might not find their target audience or even be considered fun, and that is fine. Making a game is a reward on its own, and you can always move towards the next project. Lessons were learned anyway.Moreover, once you manage to find the elements of fun, focus your effort on maximizing them. Use the game mechanics, economy, narrative, and aesthetics to strengthen the game.Making games is a thrilling experience, and it is easy to get passionate about it. As our ideas and concepts become alive in a virtual (or physical) environment, and the game gears begin to grind, moving the mechanics and elements into play, it is hard to ignore the sense of happiness and satisfaction. It is not a surprise that more and more people nowadays are moving towards making their own games and experiences.As there is plenty of good material available online for beginners, this article proposed a different look at the process of making game, based on my experience with beginner game designers and their initial efforts. More precisely, we stated 5 questions that help steer the development process on game design lens:Answering these questions must help you to build a consistent and solid game base. Even if some sound obvious, they are surely overlooked or answered using a different perspective - usually from a narrative point of view. Game designing is not about how the story unfolds; it is how the player acts using the game mechanics to allow the story to unwind.Although helpful, these questions are surely not enough to make a good game. In fact, and as stated before, there are no perfect strategies for achieving such a feat. Moreover, what does define a good game? And how generic can you go to please everyone until you please no one?Alternatively, achieving a solid game base can help you define your own understanding of good, as well as establishing (and finding) the ones that will be pleased by it. Making a game should be this blend between creating entertainment and art - not a recipe. It is about triggering fun, not necessarily success. Yet, do not forget that making a game is certainly a victory, and you should be proud of it, regardless of the game's outcome.Thanks for reading :) And if you want to know more about me and my work, you can join me here.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*m7opUC2574_Wga_6Jq0S2Q.png,https://medium.com/super-jump/struggles-of-making-games-from-a-game-design-perspective-173eb1aaf74e,gaming,2ff4ae0627818972b537f79833b00dae3eb0e8bca93ac01bf7c3c1b3
Water Is Being Traded on the Stock Market for the First Time,"This is The Color of Climate, a weekly column from Future Human exploring how climate change and other environmental issues uniquely impact the future of communities of color.In 2016, California experienced one of the worst droughts in the history of the state. Over 100 million trees died and billions of dollars in agriculture were lost. Farmers across the state were stuck between a rock and dry place: They needed more water for their crops, but the price of water was higher and more uncertain because of the drought.Now, despite a powerful recent winter storm that brought rain and snow to California, the state is once again experiencing some form of drought. This is a recurring and growing problem for local farmers, especially in Southern California, as the historically dry state becomes even drier as a result of climate change. And in December 2020, to address the dire need for water, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange recently made a historical move: For the first time, it allowed investors to trade water as a commodity on the stock market. Some say trading water as a commodity will partially help improve California's water crisis, but others are highly skeptical of the move.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange partnered with two companies - WestWater Research, a consulting firm that generates the pricing data used for the market, and Nasdaq - to make this possible. These companies say the move will help farmers and water districts in Southern California have more price certainty during dry periods and could help mitigate the state's water scarcity problem.California previously divided its water supply through ""water rights."" Whoever holds the rights to the water in a certain location can pump it from the state's ground and reservoirs. Districts with surplus water supply can sell their water rights to other districts in need. The problem is that during dry years, water is more expensive for the farmers who need it the most, and there is uncertainty in terms of the supply of water in the state at any given time (and how much it will cost) because of how dry the state gets.The creators of the new exchange hope that it will bring more price transparency to the state's water market by creating price points in the future that investors can bet on.Now, with the new exchange, districts that are paying for extra water in a dry year can bet on futures contracts - agreements between buyers and sellers to trade something at a predetermined price and at a specific time - to offset the price of water rights in the future.""We're bringing first and foremost more marketing information or price transparency into the market that alone should help drive a lot of efficiency around how people make decisions about how much water they need, or how much water they may make available for others to use,"" Clay Landry, managing director at WestWater Research, tells Future Human.The futures contracts will help Californians ""manage the financial risk of droughts,"" wrote Ellen Hanak, an economist and director of the Public Policy Institute of California's Water Policy Center, in a guest commentary for the Sacramento-based nonprofit newsroom CalMatters.""By compensating those with long-standing water rights for moving water to activities and places where the lack of water will be more costly, trading encourages partnerships and cooperation in the sustainable management of this vital resource,"" she wrote.Others have mixed feelings about the exchange. Peter Gleick, president emeritus of the Pacific Institute, a water research institute based in Oakland, California, tells Future Human he's ""concerned"" about the possibility of investors betting on the scarcity of water in an already dry state.""This isn't going to solve any water problems. This isn't going to produce more water,"" Gleick says. ""It's a financial tool to hedge changes in the price of water, which might provide a little bit of an economic benefit to certain well-water users.""Basav Sen, climate justice project director at the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank, told Earther that he was ""horrified"" when he first read about the exchange.""What this represents is a cynical attempt at setting up what's almost like a betting casino so some people can make money from others suffering,"" Sen told Earther.Landry, however, says that a ""people versus the market"" narrative is false. ""I don't think anyone wants people in our society to go without water,"" he says.In her guest commentary for CalMatters, Hanak acknowledged and addressed the fear that many Californians have about the new exchange but said investor involvement in the state's water market won't change the amount of water that's available in California or its price. ""Crucially,"" she wrote, ""the futures market won't disrupt protections already in place to ensure actual water trades are done responsibly.""Although there is a lot of disagreement about the potential benefits and perils of the exchange, there is agreement that the immediate impact of it will be small. On the day Landry spoke to Future Human, he said there had been seven trades on the exchange, and that it hasn't been very active since its inception. Still, with California looking like it's headed for another drought, it should be interesting to see how activity on the exchange picks up.California isn't the only state experiencing water scarcity that could end up trying this strategy to help with the issue. Landry says WestWater is looking at areas with ""similar geographies"" to California, like Arizona, Colorado, and Washington, to set up potential exchanges in the future.The fear of commoditizing water has been covered for decades now in documentaries, by environmental justice activists, and even through films like Mad Max. As Landry tells Future Human, It's a ""messy and complicated situation"" about a resource that everyone needs, which warrants innovations like water futures. But we should keep an eye on this going forward to make sure investors aren't taking advantage of the system.",https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*wkTQ0jDwE7dRgeJq6ltOLg.jpeg,https://futurehuman.medium.com/water-is-being-traded-on-the-stock-market-for-the-first-time-55c02bb616ed,economy,3aeae8f6df285f527a0312144c60761d56bebfcb5687f0a4dfca0728
Actions That Tell If Your Boss Has Your Best Interests At Heart,"A few years ago, a close friend of mine and I applied for a managerial job. We were successful through two rounds of interviews and had one final interview with the EVP. Ironically, I knew the hiring manager, having worked with her at my current job at the time. She left that job due to personality clashes and leadership concerns.Over a drink with my friend, I told her that I suspected I wouldn't get the job, mainly due to my knowledge of the manager's tenure at my job. She could see me as a direct threat to her role. She was just going through the motions. As suspected - and theory later confirmed - my friend got the job instead.My friend started the job and reported directly to my old co-worker. Needless to say, their working relationship became a tumultuous one. There were constant clashes, gaslighting, and micro-aggressions. Eventually, a new EVP started in the company. The EVP observed that the manager did not have her team's best interest at heart. She was promptly removed.Unfortunately, there are many leaders and bosses in positions solely for their own benefit. If someone comes along to threaten their position of authority, they will do things to keep that person in their place. It's not about the team's growth and development but about maintaining the status quo. They must be the big dog on campus. There's nothing wrong with feeling in control, but you must be able to grow and support the others that keep you there. You must have their best professional interests at heart - as much as, if not more - than you have your own.It's easy to identify if your boss has your wellbeing and development at heart and doesn't see you as a threat. And if you are a leader, these are the things you should be doing to position your team and yourself for success. Remember, if they succeed, you succeed. It's not the other way around. Do you see any of these qualities in your boss?A leader's role is to give others the tools and support to do their jobs. Then they must step back and let them work. If your boss is not doing everything they can to give you what you need - or if they aren't asking you what you need - they're not getting the best out of their team. It may not be intentional, but it can show that you aren't top of mind. If you're not getting the support or resources you need to shine, let your boss know ASAP.Managers believe in the hive mind. They know that they do not have all the answers, and you, who are normally closer to the action, might have a unique perspective. Your ideas aren't a threat to their role but instrumental to the growth of all. Observe if your ideas are getting shut down repeatedly.Nothing's worse than a boss who takes all the credit when he did not do the physical work. Yes, he would have managed, organized, and coach, but the team must execute. Bill Belichick won't be the GOAT coach without Tom Brady (as we clearly see now). Your manager should not hesitate to put his team up on a pedestal.The opposite goes when the team does poorly. Your boss should take most of the blame.I once had a boss who would always say in meetings he's 'not falling on a sword for anyone.'At first, we'd use it as a kick up the ass. Although he was nice, it started to feel that he did not have our backs when things went wrong, regardless of our fault.If you've been continually blamed by your boss, publicly and privately, they aren't trying to help you be better.One of my old managers would constantly push me to be part of challenging projects, way out of my comfort zone. I feel it's helped me to this day with my research and analytical skills. When you're being challenged, especially in a place you enjoy, you rise to the occasion more often than not. Managers and bosses help to expand the thinking of those in their charge.I once got an opportunity to move to another team that I did not want. I took it anyway. Why? One of my best team members was trying to break through for some time without success. Me sticking around just because meant I was potentially blocking her progress. She took my job and has been successful ever since.Your boss should be training you or your team to one day replace her. They won't limit your information or growth just so that they can stay comfortable. Some bosses can also block you from moving away from them because you are valuable to them or the team. If you're not getting recommendations or approvals to apply for other roles, it's a problem.Today's worker is looking for projects and work that challenge them, encourage their creativity, and help them progress in their personal and professional lives. The only way this could happen is if there is a boss who can nurture these goals and challenge their team without feeling threatened. If you have your team's best interest at heart, performance improves, morale spikes, you have less turnover, and you'll have guaranteed success.Let's connect! I'll send you actionable insights on Leadership, Growth, and, Personal Development.",,https://medium.com/lead-better-live-better/actions-that-tell-if-your-boss-has-your-best-interests-at-heart-c6a4533958e7,leadership,3b16e80f9419d0a30adc678e38cbe06c78f8c2f4ae0b50cff00bde4a
6 Weird Facts About AI & Robots,"What was nothing more than science fiction yesterday quickly becomes today's reality. With 77% of the devices, we use every day have one or another form of AI, Artificial Intelligence is clearly not a futuristic concept anymore. Over the last two decades, the number of AI startups grew 14 times and the investment in AI startups grew 6 times.With such a rise in the interest and continuous developments of AI have brought the industry to an absolutely new level. According to TechJury (2020), AI will cause the growth of the global GDP by $15.7 trillion by 2030.With such significant growth in the developments and industry investments, AI and Robotics industry now have more and more innovations. Here is the list of the top 6 of the weirdest facts around AI and Robotics.Yes. You did not read it wrong. For instance, in 2017 Saudi Arabia was the first nation that granted citizenship to a humanoid robot - Sophia. Here is a very interesting interview with Sophia:Firstly suggested in South Korea In 2017, robot tax is still of the most debatable subjects in the technology industry. Some people say that 'taxing robots is as intelligent as taxing a software', others claim that there should be clearer regulation of robots and AI.Wall Street Journal (2020) suggested an interesting example that illustrates the idea behind putting taxation commitment (regulation) on robots:Bill Gates argue that robot tax could slow down ""the speed of automation"" allowing society to cope and adapt to the new reality. Apart from this argument, robot taxes can help prevent tax loopholes and create new jobs in green energy, healthcare and education.On another hand, there is an interesting and thought-provoking notion that argues against robot taxes. These points are not focused on the benefits of robots tax, but rather on the definition side. For instance:What seems to be easy at the first sight is actually deeper and harder than you think. The definition of a robot is very broad. It can cover almost all technology with automation elements like a vending machine or a tractor.There is a certain gap in understanding what kind of robots should be taxed and what kind of automated jobs are we talking about.Apart from the definition challenge, there is also an opinion that robot tax might damage the innovation spirit. Some people claim that this additional tax might cause many companies to reduce their willingness to invest in the newest tech.No, I'm not talking about Pinterest personalized feed or eBay visual-based shopping. This is about an actual mind reading. Robotics specialists developed a new technique that can scan your brain with an FMRI scanner or an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap and create a real image of your thoughts. This AI system will compose an image it got from your brain and compare it to other pictures that it will receive from volunteers.Above is only one methodology that is designed to recreate the images people's brain is getting on the computer. Another technique to read mind was designed to not only read the thoughts of people but also to convert them into sentences with the use of brain signal-reading electrodes and Machine Learning.Imagine that in as soon as in 5 years, pet-bots will be one of the most popular trends. Pet-bots are just like the real pets but without need for 5 am morning walks and non-stop vacuuming. Despite acting just like the real animals, they don't need to be fed, cleaned, checked at the vets, walked, etc. Some robotic pets are covered with sensors, which identify when they are being touched and behave accordingly. Some of them even recognize voice commands and respond to them.Would you ever consider a dog-bot instead of a real one? Write your thoughts in the comments and let's discuss! 'According to Creative Strategies, 97% of mobile users are already using AI-powered voice assistants with 40% of people using the voice search function at a minimum of once per day. Their study also is divided into brands: only 2% of iPhone owners have never used Siri and 4% of Android users have never tried OK Google.Apart from this study, the statistics from TechJury (2020) predict that AI-powered voice assistants will reach 8 billion by 2023. But imagine, that from these 8 billion voice assistants, most AI is female. Think about it: Siri, Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant or even listen to the AI-powered voice assistant of your health centre- most likely it will be female as well. Reason?According to studies, both males and females are more attracted to a woman's voice.However, when you ask Siri a question:'Siri, are you female or male?'she will reply: 'I don't have a gender'.'Siri, why do you have a female voice?'she will reply: 'Unfortunately, this is the only voice that I have at the moment'.For years, the companies who designed these voice assistant have been heavily criticized for using female names and voices, as it raises an issue with the gender bias in technology.The example of automated journalism can be seen of what the Washington Post has done during the Rio Olympics in 2016.The Washington Post wanted AI to report the key happenings during this event in 2016. The name of their AI writer was Heliograf and it was created to generate updates to the readers. Based on the data from different sources, Heliograf was able to create new data and customize it according to user requests. In total this tool has made more than 850 stories.Here is a sports article that was written by Heliograf:Even though many of these facts might seem futuristic at some point, they are not only real but also in the forthcoming years, it will become a new norm.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8000/0*6tIIa-c1OE7fmJ3m,https://medium.com/illumination/6-weird-facts-about-ai-robots-4d7408f850bb,artificial-intelligence,3bc391b622020af376352f0e098d1ac92eb5d13c5023673431d05dc9
GRIS: how a video game can improve your mental wellbeing,"Some spoilers ahead.Whether you're an expert or a 'noob', you've got to admit that today's video games are not just a way to escape or to unload your stress. They encompass such a rich, immersive experience that they have a deeper, long-lasting effect on our lives. There is a very simple reason for that. As a friend recently pointed out to me, how many hours do you spend with a video game protagonist, compared to a movie? A hundred?It's a sector that changes so fast that some games help you with your own struggles and perhaps, to find a new way to look at your life. I happen to have stumbled upon one of them: it's called GRIS, and it is magnificent. In today's difficult climate, here is how and why a video game can have such an impact on your mental state.Video games narratives are getting more and more complex and cinematographic, with POV shots, 360 camera, or complex character development. One thing is for sure: in a video game, you're the one ""in control"", you're actively moving the protagonist forward - something completely opposite to cinema, in which all you can do is watch it happen. Interestingly, the film industry is starting to blur the codes by adding some elements of the video games - try Black Mirror's Bandersnatch, for example, an interactive episode where the player has to make a series of (more and more horrible) choices. The true novelty of GRIS, besides its beautiful 2 dimensions watercolour visuals, is elsewhere.In GRIS, you cannot get hurt, die, there is no true ""villain"", and you don't have to fight - at least, not in the traditional sense. You're safe, all you have to do is explore and use your character capabilities to solve puzzles and find solutions. This immerses the player into a bubble. Instantly, by playing this game, you can take some distance and experience a more reflective, contemplative state.The story of GRIS can be interpreted in many ways and acts as a ""canvas"" for the player who can project his/her own story onto the game. The pitch is simple: after a traumatic event, the main protagonist, a young woman, has lost her voice. She wakes up in the hand of a giant statue, which crumbles and leaves her to the ground.As you play the character of GRIS, you can only see the world in black and white in the beginning. As you start the game, you only have one capability: moving forward (and not very fast.) Many reviews expressed that GRIS is simply a story about overcoming grief and facing the different stages that go with it.Indeed, as the game progresses, many symbolic moments mark a change of attitude. The character evolves, simply by moving forward. One big feature in the game is that the more you advance, the more you unlock new colours. The world becomes red, then green, blue, symbolizing different stages the character goes through. As this unfolds, you gain new capabilities while collecting stars that unlock different paths. First, you can turn the character's dress into a block and be invulnerable to the wind that was pushing you back, but you can also use it to break through stone floors. Then, you can jump higher, run, swim... All of these faculties help solve problems or unlock new levels in the game in some creative way.Some creatures along the way seem antagonistic, like a giant screaming bird pushing you forward (which I have personally identified with anger). Yes, this bird can make you trip or block you. But its strength can also propel you to higher levels if you use it properly. The use of symbols courses throughout the game and allows you to reflect on the story or your own life through visuals, music, and experience. Yet words, dialogue, or text are absent - making you feel and think through powerful visual symbolism.Many lessons or insights can be taken from ""GRIS"". Even if you just admire its beauty, the symbolism is so rich that it's impossible not to reflect on how we recover from hardships and traumas, and to draw parallels between the character and us.Here are some of the takeaways I've noticed by playing the game :Overall, GRIS is an experience that makes you think about your own trials and tribulations. You get to both wander in a safe environment, when no one is attacking or hurting you, and enjoy the beauty of it. At the same time, you can reflect on your own growth and set-backs. What makes it unique is the combination of stunning beauty, with an odyssey into the heart of a wounded soul. Yes, it's not therapy. But this journey feels so therapeutic.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2792/1*iGF0RUAWRHurqGifX-azMw.png,https://baudouin-noemie.medium.com/gris-how-a-video-game-can-improve-your-mental-wellbeing-bf748a4f5f41,gaming,3bda17d9b52436d87dbeaac3e66a0b2a6d2a5b3390b7b9fd53861330
How I became a Data Scientist at 21,"In this article, I will take you through my journey into data science and provide some of the most important takeaways from my experience. As a disclaimer, I am not a seasoned data scientist by any means, and everything expressed in this article is merely my own experience/opinion.During high school I was drawn to both the medical field and engineering. In general, I enjoyed math and science and figured both career paths would provide an exciting and fulfilling career. For the first half of high school, however, I was a slightly lazy student and I never devoted enough time to studying. I dilly-dallied through my freshman and sophomore years without the slightest doubt in my competency for engineering or medicine. This state of mind quickly caught up to me.I finally decided to ""test"" my aptitude for engineering by enrolling in AP physics my junior year - a subject that, as many know, is not for the faint of heart. Not surprisingly, it only took two weeks before I dropped out of the class due to what I thought was its relentless difficultly (I still find physics extremely difficult today and have a great deal of respect for physics majors). My hopes of becoming an engineer were crushed as I knew physics was fundamental to almost all fields of engineering. This was the first time I'd ever felt incompetent and incapable of pursuing a dream.I spent the remainder of high school intimidated by math and any science that utilized it heavily. As a result, I chose to take statistics instead of calculus my senior year because I knew statistics wouldn't be as difficult. Thankfully, my cowardice would eventually yield a very fruitful blessing - a peak into the world of data science.After the first week of statistics, I'd fallen in love with the subject. I found it to be very intuitive, understood its relevance, and performed better in statistics than I had in any other class. The formulas presented were easy to grasp (of course I wasn't aware that statistics is deeply rooted in calculus and other more advanced fields of math), and I began to regain my academic confidence (thank you Mr. Davenport).When it came time to pick a college major and think about career choices, I researched jobs that required backgrounds in statistics; I quickly stumbled upon this famous article:I couldn't believe that this was actually a career - even more so a career that was in high demand. After reading that article and a few others, I was totally convinced that I wanted to become as data scientist. Unfortunately, it didn't take long for me to discover that data science required an extensive math background - a background that I did not have and was too scared to pursue. To make matters worse, I learned that most data science positions required a graduate degree in a technical field, and I wasn't even sure I was capable of earning a bachelors at that point. Although my hopes of becoming a data scientist were fading away, I could never seem to get the career out of my head as I pursued other options.Regardless of my severe lack of confidence, I still tried my luck and applied for a few engineering majors. I was denied from all of them (shockingly) and was told in many of my denial letters that I ""lacked experience"" in math and computer science - a proposition that I could not dispute.I ultimately decided to start my freshman year of college as a finance major. I didn't truly want to work in finance, but I figured it would provide a stable career that implemented statistics to a certain degree.Although I was shying away from data science and technical fields in general (due in part to the many rejection letters I was receiving), I decided that I was not going to allow myself to be intimidated by math any longer. I wasn't going to settle with my ""lack of experience"".I devoted the entire summer after high school to learning calculus online and fell more in love with the subject than I did with statistics. The fact that almost all physical systems could be described in the language of calculus was mind boggling - I couldn't believe that I'd waited so long to learn this.I spent so much time studying that I was able to test out of calculus 1 and 2 before freshman year started. My love for math was reborn and, most importantly, I overcame the first obstacle necessary to get into data science.""All the world's a differential equation, and the men and women are merely variables."" ― Ben OrlinDuring my first semester as a finance student, I was unsatisfied. I had gained some confidence from testing out of calculus and I knew that I was capable of studying something more rigorous and enjoyable. My dream of becoming a data scientist persisted, but I was still convinced that this was an infeasible option. I knew I had to switch majors to something I enjoyed.I was still afraid of math but knew I needed to study something pretty close to it. At the same time, I found finance interesting and didn't want to waste the courses I'd taken. As a compromise, I decided to change my major to actuarial science because this seemed to offer a nice mix of math and finance (not too much of either).The next two semesters were filled with finance, math, and computer science courses - of which I enjoyed the math courses the most. I was fascinated by calculus, linear algebra and differential equations, and my grades were constantly improving. On the other hand, I was struggling to find motivation to study for actuarial exams and was not really enjoying the finance courses.During the fall of my sophomore year, I began to pursue actuarial internships aggressively. Internships were being posted nearly every day on my schools Handshake, and I was submitting applications to every single one (a technique I like to call ""rage applying""). I'd also built up enough confidence to apply to the few data science/analytics internships that popped up every once in a while. The majority of my efforts were unsuccessful as nearly every application was turned down or ignored.Finally, after 100 hopeless applications, I was finally granted an interview with a well-known insurance company. It was for an entry level actuarial position and I was determined to be the best interviewee they had ever seen. My plan was to do a data analysis project using the famous health insurance data set:I used R, which I had just begun learning via YouTube, to create a regression model that predicted the total medical charges an individual would incur given their various demographic and health characteristics. I then created visualizations and summaries of the model results and packaged everything up into a report. I should point out that I knew very little about data analysis or machine learning at the time; all of the concepts included in my report were picked up on the fly during the days leading up to the interview. Regardless, I felt confident that this report would set me apart from the other candidates. I hoped that my efforts would compensate for the fact that I hadn't taken any actuarial exams.Now, anyone with an actuarial background should not be surprised to know that the interview was a complete disaster. The interviewer couldn't care less about the report I presented to him and virtually had nothing to say to me once he discovered I hadn't taken any exams. Towards the end of the interview, he asked if I had any questions for him. The first question that came to mind was, ""How do you use math in your work?"". He scoffed at me subtly and replied ""Well, we aren't calculating any integrals if that's what you mean"". Annoyed by his condescendence I asked, ""So what do you do on a daily basis?"". He proceeded to describe his day-to-day as I slowly stopped paying attention, knowing that I had no chance at landing this internship. I could tell this man was not passionate about his work, so I wasn't disappointed about how poorly the interview went.This failure of an interview, while embarrassing, brought about a huge realization: I loved preparing for it. I didn't care that my machine learning report was completely disregarded because I enjoyed the entire process of creating it. It was my first experience with data science, and I knew I was completely hooked. I had to become a data scientist.The following semester, I got over my fear of math and decided to make it my major. Math majors at my university are required to pick between applied math, pure math and statistics as a specialization. Of course, I chose statistics as my specialization and focused my course-load around data science applications. I continued to fall in love with math, statistics, and computer science and I often found myself studying these subjects in my free time.One of the most pivotal moments in my journey to becoming a data scientist was entering and placing in a few competitions along with a team from my school. One of the competitions we participated in was the American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest:In this competition, we used random forests to classify how long it would take a rugby player to recover after a training session. We placed 2nd and were awarded ""Best Visualization"" for a set diagnostic plots that described our models results. This was my first experience working with real life, large and messy datasets - an experience that proved to be invaluable as it led to my first internship.Internships were, without a doubt, the primary reason I was able to land a data science job at 21. This did not occur without trail, of course. As many know, the process of getting an internship, let alone an interview, can be a grueling one. This was very much the case for me.The end of my sophomore year was approaching, and I had already applied to hundreds of internships with no success. By the time the end of March arrived, I figured I was likely all out of luck. I began gearing up to spend the summer working at a restaurant and continuing classes. One night while scrolling through internships on my phone, I saw a title that caught my eye: ""Data Analyst Intern - Chief Oil and Gas"". The description looked perfect for my skill set at the time, but the application had been open for months so I knew I was unlikely to be considered. Despite this, I decided this would be the last internship I applied to and submitted my application.I received a call the next morning: I was the very last applicant they were going to grant an interview. I couldn't believe it. Of the over 200 applicants, they selected 8 to interview and I was the very last one. This was the biggest professional opportunity I'd ever been given, and I knew it. My persistent rage applying had one more chance of paying off.""The one who falls and gets up is stronger than the one who never tried. Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying.""― Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the HeartMy initial impression of the interview was that it went horribly. I was asked a lot of questions about the oil and gas industry, of which I knew nothing about, and I even confused the great singer-songwriter Phillip Phillips for the energy company Phillips 66. Needless to say, I thought the interview was more of an embarrassment than my first. The interviewers thought differently. After the interview they told me I'd receive a call within a week if they wanted to move forward. I had no expectations.Shockingly, my phone rang later that day. They had already made their decision, and they offered me the internship. I knew I wasn't being offered the internship because I was most technically qualified (I definitely wasn't), but because I was able to communicate most effectively. I was ecstatic, nonetheless.My time spent at Chief was invaluable. Not only did I received hands-on experience implementing data science practices with real world data, but I also gained a deeper understanding of how to bridge the gap between writing code and delivering value. Most importantly, this internship laid the foundation for the rest of my data science career. It allowed me to land my next internship with an oil and gas consulting firm, and it eventually led to my final internship at my current company.I don't have many regrets in my path to becoming a data scientist as I strongly believe that everything unfolded in a necessary manner. However, if I had to do it again, I would have started studying math and computer science at a much younger age. In particular, I wouldn't have avoided calculus in high school, and I would have started off college as a math major.Below, I've listed some key takeaways that I believe are important for a successful data science career.Thank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed learning about my very novel journey into data science and that you found this article insightful.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8064/1*T9aetuJ0zcrOXMHIrepImA.jpeg,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-became-a-data-scientist-at-21-2afb99e5254e,education,3c9ed78c8072be9eb86a22c40216609af55c29d7ada11bf99ce95b12
A vision that starts with a bridge: Introducing Hypermedia Multi-agent Systems,"Imagine this: A worldwide hypermedia fabric stretched across interconnected physical and digital things, where people and autonomous software agents coexist and interact with one another.As humans and machines (so-called 'agents') observe, reason about and act on these physical and digital things via physical, digital or holographic interfaces, they can create high-level services by mashing-up what they find in their environment -orchestrating the affair in a flexible, open, and scalable Web (of Things).The system is undergirded by the World Wide Web, which users can navigate with the ease it takes to input a query into a Google search engine. It brings value to a breadth of domains and improves the way humans work, live, learn and play. Users can operate intuitive systems in which a multitude of interconnected devices tick along and take up very little of their attention.Fields such as manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture and logistics stand to benefit from this increasingly autonomous technology. But its impact stretches even further -it could help users more astutely navigate the social web, for example, warning them of misinformation and emotional contagion as and when it arises.This is the futuristic vision outlined in a paper produced in 2018 by a team of researchers at the University of St.Gallen that includes computer scientist Dr. Simon Mayer, which describes how creating a bridge between research in Web-based multiagent systems will help create a world in which work that is arduous, dull or dangerous is performed entirely by machines.""We want to combine technologies from the Web architecture field with a domain called multiagent systems,"" he says. ""The problem is that these fields have operated for the last 15 to 20 years without talking too much to one another,"" he adds.""This means that the advancement we have seen in Web architecture has not precipitated in the field of multiagent systems, and vice versa.""Designing the future human-machine collaborationThe energetic and engaging Dr. Mayer serves as Chair of Interaction and Computer-based systems at Switzerland's University of St.Gallen, one of IntellIoT's thirteen partners.St.Gallen's chapter will coordinate tasks around Hypermedia Multi-agent Systems (HyperMAS)- while also supporting human-machine collaboration across the three use cases: healthcare, manufacturing, and agriculture.The department, and Dr. Mayer, were excited to jump onboard the IntellIoT mission to enable IoT technologies that will power the future of these use cases, not least because its goals chimed those of Dr. Mayer's research group.""We are now investigating interactions between many machines, and between machines and humans,"" he tells Next Generation IoT, explaining the group's motivation for joining and contributing to IntellIoT.This fostering of intricate 'machine-to-machine' collaboration is a key objective for IntellIoT, as is its 'human-in-the-loop' dimension. That is, the work of creating a system that appeals for human support and direction as and where needed, and which learns from that process.""Autonomous collaboration of devices is just fascinating,"" says Dr. Mayer. ""And it's terribly hard to do,"" he adds, careful to qualify that statement with the caveat that the challenge lies in orchestrating such collaborations at scale.When many agents work together, a tremendous number of options presents that Dr. Mayer's team believes can be managed with the help of a HyperMAS that coordinates actions within the system. And as such, this work hinges on the creation of this bridge between hypermedia and multiagent system technologies spearheaded by Dr. Mayer's research group at the University of St.Gallen.""This is what drives me personally,"" Dr. Mayer says. ""How can one device broadcast its capabilities in a way that can be understood by other devices? And how can this device be matched automatically with the requirements of other services? And this extends to humans. Maybe the system knows about their health state, or about their agenda today. And can then infer what they require and make the match.""When Hyper met MASFor the uninitiated, the term 'multiagent system' (MAS) refers to a computerised system made up of multiple interacting agents designed to solve tasks that cannot be completed alone or without an element of autonomy on the part of the agent.The theory behind it stretches back to the fifties, when mathematicians and scientists first started dreaming up visions of how a world powered by 'Artificial Intelligence' might look, explains Dr. Andrei Ciortea, who works alongside Dr. Mayer on the project.Dr. Ciortea describes how, in 1956, academics gathered at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire to discuss ideas around ""thinking machines."" The Dartmouth workshop is largely considered the founding event for artificial intelligence (AI) as a field. The concept and conversation around AI has since then grown far more complex, convoluted by increasingly broad conceptualisations of what counts as AI - especially since the recent popularisation of the term.""Us computer scientists have obviously lost the battle of who creates the definitions around here. And that's the way it is,"" says Dr. Mayer, with a shrug and caveat that he still sees the global prevalence of the subject in public discourse as a blessing for computer science, despite the confusing misuses of the terminology involved.Dr. Mayer adds that while many understand the terminology of Artificial Intelligence to refer to the topic of machine learning, or human-like intelligence simulated by a machine, the roots of the field lie strongly in the work of exploring the opportunities that come from multiagent systems 'that we might call autonomous' -combining technologies together such that the boundaries between research fields blur.""We have seen computer science enter many, many fields, over the last twenty years,"" says Dr. Mayer. ""And through these fields - and because we are using computers to enable increasingly complex behaviors, no individual can anymore explain every aspect of an end user application that is based on these technologies.""This complexity touches on some areas of contention around the rise of these increasingly sophisticated autonomous systems, notes Danai Vachtsevanou, MSc., who is a PhD candidate in Dr. Mayer's team, and explains that there will be queries around the legitimacy when machines are bestowed with capabilities so intricate humans can no longer fathom them.What's more, the greater the number of devices collaborating with one another, the greater the challenge of intelligibility. And, as an increasing number of machines are empowered to autonomously operate in unison and at scale, finding and agreeing upon a shared language among all these devices is proving a difficult exercise to manage.Managing these challenges requires extensive work in making sure there exists sufficient transparency and regulation around such technologies. All the more reason for expansive research projects like IntellIoT, that foster the cross-pollination of ideas and standardisation across an ecosystem championing open-source sharing and utmost transparency.Demonstrators, glorious demonstratorsThrough the course of our interview, Dr. Mayer's passion for the subject at hand takes expression as much in the sprawling diatribes that touch on several interlocking themes, from philosophy and social sciences and economics, to lively deep dives into the more nitty-gritty side of the technology, pulling out smartphones, and other devices to demonstrate his concepts.His enthusiasm very much stretches to the role St.Gallen's research can play in helping transform healthcare, manufacturing and agriculture for the better. Research that will help engineer workplaces where tasks that are boring, tedious and dangerous are performed by robots, and where the human's needs and comforts come first. Or, as Dr. Mayer puts it; ""Machines as tools for humans, not the other way around"".Of the various projects that make IntellIoT's expansive programme, he is very excited about creating three demonstrators for the manufacturing use case. There will, for instance, be collaborative manufacturing lines in which robots can be swapped in and out without affecting the behavior of the overall system. He's especially thrilled about what it will mean to achieve such feats and put them on show.""Such systems have been made on a small scale. Already in the past, my team has been demonstrating such systems for a handful of participating devices. But what we are setting out to do here is supposed to work for a much larger number of devices,"" he says, explaining that accomplishing this means harnessing the power of the Web architecture to create something unprecedented.""This will be a masterpiece. I mean, just think of the demonstration -once we can show that we can have a partially autonomous manufacturing line that can flexibly adjust to changing context and even request human help when required, and then learn from the human so that it won't run into similar trouble in the future. It will be glorious, and it will be an excellent showcase of what we are doing.""The University of St.Gallen boasts a pioneering Masters programme in Computer Science.

13 Things You Can Do Instead of Eating Your Feelings,"Admit it.You eat your feelings.But take comfort in the fact that you're not the only one.The longer the COVID-19 pandemic stretches on and as we enter the holiday season, we get ever closer to entering a perfect storm of emotionally driven binge eating and mindless numbing.Who doesn't want another piece (or maybe the entire half) of leftover pecan pie after you've spent your day jumping between your kids online schooling and your busy Zoom meeting schedule, and you're mentally exhausted?Or you want to soothe away the anxiety of impending deadlines for big projects that you're having a lot of difficulty focusing on with an entire pint of Ben & Jerry's.I could go on with countless examples of how we all go about using food to fill a void, to entertain us, or to simply escape from our current reality.And while this may feel somewhat tongue in cheek (food pun!), the consequences of emotional eating can be far reaching and have serious implications for your mental and physical health.When we push away our feelings and emotions, and try to avoid or numb them by eating we do a few mean things to our brains and bodies.Now this isn't an extensive overview of all the ramifications of emotional eating and why it's bad.It's a gentle wake up call, or reminder, that there's more on the line than adding inches to your waist and pounds to the scale.First off our brains start to associate negative emotions, like anger, sadness, loneliness, or anxiety, as something ""bad"" and requires a stress response. Over time the repeated stress response this triggers creates a neural pathway.Through this neural pathway, a habit loop is formed. In the case of emotional eating, that habit loop looks like:1) Experience negative emotion2) Look for food option to avoid, numb or soothe3) Enjoy fleeting feeling of pleasure from salt, sugar etc. along with mental reprieve from emotional reaction4) Repeat when negative emotion reappearsAside from the habit forming nature of using food to avoid our emotions, we're instructing our brain both consciously and subconsciously that we can't handle our feelings and they must be avoided.We also send strong messages to our bodies when we eat through the natural release of hormones and neurotransmitters that impact blood sugar levels, organ function and thinking processes.If emotional eating becomes something normal you do everyday, you increase your risk of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and a host of other chronic health conditions.But I'm not here to guilt you into changing your lifestyle and habits or scare you from eating a KitKat after your toddler uses finger paint to decorate your walls.What I'm here to do is share 13 alternatives to using food to avoid, numb or mindlessly distract from whatever it is that you're feeling.And these are methods I've tried, and want to share with you...Think of it as a gift from one emotional eater to another.What this looks like for you is going to be location specific - though these days it's likely you're at home - but find something that keeps your hands busy.Think about getting a mindless task like folding laundry out of the way.Engaging in this type of activity will distract you and give you the space you need to regroup.This suggestion works well and complements the idea of keeping your hands busy.I've used crochet, knitting, and collage and art journaling as creative outlets to both distract myself and process my emotions.When you feel like eating an entire bag of chips after a long day, turn to an activity that's fun and easy to pick up on a moment's notice.Taking an nap might be easier said than done, but often emotional eating is used to smooth over what are real needs actually are.A lack of sleep is a well known trigger for overeating, and when combined with hard and heavy emotions, food quickly becomes a welcome friend.Instead, find a quite space to close your eyes for 20 minutes and see how you feel.Right now there's a lot of advice out there that simply says in order to address how you're feeling, take some deep breaths and everything will be fine. While this is true in theory, you need to actively step back and focus on taking deep, belly filling breaths.Dr. Andrew Weil teaches the 4-7-8 breathing technique that I have used for years and find very helpful. Inhale for 4 counts, hold your breath for 7 counts and then breathe out for 8 counts. Repeat for at least 2 minutes.Watch the video for more detailed instructions.Mindfulness may be trendy right now but it's not without good reason. It works.The concept is that you simply observe, without judgment, what's going on in the present moment. This can be things both external and internal in your body.Maybe you notice the beating of your heart, or a bird singing outside. It could also be that you tap into what your body is actually asking for and decide to listen and follow through, instead of grabbing the Doritos.Related: How To Start a Daily Mindfulness PracticeHunger can masquerade as all kinds of feelings, but often its just a call for a change of state.Step back from hunger pangs and ask yourself if you're really just bored and need something to distract you.In my mind there's nothing better than spending 15-20 minutes searching giphy.com for fun memes and videos.Give yourself permission (without guilt) to ""waste some time"" doing something fun and entertaining.Music can help and heal. It can also boost your mood, inspire your confidence, or make you simply feel like a million bucks.Start a new playlist filled with your favourite tunes that you turn to when you're searching for a snack.Maybe its filled with guilty pleasure songs, or cherished favourites that make you feel like a million bucks. Whatever it is - create it and crank the volume.If you made that Spotify playlist this suggestion is even easier to put into action - crank it and dance. If you're at home find a way to move that's fun and comfortable for you - and don't hold back either.Maybe it's pulling out your dance moves from the 90s (Macarena, anyone?), or just shaking your booty along with the beat.The most important thing is that you're moving, which in and of itself has lots of health benefits, but movement also forces your brain to change its state and thought patterns almost instantly. Say goodbye, emotional hunger pangs.As with dancing, taking a walk gets you moving and benefits both your body and brain at the same time. The best part is that you don't have to go outside either.If you're limited in terms of where you can and can't go (say for instance, leave your apartment because of COVID restrictions) start by walking back and forth in your kitchen or den.If you have a home with more space, try pacing in your kitchen or living room. Try taking advantage of the outdoors (if you can) and walk around the block a few times.The physical activity boosts your brain function, benefits your body, and can even help you consolidate and process information at a subconscious level.Plants not only clean the air and provide a splash of mood boosting color and texture to your environment, but their care makes for a great hobby.Pick up a few small plants at your local Home Depot or garden centre (depending on where you live and the time of year the selection will vary), and dedicate time to their care.Easy to care for varieties include snake plants, succulents, Peace Lilies, and pathos.My collection of plants has quickly grown from a simple Peace Lily bought in the middle of an unseasonably cold spring in 2017, to a sprawling indoor garden that I tend to when I'm negotiating between emotional eating and walking away from the kitchen.Though we all spend too much time on our phones already, I like to go through old photos and do a clean up of stuff that's no longer useful or relevant.I'll also spend time organizing my photo albums on my phone, favouriting new snap shots and watching videos from the past.Organizing your photos can distract you from your emotional eating pangs, and at the same time bring up some great feelings of nostalgia.While this suggestion isn't the most fun, it's often when we sit with how we're feeling and identify its root cause that we're able to heal.If you want more than a distraction from your desire to eat a package of Oreos, this is the method for you.Take a deep breath in and out and repeat. Allow whatever it is that you're feeling to rise to the surface and approach it without judgment.Picture yourself as an objective observer whose curious and wants to explore where these feelings in more depth.Related: The Mindful Approach to Cutting Yourself Some SlackMaybe its anger over how a meeting with your boss went, or frustration with your kid's picky eating style.Acknowledge how you feel, while moving away from the pantry. Remove yourself from your kitchen and find a safe comfortable spot to sit and be with your feelings.While you can't take a hot bath or shower when emotional eating cues hit when you're in the middle of Walmart and the Twinkies are calling your name, you can still try a modified version of this suggestion.Head to the closest bathroom and take one minute to wash your hands under warm water.Pay attention to proper hand washing guidelines and distract yourself with the warmth of the water, the feel and smell of the soap, and ensuring that you clean your nails and finger beds well.If you find yourself wanting to eat your feelings at the end of the day make note of this and check in with your body and brain.Are you really hungry, or just exhausted? Do you need to head to bed early instead of numbing out on Netflix?If you're hungry by all means eat a small snack that's preferably of the healthier variety (think toast with peanut butter, or an apple and handful of almonds).With a little commitment and some creativity you can navigate the world of emotional eating with more confidence. Using any or all of these strategies gives you an opportunity to distract yourself or dive a bit deeper into what's at the root of your desire to eat.Whatever you choose remember to practice self-compassion and cut yourself some slack. There's nothing worse for an emotional eater than getting caught in a shame spiral that you fuel with repeated trips to the kitchen or pantry.Remember that you do have control and power over the decisions you make about what and when you choose to eat, and these strategies can help you get closer to mastery.",,https://shannonhennig.medium.com/13-things-you-can-do-instead-of-eating-your-feelings-655568f0401a,mental-health,3c58d12dfce358b44b3c9323759d1ae8cbe58286fcf9cb7326475602
The Sad Problem With Today's Stock Market We Fail To Consider,"I love living in Los Angeles.In many ways, it gets a bad rap. I have lived all over the country, and I have never met better, more down to Earth people than I have in Los Angeles. Especially the men - we're a sensitive bunch in this city.Except for the douchebags.It's difficult to not run into at least one douchebag per day in Los Angeles.There are old money douchebags in places like Santa Monica and Hancock Park. There are new money douchebags in places such as Hollywood and Downtown. These people live in another world, oblivious to the fact that they're pure, unadulterated douchebags.Then, there are douchebags like me. We mean well, yet sometimes miss the mark.I try to write about the inequities that persist in the personal finance and investing dialogue, but it's not easy to keep pace. It's easy to get stuck in a place where you lose sight of the fact that not everyone has the luxury of ""worrying"" about how big their emergency fund should be or if they should rent an apartment or buy a house.Jessica Wildfire absolutely crushes the game on Medium. And it's in part because of beautiful yet super straightforward writing like this:In the above-linked article, Jessica discusses the idea that the times we're living through can cause financially unfit or desperate people to look at the stock market or cryptocurrency as solutions to their money problems when they're anything but.In fact, it's the exact opposite, particularly if you fall for the allure of speculating on the whims of billionaires (Elon Musk pumping cryptocurrency) and so-called bandit traders (the novices in the Reddit forum).I have just one thing to add to Jessica's excellent story.The media deserves a considerable share of the blame for this dynamic.From mainstream outlets who lack the acumen to cover the stock market in the first place to sources that should know better, such as CNBC. While guys like Jim Cramer speak refreshingly, backed by years of knowledge and genuine concern, why in the hell does Dave Portnoy get so much airtime?Because it's all about the compelling, even if false and terrifyingly dangerous story.Just as Republicans should go straight to hell for continuing to support Donald Trump and perpetuate his dangerous lies, the media has blood on its hands for how it covered the recent money stories that made their way into popular culture.It handled the Reddit fiasco with zero responsibility.It portrayed the situation as everyday Joe, renegade ""traders"" turning the tables and crushing the big money on Wall Street when the reality ended up being anything but. Anybody who has followed the stock market for more than a minute saw the writing on the wall.While it was great to see people who made money make money, they also - even if unintentionally - took thousands of people to the cleaners. They orchestrated what amounts to a classic pump and dump, even if, again, they did so unknowingly.Here's how the Securities and Exchange Commission defines a pump and dump:If you can read, you see the point. GameStop was a pump and dump. Maybe not a classic penny stock pump and dump, but a pump and dump nevertheless.But here's the thing - I feel nothing for friends of mine with a few hundred or thousand bucks to spare who bought the top on GameStop and lost everything. They'll be fine.I feel a lot of something for the people I think Jessica was writing about in her article. People who are desperate, observed the hype, believed it, and somehow thought money was falling from trees. All they had to do was figure out how to get in on the game and they would instantly become yet another David crushing what the media lamely portrayed as some collective Goliath.Can you blame a person looking for a way out of their financial problems? They watched the news, absorbed the misguided media portrayal of what was happening with GameStop, and got in at absolutely the wrong time as the stock quickly cratered from roughly $400 to, at last check, $50.31.Can you blame the same person for following Elon Musk into Dogecoin, another pump and dump (for all intents and purposes) that's probably not going to end well either?In our day-to-day discussions about personal finance and investing, we too easily forget that millions of people worry about ""having enough money for tomorrow.""The words we use and stories we tell, especially around volatile events driven by emotion and spectacle, have power. They can cause desperate people to do desperate things, making their already precarious situations even more insecure.This article is for informational and entertainment purposes only.

The Brain's Most Precious Resource,"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the most intricate machines mankind has ever built. When it's running, every second approximately one billion particles smash into each other at velocities close to the speed of light, probing physics beyond the edges of the current standard model of particle physics.A lot can happen in these one billion particle collisions, and immense detectors are built around the ring of the LHC to not miss out on anything important. But such large quantities of collisions, coupled with complex detectors, generate a lot of data. Seriously, it's a lot of data. About one petabyte, or one thousand terabytes, or one million gigabytes of collision data per second if you sum it all up.If you hear these numbers it's pretty obvious that such an insane amount of data is impossible to analyze or even to record with current computing devices. Therefore, a lot of data has to be thrown out in real-time before any analysis of it even becomes feasible.This is why the detectors at the LHC have built into them a lot of fast, automated triggering and filtering systems that signal to the detector that it is worth starting to record an event and which events don't tell us anything meaningful and can be safely discarded.But even after the drastic data reduction achieved through these means, the data center at the LHC still ends up with a petabyte of data each day, making up only 0.001 percent of the original incoming data.Our brains are faced with a similar challenge on a daily basis: cognitive processing and storage, much like computation time, is the brain's most precious resource, and for cognitive systems that came about through evolution, spending resources parsimoniously is one of the keys to survival.All cognition can be viewed as a trade-off between information gain and metabolic expenditure. The LHC can be viewed as its own kind of superhuman cognitive system, probing its environment and extracting relevant information from it at a minimal cost.One of the keys to extracting information efficiently is to have highly optimized sensors that do their own kind of quick thinking before any kind of deep processing takes place. These low-level filters trigger which events are recorded and which events are discarded before spending too much energy on them.They are combined with the high-level scientific ambitions of the scientists that form the other part of this superhuman cognitive system that is the LHC: from the enormous current of information about the environment flowing in through the sensors, which events seem interesting enough to investigate further? Which events should grab our attention, and demand further investigation? And how do our goals (e.g. finding the Higgs boson or supersymmetry particles) inform where we look to begin with and how we construct the filters?Even while William James claimed that everyone knows what attention is, and it is important to emphasize at this point that attention is not one homogeneous thing controlled by the homunculus sitting at the steering wheel inside the pineal gland, but a complex multi-faceted phenomenon best thought of on several layers and as composed of several individual moving parts. In my previous article on why we might be looking at the brain in the wrong way, I discussed this frequent issue of applying terminology that is centuries old to describe novel neuroscientific phenomena (the heritage of James plays its own part), and frequently, relying on ancient terminology and ancient intuitions can stand in our own way of properly grasping what is going on.This holds especially true for attention, something so familiar from everyday life yet at the same time meaning so many things at once, and tied up with other wobbly concepts like free will and consciousness.So in the rest of this article, I don't want to be exhaustive (for a more detailed overview on all kinds of facets of attention, this review article might be a good place to start), but rather illustrate some useful key components and functions of attention both in the brain and in machine learning.The LHC lays out nicely how attention determines where limited resources should best be spent in a complex environment. And I believe it also introduces the key components that compose the attention mechanism in the brain well: our attention system can be thought of as consisting of both bottom-up and top-down control, as Adam Gazzaley and Larry Rosen describe in The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High Tech World.Top-down mechanisms try to implement our high-level goals by guiding our attention. Say your new year's goal is to lose weight: your cortex will then try to convince your eyes not to notice that deliciously nutritious looking bar of chocolate lying over there next to the couch. Top-down goals might be thought of as one of the pinnacles of evolution: as I noted in my article on the Bayesian Brain, discovering and predicting the future offered an enormous evolutionary advantage, with our cities and technologies built by the dead giving impressive testament to the fact.Bottom-up mechanisms, on the other hand, automatically pull your attention towards something that was, in our long evolutionary history, worth noting. Be it when there is a loud explosion down the street, a jaguar-like looking shape in the dark, or someone saying your name at the table next to you.Top-down attention is closely linked to our brain's executive functions, defined by the ability of the prefrontal cortex to exert top-down control on the rest of your brain, with the rest of the brain pushing back with bottom-up attention grabs. The orbitofrontal cortex, for instance, tries to work out how your emotions are regulated by your goals, and through the limbic system translates abstract goals into the language of body and action.An interesting to note is that much of this is mostly done through inhibition rather than activation. What counts in life is often what we do not do, the impulses we manage not follow, be it when we decide against staying in our comfortable bed in the morning to go to work or when stopping ourselves from gambling our retirement pension away in a night in Las Vegas. Studies with patients having had lesions in brain areas responsible for attention control (or, in the case of Phineas Gage, had iron rods explode through these relevant brain regions) show how detrimental the inability to control impulses and pursue long term goals was for their quality of life. A similar notion was popularized by Mischel's famous Marshmallow experiment, indicating that gratification postponement in children at an early age is a good predictor of long-term success.Thus, controlling attention is closely intertwined with controlling our behavior. Our brains might be viewed as supercomputers built on monkey brains, and with the supercomputers coming to the party relatively late, exerting cognitive control is tricky, and top-down and bottom-up mechanism are in constant competition for the brain's most precious resource.Often, they are in direct conflict with each other.You might be strong-willed, but after a long day of work, when the sight of the chocolate bar triggers saliva building up in your mouth with tsunami-like intensity, your executive functions are easily overcome and you are shown that you are not master in your own house.More generally, getting distracted and losing focus can be seen from the perspective of goal interference. Attention is, as most things in the brain, regulated dynamically, and as such is prone to interference. Staying focused is an active process, filtering information and ignoring the irrelevant is an active process, taking time and energy. Goals compete, and attentional resources are always in direct competitioin with each other.This is another important aspect of attention that makes sense evolutionarily, and brings us back to the LHC metaphor: global attention guides our sensors to maxima in the information gathering landscape. These can be achieved within individual sensory modalities (e.g. looking in a certain direction), by switching between different networks in the brain (e.g. listening carefully vs. looking carefully) or switching between tasks (reading a newspaper instead of watching Youtube). After enough information is gathered, attention also guides our memories to decide what is worth storing and remembering in future situations.But our ability to frequently initiate network switching through attention might be seen both as a feature and a bug: as there are usually many things to be paid attention to, it is crucial to have an automated infrastructure in place that shines the ray of attention on inputs and switches our action to an activities that promise most information gain.In modern high-tech society, we are constantly bombarded by attention grabs. As laid out in The Distracted Mind, too many opportunities for task switching becomes a huge problem when ancient brains continually try to maximize information in an exponentially growing information landscape, leading to constant distraction, failed attempts at multitasking, feelings of insatiability, sleep deprivation, and much more. As complex tasks are usually distributed across several brain areas, this process of switching is also relatively slow, which is why it can take time a lot of time to move in between different tasks, making multitasking, which we all engage in constantly, highly inefficient.This phenomenon is especially pronounced among younger generations, and countering these highly detrimental effects on our mental life should warrant our collective society's undivided attention (pun intended).To sum things up, we can conceptualize attention as something like an overarching organizing principle of a multi-purpose agent having to do loads of tasks at the same time in the real world and to navigate meaningfully between them. This includes information gathering across several sensor modalities and the implementation of high level goals via cognitive control.It's not entirely clear how to get from this perspective on attention to useful ideas in artificial intelligence. But if we view attention as a general tool to reduce and guide computational resources, it is already used quite successfully in several machine learning architectures.Most recently, attention has grabbed the attention of the deep learning community in the context of transformers, with the paper ""Attention Is All You Need"" becoming one of the most influential in the field, and being cited over 16000 times.Transformers have revolutionized natural-language processing and allowed architectures like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to generate eerily human-like texts.Without getting too technical, text generation is a sequential task, composed of an encoder (the text that goes in) and a decoder (the text that goes out). The input and output of the model are therefore composed of sequences. Sequential models can be very tricky to learn because the input can become quite large, requiring the model to potentially learn long-range dependencies in the input (see the exploding-gradient problems when training recurrent neural networks, something partly solved by long-short-term memory networks, which come with their own set of problems).As this blog post describes in more detail, attention mechanisms, as used by transformers, try to circumvent this problem by introducing the so-called self-attention operation. This operation is computed between the input vectors of the sequence, and can be used when generating output sequences.Self-attention is then a way of figuring out global dependencies, so of demarcating which part of an input sequence belongs together, and is, in turn, going to be relevant for output generation. One often-cited application lies in translation between different languages (e.g. between French and English, using the wonderfully named CamemBERT model), where words that belong together in meaning can pop up in different parts of the sentence in different languages.Attention also helps circumvent the problem of having very long input sequences because the model does not need to remember the whole input sequence (say when you have to translate a very long sentence...looking at you, Marcel Proust), but can prioritize and batch the input more flexibly, much as a human translator would (see this video by Andrew Ng for a more detailed explanation).This helps in effectively reducing the dimensionality of the input vector, as the model implicitly selects which part of the sequence is going to be relevant, and thus figures out what to pay attention to. This also nicely introduces context-dependence into the model, something absolutely crucial in our human understanding of text (and the world in general).While there are comparisons to be drawn between this and the brain, some of the connections might admittedly also seem a little far-fetched here.Our human intelligence is so impressive because it works across such a wide array of different tasks, and neural network architectures, being for the most part still highly specialized, have a hard time with it. So something more akin to our human-like attention could very well become increasingly important as a global organizational principle in the context of multi-task learning agents, for example in robotics.There is still a lot of room for fresh and interesting ideas (e.g. by modeling attention in transformers on attention in natural language processing in the brain), and nicely underscores why further down the road, concepts from neuroscience might infuse machine learning with a set of useful new ideas, and why the two disciplines should stay in close contact to each other.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*EIiXHgrfXh2gTRDC3uHuzg.jpeg,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-brains-most-precious-resource-7341b9fb6369,neuroscience,3dbd86fb0068c06ba7da7b9a6a42ceac3d7771277a3a40a1761c6532
A four-layer model of product focus,"Over the years I've seen many approaches for working out product focus. Some are relatively simple, like OKRs; others are quite convoluted. Some talk about lofty ambitions to be the ""best in the world""; and others focus exclusively on just the work immediately before us. Whilst they all have their merits, none have been able to connect the dots for me between the overall big picture and the minutiae of everyday work. And I've seen first hand management telling me to buy into an ambitious vision on one hand, and then telling me to deliver entirely disconnected and different features on the other.So I came up with my own model for defining product focus.* It consists of four layers from overall vision down through to individual experiments (i.e. work items). What I really wanted to achieve was to create transparency and alignment between day-to-day work and the overall ambitions of the company. I believe that this model connects the dots. The four layers are:(* You may notice some similarity of the four layers to the overall structure of Strategy Deployment in ""Escaping the Build Trap"" by Melissa Perri, but this is coincidental and my model is quite different in the details of each layer.)If you were to ask a customer to advocate for you - to promote your product to their friend or colleague - how would they describe it? Would they articulate a clear purpose and advantage, or would they struggle to explain it? Would they believe strongly in your product or would their convictions be weakly held? Or worse still, would they dissuade their friend from considering your product at all?!It's not hard to find examples of poor vision statements. Here's a list from Inc.com, one from The Balance, and one from My Corporation. What these poorly framed statements tend to have in common is that they lack both a focus and a tangible description of what the company actually does. I've come to believe that the vast majority of vision statements are actually quite poorly formed (even many that other people have admired in the past). So what is the crux of a good vision (or mission statement):I don't make a distinction between the terms ""Vision"" and ""Mission Statement"". To me, they serve the same purpose and are thus regarded as the same thing. Some people split hairs over them, but I find that distinction arbitrary and confusing. So for simplicity, I just lump them together into one concept called ""vision"".Most of the examples and commentary around vision focuses on the company level. For this framework though I want to concentrate on a ""product vision"". There are a few reasons for this. First, it is often easier to craft a more tangible vision for a single product than a whole company (especially for an example). Second, many companies are only known for solving one major problem (even though there may be several parts, models, or alternatives), so in this case, the product vision and the company vision are effectively the same. And third, we are talking about Product after all!In my view, a good vision consists of the following:Amazon's box mockup technique is a good way to think about the above - can you articulate why someone should buy your product before you even build it? Here are my takes on some good product visions (not necessarily how the companies actually describe those products themselves):You might have noticed that my definition of a great vision is very different from most of the conventional vision statements that you see around. My version is very straightforward; it doesn't contain any of the lofty ambitions ""to be the best X in the world"" and so on. But how often do you reference those conventional visions? How often do you read them and apply them to your daily work? A simple, straightforward vision statement is easy to get behind and support, for both staff and customers alike. It's easy to see how everything your team builds directly contributes to the vision (see the fourth layer below). It's easy for a customer to see how they directly benefit from your company and your product. Those two key points make for a compelling vision.Finally, I want to leave this video with you that summarizes conventional vision thinking extremely well in my opinion:Good strategy is hard. Good strategy is about execution. If a vision is a promise to a customer, and it's from their point of view, then strategy is about how we will fulfill that promise, and it's from the business' point of view instead.When most people think of the acronym ""CEO"", they immediately think that E stands for ""Executive"", and they think of all the power, privilege and responsibility that goes along with that title. But I want you think of the E in a slightly different way. I want you to imagine that the E stands for Execution; so ""CEO"" stands for Chief Execution Officer. That is, the CEO is the person who will steer how we all collectively execute to deliver that promise or vision that we articulated to our customers above. I mention this because I want to get you in the mindset of thinking ""how will we execute to fulfill our vision?""A lot has been written about strategy over the years, and Richard Rumelt's book ""Good Strategy Bad Strategy"" (2011) is a great place to start. Richard defines a strategy as consisting of three parts:This strategy framework makes more sense if you think about it as being an instance of the Improvement Kata. The strategy diagnosis is just like step 1: understanding the direction (and to a lesser extent step 2: establishing the current condition). The guiding policy is just like step 3: what is the next target condition that you seek to achieve? And the set of actions is just like step 4: gradually moving towards the target condition through daily action.Let's look at a possible strategy for one of our examples above; let's imagine how Netflix may have gone about devising their initial approach to Streaming. (This is not necessarily the strategy that they actually used at the time.)There were likely several more initiatives, but you can see the tree-like structure in the layers above. There is usually a single diagnosis. This branches out to around two or three policies. And finally each policy may branch out to a small number of actions. If we fan out too rapidly then we lose our focus and ability to execute effectively on each action and thus the strategy as a whole, so it is important to maintain discipline and careful prioritization of the initiatives that we choose to pursue. Indeed Rumelt points out that too many simultaneous activities tends to induce poor focus and can easily lead to our strategy failing altogether.One thing you'll notice about strategy is that it doesn't focus on target revenues as a prime directive. Instead it focuses on tangible things that we can actually do; the revenue numbers follow as a consequence of our actions. And it also contains a ""who"": just who is the customer that this strategy is designed for? Effective strategies focus on one group of people, for example individuals with high disposable income, retailers, technology early adopters, and so on. It's important to identify who experiences the pain most acutely, and target our strategy so that those people can succeed.Our next layer down is Outcomes. ""Outcomes over Output"" is very fashionable at the moment, so let's see what that means. Traditionally, teams just focused on output, or building features. It was assumed that customers would naturally see the benefit of these features and buy (and use) the product. Only this didn't always happen. What often happened was that the myriad of features did not actually meet the needs and expectations of customers, but overwhelmed them instead, and thus remained unused.So instead the focus has turned to outcomes. An outcome is a goal or objective that a customer is trying to achieve - it's a job that they are trying to do. If I sell cameras, my customer's outcome is to take great pictures. If I sell guitars, my customer's outcome is to make great music. Outcomes are easy to understand if you put yourself in your customers shoes: ""what am I trying to achieve today?"" As you can imagine, for this outcome layer we return to the customer's point of view.Continuing our example of Netflix Streaming, what are some outcomes that a customer might have:You'll notice while we've described all these benefits that the customer receives, we have not yet described how any of them actually work! We will discuss that in the final layer. But the main message of this layer is to focus on goals that are most important to the customer, and prioritize those.You might be wondering how outcomes tie in with the strategy that we devised in the previous layer. When we left the strategy, there was a set of coherent actions that we were going to work in order to realize the vision - projects or initiatives that we were going to actually do. Each of these actions should tie in with one more outcomes. If we have identified important outcomes that cannot be addressed within the scope of a strategic action, then we have missed an opportunity. If we have an action that contains no useful outcomes, then we are working on the wrong strategy!The Strategy and Outcome layers intersect with each other, and it may take several iterations to get a good fit. We may identify outcomes that we cannot act upon, e.g. they be part of a challenge that we simply cannot solve. Or we may identify a strategy that no one actually cares about (remember Juicero?) It may take several attempts to get this all working and meshing correctly - hence my comment earlier that good strategy is hard.Our final layer is Experiments. This is where we do the actual work - the specifications, designs, code, deployments, tests, evaluations and so on.However, we cannot treat each piece of work as a ""given"", that is we cannot assume at its commencement that it will actually create the value that we identified in those layers above. Generation of value is our guide - we must constantly assess, iterate and improve the actual work so that it delivers on the promise of value that we made. And many times we will turn out to be wrong. Gibson Biddle said that only about half of Netflix's ideas turned out to be useful. So this final layer is treated as a series of experiments rather than a plan set in stone. This will allow us to try different things to pivot and adjust as needed in order to navigate towards our goal.Usually when we think about the Improvement Kata, we imagine it operating at this layer: the actual work layer. So let's see that in action.As mentioned above, when we commence our work we don't really know whether or not it will actually solve our customers' problem. We're taking a chance. Hence we treat it as a falsifiable experiment; we do the work, evaluate it, and then decide how to proceed. We may well find at the experiment's conclusion that our attempt didn't actually solve the problem at all, or that it was a roaring success, or indeed anywhere in between.Marty Cagan writes that about half of our ideas don't end up working out, and the ones that do take several attempts to get right. So it behooves us to not get too attached or committed to individual experiments; to treat each one as expendable in the pursuit of the higher-level outcome. It's especially important to make these expectations clear, both to ourselves and to important stakeholders such as management, sales, or anyone with influence. This also means that we will have to deal with rework.On any meaningful project, rework is inevitable. We cannot know everything upfront to get it right the first time round, on every piece of work we do. When you think about creative work this makes sense: writing, music, film and TV - all these pursuits evolve from rough drafts through several rounds of refinement. Software is a creative work too. In many countries software is regarded as a literary work (e.g. in copyright law), so we should expect the same rules about refinement and improvement apply to it also.The language that we use is important; it sets expectations. For example when a team ""accepts"" work into a Sprint, there is often an expectation that they have committed to it (you can read my view on this particular example here). What we want to do is make it clear that (a) no individual piece of work is guaranteed to succeed, (b) the work is in service of satisfying an outcome, and (c) multiple attempts or iterations are to be expected. What we want to do is shift the focus back to the Outcome being the primary deliverable that we assess progress and success against, so labeling this bottom-most layer as Experiments is a great way to do that. It makes them sound more ""expendable"", which they are.Let's tie together our four layers to form a complete model:You can think of the set of actions in the Strategy layer as being projects or overarching initiatives. The Experiments contain the individual features or services that we want to try to build. Connecting the two is the Outcomes, which gives a two-way justification for both each feature (the experiment), and for the project overall (the strategy action).Let's see our historical Netflix Streaming example all tied together (and just a reminder that these are my interpretations, not necessary what the company actually used at the time that they first built streaming). You can see how the layers tie together: the strategy realizes the vision, the outcomes determine the strategy, and the experiments realize the outcomes.Vision (customer-centric)I can watch whatever I want, whenever I want. I'm never bored, and because it's a fixed price I never have to worry about the cost.Strategy (business-centric)Outcomes (customer-centric)Experiments (business-centric)The actual work, i.e. features and systems that we will build, measure, and learn from in order to try to satisfy the Outcomes, for example:It's not enough to simply define the four layers above; we need to share those layers across our whole organization so that everyone knows the common goals and they work together rather than in different directions. This is the spot where many organizations fall over - their plan is not communicated and consistent, so the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing!Inevitably, we will need to adjust our plan as our business progresses. This is to be expected. Each time we adapt and improve, we also need to widely publish the updates.There are a few things we didn't cover, but are worth considering.Positioning. Product positioning is a large topic in itself. Often it's left to the marketing department to figure out, but as you can see above the Vision and Strategy layers speak directly to positioning. I recommend reading ""Obviously Awesome"" by April Dunford; in it you will find many elements that speak directly to the Strategy elements above. In fact, I recommend following her product positioning steps as part of your strategy discussions.Product Goals and Sprint Goals. The 2020 Scrum Guide describes these two goals. A Product Goal is the same as your product vision. A Sprint Goal is still the same thing - a progress goal for each Sprint - but from our Outcomes and Experiments layers we can see how to make the Sprint Goal far more customer-centric and less like ""implement all these features by the end of the Sprint"".Metrics. We haven't talked about how to measure the impact or success of your project within the four layers above. I've previously written about avoiding Agile Success Theatre in favor of metrics that actually measure business outcomes. Everything that we've talked about above is from the perspective of making a tangible difference to your business, rather than focusing on how much code you wrote last week. If you can measure the success of your initiatives above (e.g. customer engagement, customer sentiment) rather than focusing on velocity and story points then you will be well ahead.Hypotheses. It has become fashionable to phrase features or outcomes a hypothesis statement. For example ""we believe that if we provide solution X then it will increase our customer retention by Y%; we will know this by seeing metric Z change by W amount."" Since we are already dealing with Experiments, it becomes natural to phrase each one as a hypothesis to be proven or disproven. It's a good practice to get your mind in the headspace of identifying risk and verifying your initial hunch.A common problem with many ways of defining product vision is that it bears little correlation to the work we are actually doing - the features that we actually deliver. So this means we are not actually creating the value that we think we are. Or maybe we treat the vision with skepticism, as in management espouse one ethos but tell us to build something quite different.So we looked at a four layer model for product focus. The four layers are:By identifying and refining these four layers, we can focus our work so that everything we work on contributes in a meaningful way to our overall product vision. We should be able to see the connections all the way up and down the tree: an experiment should contribute to validating an outcome, an outcome should fulfill some part of our strategy, our strategy should realize our vision, and our vision should be a common purpose that our customers and our staff can all rally around.You can see that the overall structure contains a considerable amount of detail, especially the Strategy layer. And you can see that it takes considerable work and iteration to get all these layers meshed and supporting each other well. We should not expect that this is a trivial exercise - it can take months or years of continuous improvement before we get it all right. But if you take the time to connect the dots all the way from your vision right down to your day-to-day deliverables, then you may unlock something remarkable: alignment.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8000/0*HP_JMqKrgu6j-aQp,https://uxdesign.cc/a-four-layer-model-of-product-focus-dcb09bf1ff42,ux,3dc3196383cda0905c4f150a767ced3838ae3ec8cadc7620f035ab02
VCVC is the EV Sector's New Exciting SPAC on the Block,"No matter where your investing interests lie, it's impossible to ignore the growing influence that electric vehicle companies are having on the market. With the astounding success of Tesla and an increasing global emphasis on renewable energy and environmentalism, the sector is experiencing a veritable gold rush as companies race to claim a piece of the rapidly expanding pie. Some of these companies are seeking to go public via SPAC merger. One of the most recent to throw their hat in the ring is an Israeli manufacturer of EV components.SPAC VCVC (10X Capital Venture Acquisition Corp) just recently found a merger partner in REE Automotive. REE describes themselves as:Based out of Tel Aviv, Ree was founded in 2013 and currently has around 100 employees. They have developed two key products - ""the REEcorner integrates all traditional vehicle components into the arch of the wheel and thus carrying the REEboard - a completely flat and modular electric platform."" Their most significant innovation is that their modular platform puts the guts of the vehicle, typically under the hood, in the wheel bay, opening up entirely new design possibilities for future car models. In total, they hold in excess of 60 patents on their proprietary products; an important hurdle for any company looking to take next steps in their growth.In particular, their Reeboard is set up in a way that the chassis of the vehicle looks like a skateboard. Right now, the design is believed to be best geared towards commercial vehicles, but their goal to continue improving and developing dynamic products earned them a BloombergNEF Pioneer award in 2020. REE's CEO Daniel Barel explained his company's mission to Motortrend:A completed merger should give REE in excess of $500 million in gross proceeds and they project to have revenue exceeding $19 billion by 2026. It will also place the valuation of the company at $3.1 billion. This will be a gradual rollout, as the additional funds will be used to accelerate the mass-production of their two proprietary products with the anticipated start date around 2023. In other words, once they get their feet under them, they expect to be sprinting.It's reported that to date, Ree Automotive is in receipt of around $1.5 billion in orders for the components it manufactures. Big-time customers include Mitsubishi, KYB Corp, Musashi Seimitsu and Mahindra, an Indian-based automaker that will use their order as part of a production project that will result in 250,000 electric vehicles.The VCVC SPAC is sponsored by investment firm 10X Capital's head, Hans Thomas. Once they complete the merger, they are expected to retain at least a 20% stake in the company, which will trade under the ticker symbol REE.SPACs are hot. EV companies are hotter. Since the news of the collaboration, VCVC stock has jumped, currently sitting at $14.95 per share. Investors will likely need to view this with a long-term eye, as the company is currently projecting profitability by 2024. However, with the way they expect to grow post-merger, their balance sheet could buff up quickly.With the realm of EV exploding with players and opportunities, each one must be evaluated closely in the effort to pick investing winners. Ree has developed desirable products that could be transformative for electric car makers and are taking the aggressive next step in their journey by going public via a SPAC merger. They have truly laid their cards on the table and are betting that they have a bright future. Only time will tell if investors will agree.DISCLAIMER: The author is not a financial advisor or expert.

"She Needed to Find Her Own Definition of ""Peace""","Ashley blinked back hot tears. She hadn't expected to be so emotional. Rob had been gone for three months. It was time to move on. She gritted her teeth. At first there had been denial, then a soul-crushing sadness. She thought she'd gotten to the acceptance stage, but no. Today, she was stuck on anger and bitterness at the unfairness of it all.Ashley packed up the golf clubs and reinforced the box with packing tape before slapping the mailing label on the side. She'd gotten a good price. They were PINGs and the leather bag was signed by Rory McIlroy. She wrestled the heavy package to her porch next to the pile due to be picked up for delivery. She wasn't paying the extra charge for an at-home pick-up. That fee was passed on to the buyers. Having to lug everything to a drop-off location wasn't worth the hassle.Just in time, she thought, watching the big, brown truck lurch into her driveway. She walked back in the house, not wanting to waste time making small talk. She slid the back of her wrist across her sweaty forehead and took a long drink from her water bottle.When she heard the squeal of the wheel axles, she went back outside and heaved open the garage door. The tables were set up, but she wanted to bring miscellaneous items out into the driveway to draw in potential customers cruising by.She pulled out the weight bench, but left the weights stacked inside. The kayak wasn't heavy, just awkward. The hunting blind was easy to handle. She popped it up by the portable basketball hoop. The fishing poles were laid flat next to the tackle boxes.Ashley glanced down at her clipboard and checked a few more things off her list. She was glad the neighbor bought the paddleboard last week. No need to have two.She checked her watch. It was only 9:30 and already several cars were parking along the road. Early birds. She'd been forewarned that would happen. No matter. She was ready.She pasted on a smile and made her voice sound chipper. ""Hi there! Everything is marked, but I will consider any reasonable offers.""One woman veered toward the clothing folded on tables.Ashley called out to her, ""All I have is men's clothing.""""I'm looking for my grandson,"" the lady said, picking up a pair of cowboy boots.""Those are size 12,"" Ashley said. ""They're ostrich. Practically brand new and bargain priced. As for any of the clothing, feel free to take whatever you want. No charge.""The woman's eyes widened, and she nodded to the clothes rack. ""Even those? The suits and ties?""""You bet,"" Ashley said. She wanted to believe it was out of kindness, but in truth, she just wanted the clothes gone.Rob, she realized, bought only the best. The last week had been exhausting, trying to price everything. She'd been pleasantly surprised how much the big-ticket items went for on Craig's List and eBay.They'd had plenty of arguments about money. Rob always told her she didn't appreciate the value of things.Ashley had always countered material possessions weren't important. It was the intangible things in life that mattered. Stuff like love, trust, and honesty.Still, she had to admit she didn't mind how her bank account balance had inflated since she started selling all his belongings. It was enough to treat herself to a vacation and a few other luxuries she'd been denying herself. Now that she was on her own, she realized it was time to start pampering herself for a change, instead of worrying about anyone else. This new way of thinking was liberating and healing.By noon, most of the items for sale had been wiped out. The street signs and ad in the newspaper had paid off. On a lark, this morning, she'd announced on FaceBook she was conducting an everything-must-go sale. Then she listed several ""teasers"" like the Ray-Ban sunglasses, the meat smoker, and the drone. Those were the first things to go.At this rate, she'd be able to shut the sale down early, get cleaned up, and meet the girls for happy hour. She called that a win.Her skin prickled when she heard the distinctive rumbling of a V8 engine. Her heart slammed against her chest when a blue metallic Camaro roared up the drive and screeched to a stop.She winced. Here we go!Rob jumped out of the car and slammed the door. His face was cherry red and the vein in his temple thrashed up and down as if there were a wild animal trapped in his head.Ashley swallowed hard and took a deep breath. ""Hey, Rob, what's up?"" Her tone was breezy.Rob brought his hands up to his ears as if putting his skull in a vice. ""What in the actual -""""What?"" Ashley said, crossed her arms over her chest. She tapped her foot. ""I told you I wanted your stuff out of here months ago. You're a little late.""""How dare you!"" His mouth was opening and closing like a fish out of water.Ashley reached for her cigarettes on a nearby table and lit one, knowing he loathed the habit. ""This ain't no storage unit."" She held up a hand when it seemed he was about to speak. ""It's not my fault you're a lying, cheating dirtbag. You were kicked out because you couldn't resist that little tramp from your office. You shoulda taken your things before I changed the locks.""Rob was breathing hard through his nose.She thought he looked like an angered bull and giggled.Rob massaged his neck. ""I told you it was an accident!"" He sounded like he was explaining something to a small child.  ""An accident?"" She snorted. ""What happened? Did she trip over her high heels and fall on your dick?""Rob gazed to the heavens and mumbled curse words. Then, he leveled his eyes with hers. ""You had no right to sell my stuff. No right!""""I didn't sell all of it! There's a few T-shirts left, and a couple ball caps. Besides, you had no right to lie to me. To have an affair. I caught you in our bed for crying out loud. That was the first thing I sold!""""I don't believe this,"" he muttered, clenching and unclenching his fists. ""You owe me, Ash! I want every penny back that I gave you each month to pay the house payment for two years! That still won't cover the value of everything I deserve, but it'll be a good start,"" he growled.Ashley blew a cloud of smoke in his face and shook her head. ""Nooo, I don't see that happening. It's my house. Consider that money you gave me your rent payment.""His back straightened. ""You're a real piece of work, aren't you? I'll see you in court! But while I'm here, I'll take the engagement ring back."" He held out his hand.Ashley flinched and twisted the pendant on her necklace. ""Uh, that's not happening either. If you recall, you gave it to me for Christmas. According to the lawyer I am dating now, that makes it a gift - therefore mine to keep."" She took her hand down.The two-carat diamond pendant sparkled in the sunlight.""You melted it down? You're dating a lawyer?"" He bent over and supported himself by putting his hands on his knees.Ashley stepped closer. ""Are you hyperventilating? Should I call 9-1-1? Do you need a brown paper bag?"" When he didn't answer, she wandered into the garage and started putting miscellaneous items in a large, cardboard box until it overflowed. She set it at his feet and pulled the door down.Rob stood up slowly. ""Can I at least get my skiis? Then, I will leave. But this isn't over, Ashley.""""Hmm ... all your ski equipment was bought by your friend. I think Jake is his name? Ya know, the one you always said you were out with when you were actually with her?""Rob's face turned grey. ""The ski bag, too?""Ashley smiled. ""Yep! But don't worry. I found that wad of cash you stashed in your helmet bag. You were always hiding something, weren't you, Rob?"" She made a tsk-tsk sound and started up the sidewalk, toward her front door.""I can't believe you did this to me!"" Rob hollered.""Ditto,"" she called, over her shoulder. When she reached the porch, she yelled, ""Remember how you always put me down? Made me feel worthless?""""I'm sorry for that! We can still work this out!"" Rob cried, starting to follow her.She stepped inside and spun around, watching him run towards her. She let him get to the stoop and she whispered, ""You found a piece on the side that made you happy. The peace I've found since you've been gone makes me ecstatic.""He opened his mouth to speak.She shut the door in his face.She needed to take a shower.It was almost happy hour, and the girls were waiting.Keep reading for more of Tracy's twisted tales!If you aren't in the mood for sweet and sappy, rest assured, this ain't no love story:Paul was too boring for his cheating, adrenaline-junky wife.

Traveling Light: Leave Your Baggage at Home,"Remember in-flight magazines, the only source of entertainment in those dark days when you couldn't use electronics during take-off and landing?I read a story in one once that I think of every single time I travel. It was about an American who had to have surgery just before flying to Paris for a week. His doctor cleared him to travel but he wasn't allowed to carry anything. Not even so much as a shoulder bag.Rather than cancel the trip, he set off with only the clothes on his back, passport in one pants pocket and wallet in the other. It turned out to be the best trip of his life.I'd love to credit the author or even just the airline magazine but it was at least a decade ago so while I've never forgotten the article the details have been mixed and mingled with my ongoing fantasies of following in his footsteps.Imagine boarding a plane for another country. You have nothing with you but the clothes you are wearing, a passport, cash, and credit cards. You find your seat and that's it. There is no jostling for overhead bin space, no shoving your laptop bag under the seat in front of you, no pulling out your novel and starting to read.You entertain yourself with people watching feeling a bit smug with how unencumbered you are.You sail through the airport and customs. There is no digging in your bag for your passport, no struggling with your carry-on in the tight quarters of the public toilets. You jump on public transit and begin exploring the city immediately, no need to stop off at the hotel to settle in first.As you explore you take everything in. There is no pulling out your phone trying to capture the perfect shot. No texting someone back home or posting to social media. No pulling up the web to research your next move.You are fully in the moment, accepting what comes your way without striving to create the experience you imagined.You walk through some shops truly ""just browsing"" for the first time in your life. You can't purchase anything unless it can be consumed on the spot or worn on your body. You don't buy any souvenirs or gifts for people back home. Pretty quickly you stop even looking in shops unless they sell food and you are hungry.When you are tired you head toward your hotel. There is no temptation to slip back into the comforting routines and people of home because there is no way to do so. You can watch local TV or you can go to sleep. You disrobe, washing your underwear in the sink and drape it on the radiator to dry overnight.In the morning, you put on your clothes from the night before and head out for a new and completely unencumbered adventure.The man in the article had some pretty serious restrictions from his doctor. If we did this trip, we'd be free to decide what guidelines we were going to place on ourselves.I've devoted many hours to this fantasy over the years mostly while packing for trips, as I squirmed on a plane trying to find a comfortable space for my feet next to my budging bag, waiting forever for my suitcases to appear on the luggage carousel, and standing in a queue for the hotel shuttle and then struggling to lift my heavy bag up the steps.Here are the areas you will need to think seriously about before setting off on this trip. If you don't decide ahead of time you will face a lot of angst during your travels as you regularly confront whether something is or is not allowed.This is the real biggie. The original article was from before the time of smart phones. If you decide to go completely phone-free it will be a very different experience.The advantages of no phone are a completely novel experience of living in the moment. Rather than looking up bus schedules, opening times, and directions, you will be at the mercy of your memory from any pre-trip research and whatever you happen upon. You won't be spending any time looking up restaurant reviews or weighing your various options.You also won't be able to communicate with anyone not in your immediate vicinity. If you get stuck or lost you will be relying on the kindness of strangers to help you out.Allowing yourself to carry a phone opens up the ability to research on the go and makes getting yourself to specific locations in a timely fashion much easier. It also offers you the ability to document the experience through photos and note taking.If you are prone to worrying about making the most of your time while traveling, it might be highly refreshing to be freed from the option of research. If you are a writer or an influencer, maybe a trip where you are forced to just experience things with no ability to document it in real time is exactly the vacation you need to reset your creative juices.Only you know yourself what kind of trip you are aiming for. Going with or without a smartphone is going to vastly change the experience. Make a pros and cons list then choose your own adventure.How hardcore you are going to be about clothing depends on your budget, your location, and your tolerance levels. If I recall correctly, the man in my original story wasn't even able to carry new clothing purchased at a shop. Instead, he washed out his underwear each evening and aired out the rest of his clothes.When he couldn't bear to wear an outfit anymore he purchased then changed into the new clothing right at the shop leaving his old clothing in the trash.What about necessary hygiene products such as toothpaste, a toothbrush and deodorant? A nicer hotel might supply these products gratis but you may need to purchase them.Are you going to allow yourself to purchase clothes to wear while on the trip? Do you want to buy a few necessities to use during your trip and then leave them behind? Maybe you want to stuff an extra pair of undies and a toothbrush in your jacket pocket before you leave home.Obviously how long of a trip you are taking will determine how important of an issue this is going to be for you.Do you want to ease yourself into this experiment and choose a place you have visited before? Will you go foreign or domestic? Do you speak the language fluently or not at all? City or countryside?How long will your trip be? A weekend getaway will be much easier than traveling for a week or more.All these choices will contribute greatly to the difficulty level of your challenge. Consider your personality. Are you a jump into the deep end sort of person? Or are you a more cautious type who wants to stretch yourself just enough but not so far you can't enjoy it.Will you allow yourself to fly home with a shopping bag of clothes and other items acquired during the trip.? Or maybe pay the postage to mail yourself the perfect item you found at the bazaar? It's your trip. You make the rules and you can break them.Personally, I like the idea of coming home with nothing but memories, of forcing myself to remain empty-handed from departure to arrival.Will this be a solo trip or a joint venture? There are pros and cons either way. A companion will give you someone to process the experience with as you are living it. On the other hand, maybe baggage free for you means considering only your own needs and desires.If you choose to travel with a partner it is probably best if you are both all in on the no baggage plan. Else you run the risk of simply using the traveler with no restrictions to ease your way around your self-imposed guidelines, likely leading to resentment on both sides.I've been thinking through the details of a baggage-free trip for years now but have never done it. Whenever I have had time available, I've taken that time with my spouse. He is pretty horrified by the entire idea and I haven't managed to talk him around yet.But it is on my bucket list and I do hope to try a solo trip baggage free once the world is safe again.What about you? Are you game to give it a go? I hope you do and come back to tell us all the story of how it worked out for you.Sign up for our new newsletter to stay informed with up-to-date curations from our editors:👇",https://miro.medium.com/max/11628/0*JFPhw45Jf3-LrXZ4,https://medium.com/world-travelers-blog/traveling-light-leave-your-baggage-at-home-8b722fe6aa0a,travel,3ff95f20ec3ec6bd89ed1b08db68af34cb2b665f74ef683af4a582c0
Everything You Imagine,"My awakening begins in the office of my beloved therapist, Rachel. And it comes in the form of a six-word inspirational quotation that I am not supposed to notice as the impressionable little-old me leafs through a book full of much more appropriate quotes, meaningless bat-shit crazy quotes, during my final session with her.I am so going to miss Rachel. She never once squeezed my hand in a patronizing way and told me I was special because my synesthesia allowed me to experience so much more of the world than most others. She never pushed antidepressants on me either, at least not successfully. And best of all, at least according to my parents, she was free, her services provided once a week to me and Miami's other vulnerable teens, thanks to a rich benefactor's generous donation.Unfortunately, everything nourishing has a shelf life. I knew this would be the case with Rachel. Knew that a woman of her obvious talent and grace would eventually build up her practice enough that she no longer needed to perform cut-rate sessions with fucked-up kids when she could do the same at full price with fucked-up wealthy adults. Knew that it was nearly time to say goodbye once Rachel had relocated from the back of a dingy shopping mall, where she answered her own phone and wrote out her own receipts, to a fancy office with a beautiful secretary who always blanched when she remembered I was a charity case.I kind of regret that I didn't open up more to Rachel in our sessions. I avoided the worst of my secrets and fears, the ones that seemed to announce to the world what a whiny little loser I had become. Anyway, I always told myself I was working up to talk about them. Just the same, Rachel was great, sometimes even sharing her difficulties with me, usually loneliness, which I found hard to believe, because she was so smart and pretty. When I would tell her I couldn't believe she wasn't in some exciting romance-novel relationship, she would say something Yoda-wise, like, Life doesn't always work the way you think it should.That makes me sad, I responded once, leading to a long discussion about tempering one's expectations.In my very last session with Rachel, she spends the first 15 minutes talking up her replacement, a woman named Belinda who obviously hasn't yet grown her practice enough that she could afford to jettison the subsidized cases like me.She's a friend of mine and you'll love her, Rachel says. I've told her all about you and she can't wait for you to set up your first appointment, which I keep telling you that you need to do right away.Rachel tries to get me to call right there from her office. I refuse, saying I forgot my cell phone, which contains my very busy calendar. I hope Rachel can't detect my iPhone's faint outline in my hoodie pocket. She studies me for a little too long, and then writes out Belinda's name and number on a piece of paper, for the third time that month, and pushes it into my damp palm.We spend much of that final session reviewing my so-called progress, with Rachel, for a change, doing most of the talking. She focuses on one of her favorite topics, the inner and outer worlds we live in. Remember, she says, the inner is the thoughts and feelings and perceptions that make up your own personal reality, the outer the more concrete physical world that makes up our shared external reality. The two are connected, and each one can affect the other, right?I nod.Like if you got hit by a bus on the way home. That would be the external world impacting your internal world. Might make you forever scared of buses, right, assuming you survived?I nod again, wishing I had never mentioned how much I hate taking the bus to see her.So, can you give me an example of how your inner world could affect the outer world of the oncoming bus in a positive way in this same situation? How your feelings or thoughts could change something in this exterior world?I think carefully, pretty sure this is like a final exam question that will give me access to a more enlightened world, pretty sure, too, that I will disappoint her. I guess I could use psychic power to move the bus. You know, make it fly into the air over my head at the last second so I don't get hit.How about something a little more plausible and grounded in reality?I think some more. I could go into the future, see that I'm about to get hit by a bus, and take a different route home.Or, she says, you could make sure you have your shit together. That you're mentally in a good place so you don't have your head lost in thoughts as you step off the curb, or worse, so you don't deliberately step out in front of the bus.I always like it when she swears. It is her way of telling me she means business.You need to keep working with a therapist, Ashlee. There are no shortcuts. You need to get stronger to endure the difficult world we live in. Or else you will never be safe from that bus.I can see she's right about the connection between what happens in my head and in the outside world. But I must admit, the answers I gave about how this works are far more interesting.As my session winds down, Rachel hands me a book of inspirational quotes. Pick one that resonates with you, read it to me, and we'll see if we can both use it in the weeks ahead to change our worlds, internal and external, for the better.I'm not really trying to be a little shit. But many of the quotes are so sucky. I find a good one from Einstein: The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination. But, screw it, at the last second I substitute it with something even better.I lean forward and say, It's by Pablo Picasso. 'Everything you can imagine is real.'Do I notice Rachel sigh like she wishes she had ripped that damn page from the book? Can I almost hear her familiar words, delusion can't save you, trying to claw themselves to the tip of her tongue? Listen, I admire your creative mind, she says, but I can think of much more appropriate quotes. Maybe for discussion with your new therapist, you can find one about perseverance through difficult times.She stands, and I leap to my feet and hug her before she can stop me. I know therapists aren't supposed to get emotionally attached to their patients, especially the suicidal ones. She squeezes my back gently, which is more than I expected.You've really helped me, I tell her as she steps back.I am sure this remark will make her smile, even if we both know it is an exaggeration.But instead, her eyes look the way I suspect they would when she watches a sad movie curled up alone on her couch. And as I leave Rachel's office for the last time, I realize again how right she is about my feelings having the power to impact the outside world. About this mysterious correlation.On the way to the bus stop, the piece of paper with my new therapist's name and phone number makes itself known from inside my jean pocket. The damn thing is heavy like a rock. I remove the paper from my pocket and a pen from my purse and, oh yes I do, scratch out Belinda's name and number with a flurry of blue ink. On the other side, I write the Picasso quote, Everything you can imagine is real, before stuffing it back in my pocket.I pass the same homeless guy as always, sitting in his regular spot outside a liquor store with Georgie, his glam but dirty white-haired poodle. Funny, I don't know the homeless guy's name, but I do understand he needs cash to feed himself and Georgie, and he hasn't had a drink for going on two years, even though I have more than once peeked back to see him go inside the store after I give him the usual three dollars of my babysitting cash. Of course, I also understand that sometimes we all need to take the dangerous little shortcut that never gets us where we are supposed to go but does give us a teeny bit of pleasant distracting relief from the exhausting shit.In the distance, I can see my bus, a small square of vivid blue that pops out of the surrounding dull expanse of sun-bleached grey, like it is screaming to me, Remember, girl, what you learned today. And I do remember.I think about all the great ideas and inspiration I have gotten not just from Rachel but from books and the Internet, even if it meant many lonely, nerderiffic nights, lying on my bed and reading the latest non-fiction work on the nature of reality or the newest blog on what the universe is made of. I especially love how science, over the years, has exposed the greatest untruths of our existence. That the earth is flat. That the universe revolves around our little blue and green planet. That time and space and everything we see before us are real.Just then a rotten smell reaches my nose, and I assume it comes from the overflowing garbage container to my left. The supposed garbage container I can smell and see and even touch if I choose to get closer.As I plug my nose, I consider the Picasso quote, Everything you can imagine is real, and marvel at how this genius had so long ago come to the same conclusion as today's scientists. Everything we imagine is real, because that is all we do: We construct in our minds the world we live in, including all the people and objects and animals. Scientists agree our eyes don't actually see any of the things we think we see, because none of them exist. What actually does exist in our world are plain-old electrons and binary codes and magnetic fields, which are pretty damn boring and not that helpful. So our minds instead create icons like birds and trees and rocks and the homeless guy down the street. I almost lose my shit each time I realize that each of our wonderfully unique lives can all be summed up in a single mundane sentence: we create in our mind a world that gives our species enough information to navigate where to find shelter and food and how to avoid danger, so we can survive long enough to mate and pass on our genes. Anyway, our species may be able to eradicate polio and send astronauts to the moon, which sounds like amazing progress, but it simply means we are becoming better masters of our own interface, like the 12-year-old girl who reaches the highest level in her favorite video game.I study the garbage can and understand that it looks and smells and probably feels so repulsive because it is filled with germs that can make me very sick. My brain and eyes and nose and fingers all want to keep me safe. But they also want to keep me from discovering and messing with a deeper truth, because some of the best scientists agree there is something profound hiding next to the electrons and magnetic fields and all that stuff that we choose not to see.And what is it? And is it connected to the mysterious dark energy that scientists say is the dominant type of matter in our universe? And is it awesome? I feel I am on the verge of figuring this out, this one answer that would allow my very existence to suck far less and maybe even become bearable.The bus stop has no bench or shelter, and I sit on the ground meditation-style, avoiding most of the spit. I stare down and think, like really think. Nothing happens other than my bus passing by. I don't know how many other buses pass or how many long breaths I exhale in fear and frustration or how many times I rock back and forth or how many strange looks I get or how many times I pray for Mom or Dad to show up and take me home before I feel a burst of anger, and like it, and I give up thinking and start feeling. Which is better, even if much of what I feel is a dull pain rising through the concrete and into me. My legs are crossed, and near the spot where my open-toe shoes come together, I notice a clump of dandelions growing from a dirty sidewalk crack. There are three yellow flowers that look like tiny umbrellas and a third that has gone to seed, its white globe joyfully perched atop an erect stem, eagerly sharing itself with the world. People call dandelions a weed, douse them in poison, rip their heads off, try anything to destroy this unexpected beauty they can't control. These dandelions, I sense, have deep roots and screw-you grins and kind souls. Tough little motherfuckers.I stare at them as the sun drops low, my fingers and eyes caressing their soft flowers, whose colors grow brighter in the twilight. It's the strangest thing; it feels like they're staring back at this girl who is the pesky dandelion of the human world, often judged for taking root where she shouldn't, frequently trampled on by careless others, usually never seen for what she is. I smile at this thought, and then something even stranger happens. The dandelions start moving, their straight stems swaying like tall trees in a storm. Only there is no storm. Just a late-day calm, a sticky heat crying for any breeze. I cup my hand around the dandelions, the way you would protect a match from the wind. Again, there is no wind. And they keep moving, locking, and popping like hip-hop stars doing a happy dance they surely want me to notice, parachute-like seeds floating up and catching in my hair, on my eyelids.I watch until my new friends are spent, until the three flowers and the once-seedy globe pull close for the long night ahead. I stretch my back and close my eyes and don't so much think about what I witnessed as let it wash over me. I begin sensing a larger and gently loving natural world that is aware of my presence. That is making me aware of its presence. It comes to me fast, a sudden rainstorm, and I cry out because it's too much, then it slows, a warming sun on a winter day. I want to analyze it with my conscious mind, with my wildly spinning three-pound brain, though I understand this is not the way. So I take it in like you would a hard kiss or comforting embrace.At first, it communicates only in feelings, welcoming and loving, until a voice heavy with the experience of infinite lifetimes abruptly puts these feelings into words. It whispers, Your gracious soul needs to understand that humanity is a blight and family is a blight. Unless you free yourself.Then it says, It's not safe sitting here so long after sunset. You need to get up and go home.I open my eyes to see that darkness has fallen like a huge eyelid dropping over the earth. The busy street has gone ghostly quiet except for the occasional passing car or groups of noisy people lurching home from a bar. No one has checked to see if I am okay, and no one will. I am on my own, except I am not, because I have my new connection with the natural world, this universal consciousness older than the time that I have been allowed to join.I nearly crap myself when I look at my phone and see it's past 11, which means my bus is no longer running, and, worse, I have been gone almost seven hours without getting a single call or text from anyone. As I stand and start the long walk home through the human-created outer realm of my city, I sense the collective inner world opening wide for me with more hard-won knowledge. Take the busier street a block up, it's safer. You need to stop to eat and pee at the all-night McDonald's on the right. Don't make eye contact with that shirtless man standing on the corner. Don't let your beautiful, beautiful heart grow heavy.As I walk, I whisper words of encouragement to myself, not caring if I look crazy to the few people I pass, because, who knows, they may not even see a teenage girl reluctantly returning to a home where addiction has become a number one priority, where she's less like a daughter and more like a friend who comes and goes on her own. By the time I reach home and climb the stairs to our apartment, where music blares, I feel like I have tapped a source of support and knowledge that will allow me to exert some control over my life. More than that, I have become part of a far truer world that most people have been conditioned not to see.I go inside and stand in the middle of a whacked-out Friday night gathering that smells like cheap wine and puke. Everyone, especially Mom and Dad, is too wasted to notice me; it's like I am not really there, which of course is possible. Mom's ginger-haired friend Zoey finally sees me and pulls me against her pregnant belly and starts dancing, if her crashing around the room in bare feet can really be called that.I should be mad at my parents, but I am not. Because I do see that, like most other people, they are a weight on everything good and authentic in this world. More so because I love them, because I am bound to them like a leaky boat I have paddled deep into the Everglades.So when super-blitzed Mom finally lays her bloodshot eyes on me and rips me from Zoey's arms and whispers that she loves her girl and spins me around like we are sharing some precious mother-daughter time and not just stumbling through another messed-up night of epic hurt, I don't even bother telling her I no longer want or need her.For more nonconformist stories, read nonconformist-mag.com",https://miro.medium.com/max/2200/0*c09AoIqbIe11BWI-.jpg,https://medium.com/the-nonconformist/everything-you-imagine-c264e3d0779e,fiction,4a40c23fa74ff993df054fb6fd42b2048cda1e53b58ab3bc80658191
5 Steps Investors Should Take to Prepare for The Coming Debt Crisis,"Million, Billion, TrillionI recall pretty clearly that it was special to hear or read that something cost millions of Dollars or some government department spent millions on something. In rare cases, there were programs that needed Billions. I remember the mortgage crisis where reports came out that the government was supporting different groups, banks, etc. with Billions of Dollars. At the time, each newscaster emphasized ""Billion with a B"".In late 2019, we had a stock market correction - does anybody remember? Yes, a correction that showed that we had a lot of zombie companies in the market. A zombie company is a company that is not making enough money to pay its bills and not even enough to pay the interest on its loans. It keeps going out to banks and lenders to borrow more money so they can pay off one credit line with the next.If you look around, there are some people who I call ""financial zombies"". They started with a few simple purchases using their credit card, often while still in college. At some point, they reached the limit on the card and the monthly payments kept rising. At the same time, they get one offer after another for new cards. Naturally, they realize that they could get money from one card to pay the other. The new card pays the old. Normally, when your income is not sufficient anymore, and you are maxed out on too many cards, you have to declare bankruptcy. You turn into a financial zombie when the government comes out with programs that allow you to suspend payments, restructure your debts, etc. instead of letting you fail and start over.The same is true with the correction in late 2019. When stocks suddenly collapsed, the FED stepped in and provided massive amounts of funding. Most people didn't even take notice, but that was the start of the current debt and money printing spike.With the pandemic raging more severely than in any other country in the world, the FED keeps printing money to the order of about 6 Trillion Dollars. Yes, - with a ""T"".We have actually gotten used to that term and the media tells us almost daily that we need more fiscal stimulus, more trillions to help us make it through the crisis. I believe we have given up trying to understand what a Trillion really is. Yes, it is 1000 Billion. A Billion is 1000 Million. So a Trillion is 1 million Million - crazy to even imagine.If we look at the bigger picture, the United States will probably reach about 30 Trillion Dollars in national debt by the end of 2021. (I had originally written 27 Trillion, but when I checked today before posting this article, I saw we are already past 27 on our way to 30) Since that number is so large, what does it actually mean? Well, it is about 130% of GDP.GDP is the value of all goods and services we produce as a country in one year.Why is this an important milestone? When one person is giving the other person money as a loan there needs to be an expectation that the loan can be repaid. It's not so much a matter of the actual payment but the belief and trust that the person you give the money to is able and trustworthy to pay back the money.The same is true for countries and governments. It's not that well known, but other countries are actually holding our debt. The two countries that hold the biggest amounts of our debt are China and Japan.Whenever the United States wants to borrow money, it issues bonds. Bonds are papers that promise to repay the money that we are borrowing plus interest. Other countries take the paper and secure the money we want to borrow. On the bonds, it is written that we promise to pay back what we owe.What do you think about anybody who is constantly borrowing money and has now reached a point where all the money that is borrowed is at the same level as the value of everything they produce? Just think about that. The value of what they produce. Not the money they earn. The US Government ""earns"" income from taxes and fees. That's just a fraction of the value that everybody in the United States produces as value. The income from taxes is only about 3.5 Trillion in 2020.So what happens when you gave someone a loan and find out that they have 3.5 income and 27 in debt and keep taking on more debt as if there is no limit?I believe it is totally normal to assume that those countries that hold our debt are getting a little uncomfortable and wondering if they can trust us.The world saw us as trusted and respected as the global superpower, the moral police of the world, etc. Lately, we have turned many former allies or places we did a lot of commerce with into enemies. There are suggestions by the leaders in the US government not to pay the debt we owe in the bonds we issued.How is it that a nation can print money with no value or services against it? How can we keep printing money and not produce anything with it - just send it to people and companies to spend it or buy more debit/credit cards?The major reason is the fact that the US Dollar is the reserve currency of the world. Pretty much everything is paid in Dollars. Most international transactions happen in Dollars or calculated and transferred into Dollars.What happens when we lose that status as the reserve currency?Yes, the trust is lost. Yes, there will be turmoil. Some people say we will get enormous inflation. I don't think it will be hyper-inflation, but a lot nonetheless.A situation like this already exists in history, right about the time between World War I and World War II, in Austria. In his book ""The World of Yesterday"", Stefan Zweig, who actually lived at that time, described it as follows:""Every hotel in Vienna was filled with these vultures [foreign tourists]; they bought everything from toothbrushes to landed estates, they mopped up private collections and antique shop stocks before their owners, in their distress, woke to how they were being plundered. Humble hotel clerks from Switzerland, stenographers from Holland would put up in the deluxe suites of the Ringstrasse hotels. Incredible as it may seem, I can vouch for it as an eyewitness that Salzburg's first-rate Hotel de l'Europe was occupied for a period by English unemployed, who, because of Britain's generous dole were able to live more cheaply at that distinguished hostelry than in their slums at home. Whatever was not nailed down disappeared. The tidings of cheap living and cheap goods in Austria spread far and wide; greedy visitors came from Sweden or from France.""What this account describes is the fact that the value of the currency of the other countries increased so much that even homeless people and simple workers could come to Austria and live the high-life.We might not see this extreme situation, but as investors, we need to ask ourselves how we prepare for a time in the near future where we have a lot more inflation and the value of our money is going down. How do we prepare to live in times of high inflation?Step 1:The first thing you need to ask right now is: What do I own that is doing better in times of inflation and what doesn't do well.The stock market typically collapses when the economy struggles and inflation is high. Real estate and real assets do comparatively well. That's partially because the rising tide is floating all boats.If you bought a house for $100,000.00 in 2018 and now we have a lot of inflation and all similar houses now cost $200,000.00 to buy, your house has increased to that price as well. That's just because the cost of everything has gone up with inflation and keeps going up.That also means your rent from your tenants keeps going up. As prices increase everything costs more, including rent, and to pay for things, people need to make more money from their work. For you, as the investor, this means that you can pay down your mortgages quicker.Step 2If we don't get hyperinflation, which means prices increase by 50% or more per month, it will be important to have access to cash. The paper the money is printed on is losing value by the day. If opportunities like the one described about Austria in the 1920s occurred, you want to take advantage. To do that, you need to build cash reserves now. Hold cash or something that you quickly convert into cash. I like gold. You can turn it into cash all over the world. A small amount will be worth a fortune in times of high inflation. Some people believe that gold will cost $5000 or more/ounce. Imagine you only had to have 1 gold coin in your pocket and could pay for a ton of stuff easily.Step 3You do not want to own anything that is considered a long-term fixed-income investment. Bonds are such investments or anything that pays you dividends. If we had 15% inflation and you have a 10-year bond from 2018 that pays you 2% interest, you are losing money and the bond itself is losing value because it is denominated in US Dollar currency. Get rid of long-term fixed-income investments, if you have any.Step 4If you still have any adjustable-rate debt, immediately convert it into fixed-rate debt. I can't imagine that anybody still has any adjustable-rate mortgages when we currently have historically low interest rates. However, if you do have any adjustable-rate debt, convert it into long-term debt.What we often forget is that credit cards are adjustable-rate and high interest. If you have any equity in any of your assets, convert your credit card debt into mortgage debt. I would even refinance if you have to. With strong inflation coming, the associated costs of refinancing might be somewhat painful now, but soon they will have been well worth it.Step 5For all your real asset inventory in your portfolio, start developing a detailed list of things that will improve the long-term value of your asset. Have that list ready. As inflation comes around, you will improve your property for a small fraction of the value that you would need to spend now. As you know we always suggest applying the 5/5/5/ rule.That rule says that you should always take 5% of your rental income and put it into savings for vacancy. Another 5% for maintenance and minor repair. The last 5% is for CAPEX, major repairs that will increase the value of your property.As you apply the 5/5/5/ rule each month, the amount of money that accumulates in the accounts could be substantial. Ask yourself how much will you realistically need on brief notice. For that amount, you apply Step 2 so you have a modest amount of cash on hand. We should convert the rest into gold so the value increases with inflation, maybe even more. If you don't want to hold actual gold coins or bars (which I recommend), you can follow Warren Buffett and invest some money in gold mining stocks. Just be aware that it might be harder than today to convert that back into cash.If you follow these steps now, it will better prepare you for the coming financial crisis.The more you can make sure you have flexibility and access to cash, the more you will take advantage of amazing, unheard deals while holding on to your portfolio and keep collecting ever-increasing positive cash flow from your properties.The information provided above is based on my personal experience, planning, and opinion.

Female Disruptors: ,"As a part of our series about women who are shaking things up in their industry, I had the pleasure of interviewing Chelsea Rana.In her capacity as an Art Advisor, Chelsea acts as a natural catalyst between the collector and Gallery. In the community's best interest, it is their function to provide maxim exposure for the artist but also uphold its integrity for long term ownership, rather than quick flips - a current trend plaguing the veracity of the art industry. Remaining a trusted source to both galleries and collectors alike is essential business strategy for CRAA. Upholding genuine relationships give Chelsea the insider edge that her clients need to protect their investment and uphold the value in each piece.In celebration of the launch of CRAA and a culmination in her art advisory journey, Chelsea will soon embark on another cross-cultural visual endeavor entitled L.A.: Views, with international partner Maki Gallery. Opening in Omotesando, Japan on December 4th, 2020, the L.A.: Views show will feature Los Angeles based Mid-Career and Early Bluechip artists. Running until January 16th, the inaugural show focuses on Angelenos that Rana is drawn to in a cultivating artist.Innovation is key is in her artist discover. Rana seeks out artists who create new techniques or builds upon the existing. She looks for new ways that they express their subjects. Her ability to recognize innovation is due only to her in depth of knowledge in the Masters. Following the Tokyo exhibition with Maki's own collection featuring L.A. based artist Mungo Thomson as one of the first shows outside of Japanese artists, this show featuring the likes of Sayre Gomez's modern art and Gabriella Sanchez' graphic and Latinx typography and double entendres at Maki's second location. It will be only the first non post war avant-garde Japanese shows held in the 2003 brand gallery.This distinct honor of bringing in American art prior to auction houses, which inflates value making in difficult for Japanese patrons to acquire, gives CRAA the trusted responsibility to help shape the contemporary art scene in Japan. It is Chelsea Rana Art Advisory eye, expertise and ultimately experiences, of whom the show exhibits, will define the representation of Los Angeles work as it appears in Japanese Culture.Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your ""backstory""? What led you to this particular career path?Thank you for having me! I am the founder of Chelsea Rana Art Advisory. Prior to founding my own company, I worked in galleries and then later co-founded an advisory firm. I developed my passion for art long before I was fortunate to get my start working in galleries. I had an opportunity to live in Europe and Asia for an extended period of time and that opened my eyes and ears to the diversity of art. Throughout my career path, I've always held onto my basic principles, which is working with kindness, transparency, empathy and honesty. My clients know that I work to get the best results for them, rather than just making a sale, which has translated into long-lasting relationships.Can you tell our readers what it is about the work you're doing that's disruptive?The exhibition that I recently curated, L.A.: Views, which is currently on view at MAKI Gallery in Tokyo Japan, is a group show comprised of paintings and sculptures by Los Angeles-based artists. Many of the artists in the show are early to mid-career so Japanese collectors are getting early exposure to these artists that they wouldn't have otherwise. Japanese collectors typically learn about Western artists from auction houses, and by the time an artist has work in an auction, their prices are already quite high which excludes many would-be-collectors. MAKI Gallery is the perfect gallery for this exhibition. I say this not only have I known and worked with the founders for quite some time, but also because MAKI Gallery is very forward-thinking and highly-esteemed, with collectors looking to MAKI Gallery for early talent.We all need a little help along the journey. Who have been some of your mentors? Can you share a story about how they made an impact?I've been really blessed to have had a number of mentors in my life. I spent years living in Europe and Asia which allowed me to cultivate deep relationships with different types of people from all around the world. Each has taught me something different, whether about art, or business, or even just life, and I feel that I carry a little bit of each of their philosophies with me. The most impactful advice that I've received is that there is no need to rush into things. By taking the time to be truly thoughtful before acting, I will always be happy with the end result.In today's parlance, being disruptive is usually a positive adjective. But is disrupting always good? When do we say the converse, that a system or structure has 'withstood the test of time'? Can you articulate to our readers when disrupting an industry is positive, and when disrupting an industry is 'not so positive'? Can you share some examples of what you mean?Absolutely. An example of disruption being positive that relates back to my L.A.: Views exhibition at MAKI Gallery is that by bridging the gap between Tokyo and Los Angeles via an art exhibition making the world a little smaller. It's a net positive result for everyone. The Japanese collectors are able to see, learn about, and collect artwork by talented artists that they otherwise wouldn't have known about until much later in that artist's career. Through this exposure, the artist is able to acquire new patrons which can lead to career-changing opportunities such as more recognition and inclusion in museums. With that being said, disruption can be negative when done thoughtlessly. Even though the goal of showing an artist's work to a new market is to gain new collectors for that artist, we have to make sure that these new collectors have good intentions. In today's speculative market, it's more important than ever to take time with placements and make sure that the artworks enter collections where they will remain and be appreciated without being flipped.We are sure you aren't done. How are you going to shake things up next?Even though L.A.: Views is still on view, I'm already thinking about curating another show. I also have a few more projects with MAKI Gallery in the works.Can you please give us your favorite ""Life Lesson Quote""? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?""We need art to remind us why life is worth living. We need art to reawaken our sense of the wonder of being, to remind us of our freedom, and to highlight the things in our culture that enable us to withstand the dreaded visage of death.""

"The Reason That Web Templates Fail, and Why Custom Design Is Always Best","The website development process contains a lot of variables. As developers we often want to reduce the scope for error by establishing patterns in our work. This comes in the form of reusable objects and functions, as well as processes like client questionnaires and launch checklists.But often, we developers can take the idea of standardization a little too far. It's appealing to use templates to achieve our goals more quickly and earn a greater profit from the work.But I have been around this particular block countless times, and with every journey I am drawn back to developing my own custom solutions based on the individual needs of the client.Let me tell you how I've come to this conclusion, then share what I do instead.I've been a web developer for 15 years but I set up my current business three years ago. Right from the outset, one of my goals was simplicity. I wanted to lead my clients through the web development process in a standardized way, free from the variants that often plague web design projects.So I built my own reusable templates.My solution was to let WordPress do its thing as a CMS and leverage Gutenberg to create custom blocks that I could use on every client website. This way I could retain fine-grained control of the front-end and use WP to handle the data.You might be thinking ""that sounds great!"", and in many ways, it is.For three years I have ruthlessly improved the way I build websites, shaving off delivery time and striving for greater simplicity with each iteration.This has enabled me to find innovative ways to deliver websites for my clients quickly. Out of this process came the idea of the Russian Doll Principle.I developed this model to help distinguish the nested levels of content within the website:This system essentially meant that I could turn WordPress into a product - the same files and fields used by every website, with some simple adjustments to the CSS to make each site its own. It worked, and I was creating websites at speed.But with standardization, you can go too far.From a business perspective, templating makes total sense. It's quicker for you, and it's cheaper for the customer. It also puts a lot of power into the hands of lesser-skilled developers and clients alike, lowering the entry barrier for creating content on the web.But this simplicity is also its downfall.What I began to notice when developing websites in this way, was that my page designs were missing something. They didn't look bad, they just lacked character.Each page comprised a series of reusable blocks. For example, a heading, a paragraph, a list of blog posts and then a form. Each item, neatly contained within its own component. From a web developer's perspective, it doesn't get much more elegant than this.But the problem with designing pages this way is that you end up with a bunch of disparate objects that just float around without any coherent design system bringing them all together.In writing, this would be akin placing several paragraphs of text on a page without linking one to the next. The reader would lose the thread. In visual design, the user senses something is missing: a unifying theme that helps it all make sense.For me, this lack of cohesion in the page design negates any time or money saved. It doesn't matter how elegant the delivery process is if the end result is lacking. This is standardization run amok.Upon realizing this, I iterated my processes once again.As you've now seen, I am a big advocate of repeatability. I believe that many freelancers and small agencies eventually fall over themselves because they don't invest enough time in creating sustainability in the way they deliver website projects.But as you've also seen, I believe you can go too deep. This is what I did, and now I'm climbing back up out of the hole.The problem with the process I outlined above is that I was skipping a fundamental aspect of the website design process: the design stage!This seems pretty obvious now. But every time you use templates or reusable blocks, you're not really designing. You're building. This is absolutely fine - in fact it should be encouraged - but only if you have already gone through a design stage to meet the needs of your particular client.When you visually conceive a page - in Sketch, Illustrator or some application like that - you create inherent aesthetic cohesion, the missing piece I described earlier.Having gone through this process and into front-end development, you will mostly likely divide your work into segments to establish repeatable patterns and blocks anyway. But the magic happens during this visual conception phase. Without it, the design just... lacks soul.Ironically, I used to be furiously against templating of any kind. I sensed that somewhere in that process, creativity would be lost.But what I have learned, is that you can leverage both the ideas of custom design and standardization to create your best work. Standardization enables you to think in systems, logically, where customization empowers your creativity. The two are symbiotic.The challenge, of course, is finding a balance between the two.If you enjoyed this article please consider subscribing to my newsletter for more.",,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-reason-that-web-templates-fail-and-why-custom-design-is-always-best-c43650311615,design,04b2bc07214a2a3019b8313fc83a68e00315c76a202fbb55af922f9e

A picture of a bird in an A.I. dataset would be manually tagged ""bird"" so that the algorithm associated aspects of that image with the category ""bird.""The process of tagging this data, by hand, scaled to the millions, is time-consuming and mind-numbingly monotonous.Much of this work is done outside the United States and other Western countries and exploits workers from around the world, according to a new paper from Princeton, Cornell, University of Montreal, and the National Institute of Statistical Sciences.Data-labeling companies like Sama (formerly Samasource), Mighty AI, and Scale AI use labor from sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, paying employees as little as $8 per day. Meanwhile, these companies earn tens of millions of dollars in revenue per year.Take Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online gig working platform where anyone in the world can log on and perform simple tasks for a few cents each. Until 2019, Mechanical Turk required a U.S. bank account to get paid, meaning that anyone working for the platform without access to U.S. banking wouldn't even be paid in legal currency. Instead they were compensated in Amazon gift cards.One of the most impactful datasets in the history of artificial intelligence, ImageNet, relied on Mechanical Turk workers who were paid $2 per hour, according to the paper.Furthermore, the data being tagged has been selected by developers and programmers in the United States or other Western countries, meaning they often exclude global culture context.""Images of grooms are classified with lower accuracy when they come from Ethiopia and Pakistan, compared to images of grooms from the United States,"" the paper says. ""Many of these workers are contributing to AI systems that are likely to be biased against underrepresented populations in the locales they are deployed in, and may not be directly benefiting their local communities.""A potential fix for this, the researchers write, is simply integrating these data labelers into the A.I. development process, rather than keeping them as gig workers making cents per image labeled. Workers would be paid equitably, and their insight and expertise would help address disparity in the data collection process, improving the accuracy of the product overall.The paper points to Masakhane, an organization dedicated to the preservation of African languages through artificial intelligence as an example of equitable A.I. development. Masakhane doesn't create data for A.I. researchers, but instead fosters a community of people who label, research, and build algorithms for the African continent.""We can likely connect you with annotators or translators but we do not support shallow engagement of Africans as only data generators or consumers,"" the organization wrote on its website.And if companies already include data labelers in the process, the paper says, these individuals should be given the opportunity to grow inside the company.""We suggest viewing AI development as a path forward for economic development,"" they write. ""This development activity should not be focused on low-productivity activities, such as data-labeling, but instead on high-productivity activities like model development/deployment and research.""",https://miro.medium.com/max/4910/1*a0iiUOdG2fonXqrAO2u9uw.png,https://onezero.medium.com/the-a-i-industry-is-exploiting-gig-workers-around-the-world-sometimes-for-just-8-a-day-288dcce9c047,artificial-intelligence,4b288cae77d2b5d9650e3da19a3aede2553f62cf32929e3c23c0c7b3
How to download and visualize your Twitter network,"Social Network Analysis (SNA) is an incredibly interesting field of research in itself as well as a useful skillset for data scientists to apply to other fields. In this tutorial, we will use a Python package, Tweepy, to download Twitter data from the Twitter API and another Python package, NetworkX, to build a network out of that data and run some analysis. Finally, we will use Gephi to visualize the network.According to Wikipedia,It has made its way into virtually every field - again, according to Wikipedia:Twitter offers a free REST API to stream data in realtime and download historical data in chunks. Jaime Zornoza has written some great tutorials on using the API for both streaming and downloading data, so if you're looking to get started with using the API, I'd suggest going through those first.To get started, we will build a network using my personal Twitter account (@ stevehedden). To do this, we'll start with a list of all of my followers (about 450). Then we'll get all of the followers of those 450 accounts. To save time, for accounts with more than 5,000 followers, I will only scrape the first 5,000 of their followers.First, we need to import the Tweepy and pandas packages.Then we need to enter our Twitter API credentials. If you don't have these already, you will need to go to https://apps.twitter.com/ and ""create an app"". After you create an app, go to ""Keys and Tokens"" to get your tokens.With Tweepy, we can use these credentials to connect to the Twitter API and begin downloading data. The following code just uses the credentials entered above to connect to the API. Since we are going to be downloading pretty big datasets it is important to specify some parameters when we initialize the API. We set 'wait_on_rate_limit' and 'wait_on_rate_limit_notify' to True. There are rate limits when downloading data from Twitter - you can only make a limited number of download requests to the API in a given time frame. By setting these parameters to True, we won't break the connection to the API when we hit these limits. Instead, we'll just wait until the timeout ends and we can continue downloading data.To start the data download, we will get all of the followers from an individual user. To get this, you need the user ID of the user. You can get the user ID of a user if you know their screen name using the code below.My user id is: 1210627806A network consists of nodes (or vertices) and links (or edges). For this network, we will use individual user accounts as nodes and followers as links. Our goal, therefore, is to create an edge DataFrame of user IDs with two columns: source and target. For each row, the target follows the source. To start, we want to list all of my followers as targets.The screenshot above shows the structure of the DataFrame we want to create. The first column, the ""source"", is my user ID (1210627806) and the second column, the ""target"", are all of my followers.The following code creates a list of my 450 followers.Now that we have a list of all the followers we can put them into a DataFrame.But this is not a very interesting network. To visualize this simple network, we can use the NetworkX package to convert the DataFrame into a graph or network.Then we plot the graph using matplotlib.The code above renders the following visual - not very interesting.What we really want is to get all of the followers of these 450 users. To do this, we will loop through the list of all those 450 users, get their followers, and add those links to the original DataFrame. This is the code that will take a very long time to run because of the rate limits.This code is very similar to the code above in that it gets all the followers of a given user ID. The major difference is that instead of feeding in just one account, we are looping through all 450 accounts that follow me. Another difference is that if an account has more than 5000 followers, we only take the first 5000 followers. This is because of the way the API works. Each API request will only return 5000 accounts. So if we want all followers from an account that has, say, one million followers, we would need to make 200 individuals requests.Because of the rate limits, I left this running overnight to get all the data. It makes 15 API requests, then has to wait for 15 minutes, then makes another 15 requests, and so on. So it can take a long time.Once this is done running, you should have a csv with all of the edges of the network. I wrote this all to a csv just so that if it breaks while running I still have all the edges already scraped.Now read the csv and turn the df into a graph using NetworkX.Once the data has been converted to a graph, we can run some basic network analytics.There are 716, 653 nodes in my network!We can also find the most influential nodes in the network using centrality measures. The most simple measure of centrality is Degree Centrality, which is just a function of the number of connections each node has. The following code finds the number of connections each node has i.e. the degree of each node and sorts them in descending order.The node in my network with the highest degree is node 37728789 or @ TheSolarCo. TheSolarCo has a degree of 5039. 5000 of these connections are the 5000 followers of this node that we scraped. But this means there are 39 additional connections - meaning TheSolarCo follows 39 accounts that follow me. To get the username of an account given the user ID use the following code, similar to how we got our user ID above.Because the network is so big now (over 700K nodes), any analytics will take a long time to run and any visualization will be a complete mess. For the rest of this tutorial, we will filter the network down to a more manageable number of nodes. We do this using the k_core function of NetworkX. The k_core function filters out nodes with degree less than a given number, k. In this example, I set k equal to 10, which reduces the number of nodes in the graph to about 1000.With this smaller graph we can easily do some network analytics. We start by splitting the graph into groups using a community detection algorithm.We need to run the degree centrality code again now that our network is smaller.Now that we have the nodes split into groups and the degree of each node, we combine these into one DataFrame.Now your DataFrame should look something like this.Now we can visualize this graph using the following code.This should create graph that looks something like this.What a mess. I'm sure there are ways to make that visual look better using matplotlib, but at this point, I always just export the files to csv format and use Gephi to visualize. Gephi is an open-source network analysis and visualization software. You should be able to easily install it for free from their website. It's pretty easy to get started and allows for some really beautiful visualizations. If you have never used Gephi, here is a good tutorial to get started from Luca Hammer.To use Gephi, first you need to export the node list and the edge list as csv files.You can follow the Gephi tutorial I mentioned above to import these files into Gephi and start visualizing your network. Here is what mine looks like.Hopefully, you were able to follow along without too many issues.

Clubhouse Assumes that Black Folk Equates Celebrity with Community,"Every night feels like Friday night on Clubhouse.I got an unexpected invite to the app from a fellow Black writer on Medium on January 30th in anticipation of a room she and a few other writers and editors of color (#weoc). I have not socialized with anyone outside my immediate family and friend circle since COVID took over in March 2020, and was eager for community.I spent the rest of that evening floating through the rooms. OutKast's ""Spottieottiedopaliscious"" hummed in the back of my mind as I floated in and out of rooms. My libidinal energy was supercharged with Blackness. My journalistic impulses took over and I decided to document and find the story of this app, valued at $1 billion dollars by white people, with a Black man as the picture on the avatar, in a space where so many of the app's rooms were moderated by Black people, with majority Black audiences, discussing Black issues.Clubhouse is a petri dish on how Black personhood adapts to living and loving within a technologically evolving white supremacist society. Science-fiction, and predictions of technology into the future, do not consider Blackness. Yet here we are, writing ourselves into the source code of an app white people are staking their fortunes and reputations into. How does Blackness form community in such an environment? And how do the algorithms of whiteness assume the ways in which Black people form community?This is a chronological journal of what I found.Saturday, January 30th, 202121 Savage was the first person to pop up in my People to Follow feed. I heard tell about how in December 2020 he emerged as a voice of reason by moderating a tense discussion between Akademiks and Meek Mill. As a former educator, I'd often sing ""Bank Account"" with my students. Those are fond memories.I instantly followed and then went to bed at 9 PM.Sunday, January 31st, 2021I spent the morning in the Black writer's community group, where Medium's writers and editors of color (#weoc) put me on game. It eased the loneliness that comes with writing and not knowing if you would ever be able to dedicate your life to the craft and make it financially stable.Later, during my Sunday dinner routine (grilled potatoes, grilled steaks, grilled everything) I bounced from room to room. Love was on the mind of Black folk that evening, with me bouncing in and being a fly on the wall in the following rooms:· Courtship and Black Dating - Is it Dying if so Why?· Normalize leaving after the 1st Red Flag· Baby Mommas ask baby daddy's hard questions.I've been happily married for nearly a decade, so I had nothing to contribute. These rooms would not contain my tribe. It was both nice and disheartening, though, to listen to young Black folk (I am amazed how frequently I'm referring to people as young) come around the world and discuss how to love in a world that was not programmed to foster and nurture their love. I could have done less with the men in the Baby Momma room saying the word female though.The morning offered community. The evening did not.Monday, February 1st, 2021Leave it to Elon Musk to steal the thunder from the first day of Black History Month.I logged onto Clubhouse while I started making chicken marsala to find the most popular room being ""Elon Musk going to Mars but will Black Lives Matter there?"" For over an hour, I kept my hand up, hoping to contribute to the persistence of Blackness in the future and why such endurance threatens white industrialists like Musk.The habit of conversations about the future of Blackness is that they tend to be speculative rather than historical. We don't need to imagine what Musk is going to do with Black Lives Matter when he gets on his rocket and lives within his dome with his other rich industrialists on Mars. The New York Times reported years ago of the discrimination rampant in his Tesla plants. He has taken steps since then to repair the damage by making Juneteenth a paid work holiday and speaking out against the lack of charges against the officers who watched Derek Chauvin choke the life from George Floyd. For men like Musk, being on the right side of history meant focusing on the bottom line. #blacklivesmatter is fashionable now for most of the nation, and he had to be prepared to enter a Black space like Clubhouse.But I also know that he'd rather not deal with all of it on Mars. Musk stays in conversation with other billionaires and techies, which is exclusively the white boy's club that sees Clubhouse being worth a billion. There will be police on Mars. It will be designed so that only the rich can come, with domestic grunts kept in line by force - Ayn Rand written across the Milky Way.After an hour of waiting and not being called upon, I went to a room called ""Trust is Very Delicate."" 21 Savage was in the room. In the short time I was present, he did not speak.The gravitational force of celebrity drew me in on this day.Tuesday, February 2nd, 2021I had a long day of work meetings that bled into the evening. I also have an eight-month old who crawled for the first time; my evening was spent taking tons of pics on my new iPhone 12. I whipped up a quick meal for my family and bounced quickly between two rooms: ""GAIN 200+ FOLLOWERS. MUTE YOUR MIC AND PING YOUR FRIENDS."" And ""Professional WOC: The One Scary Thing I Did This Week."" Here I was, searching for community when I should have been paying attention to celebrity.I somehow missed the room of the night where some brave soul asked Tory Lanez the question on the Black community's mind:Every night is Friday night on Clubhouse.Wednesday, February 3rd, 2021""This nigga Uzi really put a diamond in his head!""""Nigga look like Thanos.""""I'm sayin' this in my best Baltimore accent - STOOPID!""21 Savage, in the room ""Y'all let me slip? Sayless,"" finally offered his wisdom regarding Lil' Uzi Vert's cosmetic decision to the various plebs like me watching with hands up. ""Y'all must be stupid as hell to think that diamond is worth $24 mil. Only time I'm buying diamonds is if I'm worth at least $2 billion.""This was the sort of carrying on COVID deprived me of. It was classic Black barbershop talk, among the most consistent communal experiences of Black men. But instead of creating conjecture with the dude waiting to get his bald fade, we got to hear from 21 Savage himself on how stupid he thought Uzi's latest cosmetic decision was.It was on this evening that I also noticed I tended to go into rooms, however briefly, where 21 was a moderator. I could no longer feign journalistic interest. I could not find escape velocity from the orbit of celebrity. 21 was the very first person Clubhouse recommended I follow. Why did the algorithm recommend this choice to me? And what did it have to do with whiteness and Blackness? I was curious because I found myself not being to help myself in following 21 in whatever rooms he chose to visit.I have a hunch. White people believe that Black folk seeks community in celebrity. It is by their hand that poverty and incarceration visits my people so frequently. In the cages of both white supremacy and COVID - and the disparate illness and death this pandemic has wrought shows it is another tool of white supremacy - is the assumption that Black people, on social media, will be attracted to the brightest stars in our period of social isolation?Bomani, the Black man who is the avatar icon of the Clubhouse app, hosted a room called ""Text me nice things 323-676-0936."" I popped in for five minutes and listened to him strum guitar and pick on random ladies in the rafters to sing with him. The next room I went into was ""The Music Industry Room.Artist.A&Rs.Execs.HITS ONLY,"" where various Clubhouse members played their tracks for music executive moderators. Again, community formed around potential celebrity.I went back to 21's room. The conversation now was a heated talk on pescatarians and how hard it was for Black people to adhere to the diet.""I try to be a pescatarian but I go to the Jamaican spot and get me some oxtail,"" one of the moderators dryly noted.""Popeye's mashed potatoes got meat in it!"" So did the Cajun rice before they took it off the menu, an act that feels like a hate crime.Thursday, 2/4/20201The final Clubhouse room I visited was ""No, black men don't want to take accountability."" I made it as I, inspired by 21's room last night, tried to make some pan-seared cod with jollof rice.The room was moderated both by men and women debating if Black men could do more to close the pay gap. Who is responsible for promotions? Do white people in corporate American force Black men and women to compete with each other? Or are they not responsible, and what we are seeing is a melaninated, patriarchal struggle?I raised my hand. After 45 minutes, I was made a moderator. By this time I had screwed up the cod; too salty. My wireless headset was in. I unmuted my mic and as I put the cod to the side, spoke into the community and said my piece. ""The problem here is that the men in the room are not mentioning their privilege. One of the ladies in here earlier mentioned intersectionality as a framework for understanding oppression and disparities. I understand it's hard for people who have been put down for so long to acknowledge that there are others who suffer too. But fellas, this ain't the Oppression Olympics. We are all in this together, and we have to listen to Black women.""There was no talkback. I got back to my phone. The room was empty.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2316/1*OaOXKlxVnzs6JuDRvycmLg.jpeg,https://medium.com/established-in-1865/clubhouse-assumes-that-black-folk-equates-celebrity-with-community-119253c31568,social-media,4c154b20df6097d128dafe582fb0e1f4c37b00265a0b9791714b7862
I Treat Severe Anxiety With Psychedelics,"""After the clinical trial, half of the participants reported substantial increases in life satisfaction and positive behaviour""""My anxiety developed when I was diagnosed with epilepsy eleven years ago,"" explained John*, as he led me on a Sunday morning nature trail to a mushroom picking hotspot in Yorkshire.""But I never really recognised my problem until I got knocked off my bike two years ago. I had 15 staples in my head and was hospitalised for three days. That brought it to the forefront. I realised I had quite a bad anxiety problem.""John, 29, forms part of a growing subculture of people who are self-medicating their mental health issues with psilocybin - the naturally occurring psychedelic compound within magic mushrooms - while risking up to seven years in prison. With his tightly knotted hiking boots, army-green waterproof jacket and large rucksack, he looks like any other early morning rambler.""I first tried magic mushrooms with a couple of friends eight years ago. Years later I read Professor Nutt's book Drugs Without the Hot Air and was interested to learn about the links between psilocybin, anxiety and depression. After reading that book I decided to start foraging for mushrooms myself.""From my own experience, it does have a positive effect on anxiety. As soon as I 'come down' off the mushrooms, any thoughts of anxiety that are going through my mind immediately evaporate. It just goes in an instant... melts away. The feeling of wellbeing lasts a month or two until something, usually an epileptic fit, will trigger off the negative thoughts again.After doing some research online, so I knew what I was looking for, I managed to find a couple of local fields that I forage on when the season comes.""During the off-season I have had to find other avenues to get hold of mushrooms, including ordering them online or buying ones grown indoors. But for me nothing beats the romance of picking my own medication. Psychedelics are something that I've grown to respect, so I mainly leave it to the season as I don't want to overdo it and it lose the effect.""I think they have a great potential for naturally treating mental health issues without using synthetic drugs, which invariably come with a string of nasty side effects.""""What we're looking at is a largely unexplored technology for brain science - it was discovered in the 1940s, set the psychiatry world ablaze in the 1950s, and was aborted by widespread recreational abuse, the reaction of the media and its confluence with the Vietnam war,"" argues David Nichols, a Purdue University pharmacologist, in an article for the Journal of Psychopharmacology.James Rucker, a leading psychiatrist at King's College London, recently spoke out against the law surrounding psychedelic drugs, which he believes is hampering research into their prospective medicinal benefits. On psilocybin and LSD, he said he believes the Government should 'downgrade their unnecessarily restrictive class-A', citing that they were 'extensively used and researched in clinical psychiatry' before their prohibition in 1967′.One of the first studies in 40 years into the therapeutic effects of psilocybin was conducted by Roland Griffiths, of Johns Hopkins University in the US, and more than half of participants said the experience was among 'the most significant of their lives'. The 2008 study, which was published in Journal of Psychopharmacology, took a sample of 36 participants who had never used the drug before. Six were given a placebo drug and the rest 30 milligrams of pure psilocybin.The volunteers in the psilocybin condition widely reported positive experiences - repeatedly described as a 'sense of unity'. The experience was generally described as a profound spiritual event. Fourteen months after the clinical trial, over half of the participants in the psilocybin condition reported substantial increases in life satisfaction and positive behaviour. No negative experiences were noted whatsoever.Despite these findings shedding some much needed light on the topic, it's useful to note that generalising these findings across society would be difficult due to the small sample and the fact that prospective volunteers with personal or family histories of psychotic disorders were disqualified from taking part. In an accompanying article, Griffiths acknowledges that while being physiologically non-toxic and non-addictive, users of psilocybin may experience short-term stress and panic or trigger pre-existing psychosis.A 2011 study, published in Archives of General Psychiatry, found that low doses of psilocybin improved the mood and reduced the anxiety of 12 late-stage terminal cancer patients. These finding were backed up two years later in a study, published in Experimental Brain Research, which demonstrated that dosing mice with a purified form of psilocybin reduced their outward signs of fear.In 2012, researchers battled through reams of red tape as the result of the negative connotations surrounding the drug, and were eventually able to test the psychoactive effects of magic mushrooms.The team's study, published in British Journal of Psychiatry, found volunteers given psilocybin experienced cues to vividly remember really positive events in their lives - such as their wedding day or the birth of their child.It does seem there is little evidence that psilocybin is unsafe in a controlled setting, and even less evidence that it has addictive potential - or is even habitual at all - but plenty of evidence that suggests its prospective therapeutic benefits.Taking that into account, isn't it time that we let go of old prejudices and loosen the laws surrounding psilocybin in medical research? I say yes. Mental health is one of the most important issues of our times; we should be pouring funding into studies on how to treat it, instead of hampering the scientists.The human race have reaped the rewards of the these psychoactive mushrooms for millennia, since they grew in the Elysian fields of Greece, yet we still know very little about how they work, or how they can benefit us. It seems that until we wise up, people like John, an otherwise totally law abiding citizen, will continue to break the law.John's name has been changed to protect his anonymity.Follow Simon Doherty on Medium, Twitter or Instagram.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1998/1*l2MHIiIT_c-EKyCi9yEN7g.jpeg,https://medium.com/the-shadow/treating-severe-anxiety-with-magic-mushrooms-f972175d343e,mental-health,4c374504c322bdb546bd8451e6edd69ea70dd49750546fa92c6738c1
An Epidemic of Sleeplessness,"Back as an undergraduate student, I took great pride in getting by with only five or six hours of sleep per night. Staying up late studying, waking up early to get a head start on that lab report... Some of these practices have stayed with me up to this day. However, while reading Matthew Walker's Why We Sleep, that attitude of getting more done by sacrificing sleep was quickly vanishing. And it doesn't stop there. Evidently, insufficient sleep does not only impair your creativity and productivity at work, but also negatively impacts your cardiovascular system, immune system, reproductive system, metabolism, cognitive abilities, emotional stability, and genetic material. In brief, insufficient sleep is a perfect recipe for a shortened, lower-quality life.Interestingly, over the span of a century, human beings have abandoned their biologically evolved sleep habits that took Mother Nature 3.4 million years to instil. Industrialization led us to wake up unnaturally (through factory whistles and later alarm clocks) and also stay up for much longer due to the advent of incandescent light bulbs, delaying the trigger signal that leads to the onset of sleep. As a result, our society is now in a silent sleeplessness epidemic that has catastrophic impacts on our health, life expectancy, safety, productivity, and education.Sleep is governed by a variety of biological and chemical factors, the onset of which is determined by the release of melatonin. However, the two main factors that govern wake and sleep are 1) your circadian rhythm and 2) sleep pressure, represented by the build-up of adenosine in your brain while awake. Once asleep, adenosine levels rapidly decline, resembling the discharge of a capacitor. The greater the distance between the adenosine levels (high) and the circadian rhythm (low), the greater the urge to sleep (see figure below).Sleep can be broadly divided into rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. While NREM sleep seems to be important for memory consolidation, REM sleep plays a vital role in integrating those newly formed memories into existing ones as well as nurturing emotional, social, and creative capabilities. Interestingly, during NREM sleep, the themes you experienced while awake seem to be replayed in an autobiographical fashion, only much faster, as can be seen by investigating the brain waves during this period. As Walker writes:It is worth noting that, apart from information reflection and integration, NREM and REM sleep are integral for a much wider array of restorative tasks. However, these tasks are well beyond the scope of this article.Throughout this book, Walker emphasizes the importance of sleep and how detrimental a lack of it can be, for all parties involved. It would take me too long to cover each of the studies he introduces in detail, so here is a brief summary of the most sobering findings:According to Walker, a healthy seven to nine hours of sleep per night is the cheapest medicine there is and can prevent many of the harmful consequences outlined above. In his own words:For information on how to obtain a good night's sleep, Walker refers the reader to this website, which includes easy-to-do and helpful tips involving factors such as light and temperature control.

Rolling funds: An old frontier,"February 5, 2020 was a big day in venture capital. AngelList announced a new way to raise capital: the rolling fund.¹The core idea is simple. Instead of a single fundraise establishing a committed capital base, venture capitalists can garner quarterly commitments, giving them fresh capital each quarter to invest. This is a radical departure from how traditional VC firms work.The biggest rolling funds are actually quite sizeable. Sahil Lavingia, founder of Gumroad, expects to deploy $8 million a year - which is the size of a proper pre-seed fund!Here is how AngelList itself describes its creation:""Similar to how SAFEs brought high-resolution fundraising to startups, Rolling Venture Funds brings high-resolution fundraising to venture funds. With a Rolling Venture Fund, fund managers can now accept new capital in the form of auto-renewing quarterly commitments.""These are big words! SAFEs were arguably the most important structural innovation in venture in the 2010s. Will rolling funds similarly live up to that comparison and be the transformative structure for venture in the 2020s? That's the 130 billion dollar question.So, a week after the anniversary of their launch, let's review: how should we think about rolling funds?What are rolling funds?Rolling funds are based on a single premise: instead of raising a whole fund at once, fund managers can raise the fund one quarter at a time. This is where the ""rolling"" part comes in: the opportunity to invest comes once a quarter instead of being fixed in time with dedicated close dates and painful roadshows.Technically, venture capitalist firms raise several venture capital funds - for example, Sequoia Capital will raise Sequoia Fund I, Sequoia Fund II, etc, and formally it is this legal entity that invests.² The partners at Sequoia spent months (for less famous venture capitalists it can take years) talking to big institutions and convincing them to commit money to the fund,³ and they agree to manage the fund for a contractually defined timeframe. This process is extremely painful and a huge barrier to entry - to be a VC, you might need to be able to sustain yourself without receiving any income for years while you fundraise. And since you have to raise it all at once, if you don't succeed at raising a huge sum you will not be able to successfully create your fund at all.The traditional approach introduces three problems:Rolling funds solve each one of these problems, creating not one but three value propositions for fund managers:Rolling funds are entirely managed through AngelList. Fund managers define their closing conditions, like the minimum investment size. Investors can also pre-commit to funding several quarters at once, giving star rolling fund managers something resembling a permanent capital base.The way this is legally handled is not by a rolling close but a vast proliferation of entities. In other words, each quarter, AngelList creates a new limited partnership to manage that quarter's commitments. This is necessary because if you invested in Lambda School in Quarter t, you would not want the investors who didn't take the risk early on to be able to invest in Quarter t+8 and get a share of the returns.⁴As you can tell, this creates meaningful administration complexity on top of the existing madness of running a fund. To deal with this, AngelList leveraged its experience with syndicates and funds to create a back office for rolling fund managers. You don't have to leave their platform: they'll create the legal entities, hold the committed capital, wire the funds for you, and more. They even have staff to, for example, provide common side letters. This last piece is rarely discussed but it's essential - if the point of rolling funds is to decrease the overhead of running a fund, reducing the administration to zero through operational experience and technology is a critical piece.⁵ AngelList already had most of this infrastructure for its fund product and simply repurposed it.Due to the low capital commitment and flexible investing structure, rolling funds are a sort of scout fund in reverse: a diverse set of investors who can provide support and deal flow to the whole portfolio because they would like to invest but probably couldn't have met the bite size on their own. Traditionally, scout funds solved this problem by having a big, traditional fund with lots of commitments and contracting with relevant operators, promising some of the returns. Rolling funds also give operators the chance to play under a fund's banner, but they solve the problem by allowing these same people to pool their money with checks that would be too small to be interesting for a big fundraise - and arguably, this is a little better since it makes the scouts have skin in the game.By having commitments on a quarterly basis, rolling funds introduce an unprecedented amount of flexibility to VC. Because each fund closes quarterly, new fund managers can start small and build momentum. With the old fund structure this would be impossible because they would have to deploy the old fund, and if they started to see success they wouldn't be able to capitalize on it quickly because of the cadence of a traditional fundraise. It also means that fund managers could have, for example, seasonal funds (say, a rolling fund manager who only invests in the summers) or take a break and regroup after a rough year or important life event, like a new child or a sick parent.AngelList is perhaps the perfect firm to have invented rolling funds because they also commoditized the syndicate.⁶ In fact, you can think of rolling funds as an obvious expansion of syndicates: instead of people banding together over the internet to invest in a single startup, they now band together to invest in a single fund.Who will this affect most?Let's talk about which slices of VC will be most dramatically affected by rolling funds.The first is micro-VC, which is defined as early-stage VC funds with less than $50m. This is probably the most obvious. The traditional fund route involves a high fixed cost regardless of the dollar amount raised, both fiscal (plane rides add up) and psychic (smaller checks, same boot leather). In exchange for all that pain, you get what, $10 million after a year plus of fundraising? Plus a business structure designed for funds with much larger capital bases? No, thank you. With a rolling fund you can get just as much money, albeit with less certainty for the life of the fund. It makes way more sense at that dollar amount to just take the money as you get it and invest. For example, Cindy Bi, who is a super angel with a strong track record, has sung the praises of rolling funds and the massive increase in speed that they gave her fundraise. That also allows fund managers to establish a track record during the fundraising process, which can grease the wheels for larger, later closes.The next big group to be transformed is operators. I wrote earlier this year about the rise of operator investors - funnily enough, just a week and a half before the announcement of rolling funds. Founders increasingly want other operators to be their investors. The problem? Operators usually don't have enough liquidity to invest on their own, and they don't have the time to raise a proper fund (nor could they; being a current operator is part of their appeal). Because of the flexibility and backend tools of rolling funds, operators don't have to have the same time commitment they would need if they were running a normal fund too, which means that more operators will have the time to run rolling funds. That said, you already saw bigger founders like Rahul Vohra raising capital before there were rolling funds, so arguably the biggest barrier was the rails AngelList already provided.And lastly, you have scout funds, which rolling funds will largely replace. Rolling funds aren't in obvious conflict with the existence of scout funds since, ostensibly, the main function they serve is creating a deal funnel to larger VCs. Maybe so for the funds, but not so for the scouts themselves: their problem is lack of access to capital. Scout funds solve this by giving scouts enough money to invest, but the scale is quite small - 5-10 checks that are tiny and meant to be written at the earliest stages. If the top 300 scouts can raise small rolling funds that give them 2-5x the capital, it's worth it for the scouts to jump ship. Scouts all want relationships with the top scout funds anyways because their ability to raise next quarter's rolling fund depends on their ability to say they coinvested with a Tier 1, so scout funds can just keep their relationship with the top rolling fund managers by investing in their funds and remove a lot of their own overhead.⁷ Scout funds might just be better off becoming rolling fund-of-funds.Rolling funds create incentive misalignment with follow-on roundsRolling funds are an amazing innovation that, as I've argued above, will produce a lot of good. That said, rolling funds come with a downside: a longer-term misalignment on follow-on rounds. This will create tensions between rolling GPs and their LPs and affect their ultimate returns.Typically, the life of a fund is 10 years because it takes that long for the best companies of the fund to mature (which, as Scott Kupor points out in his book, is longer than the typical marriage!).⁸ During that time, investors need to measure and meaningfully compare the returns to other assets. What really matters is the cash-on-cash returns.⁹ In other words, when all's said and done, how much actual money did your LPs make?How do you get good cash returns? Once you move past the ""invest in good companies"" part, it's by doubling down on your winners.¹⁰ You need to make sure as many of your dollars as possible are in your winning investments becaise the power law dynamic means that your top portfolio companies will outperform the rest of the portfolio, even at a later stage.¹¹ You can get good returns without doing this, but it's tough to get great returns without it, and it's impossible to do so at dollar amounts that matter.¹²The core mechanic that creates this problem is that rolling funds exacerbate the dichotomy between fund and firm. Traditional funds have a committed capital base that is full of institutional LPs who are investing lots of money over a long time horizon across several funds run by the same firm. When you have a long-term relationship with the same firm, it is not so problematic to concentrate on a single successful portfolio company, even if it is across funds. In other words, the fund/firm dichotomy matters less. With rolling funds, there is a new fund each quarter, each with a potentially widely different investor base, so that dynamic matters a lot.Think about it from the perspective of the dollars. When each quarter has a different set of LPs, you want to maximize the performance of each individual dollar in order to incentivize new investors to participate each quarter, which means investments as early as possible to get a great headline that drives subscriptions. But if you are thinking about it from the perspective of a pool of dollars instead, the performance of each individual dollar matters less; what matters is getting as much of the pool as possible into your winning investment.This can somewhat be mitigated by increasing the subscription term. Instead of quarterly, you may eventually see rolling funds raising for a year at a time. But once you're talking about 2 year subscription periods you're raising a fund that isn't really ""rolling"" anymore - it's just a regular, 2-3 years to deploy fund that didn't have any follow-on reserves. LPs can also precommit to several quarters of funding, but since each quarter is a new LP there's no way to know how much of it will be going towards follow-on investing. And since there's total flexibility on the part of LPs, GPs don't have that much predictability as to the follow-on capital they'll have in 5-7 years when it's clear who the big winners are.There are other issues with the rolling fund dynamic that make it difficult to double down. You can't guarantee the timing of your fundraise, for one, and you can't guarantee that your LPs will be around to invest in future rounds. What if you have an amazing investment that doesn't raise again for a few years so your LPs abandon you? You could also try to raise an SPV, but rolling funds are inherently less private, so you can't put out a private note without risking jeopardizing the sanctity of the funding round itself, or prioritizing certain LPs, which would violate one's fiduciary duties. Even superstar rolling fund managers will encounter this problem because even though they will know they can fundraise indefinitely they will not necessarily know the size of the fund each quarter.We spent a lot of time in previous sections talking about the minimum check size, but in later, competitive rounds the main limitation is actually a maximum check size - the allocation. Good firms not only take their pro rata but are able to get over-allocations at the expense of other investors. With these issues it will be much harder to secure that.A promising legacyVenture capitalists often say they won't fund ""lifestyle businesses"" that have no real way to scale to large returns - rolling funds actually enable, for the first time, lifestyle funds. They don't need huge winners to be successful for all involved, and by allowing for an increase in the diversity of fund managers they mean that more lifestyle businesses can be funded too, improving the ecosystem overall.But for rolling fund managers who want to make it big, they will need to secure follow on capital. It's basically impossible to become even a hundred millionaire by just cutting a seed check in a unicorn but it's quite probable if you keep writing follow on checks.¹³ Due to the follow-on problem, the rolling fund managers who truly want to scale will eventually have to abandon their rolling funds for a more traditional route.What this means is that the biggest legacy of rolling funds might be as a new, decentralized talent funnel into the biggest funds. We have already seen blogging and tweeting as legitimate means to enter VC by proving that you can pick good startups. Rolling funds take that a step further by having a costlier signal. You actually put capital at risk and have to show that you can actually get into rounds yourself, not just talk about who you might like, without already having to be rich enough to angel invest or needing fancy credentials. There is no theoretically stronger signal, so rolling funds might enable a new class of fund managers to come from anywhere.That would be an amazing legacy in itself.[1] Hilariously, AngelList has trademarked the term ""rolling fund."" I don't think it would survive a trademark lawsuit.[2] Technically, each fund is its own limited partnership. The entity that lives for decades is a management company (in the case of Sequoia, the actual company is Sequoia Capital Operations LLC). The management company has a contractual relationship with a general partner entity that it creates to manage each successive limited partnership.[3] To add a layer of complication, this money is technically not invested in the fund but committed to it. VCs send out ""capital calls"" asking investors to submit a portion of their capital commitments every time they make an investment. For big or active funds this can make the financial administration quite complex.[4] As an interesting technical aside, this means that a rolling fund manager who survives a few years will be technically managing more funds than even many large fund managers.[5] The cost of starting a fund isn't just metaphorical. Probably the two biggest expenses are travel and legal fees. A good lawyer will run $250,000 for all the fund formation activities. While AngelList won't replace your attorney, they do help make things much cheaper.[6] Syndicates have been around for centuries. But AngelList made it a more standardized asset class for investing in startups.[7] Scout funds do also provide some mentorship. Many of the best assign each scout to a partner, who reviews the deck with the scout and has to approve the investment. They can still provide this support regardless of the method of funding. There is also a signal to being a scout, but presumably the signal is stronger still if a major scout fund invests in your rolling fund.[8] This isn't always true of course. Fred Wilson was the board of Return Path for twenty years![9] ""Cash"" here means ""liquid assets"" so public stock disbursements post IPO count too.[10] Here, I'm thinking more of the firm as an institution rather than the performance of a particular fund. If you are an LP and you invested in a fund that invested in the seed round for Stripe, you might not be satisfied with just investing some portion of the fund in Stripe. You will also want to invest through SPVs and maybe a growth fund. This will probably be desirable even if the main fund can eat the investment to avoid concentration risk. But that means that the specific fund that invested in the seed will lose out on some returns even if the firm itself actually increases its performance as a result. For a committed capital base invested across funds this doesn't matter; for a dispersed capital base it matters a lot.[11] You can even see this at later stages. In tech, the winners win so big that growth stage investments can outperform early stage investments in winners. For example, if you invested in Zoom's last private round you made 100x, which is probably more than most successful YCombinator exits.[12] AngelList has a good research paper suggesting that seed stage funds should broadly index across startup portfolios. While the data suggests that this is a very credible result, what this does not account for is the long tail of startup returns. Under uncertainty at the seed stage, yes, there is an argument to be made for broadly indexing, but at the Series A stage and above when there begins to be clarity as to the winners this falls apart; there is a reason that the best funds reserve a lot of money for follow on. It is also of note that Warren Buffett has something to say about indexing: ""Diversification is a protection against ignorance. [It] makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing.""[13] In fact, Chris Sacca's huge wealth originally came from the act that he quietly raised SPVs to buy Twitter secondaries prior to the IPO. In all, his combined funds became the largest outside shareholder of Twitter at their peak, owning more shares than even Jack Dorsey. As far as I know, in modern times only Jason Calacanis has managed to become a hundred millionaire on just angel investing (Uber) along with Elad Gil; the other angels who have achieved extraordinary wealth all became associated with funds with follow on capital, like Cyan Bannister (Founder's Fund), Alfred Lin (Sequoia), Chamath Palihapitiya (Social Capital), and Naval Ravikant (AngelList).",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*Oe2XMyGPwCNWJVsXs-srtg.jpeg,https://medium.com/jovono/rolling-funds-an-old-frontier-ba9325e24752,startups,4d9b53abfd1a1bcb908702ed6e968df1ec7674172a1eec197d483575
The Elites Have Set the Stage For the Greatest Economic Crisis In History,"Time after time, over history, speculative manias seemingly emerge out of nowhere, fueling extraordinary booms that prelude devastating busts. After a while, you'd think we would have recognized how to avoid them, but as manias tend to occur every 20 years or so, the next generation is doomed to repeat the mistakes of their predecessors. And it's been the same for over 300 years. From the Tulip Mania to the Dot-com Bubble, once leaders instill moral hazard in the minds of their citizens, cheap money ignites excessive greed and risk-taking, creating a speculative frenzy.Although each bubble possesses unique characteristics, they follow a similar pattern, no matter where in the world they occur, with some exhibiting more bizarre tendencies than others. In the 1980s, after a small crash in Kuwait's official stock market, the government introduced tighter regulations, forcing investors to stick their money into riskier investments. Housed in an air-conditioned parking garage, Kuwaiti's unofficial stock market, Souk Al-Manakh, became the third-largest worldwide by market cap after wealthy investors bid up the price of speculative companies. In the end, it took a simple rumor of a dealer's check bouncing for the bubble to burst, causing a deep recession in the Kuwaiti economy.Decade after decade, similar booms and busts surfaced across the world, with the same flawed thinking from elites producing the same result. But when the 2008 financial crisis came along, the rules of the game changed. The interconnectedness of global finance meant that one asset class was capable of bringing down the entire system. The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve ""had no choice"" but to use the same policies that had caused the crisis to prevent a collapse. Their solution? Turn the entire U.S. economy into one gigantic moral hazard.Thirteen years on, and bubbles are no longer bubbles. Instead, they have become the hip, new asset class on the street. Every speculative asset class has been ""securitized"": stocks, corporate debt, real estate, fine wine, fine art, vintage guitars. Take your pick. You're spoilt for choice. Valuations don't matter. It's whether the price goes up or down.The elites have replaced America's economy with ""the Everything Bubble"", and it's harder than ever to achieve the American dream. Every year, home and food prices rise, more manufacturing industries disappear overseas, and the cost of healthcare and education skyrockets. But rather than addressing these issues, the American elites have ignored them and now define their success by whether ""stonks go up"".""Stonks go up"" is not a reference to stocks, per se, but the system that allows asset prices to rise indefinitely. In reality, stocks are not stocks anymore. We have no market or price discovery, just a constant struggle to postpone economic gravity. To make our situation a little less surreal - and more of a parody, we replaced the ""c"" with an ""n"" and invented the stonks meme. We clung to the weirdly shaped man in a suit and tie standing in front of a chart to find solace in our crazy economic world. Our future rests on whether a four-figure number on a screen rises. The S&P500 index's closing price must be stapled to everybody's fridge in the morning because it's the number one marker of America's health.While that number remains stable, America's flawed bubble economy remains stable. To the elites, nothing else matters. Although it does zero for the country long term, the upper echelons of society - the politicians, the Wall Street machine, the bankers, the central bankers, the ""look at my yacht"" high net worth individuals - have become obsessed with preserving the indefinite rise of asset prices, and for now, they can do just that.Since the speculative activities Wall Street engaged in pre the 2008 financial crisis broke the system in two, they had to copy the politicians and the central bankers and embrace financial insanity. It's common knowledge that banks create money out of thin air to maintain the fake economy, but what most people don't realize is, post the 2008 crisis, they create assets out of thin air to make up for the poor liquidity in the system. Before, subprime was the prominent liquidity driver, but as that market collapsed, Wall Street needed a quick replacement. First, they used pristine collateral such as U.S. government bonds, but as risk appetite increased, they began to securitize everything from auto loans to credit cards.In the shadow banking layer, an asset's properties have become irrelevant. What matters is the asset's dollar value. Because shadow banking markets - the Eurodollar system, the repo market, and money market funds - lie outside anyone's jurisdiction, while an institution has an asset denominated in dollars on its balance sheet, anything goes. Assets pose as other assets known as rehypothecation. Even rehypothecations of rehypothecations exist. Think of these as a CDO squared: ""a CDO of a CDO"". They will get away with using anything as collateral because, in the end, they know the authorities will bail them out if they pose a risk to the system, using former British prime minister, Theresa May's idiom, a ""magic money tree"" to rescue any institution when appropriate.To keep citizens from revolting and the system running smoothly, politicians and central bankers have lost their leadership roles. Instead, they have become perception managers, using a range of psychological tools to keep us in a constant state of confusion. Take the debt ceiling: ""a legislative limit on the amount of national debt that can be incurred by the U.S. Treasury, thus limiting how much money the federal government may borrow"". But this does not exist; there is no limit. It's there to make you think the government is fiscally responsible, but it rises every time the system reaches crisis point.As perception managers, their job is to convince you that becoming dependent on the system is the only option, to make you spend more, to make sure you keep loading up on debt so that the system keeps functioning. Your job as an American used to be to pursue your dreams by embracing the sound elements of capitalism. Now it's to support the crony capitalist ""stonks go up"" machine. Saving for that dream car, house, or holiday? Sorry, you'll have to put that on hold: It's your patriotic duty to feed the system with your hard-earned money. You must take out that credit card with a 25% interest rate because Amazon has 75% off AI-powered electric toothbrushes. You must buy that $2,000 exercise bike with an oversized iPad attached, and if you can't afford it, you can pay for it in monthly installments.Society has become obsessed with debt not just because there's a lot of stuff to buy in a consumer-capitalist society but because our money buys less every year. Yet, the economy must expand, and if you don't participate, if you try to cash out and take profits, you're a systematic risk, a traitor. Saving for a rainy day is modern-day financial terrorism, and your punishment for dissent is death by inflation: to watch your money erode away in your savings account, only you can't see it because inflation remains hidden. You become a blind, long-term day trader: Wall Street's computer algorithms take your money but you can't see your balance going to zero.You have become part of the craziest monetary experiment in human history and you're powerless to stop it. It has become part of you without you even realizing it. Every medium you use to express your anger against the system only feeds and increases its ever-growing power. Decentralization, the most popular escape from the system, is the last mainstream beacon of hope. But it's a false hope. It's a retreat from society altogether. We're removing ourselves from the system rather than changing it, which will lead to the stark fragmentation of society: the centralists versus the decentralists. This won't end well.While the decentralization movement builds momentum behind the scenes, we will continue to see craziness become the new normal. We're at the stage in the cycle where Gene Simmons is buying Dogecoin and tweeting about it, where the highest-profile CEO in the world tweets about the size of his junk and faces no consequences, where every mainstream media outlet has outlawed any economic voice of reason who promotes sound money and economics.Whatever happens next, in both scenarios - a conflict between the centralists and the decentralists or the collapse of the ""stonks going up"" machine - our fate has been decided. We must face the future head-on and brace for the inevitable downturn. Before financial systems were somewhat disconnected. Risks were bifurcated. If something broke it didn't cause other parts of the system to collapse. But in the 21st century, everything is connected, and there's no turning back.You're probably thinking what can you do to stop it? Not much. But it's not all doom and gloom. Instead, this is a time to get ready for what's to come. This is a time to learn how to weather the storm. This is a time to cut out the noise. This is a time to think different, to think outside the box, and to see things for what they really are.What you do to prepare for the coming crisis is up to you. It's your choice what steps you take. Some people are buying cryptocurrencies, some people are stocking up on gold and silver coins, some people are even ""prepping"": building shelters and bunkers - but you don't have to go that far. Just make sure you do something, anything, the bare minimum. That's what matters. Appreciate that in the next few decades life will get harder, and planning now will save you a lot of hardship in the future. And if by some miracle, what we're experiencing is a new paradigm and the next collapse never occurs, you'll praise yourself knowing you did everything necessary for the ""stonk apocalypse"" becoming a reality.This article is for educational purposes only, not financial advice.",,https://medium.com/concoda/americas-fate-now-rests-on-the-stonk-market-going-up-2ce14792233d,economy,4d950d1af86daa8ed599a8d4925f6866380bec82f85ea73d955f1a17
My Most Memorable Restaurant Meal,"It took me too long to get to Paris. Too many years, too many reasons not to go. Maybe I was afraid it would not live up to my expectations after years of reading and fantasizing about this almost mythical place.Then, I finally got there.I don't remember much about the trip. DeGaulle airport was a mess, having been bombed by terrorists and still under reconstruction. Not having any Euros and searching for an ATM in a construction site so we could pay for a cab. Typical travel stuff.The first hint that things were different was that cab and the cabbie, a gorgeous older woman dressed very stylishly, so stylish that my ingrained chivalry, now disdained, had me helping her put the bags into the trunk of the very nice Mercedes she was driving. Everything about that cab ride and driver was as foreign as I could have imagined, in a great way.And she was just that side of rude to a couple of middle aged Americans who obviously were not chic, not French. Until we got into Paris and our destination.We had rented an apartment for ten days in the Marais, a district or arrondissement of central Paris, walking distance to all the must sees. It was in a characteristic Parisian building, a l'hotel, which is not a hotel, but a four story building, circa 1880, once a private dwelling, now divided into apartments, some like ours looking into the large courtyard. Tres chic.As we pulled up to the address the driver looked momentarily confused. Did these provincials actually have an apartment in an expensive district? She became noticeably friendlier and more helpful. By this point, in spite of my jet lag, I was amused at my first Paris attitude encounter. It was mid afternoon as we met the rental agent and climbed an ancient curving staircase to the third floor, the oak steps worn and the curving oak rail with a patina you simply don't see in the US. We would have cleaned it up too much.The apartment was lovely, with a contemporary kitchen, which I had no intention of using, and tall windows in the bedroom that opened out into the courtyard. I don't think we ever closed them. There was a bottle of chilled white wine in the fridge and we sat having a glass, in that dissociated state that jet lag and a new place creates.Where to eat? Would French food live up to my obsession? All those years with Julia Child's massive volumes trying to absorb a culture? Not to mention Hemingway, Henry Miller, Picasso and an entire pantheon of those I'd admired growing up while dreaming of being a writer?After regrouping, my then girlfriend and I decided to get out and find food and see the hood, which she had researched. Here is where this starts to sound like one of those Paris fantasy movies that appear regularly.During the course of those ten days we had our share of crummy meals, bad cab drivers, and rude cafe staff, but only a very little share. The rude cafe staff loosened up considerably as we stopped there each morning for a cafe creme and croissant (yes, they were excellent). The Parisians we encountered were not that stereotype of French rudeness as I found out when we wandered out to find a meal that first evening.The research told us that there was a legendary medieval square nearby, the Place de Vosges. A city block from before Haussman's rebuilding of the city, surrounded by a four sided covered arcade with ancient stone arches. The block itself was paved with stone and there were many people strolling about, no cars, nothing modern except a few neon signs for restaurants along the interior of the arcade. It felt dreamlike.We circled the arcade twice, looking at restaurant menus posted outside restaurant entries. Many were simply doors in a stone wall (no windows) and we had no way of knowing if they were any good. Finally we just took a chance on one as that jet lag exhaustion was setting in, creating dislocation and a sense of lost time.During those ten days we did the tourist thing and walked non stop. Walking under the Eiffel Tower was in some ways more magical than the long elevator ride to the top. It is magnificent to look up at it from directly underneath, perhaps my iconic memory of Paris. We saw art, we ate at cafes, we wandered the Seine, we visited gardens- all those things I'd fantasized about for years.But, back to that first meal. I only vaguely remember what the place looked like, but recall it as a white tablecloth place. A gracious hostess and waiter who helped us order. Our appetizers came. I don't remember what I ordered but she had fat spears of pale asparagus in a creamy yellow sauce. I watched take her first bite and saw a look cross her face that I could not decipher.Concerned, I asked her what was wrong. She shook her head and gave me a forkful of the asparagus. When I tasted it, time stopped. It remains one of the best things I have ever eaten, perfect.At that moment I knew Paris would live up to my dreams.A note about the Eiffel Tower, le tour Eiffel: it is being painted gold for the upcoming Olympics. It takes 60 tons of paint. It is being stripped, which involves lead paint so the paint job will cost $60 million, easily the most expensive painting project around. And, apparently, when it was built, the designer Gustave Eiffel had it painted red!",https://miro.medium.com/max/5184/0*qEsBV7acbl1xqcb5,https://martinedic.medium.com/my-most-memorable-restaurant-meal-57ab4368d7da,travel,4dcbfcb400ff6d808511bed3943a757b780a12bb7aba041e16762076
Why great coaches fail often,"A true Agile Coach puts their job on the line every single day. Not because they are making mistakes or advocating the wrong principles, but simply by doing what organisations hired them to do: coach.As consultants and freelancers, we are used to the hustle, the long hours and the pressure to deliver the best possible results for our clients and their stakeholders. And most of the time the process as well as the outcome are straight-forward. More and more companies find themselves in the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) world, and look to us for guidance. One way of facing the future is by adopting Scrum practices and transforming into agile organisation.Ever since the industrial revolution, the world turns to technology giants for wisdom and best practices. Business Schools, Ted Talks and your uncle Simon all rave about how their practices should be adopted by mainstream organisations to grow faster, create better and last longer. Therefore, it was only a matter of time until experts and coaches everywhere would start to preach software development practices as new ways of working outside the world of software development.Consequently, we find a wide spectrum of organisations ranging from waterfall-practicing conservatives to agile-preaching progressives; neither of them inherently ""good"" or ""bad"". The main challenge are organisations in between, trying to change their position by copying what worked for others. They turn to Agile Coaches to guide them through the transitions, adopt Scrum as a way to deliver as well as a mindset.Agile Coaches and Scrum Masters main quest is to be the change agents, empowering everybody around them to feel more confident and competent to work in Scrum. They give guidance on the administrative setup, the running of Scrum events and on how to best deliver value for the customers. The Scrum Master acts as the servant leaders, focusing on the teams, their adoption of Scrum and how to improve them into high-performing teams. The Agile Coach facilitates beyond the Scrum teams and is tasked to challenge the status quo. Not because the organisation had done it wrong all this time, but simply because they had decided to move away from existing practices and establish a new normal.And just as there is a spectrum of waterfall to pure Scrum is there a spectrum from acceptance to refusal of the proposed changes. Not too seldomly do Agile Coaches find themselves in situations loaded with politics, misrepresentation of agile values and managers manipulating the new structure for their own benefit.Underlying most of these issues is a misconception or malpractice of transparency. Bad management practices use transparency to amplify control, by forcing teams to guarantee the delivery of a set value by a set date.For them Scrum offers a clear roadmap to delivering albeit smaller pieces but more regularly. Failing to meet those goals is met with blame, cries of inefficiencies and increased measures of control, which translate to more administrative overload of the teams and their Scrum Masters. Good management would want to investigate why goals are not met and try to overcome any obstacle and resolve impediments to better ways of working. Scrum events such as Retros and Reviews are targeted measures to understand where obstacles are keeping the team from delivering and invite the teams themselves to figure out solutions to overcome them. These events, if done correctly, are proven to increase motivation through participation, increase flow by removing impediments and increase quality through regular feedback and testing.In organisations faced with scenario one, teams live off the hope that management won't look too closely, giving them the option to hide short-comings and spill-overs in impressively creative ways. Once this seed has touched the soil it spreads from one team to the next. No one wants to be blamed or called out by management for under-delivery and missing deadlines. When transparency gets you penalised, you will try anything to muddy the waters. It is the Scrum Masters duty to counter-act these patterns as they go against the Scrum values. Yet a Scrum Master can only do so much as their primary goal is to focus on the team.This is where the struggle of the Agile Coach becomes all too real. Their efforts to coach Scrum Masters and their teams to better manage problems, bring transparency to their challenges is met with lowered heads and defeated sighs. The teams don't want to become more sufficient in Scrum, since it would only give ammunition to management to bully them further into submission. Some coaches will consequently accept an organisations fate and try to help the teams as much as possible to become stronger, better, and more motivated in supporting each other.Great coaches, with hearts full of empathy and a head full of ways to help the organisation overcome such patterns, bring these issues to management's attention. And that is where the true fight begins. Good managers will listen to the coach, validate the information with representative sources and start implementing a roadmap with improvement practices. But bad managers will view this challenge as a direct attack on their capabilities. How can an Agile Coach know better how to manage an organisation? How could they possibly hint at failures of the current management practices?What follows are a couple of frustrating conversations, rising anger levels and an endgame, which usually ends in a powerplay - and the manager always wins. In the best case the Agile Coach goes back to managing the smaller scale issues, supporting the Scrum Masters and their teams. Slightly worse is the Agile Coach leaving the organisation, which is what coaches with options and pride tend to do. And the worst outcome is the Agile Coach being fired on the spot. Simply for doing their job.Some mindsets will simply not be changed, no matter how careful we craft the message or how valid our points are. In such cases we can try to give the teams and people around them the best possible toolset and practices to grow. If the agile mindset becomes prevalent and the results follow in the form of improved quality, faster time-to-market and happier customers it might just be enough to sway such a manager. After all, I find that such personality types tend to be part of a success story. This process can be tough on employees and coaches alike, as it does feel like an uphill battle, and some battles will be lost and some minds will remain unchanged.But to prevent such scenarios Agile Coaches can hold some difficult conversations at the beginning of a working relationship. As much as it might be counter-intuitive to risk a new consulting job by being honest about the difficulties some managers might face, those candid conversations can build the foundation of a more transparent relationship. Topics worth covering are how more decentralised decision making might feel very different from the current setup or how it might feel odd to not be an expert on such new territory as Scrum.Also use the opportunity to align on a strategy on how you should bring insights and critical feedback to them. It might be as simple as an early warning system if the teams bring something to your attention or you spot a malpractice committed by management. If you can catch and resolve those issues early on, nobody needs to lose face and everybody can continue to build on their strengths while allowing the teams and organisation to move towards a brighter future through a successful adoption of Scrum.In the end we are all human, struggling with our pride and unable to get out of our own skin. Some minds can be changed more easily than others, and some will remain locked on their long-held ideals. As Agile Coaches we owe it to ourselves to at least attempt our best at bringing everybody on the journey, and allow for the time for sceptics to change their minds. Because if everybody had already adopted the agile mindset our jobs would be far less rewarding and meaningful, and we wouldn't be allowed to learn from our own failures and short-comings - which is what makes us truly great coaches.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*1Vtbu8_a8-UbS0Uh,https://medium.com/serious-scrum/why-great-coaches-fail-often-5f6203781194,leadership,4dd84f908b15b8876af5ab5ee0df28e51c8107860301ee13148d6666
Keepsake,"The marble statuette broken in four pieces I still keep in the flowery box is hardly a piece of art.I picked up the pieces from behind the TV and found the tiny chip that split on its own. I told you I'd put it together and it will hold. It was my gift to you, that marble embrace in a heart's kiss - for Valentine's Day. I didn't ask why it was broken. Years later you told me you threw it at the wall because it hurt too much to look at it. Initially it had only chipped a little. Then you caressed it and threw it again.Maybe I could have just kept that little bit shaped as a tear, the one deprived of your caress.We've moved seven times together. Our kids are growing, one already facing the world by himself.The flowery box came with us and I'd never think of it as clutter or junk. Interesting how I've never glued it together either. I think something deep inside me felt the absence as presence as in we were most apart when the statuette was shiny and complete, and all these years together I dragged it around in pieces.I'm smiling thinking I never told you I kept it. That we still have it. Valentine's Day is coming, I'll ask you to kiss that chip for me. You'll ask why, the little guy will wisely advise, ""Just do it, dad, it means something,"" and you'll comply. We'll maybe get a little time for ourselves. We'll plead with the kids to give us an indoor date this time, especially because I'm planning to order lobster and none of them would touch it.Maybe they'll allow us our romantic dinner if we ask.Happy Valentine's Day, my love.Copyright © 2021 by Georgiana Petec.

"Rest in pieces, phonebloks","The obsolescence of an object has likely to do with the failure of just one of its components, which leaves the remaining, potentially operational parts unusable.For this reason, it would make way more sense to design objects that are easier to repair or implement by simply and fairy switching their elements.Our smartphones have increasingly become SOC-based black boxes, impossible to repair except - in very limited cases - at a cost to the final user that is even higher than that of producing the entire device. Hence a very bad habit of premature replacement is crystallising: while design has perfectly planned the reciprocal position of each individual component to minimise space and thickness, it is in no way favouring repairability, which is nowadays still considered a negligible value - indeed, the opposite of policies of quick turnover market, the only one left in a now mature sector.Back in 2013, with great foresight, Dutch industrial designer Dave Hakkens - then just graduated from Design Academy Eindhoven, now merged in the One Army collective - introduced the breakthrough Phonebloks concept, a modular smartphone open platform conceived from the ground up to reduce electronic waste.By attaching individual plug-in components called «bloks» to a mainboard, any user would create a bespoke, personalized smartphone. These bloks could be replaced at will to switch a broken module, to upgrade an existing blok, or to expand the functionality of the whole device in a specific direction.Phonebloks was a clever and promising brainchild, later merged into Google's more corporate-friendly ""Project Ara"" via Motorola, with a corollary of conferences, developer sessions, and funding campaigns. But in 2016 the Mountain View juggernaut - which was increasingly abandoning investments in hardware, maybe just to focus on private data-mining business - suddenly pulled the plug, pushing into oblivion a serious attempt to conceive a product as a real open system, deeply customisable and able to stand the test of time.There have been other attempts since then, most recently the Fairphone, trying to include a degree of sensible modularity in their DNA, but all seem to pointlessly mimic the form-factor of their monolithic equivalents, yet never embracing a greater, necessary boldness.We don't know how interested people will be in something that can be taken apart and put back together as easily as a jigsaw puzzle. (Google, for example, determined that Ara was not a topic of interest to the market).And since the idea was not even born at all, we do not even know how interested third parties would be in producing the individual modules applicable to the canvas core of the device, and how successful this open platform criterion would be in a world increasingly locked into proprietary systems protected by a zillion patents. Yes, we are completely unaware of how much room such a concept could have in a market where services are massively replacing physical products, so that it is much easier to have an up to date new smartphone every year owned by an external rental company that does not even pay taxes in our own continent.Yes. But.But if we continue to design everything according to what people want - or, worse, according to what corporates think people want, especially if these corporations have no big ambitions to overturn the status-quo... - flattening ourselves to the lowest common denominator, we will have fewer and fewer opportunities to move forward, beyond popular acclaim. Fewer options to perhaps design what will be likely even better for all, including ourselves as a part of the whole. Doing all this without necessarily neglecting the right revenue, but also without necessarily forcing people to buy a new object - and throw away an old one - every time they simply want more functions, more autonomy, or to repair a part that does not affect the rest.The rise and oblivion of Phonebloks, its cold fusion with Project Ara, and its decommissioning teach us precisely why good independent ideas should not be placed in the hands of large corporations. At least not right away. Because it will be all too easy for these embryonic concepts to be stretched with too many compromises, and subtly pushed with a worldview that certainly does not belong to the people who first thought them up. Or, worse still, dropped off in the street - preferably keeping the patents, just in case - as soon as the smell of blood arrives from other directions.Nevertheless today, in a world of monolithic, fragile black crystals and rogue copies, Hakkens' Phonebloks concept is still a beacon for a deeper and truly-radical design, capable of dealing with how things work, instead of being superficially satisfied with how things look like.The best design dares to take a long view, beyond the present. The best design is such because it takes on its shoulders the effort to go above mediocrity.As Dave Hakkens had rightly imagined, there is still out there, yet to be uncovered, a sweet spot where the need for a profitable business model, a scalable, fair, multibrand supply chain, a state-of-the-art coherence and reliability, but also, and above all, the right to things designed to be long-lasting and repairable can finally - and hopefully - collide.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8308/1*AvBA0q9K1O54rsjo03XFcQ@2x.jpeg,https://uxdesign.cc/rest-in-pieces-2a0f48b1c2df,design,4fbf72d2b335f9c8fadd6e2b2e4c5d6029f54a0fbd41ac2e846be2ec
"10,000x","My ideas may be controversial (to some) or stupid (to others), but my goal here was always to spark some curiosity, potential joy or just a discussion.I believe designers should write more, because expressing complex ideas is the best way to better communication. And my outlook has always been that communication is one of the biggest problem our little industry faces.Even when I'm poking fun at ""UX"", I do it because I love. There are times that it can get frustrating, but I was always hoping for a positive change. That's why I started to share what I know (and yes, mostly for free).I want that change to happen, but I also want us, designers to be a little bit less serious.Big shoutout to UX Collective Editors ➡️ Fabricio Teixeira Caio Braga for amplifying my little voice and their useful, helpful and friendly approach.Thank you for helping me find my way and becoming a better designer. This community, united under a polar bear is one of the best things that happened to me in my over 20 year long career.🙏So if you're new here here's 5 of my popular articles and one unpopular that I think is likely one of the most important ones. I'll start with the unpopular (but important) one.Thank you!

How to confidently communicate design decisions as a young designer,"I always wondered how experienced designers were so good at responding to feedback and getting stakeholders onboard - was it a skill they developed over their career or just a natural talent they had?At my first job as a designer, I would regularly present my design concepts to stakeholders. They would ask me tough questions on the spot and I would stumble over my thoughts and lose my audience almost immediately. I wasn't able to get the stakeholders onboard.I knew what I was doing as a designer, I just couldn't communicate it well. I would see other designers at the company present concepts with little pushback and get everyone onboard almost immediately. I always wondered, will I ever reach the point where I can confidently communicate my design decisions?Over the years as an in-house product designer, I finally figured out the answer. Yes, it is possible to develop this skill. All of the designers that I looked up to were in my shoes at some point in their career.This may seem obvious, but it's one of the most essentials steps to succeed. To be a good designer, you need to be a good communicator. Communication is how you get people onboard with your decisions. Clearly articulating your reasoning for design decisions will not only get stakeholders onboard, but will allow stakeholders to trust you as a designer. Like all good skills, this takes practice.The most effective strategy that has helped me build my communication skills is to write down possible questions and answers. As you are iterating designs and exploring concepts, start creating a list of questions and responses that you may receive when presenting. This process helps you think about the answers beforehand, giving you time to prepare and practice how you are going to say it.You won't be able to prepare for every possible question, but you will be more confident during the meeting for the questions you did prepare. And the more prepared you are for the meeting, the better you will do.When presenting your designs, some of your stakeholders may be seeing it for the first time. You don't want stakeholders falling behind and asking questions that were addressed weeks ago. Make sure you get everyone up to speed at the beginning of every meeting to eliminate friction.You also want to utilize your time wisely. Sometimes, you only meet once a week with your stakeholders. Make sure you put thought into how you present the information so they are asking the questions you want them to ask. It's all about navigating the discussion effectively.Always come to the meeting prepared to show your concept explorations. This will help your case when showing why one concept works over the other. It shows that you have already thought about different solutions and that you have arrived at the best option.You have done the hard work already. So, prove it to your stakeholders. Show the reasons why one concept is better than the other. Let them know you made logical decisions to arrive at your final design.A helpful tool to organize your thoughts is a pros and cons list. For concepts you explore, make sure you have a thoughtful list of what works and what doesn't. This will help logically organize your thoughts, create a strong argument, and get more people onboard with your process.Even if you don't interact with your stakeholders daily, it's important to build a connection with the people you work with.Once you develop a relationship with your stakeholders, they will start to understand you as a designer and as a person. This connection leads to better discussion and better understanding in design meetings. Whether you are starting a new job or have been with a company for 5+ years, it's never too late to build a relationship. It will only benefit you.Understanding the way people are the way they are will help you craft the way to communicate to them and get them onboard quicker with your designs.The best designers get buy-in from stakeholders with as little friction as possible. And those designers are able to do that because of how they communicate. And being a good communicator is essential in this field of work.If you are a product design newbie, check out my article on Top 5 mistakes UX designers make early in their career.

Reflection Exercises You Can Do with Your Team in 2021,"Want to know how to reflect on the New Year with your team in a human way? Check out these reflection activities that can build trust, foster relationships and allow everyone to get to know each other better.There is a lot to get done at work each day. Most of us spend our days working long hours in front of a computer and move onto the next urgent task one after the other (and another, and another).We're probably struggling to make time, get together and check in with each other. With this, we also forget to reflect on the way we're working individually.Even during our busy work weeks, with a little planning and some easy reflection activities you can make time to spend with your team.At least two people can partner up and do this activity for an hour or a day, with the primary objectives being appreciation, bonding and teamwork. Include all team members/staff in this activity - there are endless possibilities for the number of different coworker pairings!The facilitator assigns each person to take on someone else's role for an hour or a day. The team leader might take the role of a member and vice versa.This activity offers reflection and insight for everyone on the stresses, challenges and demands of each specific position.While brief, quotes are inspiring! They can also be interpreted in different ways. You can use a couple of quotes to represent different viewpoints or those that can have varying interpretations. You can also invite your team members to share their personal quotes so others can get to know them even more.Fill a box with different quotes. Let each individual draw, read and interpret the quote they chose. Later, allow each person to discuss how it pertains to a specific project/task in the workplace. A few examples of quotes to use include:Don't tell your group members about this activity in advance so that the speech will be impromptu and insightful. It will help your team find their inner motivation/passion for their work and allow them to express themselves genuinely.Give each person about a minute or so to communicate their thoughts and keep the conversation flowing. Allow team members to ask questions or discuss what resonated with them about each short speech.A good prompt could be, ""Why do you do the work you do?""This activity allows the team to reflect and identify a problem that needs both an action and resolution. You can start by asking a member to identify an issue and then another member will pose a solution.The succeeding member and then the next will build on that solution until everyone in the team has arrived at a conclusion on how to solve the problem. (A consensus may or may not be a part of this process, which is part of the team building activity.)Have all participants write a letter to themselves. They can write about what they're thinking, how they're feeling about their job or what parts of it they enjoy (or don't enjoy). This activity allows each person to reflect, pause for awhile and think about how they work and what they want to improve for themselves.This activity will develop and hone the empathy skills of your team members. Ask them to think about a specific event from the week or month that involved some conflict. Then, ask each of them to assume the viewpoint that they had during the conflict or the viewpoint that they felt least empathetic with. In the end, ask members what they realized through this activity and how they will use this information going forward.Divide your team in half and ask members to interview each other about their service experience. Take notes, and later present a summary to the group.Reflection activities for your team members provide them with an opportunity to express their opinions, feelings and thoughts in a shared environment. They will also be able to talk about this experience with each other in the future.These exercises, both individual and collective, will help build trust within the team and gain insight that your team can establish in the future.In love and respect,HilaryFounder & CEO, Corna Partners",https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*U6oEqsm2mzYxggMWKOXQ-w.jpeg,https://medium.com/@HilaryCorna/reflection-exercises-you-can-do-with-your-team-in-2021-2849c71cc3b,leadership,5a239eb49c5147d31ef7e844d621df249a653c8c3831f76794460be2
What Is Capitalism?,"Conservatives believe the United States is a capitalist country, and they like it that way. They say government should stay out of people's business, so free markets can create the best possible society. Anyone who advocates that government do more is labeled a socialist, a communist, or worse.When we try to find such a free market, though, we see that capitalism in the U.S. does not mean free markets at all. It means government and markets run by people with capital, meaning big money and other financial assets, dedicated to making themselves richer.We do have markets, but they are not free or fair. Powerful people and corporations fund and manage the politicians who make the markets' rules. When those rules don't serve the wealthy, government doesn't enforce them or rushes to change them.Recently, a group of small-time investors on Reddit started taking down two multibillion-dollar hedge funds, Citadel and Melvin Capital. The funds had been short-selling stock in the retail company GameStop.Short-selling means borrowing stock and selling it, then buying it back later at a lower price to return it. If the stock goes down, you win; if it goes up, you have to buy it back at a higher price, so you lose. That's a perfectly legal bet under Wall Street rules.But these hedge funds were engaged in ""naked short-selling,"" which means selling shares without borrowing them first, in this case selling more shares of stock than actually existed. It's illegal market manipulation, often with the goal of driving stocks down and companies out of business.Big funds get away with such financial crime because the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rarely investigates. The Reddit crew caught the funds doing it and started buying GameStop stock, driving up the price to absurd levels. The hedge funds were losing billions buying the stock back.So, capitalism stepped in to protect them. The people running the markets stopped people from buying GameStop. The server used by the Reddit users' chat room got turned off by its operator, the communications platform Discord, who accused them of racism and hate speech. Brokerages stopped taking buy orders. Since people couldn't buy, the price stopped going up.The hedge funds still took a substantial loss, but far less than they would have if market rules had been followed. Now, the SEC is investigating the Reddit investors for manipulating the market in the same way hedge funds do every day without the SEC paying any attention.Real estate markets are manipulated in more harmful ways than stock markets. For decades, Black Americans and other minorities couldn't buy housing in white neighborhoods. Then, when real estate and finance companies wanted a big score, they would start encouraging Black folks to move in, excite racist fear among the white homeowners, driving them to sell their homes cheap (a process called ""blockbusting"") and flee (called ""white flight""). Then the companies would sell the homes to Black families at a big profit.Americans' desire for home ownership has been ruthlessly exploited by market manipulators. Starting in the 1990s, Wall Street financiers created new investment products such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). CDOs are collections of people's debts (usually mortgages) packaged into bonds that banks sell to investors. As long as people are repaying their debts, a CDO-holder profits.But in the late 90s, banks started loaning people deceptive mortgages, often with low interest and low or no down payments. People were encouraged to take these ""subprime loans"" to buy a new house or refinance an old one to pay college tuition or medical expenses.After a year or two, the interest rates would jump way up, a big payment would come due, and homeowners would default and be foreclosed. The African-American community was hardest hit, losing over half its total wealth in a few years, but millions of other people also lost. The economy collapsed into the ""great recession,"" and good-paying jobs disappeared, never to return.Bankers who made these bad mortgages should have lost, too. After all, the money they had loaned out wasn't being repaid. But they had sold the mortgages off as CDOs, so others took those losses. And while allowing homeowners to be foreclosed and impoverished, government gave bankers and financiers massive bailouts.These wealth transfers to the rich are sometimes called corporate welfare. While a couple financial companies went broke in the economic crash they had created, most big banks like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan posted record profits and continue to do so. Corporations in agriculture, defense, transportation, health care, oil, and other industries also receive these kinds of benefits.Since 2008, the Federal Reserve has poured ever-increasing amounts of money into Wall Street, while jobs disappear and wages decline. These monthly gifts of tens of billions of dollars to banks and financial institutions are usually called quantitative easing (QE), although they can take other forms.These payments are the reason the stock market keeps going up. They guarantee that capitalists' share of wealth grows, and the people's share shrinks. They also guarantee that the capitalists will continue their risky bets: their short sells, CDOs, and a dozen other financial schemes, because if the investments tank, the big investors know they will be bailed out.Government consistently serves capital financially and in other ways, like cutting taxes and regulations, because they are the same people. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellin received an $800,000 speaking fee from Citadel. This fee topped the $675,000 that Hillary Clinton received for three speeches to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in 2013. Mitt Romney made $250 million running his fund Bain Capital, which eliminated thousands of American jobs. He almost became President and is still a U.S. Senator. People move from corporations to government and back, serving the super-rich in both places.That is why, in the COVID depression of 2020, U.S.-based hedge funds increased their wealth by $63.5 billion. The CARES Act, the one COVID relief bill, directed over $200 billion to huge corporations while sending working people $1,200 each. U.S.-based billionaires have increased their wealth by $1.1 trillion since March 2020.French political economist Frederic Bastiat wrote:In 21st-century capitalism, plunder by corporations is not only legalized but celebrated. Real and fictional capitalists have movies made about them. Their names appear on university buildings; politicians seek their support and advice. Their interests, not free markets, determine what capitalist governments do.Financial journalist Max Keiser calls Wall Street ""a whole layered cluster of fraud."" He goes on to say:Government as servant of capital is not unique to the U.S. or the 21st century. In The Communist Manifesto (1848,) Karl Marx wrote, ""The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs of the capitalist class."" His definition may not have been right in all times and places, but it certainly is true in modern America.Capitalist domination of our markets can't be changed by electing Democrats or Republicans, even a Trump or a Sanders. Both parties serve the corporations, and the rich contribute equally to both of them.Leftist journalist Glenn Greenwald told Rightist TV host Tucker Carlson, ""The Right wants government out of markets; the Left wants government to intervene on behalf of poor people. Right now we have the opposite: a government that intervenes on behalf of the rich and powerful."" Carlson agreed.Could this understanding be a way out of the Left/Right divide which leaves the capitalists in full charge? Consumer advocate Ralph Nader thinks so. In his book Unstoppable: The Emerging Left-Right Alliance to Dismantle the Corporate State, he said, ""There are many issues on which Left and Right can agree, such as opposition to Wall Street dominance, corporate welfare, and wars.""We need markets so people can create things, buy, and sell them to enrich everyone. We also need government to keep markets fair and to do the things markets can't or won't do for society. What we don't need is a government controlled by those who rule the markets. That combination is called capitalism, and it has to go.- - - - - - - - - - -Thanks for reading! Follow me on Twitter, on Facebook or my blog The Inn by the Healing Path.

KPI trees for root cause analysis,"The KPI tree is a really powerful tool for understanding changes in system performance. It is very easy to implement and it has a broad range of applications. Here we'll look into 2 examples:We're running an A/B test and notice that revenue per customer is down 13%.Here's a sample of the data that we're collecting:We note that:So now we can build the KPI tree:So we conclude that:Sales are down 5.1% for Gap Inc. and management wants to understand the cause.Here's a sample of the sales data:We note that:So, again, we can build the KPI tree:So in conclusion, the decline in (simulated) revenue can be traced back to 2 very specific causes: the closure of a single Old Navy store plus the reduction in average item price across the Athleta stores.KPI trees are really powerful at turning raw data into stories that are both interpretable and actionable. They also have broad applications as demonstrated here.

What manhole cover design can teach us about product development,"At first glance, both topics seem unrelated. But manhole cover design illustrates some important points for product development, both for startups and large multi-national organisations.Let's look at some common challenges that startups and large organisations face.The challenge for startupsStartups with a B2B aspect in their business model can sometimes be overwhelmed by individual feature requests from business customers. They have found a need - as the lean startup methodology tells them - and now they plunge into building it. But the next customer has another request, and yet another customer has yet another feature request.This can lead startups astray from building a product towards building custom software solutions. Or, their product turns into a complex Frankenstein with 5 heads, 10 arms, 7 feet... lot's of things stitched together.How can startups listen to customers, while keeping a strong product focus?The challenge for large organisationsLarge multi-national organisations face a similar, but different challenge. They often find themselves in the situation where their colleagues in other regions have developed their own local solutions. This leads to many different systems being run, maintained and evolved. In turn, this creates a complex software systems landscape, and high overall costs.At some point, organisations realise the inefficiency of this. They become aware of complexity that arises when central systems need to interact with the variety of different regional systems.Then, an initiative is started to consolidate things into one single source of truth. They aim to create a standardised process within one central system that serves all the different regions.This is the time when organisations encounter resistance from the different regions, who emphasise that their local needs are different and cannot be served by one central system.But...Even though there are regional variations and varying stakeholder needs, that should to be considered, there are also many common aspects among them.This is where we can learn from manhole cover design. (1)Common aspectsMost manhole covers have the shape of a circle. This isn't an accident. The round shape has many benefits:This shows that standardisation is important, so that all users can take advantage of the benefits.VariationA local variation in the function of manhole covers are required for areas that are prone to flooding. Here, manhole covers may have special hinged lids that flip over to one side when pushed by water, and flop back when the pressure subsides.This is an important local variation. It prevents catastrophic lid launches that pose hazards to the immediate surroundings, and avoids empty holes in the street that may be deadly for passersby.So this is not a weird edge case we can ignore. But at the same time, we do not need to install manhole covers designed for flooding in areas where floods don't occur.Another variation is the aesthetic. While some places have less striking graphic design, some have turned manhole cover design into an artform. These designs show drawings with regional significance, of cityscapes, local maps, nature, folklore or contemporary culture. Fun fact: In Japan you can find Hello Kittie manhole covers.Beyond the aesthetic variation, these designs have captured the imagination of the public. In Berlin an artist rolled paint onto the profile of the manhole cover to print t-shirts. While in Japan it created a treasure hunting culture among adults, who search for the over 200 designs and take pictures of the covers they visit. The different designs also created hope among some japanese locals, who anticipate that the elaborate designs will increase tourism to their city. For the sewage industry in Japan it has helped them improve their image from ""dirty and smelly"" to ""colourful and elaborately designed"". (2)The takeaways from this story is that common design aspects and local variations are both important. We sometimes fall into the either-or-trap. It can be hard to find the middle way. But it is important that we do, so that we can ensure the success of our product or service.The risk of over-standardisation is that we do not meet the needs of customers, which results in them rejecting our product.The risk of over-customisation is that we end up building custom software. This makes growth and scaling slow, and creates a complex systems architecture with high maintenance effort.Not all variations need to result in separate features. There are some variations we need to be aware of, so that our common solution can handle all of them. Like the simple example of conventions for last names which vary between countries. If we are not aware of them and have a maximum character restriction on the form field, a Spanish customer may not be able to enter their full last name. (In Spain the last name last names are much longer, because they combine the mother's and father's last name.)Other variations may require a separate feature. For example: Tax rules will vary from country to country, when buying a car. Some markets have very complex taxes rules: such as Portugal where a luxury tax applies.Finally...When we are overwhelmed with individual feature requests from Business customers...We need to start by looking at the common needs. This will help to reduce complexity. Then, we can shift focus to understand what varies.Some of the methods that help us understand and prioritise needs are Jobs to be Done or the Kano Model.Why do I share this random story about manhole cover design?

The easiest way to plot data from Pandas on a world map,"This guide is intended to be quick and easy, with the least amount of words and least amount of code, to show you how to plot data from a Pandas object on a world map using Matplotlib and Geopandas libraries.The python libraries you need to install are pandas, geopandas and matplotlib. You can find the code for this tutorial on github: https://github.com/udiy/blogposts/tree/main/Easy%20mapThe data in the Pandas object needs to have location coordinates, which means latitude and longitude. For this article, I am using data about fires in Australia, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/carlosparadis/fires-from-space-australia-and-new-zeland.The data comes from NASA satellites MODIS instrument, they monitor the fires from space, find acknowledgments at the end of this article. In the data, there's a column called brightness, which is a measure of the temperature (in Kelvin) of the fire.Let's see some code now. First, we'll have a quick look at loading and peeking at the data:Now let's plot the data on a scatter plot, latitude on the y-axis, longitude on the x-axis:Nice. Even without the use of a map, we can see the contours of Australia. Let's add a map.Geopandas lets you load the geometry for countries worldwide into an object called GeoDataFrame, which is very similar to pandas DataFrame object. It looks like this:Once you have this object you can easily plot a world map, in the same way you would use the plot function in pandas:Since our focus is on Australia, we can slice the ""countries"" object so it shows us Australia only:We'll now use matplotlib to create a figure, and plot the map and the data together at the same time:The grid lines correspond to the ticks on both axes. Depending on the zoom level and our target on the map, we might want to add grid lines with smaller spacing, to do that we need to add extra ticks. For styling purposes, I prefer to add minor ticks, this way you can plot the minor grid in a different color, or transparency level. In the example below there is a minor grid with a spacing of 1 degree:We acknowledge the use of data and/or imagery from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/firms), part of the NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).MODIS Collection 6 NRT Hotspot / Active Fire Detections MCD14ML distributed from NASA FIRMS.

Evolving Neural Networks in JAX,"""So why should I switch from <insert-autodiff-library> to JAX?"". The classic first passive-aggressive question when talking about the new 'kid on the block'. Here is my answer: JAX is not simply a fast library for automatic differentiation. If your scientific computing project wants to benefit from XLA, JIT-compilation and the bulk-array programming paradigm -- then JAX provides a wonderful API. While PyTorch relies on pre-compiled kernels and fast C++ code for most common Deep Learning applications, JAX allows us to leverage a high-level interface for programming your favorite accelerators. vmap, pmap, jit accelerate and vectorize across array dimensions/compute devices without having do deal with asynchronous bookkeeping of processes. But this is not restricted to standard gradient-based optimization setups. It also applies to many evolutionary methods. Therefore, in this post we explore how JAX can power the next generation of scalable neuroevolution algorithms:Note: Throughout the post we will assume that you already know the basic primitives of JAX such as jit, vmap and lax.scan. If you feel like you need to catch up on these, checkout the JAX quickstart guide or my JAX intro blog post.Let's start by installing and importing a couple of packages.Evolutionary strategies aim to minimize a black-box function without the use of explicit analytical derivatives or gradient estimates. Instead, they rely on stochastic evaluations of the (potentially noisy) function of interest, f. The previously accumulated information is then cleverly integrated to inform the search distribution π. Th sequential batches of proposal solutions x are also known as individuals of a generation g. In neuroevolution x corrsponds to the parameters of a neural network and f denotes some metric of performance. Importantly, we are not relying on backprop and the resulting gradients, the objective does not have to be smooth and differentiable. This has a couple of practical implications:ES can be thought of as search algorithms, which use a type of memory or surrogate model of the objective. The specific form of the surrogate π differs across ES (e.g. for CMA-ES it will be a scaled multivariate Gaussian). The general procedure has three repeating steps:We iterate over these three steps for a set of generations g = 1, ..., G. This three-step procedure is commonly implemented in hyperparameter optimisation toolboxes (e.g. scikit-optimize) and provides a minimal minimal API for interfacing with ES (e.g. see David Ha's blog).In CMA-ES the search distribution π is a multivariate Gaussian with mean m and scaled covariance matrix σ² C. The update step adjusts the mean and covariance of the Gaussian and the stepsize standard deviation σ. Loosely speaking, the mean will be pulled into the direction of the best performing candidates, while the covariance update will aim to align the density contour of the sampling distribution with the contour lines of the objective and thereby the direction of steepest descent. That sounds plausible - but what are desirable characteristics of efficient search algorithms in the first place? It should generalizes across a wide range of functions f and be robust to a variety of transformations of input and output. This robustness meta-objective can be recast under the notion of invariance properties and we will see that several of these apply to the solution quality of CMA-ES:Let's now see how CMA-ES accomplished these meta-objectives and examine the individual update equations of CMA-ES as well as how to implement them in JAX. I have taken the freedom to code up some helper functions, which aren't essential to our understanding of either JAX or CMA-ES. This includes how we initialize and terminate the strategy and some logging utilities. Feel free to check out the source files in the linked repository.The first step is to define the core functionality of CMA-ES and the way in which we interface with the search algorithm: By asking for a set of proposal candidates from the search distribution and evaluating the candidates. Only afterwards, we can update the strategy with the information gathered during the evaluation. In CMA-ES, the ask-step samples from a multivariate Gaussian, where the sufficient statistics define the direction of the search. Intuitively, the mean should move closer to the best performing candidates, while the covariance should point our search into the direction of steepest descent. To efficiently sample from this potential high-dimensional Gaussian, we will use the reparametrization trick:The eigendecomposition of C factorizes the covariance into B and D. B is an orthogonal matrix, whose columns form an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. D is a diagonal matrix of square roots of the corresponding eigenvalues of C. Intuitively, D scales the the spherical 'base' Gaussian distribution and can be viewed as a dimension-specific step-size matrix. The diagonal entries correspond to the standard deviations of the individual $d$ dimensions of our optimization problem. Hence, it controls how far the search distribution 'reaches out' along a specific axis. B, on the other hand, defines the orientation of these principal axis. In short: D scales, B orients. Finally, σ is a dimension-independent step-size. In code this looks as follows:The memory stores all the variables which are exposed to an update from the ES. params, on the other hand, are fixed hyperparameters such as the different learning rules or population size. We will reuse the eigendecomposition of the covariance later on, so that we can amortize the compuation by storing C, B, D in our memory dictionary. Having obtained a set of λ candidates from an ask-function call, we can use the objective function to evaluate their fitness.The update of a CMA-ES generation consists of 5 sequential update equations: m, p_σ, σ, p_c, and C update. These are the ones stored in memory. The resulting dynamics prescribe how our search distribution evolves over the consecutive generations. Schematically, this looks as follows:Wait! But where do p_σ and p_c come from? Empirical estimation of C from a single generation is hard, especially when the number of parameters is larger than the population size d >> N (which will usually be the case in when evolving neural nets). We therefore want to obtain a reliable estimate by leveraging information accumulated by previous generations. And this is where the different evolution paths come into play. Their role is to track the changes in the mean statistic and how different updates affected the next generations performance. p_c is then used to inform the update of the anisotropic part of the overall variance (so C) and p_c for the update isotropic part (so σ). Don't worry about the equations yet, we will soon see how all of this works in detail. For now just remember that p_c and p_σ provide a memory trace that integrates over past updates. The function below wraps all five update steps as well as the initial sorting of the solutions in call:Let's take a closer look at the individual update steps and how their implementation in JAX:We start with the mean, which relies on truncation selection. Instead of letting all candidates pull equally on the mean update, we will only consider a subset of the top performers in the population (or parents μ) to influence the update of m. Usually the set of parents is chosen to be around 50 percent of the entire population. The weight of each parent decreases as their rank in the population decreases.where x_:λ denotes the fitness-sorted candidates of generation g and c_m represents the learning rate of the mean update. The weights w_i are typically chosen to be decreasing so that the very best performing solutions are given more influence. Here is the default case for a population size λ = 100 and μ = 50:In the code below additionally we define the z-scored parameters and the weighted sum over the selected and mean-normalized parent parameters. update_mean returns the updated mean and both y_k and y_w. These will later be reused for the covariance update step.In the next two steps we will derive an update for the isotropic part of the covariance matrix, a.k.a. the scaling by the 'stepsize' σ. CMA-ES uses an evolution path p_σ, which integrates over previous steps to perform cumulative step length adaptation:Loosely speaking, this is meant to modulate exploration-exploitation trade-off in the following two cases:The speed of adaptation and the timescale of integration dependes on two crucial factors: the learning rate of p_σ, c_σ and the size of the eigenvalues of C. The larger c_c the faster p_σ will respond, but also the smaller the integration timescale. The precision of the covariance, on the other hand, provides an additional rescaling which interacts in non-trivial ways. So how do we actually update σ?The stepsize is a scalar, while p_σ is d-dimensional. So we need to reduce things. The norm of p_σ provides a measure of aggregated step length and a simple moving statistic for whether to increase or decrease σ. We will skip some math here, but one can show that p_σ is in expectation standard normally distributed. We can then use an exponentially scaled update if ||p_σ|| deviates from its expectation:Note that if ||p_σ|| equals the expected value, there won't be any change in the stepsize. d_σ ~ 1 is the so-called damping parameter and re-scales the magnitude change of ln σ.So far so good. We now have an update formula for the mean and the isotropic part of the variance. Finally, we need a procedure for estimating the covariance. A natural starting point could be the sample estimate based on the current x. But this can be highly unreliable for cases in which the number of parameters is a lot larger than the number of parents, d >> λ. This is another example of the statistical challenge of the curse of dimensionality. Instead of relying only on the most recent generation, CMA-ES again uses an adaptation procedure, which exploits the structure in successive update steps:At first glance this equation looks very similar to the update of the isotropic path update of p_σ. But there are two significant differences:We can now use the evolution path p_c for one part of the covariance matrix adaptation step: the rank-one update given by the outer product p_c p_c^T. The update is complemented with a rank-μ update constructed from the weighted sample covariance estimate of the most recent generation evaluation:Intuitively, the goal of the adaptation step is to increase the chances of sampling p_c and the normalized parameters. Again c_1, c_μ and c_s denote a set of learning rates. For a better overview of the hyperparameters in CMA-ES check out the overview table at the end of the blog. The overall covariance matrix adaptation step looks as follows:Let's now see how we can scale CMA-ES to optimize a small neural network for a classic Reinforcement Learning task. Traditionally, this would involve large chunks of code and communication pipelines involving multiprocessing and OpenMPI. In JAX, on the other hand, we will use vmap to take care of a lot of engineering complexity in the following ways: 1) We will jit the RL episode loop after using lax.scan & rewriting the gym environment. 2) We vmap over the evaluation episodes used to estimate the agent's fitness. 3) Finally, we also vmap over the different proposal networks within a generation. Pictorially this looks as follows:There are no multiprocessing worker queues involved and we can easily scale this to accelerators such as GPUs and even TPUs. I have already taken the freedom to re-write OpenAI's Pendulum-v0 NumPy environment in JAX. For the simple pendulum-ODE case it basically boiled down to replacing all np.<op> operations with the equivalent jnp.<op> operations and to avoid the explicit use of booleans (e.g. by using masks instead). Furthermore, the RL step will now take as inputs an additional dictionary of environment variables and the current state of the environment. This allows us to jit an entire episode rollout together with the help of the lax.scan primitive. We now import the simple environment helpers. Next we define a single-hidden layer MLP policy and a policy rollout wrapper. For simplicity, we assume that the policy deterministically maps from observation to action:Finally, it is time for the ultimate JAX magic. We vmap over both the number of different evaluation episodes and all the different neural networks in our current population. The helper v_dict indicates that the first dimension of our different dictionary parameter entries corresponds to the population dimension over which we want to vectorize. Afterwards, we jit the vmap-ed batch rollout and indicate that the environment parameters as well as the number of episode steps are static:We need one final ingredient: When asking CMA-ES for parameter samples for the next generation, it will sample a flat vector of parameters. But the evaluation procedure requires a dictionary of layer-specific weight arrays. Hence, we need a helper for re-assembling the flat proposal vectors into the proper parameter dictionary of weights and biases for JAX. Here is a simple function that does the job for our single hidden-layer MLP:Now we are ready to put everything together into the CMA search loop for the Pendulum task and a multi-layer perceptron with 48 hidden units: We start by initialising the strategy hyperparameters, the search distribution, the evolution paths and the logger which tracks the progress of the strategy. Afterwards, we then run the ask-evaluate-tell loop over the different generation iterations.In the left plot above we see that the strategy is capabale of solving the Pendulum task (fitness score of ca. 120) in less than 50 seconds (on a 2,7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 chip). The plot shows the overall best performing solution (""Top 1"") found so far as well as the mean of the top 5 solutions (""Top-k Mean"") across the search iterations. In total we have gone through 200 generations with 100 networks each and evaluated each single one on 50 episodes with 200 sequential steps. A total of 200 million step transitions and 200 network sampling/covariance adaptation steps in less than a minute on a standard CPU. And this even included jit-compilation time. Pretty dope if you ask me. Let's now take a look at the evolved behaviors at different stages of the evolutionary trajectory:Something I like to do when there is some extra compute lying around is to figure out when things break. This for me means running grid searches and building some intuition about the 'white-box' dynamics of our algorithm, which may not be directly visible just from starring at the update equations. I was particularly interested in how CMA-ES would scale to larger networks, how the truncation selection (λ > μ) would affect the performance as well as how much wiggle room there is with the mean learning rate (c_m). Therefore, I ran the same configuration as above but changed the individual parameters. In order to get a little more statistical power, I repeated the experiment over 10 different seeds. In the figure below you can see how the performance varied across these 3 parameters (smaller is better):And last but not least we have to see how hard we can scale this on GPUs. In the figure below you find a runtime (left) and compile time (right) benchmark for a single ask-eval-tell iteration on the Pendulum task and for different population sizes (and 50 MC fitness evaluations):The measured times are averaged over 1000 iterations and were obtained on three different devices. On CPU we can see an increase in time per generations as the population size is increased. Both GPUs, on the other hand, handle the increased population size easily using simple parallelization. But this appears to come with a small caveat: Increased XLA compile time. I am not sure what is going on here but given that you only have to compile once at the first function call, this seems negligible.In this post we learned about the CMA evolutionary strategy and experienced how the power of the jit, vmap and lax.scan combo is capable of scaling neuroevolution methods. With two lines of code we were able to vectorize over both stochastic fitness evaluations and population members. The power of XLA then allowed us to run the entire ask-evaluate-tell procedure on accelerated hardware. Ultimately, these are the types of soft- and hardware developments, which enable new types of research (reminiscient of arguments in the 'Hardware Lottery' by Sara Hooker) and potentially revive forgotten techniques. Here we investigated one type of gradient-free optimization, which can free us from the requirement of having to use differentiable functions everywhere. E.g. we can use spikes (like the brain does!). In the future, we may dream of entirely different types of neural net architectures, which leverage scalable random search/0-order methods.Finally, the entire code of this tutorial can be found in this repository ready for you to dive in. Furthermore, I put the entire pipeline into a 120 line snippet. I would love to get some feedback ⭐ CMA-ES obviously is not the only ES out there. So if you want to know more about different ES or get a different point of view on CMA-ES, I recommend checking out the following links:I want to thank Joram Keijser for helping me make this blog a better version of itself and for being my buddy in JAX-love crime.We have only glanced over the specifics of how to initialize/set the different parameter initialisation of CMA-ES. This is mainly because I wanted to focus on the high-level intuition and not drown you too much in math. If you want to learn more about how the nitty details I recommend checking out the tutorial by Hansen (2016). Below I have collected a table of key hyperparameters and how they are set in the reference tutorial:",https://miro.medium.com/max/2398/1*uhcp9F0B7w-FOzChEzfLHg.jpeg,https://towardsdatascience.com/evolving-neural-networks-in-jax-dda73bd7afd0,artificial-intelligence,5b5f54803c8ad4ea7dda5ee52ef98a7c5ac65eed68d291efd79b3204
A Snowflake,"Ernesto López leaned forward to get out through the door much too small for his tall and stout body. When he straightened the back at the top of the stairs he saw darkness and feeble snowflakes falling slowly from the skies. He didn't expect that. Recently the weather had rather resembled the springtime weather - so nice and warm. No snow at all. And there it was suddenly in a desperate attempt to fulfill everybody's dream of White Christmas. So pathetic. Grr . . .Ernie abhorred snow. As a person particularly sensitive and attentive to details, he didn't perceive snow like everybody else - as a kind of cold, fluffy and sticky substance causing mainly a nuisance or at best considered useful for skiing, sleighing or making a snowman. The perfectly intricate and sophisticated structure of a snowflake scared him beyond reason. He wondered if it could indeed be just soulless nature, not a higher being, that had invented and created something so amazing as regards the shape, symmetry, color and texture? Maybe, maybe, maybe. Or maybe not.With a suitcase in his left hand, Ernesto grabbed the rail on the right and carefully descended the narrow and steep stairs. The plane landed fairly near the gate. Good. After passing through customs, the man yearned for a cup of good coffee with one-third of milk and one spoonful of cane sugar before getting out in search of a taxi cab that could take him straight to work. It was the last but one pleasant nuance that awaited him this evening.As soon as he ordered the coffee and sat comfortably in an armchair, the cell rang again. Amanda. Of course. Oh, yes, his American fiancé was a real pain in the neck. He did everything she wanted him to do once they'd learned about the pregnancy. There were roses, a romantic dinner, a diamond ring and one-leg kneeling. Wonderful. Whenever his work allowed him, and other family matters, Ernesto did visit his wife-to-be as often as possible. But it was still not enough for her. She complained the wedding date hadn't been even vaguely agreed on yet and the twins were on the way.The twins - a boy and a girl. The boy made his heart leap for joy. But the girl? He'd never looked after a little girl. Hmmm . . . but maybe it was just an excellent opportunity to try something different? Yeah, he was so open, so eager to welcome any thrilling novelties. All the excitement was yet poisoned by the thought of the wedding issue. How to carry this through? He hadn't even looked into the matter yet, out of cowardice, however knew far too well he couldn't run away from it forever. The wedding with Rosa took place in Las Vegas, which made the matter of hiding the marriage easier, but the risk was still too high.Amanda's call got ignored. Ernie didn't feel like fighting about boring stuff again. All he really wanted from her was to provide him with the possibility in the future to independently take care of the kids, whenever and however he would like to.First Amanda, now his Mexican wife Rosa was ringing. Ernesto made a quick decision to pick up this call instructing himself fervently not to mistake names like he did last time. Jesus Christ, how long had he had to explain himself before Rosa believed him he'd only worked a lot with a woman named Amanda. Ernie promised to visit his wife and son in a fortnight. After ten minutes or so he hung up fully satisfied with the interaction. Rosa was a young and poor woman with a strong inclination to drink who easily endured her husband's long absences in return for decent money making her life safe and comfortable. A good girl. And little Pablo - crème de la crème! Their relationship had been getting closer and closer throughout the year. Now when Pablo had reached the age of five, Ernie could move it to the next level. In fact, both of them were ready to go all the way. In two weeks' time.The bottom of the cup interrupted the train of thought. High time to get up, find a cab and travel two hours and twenty minutes to his home town Sorria and work.Ernesto opened a tall, wide and very heavy door, strutted inside and looked around with utter elation and pride. His kingdom - full of space, artificial light, gold and splendor. Here he was the ruler, the master in full power and control. As usual, all the eyes ran to him. All these people had gathered here to show him their sense of submission and respect. To admire, adore and worship him.The king headed for a small room at the back, checking every detail along the way. Excellent. Everything was ready for the event. In the room, Daniel was already standing, waiting. The other, after the coffee at the airport, pleasant nuance of the evening - his little helper so charmingly meek and tacit with the blond-haired head down on the chest, looking like a pretty angel. Delicious. The combination of the dirty and sacred invariably turned him on.Ernesto hurriedly changed his clothes, which was time and effort consuming. With all the robes on at last, ready to start the show, he came up to the angel, placed his palm on his velvet hair and slid it slowly on the boy's neck, back and, finally, bottom, where his hand lingered a bit longer caressing sensually and, finally, squeezing the buttock. Ah, Daniel's just like his elder brother Samuel, he doesn't jump and scurry off, but gets paralyzed. Breathing heavily, Ernie took his hand away very reluctantly. Enough for now. The rabble's getting impatient. With a confident stride Ernesto went out of the room with little Daniel in tow, singing, ""Silent Night, Holy Night...""His voice sounded strong, warm and soft. Actually the priest would rather be singing ""Come Fly with me"", for example. In his childhood he aspired to become a professional singer, like Frank Sinatra or Michael Bublé. But then uncle Nicolàs entered his world with sticky hands and tongue convincing him life was no heaven where beautiful dreams came true. There was no place called heaven in general. No place called hell, either. There was only the here and now filled with fear and pain as well as lust feeding on them both.Singing at the top of lungs, the clergyman placed himself at the altar before a grand table with a closed thick maroon book. Just as he was about to open it, his attention got caught by a small silver sparkly something. His singing stopped. That was a snowflake of about three inches in diameter! Immediately, Ernie lifted his head up checking if the solid roof was still there or whether the church had magically turned into the Pantheon during his absence. No hole in the roof.But...how? Never mind. Ernesto simply pressed his finger against the glittering beauty to make it disappear. It did. Only a wet spot remained. That was peculiar, he thought putting his hand confidently on the cover to finally raise it. However, something glistened attracting his attention again. Ernie glanced at the wet spot. There the snowflake had reappeared, even lovelier than before. Red in the face, Ernie began hitting it with a thumb like mad. In vain. The snowflake melted and grew back each time, over and over. In the meantime the carol finished. The worshippers fell silent and waited for the priest to stop acting weird and start the ceremony.""What the fuck...?"" he shouted to the microphone and fainted.©2021 Marta Mozolewska.

Apple Is Working With TSMC on Micro-OLED For Apple Glass,"The Japanese business publication ""Nikkei"" reports that Apple is developing high-resolution micro-OLED displays in a factory in Taiwan in a joint venture with chip manufacturer TSMC. These new displays will be going to be used in devices like Apple's long speculated AR / VR glasses Apple Glass.The good news for Apple and technology enthusiasts is that Micro-OLEDs do not require a glass substrate, but are attached directly to the chip, resulting in thinner screens for compact devices.The production is still in the test phase, it could take years to mass production - research would not be far enough for a first model of the Apple Glass, which according to rumors should come in 2022 or 2023.For this specific project, Apple had employed dozens of employees from the Taiwanese display manufacturer AU Optoelectronics.I found an article from an Asian news sources Nikkei which explains the partnership between Apple and TSMC and also explains the challenges and the solutions that Apple is promising:""Panel experts are good at making screens bigger and bigger, but when it comes to thin and light devices like AR glasses, you need a tiny screen. Apple is working with TSMC to develop the technology because the chipmakers are export at making things ultra-small and fine, while Apple also uses the expertise of the panel experts at display Uses technologies.""And At the same time, Apple is also researching micro-LED displays for Macbook, iPhone, and iPad.These are tiny light-emitting diodes that, like OLEDs, do not require backlighting and promise great contrast and high brightness with little energy consumption.In the article published by ""Nikkei,"" they mentioned, micro-OLED can best be understood as miniaturized organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) and as a technology different from micro-LED. The Paris-based manufacturer Microoled advertises its panels as the AMOLED (active-matrix OLED) with the highest pixel density. The alleged research by Apple with TSMC is likely to result in this: to make OLED displays even more compact and thinner than those of the Apple Watch, for instance.According to ""Nikkei"", Apple has rented several buildings in the Longtan Science Park in Taiwan that are within walking distance of TSMC's manufacturing and testing facilities for chips. TSMC builds Apple SoCs for Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, and, more recently, Macs, which Apple designed on ARM designs.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1080/1*EX9PXqbdURLR7xSQmnXtOA.jpeg,https://medium.com/macoclock/apple-is-working-with-tsmc-on-micro-oled-for-apple-glass-36c60fdc02df,business,5b3521924ac587a3a61be414da2c83025b0164ce8a26b00face56a1f

What can UXers learn from MasterChef?,"In the past couple of weeks I have been obsessed with watching MasterChef on Netflix (in case you haven't watched it, it's a competitive cooking show, where contestants have to serve their best dishes and as the weeks go by to be crowned the champion). After a busy working day I couldn't wait to just sit down and enjoy one of my favourite shows.As I was getting deeper into the season I realised that I could compare some situations in my work life as a UX designer with what I have seen on the show. I know you probably think it sounds crazy but let me walk you through the similarities I have explored.Each week the contestants have to address a brief of what they should cook, what ingredients they can or can't use and how many people they will have to cook for.It is actually not that different in terms of UX at all. Let me demonstrate it for you:(Scenario: You are either a freelance designer or working for a company)In the kitchen you're probably using the most common tools such as: pans, knives, chopping boards, measuring jars etc., and you know exactly what they can be used for. For example, you can't cook the pasta in your measuring jar, you will use the pan for that. But there are also things that you will use multiple times during your cooking process, like your knives or spoons.It's the same in the User Experience world. We are so lucky that we can use many different tools to achieve the best outcome for a project.I think it's important to highlight that you might feel more familiar with some of these tools than others and might even use some of them for multiple purposes. Whatever you do, always try to experiment with new and existing tools to find out which one works the best for you with different aspects of the project.Every MasterChef contestant is different in terms of their skills and knowledge. Some of them might have never seen a sous vide machine before, whilst others use it in their day to day life. I think it's important to note that we all have different abilities. In fact it's truly amazing as this is why we can learn so much from each other.There are several cooking techniques that are most likely familiar to all of us: baking, roasting, frying, grilling etc., and we know when to use them. For example you know that frying a chocolate cake will not benefit you at any occasion.It's the same in the world of UX design. You probably have a process that you apply during product discovery. Your techniques may look like: competitive analysis, creating personas, user journey mapping, a/b testing, usability testing etc. Be sure that you know your techniques and when to use them (don't fry your chocolate cake!).In the first round of the show the contestants can use their own well-tried and tested recipes that they have probably cooked for their families for weeks before they actually have to make it for the judges, John and Gregg.In terms of UX, I want you to change the word in your head to 'Components' - that's right Components like buttons, input fields, images, text etc.User Experience is a really complex field but here are my 3 tips to create the best experience possible with your ingredients:Once you establish all the components that will be needed for your design you will have to make sure that they will all work well together (just like a recipe!), building up the whole page/screen. I always try to go back and forth when I'm creating components as I probably need to do multiple iterations of them and select which ones can be used in the final design.In both Masterchef and in UX, timing is the most crucial part of the process. Imagine spending too much time on preparing the elements of your dish that you don't actually have time to cook. Or a different example: you focus on cooking the meat to perfection but you are not able to serve with any side dishes or sauces. You would only be able to serve a piece of meat on a plate which let's be real not so appetising.It can also happen to you when you design something and you get lost in the details not realising that you have been only focused on one element of your product forgetting about the overall outcome. It's better to get a complete design out in time which you can then learn and iterate on.Once the contestants are finished preparing their dish they have to make sure that their presentations are extraordinary and impressive for the judges. Hopefully achieving the wow factor.When you are able to present your prototype, research and findings you have to make sure that you will want to do everything you can to receive that wow factor from your client/stakeholders.How to achieve that wow factor?John and Gregg are not there just to run the show. They provide feedback to all the contestants hoping that they will develop from it and become better and better each week.Being afraid of getting feedback is not the best way to go. Personally at the start of my UX career, I was hesitant to share my designs for a very long time because I was scared of the feedback that I would receive. I felt anxious before my presentations as I was scared of getting negative feedback on something that I have been working on for a while.Today I know that constructive feedback is the best way to develop and challenge yourself. Any sort of feedback is better than no feedback at all. It is crucial that you are aware that it's not a personal attack (or at least it shouldn't be). It's truly about getting the best outcome possible and keeping the users the centre of your focus.In conclusion: becoming an effective User Experience designer is a never ending learning process, just like being a contestant in MasterChef.You have to be aware of so many different aspects of the process and make sure that your audience will benefit from the application of your knowledge/skills to enjoy your final meal!",https://miro.medium.com/max/2016/1*PFzX1ELpCabLJsRRhQwZqQ.png,https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/what-can-uxers-learn-from-masterchef-750995559073,ux,5cafbc4428383ac093738dd8be0f378401b6b134fca99c9018ba4ced
The Future White Hot Coals Economy,"Why Elon Musk is Like a Greek GodLet's state this right at the start: the goal of the Biden administration, Congress and the Fed is to make the economy white hot.Not trend growth, not strong growth, but 8-10% GDP growth.Let that sink in for a minute.The US economy will recoup the lost economic growth from 2020 in 2021. Remember in June of last year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would take 10 years to recoup this lost economic output or output gap. They are everything we've come to expect from a government economic research group.The truly shocking development has been the rapid wall of money created by the White House, Congress and the Federal Reserve. This is unusual and extraordinary. Due to the massive amount of stimulus from CARES 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, we now have over $10 trillion dollars working its way through our economy. The graphic below underscores how much has been allocated and how much has yet to hit the economy.This is on top of the monetary stimulus the Federal Reserve continues to pump through the veins of the US economy. The Fed's stimulus included $3+ trillion of new assets (see graph below) and cutting short-term rates to zero with a pledge to not raise the rates in our lifetimes. Ok, that last of that is not true. But the comments recently feel that way as Fed officials go out of their way to reassure markets they will not react to a short-term increase in inflation.The US economy has roared back and as stated above, the markets/analysts/economists are expecting a complete GDP recovery by the end of this year. This is not the complete story. There are still 10 million workers who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic. This is the focus of our government right now and the driving reason for the push to enact a $1.9 trillion stimulus package. While ex-President Trump is being tried in the Senate this week, it's fair to say that Democrats are emulating him on the economy. It was under Trump and a unified Republican Congress that the TCJA (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) was enacted, leading to above trend economic growth and drawing in workers to drive down the unemployment rate to historical lows for blacks and minorities. Paraphrasing the Raiders' Al Davis deficits be damned, just stimulate, baby.This gets us to where we are today. It's likely the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passes.This is raising economists 2021 Q2 GDP forecasts from 4% to as high at 10%. The Fed is onboard and will continue to buy as much debt as necessary to not only stimulate the economy, but also to ensure the bond market doesn't become overly volatile. The Fed is not concerned about inflation. The Jay Powell Fed believes it has learned it can run the unemployment rate down to 3.5% without creating wage inflation. All the major government economic decision makers are aligned to create policy to drive down unemployment.For the markets, it translates into the biggest risk-on party in our lifetimes. Go ahead, try to think of another time where monetary and fiscal stimulus were in completely and utterly aligned for generating rapid, over-the-top growth?Can you think of another time where a car company (Tesla), who's stock price is running at 100x EPS, decides to use almost a full year's revenue to make a bet on 1 financial product? Or when retail investors have dramatically dominated trading volumes as these rose from 10% of trading in 2019 to 25% today?Keep in mind, the party won't stop after CARES 4.0 gets passed. President Biden and fellow Democrats have another budget for 2022 they can utilize under reconciliation (50 votes only needed in the Senate) to bring about more stimulus. Infrastructure, housing and expansion of Obamacare are on the spending to-do list.What does this hold for the future economy? Rapidly rising risky asset prices, rapidly rising housing prices, and rapidly rising deficits. A more volatile bond market despite efforts from the Fed to contain the price movements. Guess what happens if the Biden administration is successful with the vaccine program? Economy, steroids, on.And Musk?Musk is simply the Hermes for the Stimulus Gods.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10944/1*qdeVyYM_66GfiWATWhsTeg.jpeg,https://medium.com/swlh/the-future-white-hot-coals-economy-274456dd3284,economy,5d4226d9004e73493dc8f2cbb72a84139c90b1e13f3728d7f2604485
How to Download NGS Data From NCBI's Sequence Read Archive,"The Sequence Read Archive, or SRA, is NCBI's database of storing Next Generation Sequence DNA data from sequencing experiments on any species, including humans. For those new to bioinformatics, it can be unclear how to access the data from this massive resource. It's most likely you will be trying to access data from a research article you've just read, and the authors will have provide a Data Availability Statement that includes an accession number. This guide will assume you have the accession number ready. Bioinformatics software runs primarily on Unix based operating systems, and this is the case for the toolkit needed to download SRA data. You will need a computer running Linux or MacOS. This guide is specifically for MacOS, but the commands for MacOS and Linux are mostly the same, though they might require some minor tweaks between operating systems. Finally, NGS data is typically massive so you will need a decent amount of free storage on your machine. Depending on the species the dataset came from, full analysis of the NGS data can use upwards of 100Gb of memory. Just downloading a singe file should required no more than 50Gb though. Let's start with downloading the software required for the job.The SRA Toolkit contains all the programs we need to download and manipulate the data from SRA. To download it, navigate over to NCBI's sra-tools GitHub page and download the appropriate file for your operating system. In your Downloads folder, double click the .tar file and navigate into the newly created folder. The programs we will be using for downloading the SRA data are located in the bin folder. We need to get the pathname of that bin folder and navigate into it on the command line. To do this, right click the bin folder, hold down the option key, and select 'Copy ""bin"" as pathname'.Now, open terminal and type in the following command, replacing <path/to/bin> by pasting in the pathname copied earlier:To check everything is in working order, run the following command:You should get the following output:We are now ready to download some data.The first thing we need to do is find the Run number of the data, which is different to the accession number listed in the research article. To get the Run number, navigate to the NCBI SRA webpage, paste in your accession number from the research article and search. From the list, click the sample you are interested in, and under Runs, copy the number beginning with SRR followed by 6 or 7 digits. There is a lot of different accession type numbers on this page, but you have to select the right one to use in the next step.Back to the command line, we are going to use the prefetch command to download the data plus any necessary files associated with it. To download the data run the following command, where <SRR0000000> is your Run number from above.The file will download to the bin folder, so take a look to make sure it's there after the download is complete and before moving on to the next step. Downloading could take a while depending on your internet speed and the size of the file being downloaded.The prefetch program will download a .sra file, which is not a very useful file format. We need to convert this file into the standard NGS file format of FASTQ to do any work with it. We will use the fastq-dump tool to convert the data. There are quite a few options you can use with fastq-dump but if you are not sure which one to use, you can safely ignore them all for now. The --split-files option is likely the most useful one, it splits paired-end reads into separate files. To convert the .sra file into .fastq, make sure the file is in the bin folder and run the following command, where [options] are any relevant options and <SRR0000000> is the SRR number of your .sra file:The final FASTQ file will be dumped into the bin folder. This process could take a while depending on file size. After the conversion, we can visualise some of the bases in the file by using the head command piped into the less command.You can go on to do any further processing with your FASTQ file now, including mapping to reference and variant analysis.",https://miro.medium.com/max/11520/0*H3VnHuNI0Hjs8xsZ,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-download-ngs-data-from-ncbis-sequence-read-archive-ead03908a192,science,5dc9a0676a979c7ecbdbacc1e198a567e5d73b7f0f9860d67d782aa8
The Unforgettable World of Stock Markets: The Moment the Game Stopped,"An interesting event happened this last week.A group of young investors jumped on the back of hedge funds for a real fight. The GameStop company was the victim. But to properly understand it, I had to read and hear a lot of information. My goal was to understand the stock markets' complex problems on short selling, short squeezes, or corners.Some investors are demonizing the short-sellers, and I needed to understand why.Short selling has been around for more than 150 years on Wall Street. And it is one of the reasons why Wall Street is the most developed market in the world.Short selling has the particularity of keeping the markets alive, even in Bear Market, or downward trend of the market in general. It increases liquidity because, besides investors, traders also buy and sell. Both in bullish and bearish markets, money is earned. So, there is always plenty of liquidity.Why is it good for the economy and the companies?Let's take Tesla's example. The company had 16 years of losses, from its founding in 2003 to 2019. Only in 2020 did the company become profitable. If Tesla had been born in Europe, it would hardly have resisted the long process of innovation.In the most efficient market globally, even struggling companies can finance themselves in the markets. As long as there is liquidity in shares. They often endure crises, resuming growth in the next economic expansion.Sometimes unusual phenomena happen. Hedge funds excessively provoke the market with short positions. Some of them with percentages often 50% above the available shares.How is it possible?Through naked short selling, more shares are sold short than those sold by the company. Yet, short-sellers abuse this possibility, seeking to take companies' quotations to the pond. Making it difficult to finance them at reasonable prices, even trying to ruin them.Here is the moral factor that brought out the Redditors to make a corner.The intention of these bulls was not to cause a short squeeze but a corner. This is like saying, corner the shorts in a dead-end and force them to take huge losses.A group of Redditors called WallStreetBets saw a short position of 150% on GameStop. And encouraged group followers to buy shares with all their strength and speed. They forced short-sellers to cover their positions at much higher prices.As the shorts were short with 150% of the shares, there are not enough shares to close those positions. So, the short-sellers are trapped in a corner, with no possible escape. Unless the company cooperates by issuing new shares to satisfy these shorts. Or the short-sellers get financing and shorten even more shares to bring GameStop down again.We should stop pretending that trading in stocks is investing in businesses.Capital markets were initially conceived to finance the real economy and to help capitalize businesses and companies.Unfortunately, it doesn't happen anymore. At least the way it should be. It has become a synthetic casino - a gambling model with no morality.I'm an investor and a believer in the free market. And as a European, I'm a real fan of the US stock market. I invested for the long run in companies like Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Disney, AT&T, Square, and so many others.Yet, from time to time, here comes another event that shows us how rotten the system is. It's urgent to simplify processes, moralize them, and bring the market back to the people who produce, and to the people that bring wealth to the country.Capital invested in real businesses has been taken away from some malicious hedge funds. That capital could drive growth and create real jobs, prosperity, and innovation.Cboe Global Markets, Inc, a global exchange operator, reported that, in 2020, stocks were traded at a total volume of $121 trillion.Yet, more than 95% of that volume didn't even reach the real economy.So, right now, we have a supposed equity market that should provide capital to the real economy. But at the bottom is being the most immoral casino bet in the world.Hedge funds should be tools to support the real economy. Not to fill the belly of managers with juicy commissions. If they add nothing to the real economy, they should be excluded.Yet, not every hedge funds are bad. Take, for example, Ray Dalio's Bridgewater or Howard Mark's Oaktree Capital. These two hedge funds are led by two investors that I deeply admire. I've read several books, both from Ray and Howard. I often read notes that I took from the lessons they gave me. And I often read newsletters from both.They are good people. Philanthropists. Their hedge funds do not seem to have damaged the market or take advantage of to the detriment of the real economy.Robinwood brokerage has been in some extreme events lately. In May 2020, a group of Redditors from WallStreetBets started investing in an apparent dead stock at an exponential pace. Everybody wanted something about this company. From 2,000 investors on Hertz, it went up to 180,000 committed ""fans."" Stock gambling at its best.That was when I found a book I automatically bought from Jaime Rogozinski called "" WallStreetBets."" The subtitle made me very curious. "" How Boomers Made the World's Biggest Casino for Millennials.""Why did Robinwood investors were buying Hertz stocks if the company was filed for bankruptcy?When millennials had the age of 20 years old, the 2008 mortgage crisis came. And it whipped out the savings of their parents, grand-parents, familiars, and friends.These millennials not only watched the unbelievable capitalistic schemes in financial institutions. But they also suffered from the whole process.And now, millennials are treating Wall Street for what it is- a gigantic casino for them to play. A legal venue was full of leveraged tools to make sophisticated bets with their cell phones.Nowadays, WallStreetBets turned into a social media network where kids and youngsters bet on the YOLO culture. YOLO means You Only Live Once.YOLO culture was the reason I finally understood what happens to Hertz investors.Hertz investors were buying stocks of a dead company for fun!From the time I read the book until today, these kids have refined themselves.They became aware of the system's immoralities and what hedge funds are doing to the market.Now, highly sophisticated Redditors, highly leveraged, and highly financed nerds are attacking Mordor. They want to annihilate Sauron himself, the supreme image of evil in the famous saga The Lord of the Rings.Ironically, millennials created platforms like Robinhood, and now they're using them to provoke a war.If Redditors are pushing hedge funds into a morality corner, I'll want to see more of it.Unfortunately, there's a lot of misinformation, confusion, and little foresight. We are creating gigantic bogeymen, triggering a tsunami where the good and the bad are carried in the current.Regulators have to look for these signals and control leverage levels. They must make the market more transparent so that we all know who is shortening what and in what amount.Only then, the stock market will come out stronger and more moralized. Otherwise, it will be another day well spent in Las Vegas.It's always good when you see young investors show experienced ones that they are wrong.I believe that the GameStop novel is one of those cases. A broken system in urgent need of renewal.When there is too much money in the system, poorly distributed, less useful things happen.Like in any other system, it has to be balanced.Short selling is not a wrong tool if it's used in a balanced way. But there have to be explicit rules to control it.Short selling was the one tool that warned investors about Nikola. If short-sellers did not short sell the company, their CEO would continue to deceive everyone, even today.In 2008, short-sellers bet heavily against big banks. It was from there that everyone realized what was happening behind the scenes.Yet, some hedge funds lost their absolute morality. And these are the bad guys.These guys are in the business to profit from destroying companies. It's their business models. They ultimately manipulate the outcomes by wiring PR people, private investigators, and lobbyists.The beautiful thing is having these digital pirates writing a manifesto to fight at this level. Redditors said: no more. And they push some hedge funds to a corner, putting them on their knees.Though, Robinhood did shut down the trades and made it impossible for the operation to go all the way.We are yet to understand who turned off the button. Who is behind this shameful market manipulation?Ironically, a company called Robinhood closed the trades that were taking money from the rich to give to the ""poor.""We'll be here to watch the next episodes.Sign up for my email list and join the happiest readers on Medium.(This is where you get exclusive access to my daily activities, experiences, and daily thoughts)",https://miro.medium.com/max/9184/0*uQfi3C19gCeT3T3z,https://medium.com/the-price-of-tomorrow/the-unforgettable-world-of-stock-markets-the-moment-the-game-stopped-70f65763624a,economy,5dc575db30b60ae0ec2acb2382095a2704fbee3ec731c6b3ca4cdf8a
The last mile of change: What companies can learn from supermarkets,"The last mile is better known as 'the last mile delivery' and is a term mainly used in the logistics world. It refers to the last mile before a product reaches the hands of the customer.I have a background in the FMCG world, back in the days when e-commerce barely existed, and was always fascinated by the question of how to get a new product into the store and preferably into the kitchen of the customer as quickly as possible. This had not only to do with the pure logistics of stock and transport, but also with marketing and sales. If a new coffee variety was advertised strongly, the chance of a listing at a retailer was already much greater. It also resulted in faster orders and better displays of the new product in the supermarkets.The representatives who visited the supermarkets made sure that the necessary space on the shelves was provided at the right time and that the order codes were readily available. So we had a dozen or so tactics to get the product to the place of truth at the right time to increase the chances that it would be bought and end up in the customer's kitchen. And, of course, we had a number of other tactics to get people to buy again and become loyal to the new product or brand.I would now like to draw the parallel with organizational change. A change usually manifests itself in the form of a digital tool, a new system, a new policy or a different approach. Similar to a new pack of coffee at the supermarket. Just like the manufacturer and the supermarket want customers to get to know the new taste of coffee and try it out, and then buy it again, someone who aims for change (this can be a software developer, a director, a team lead, a change manager...) wants the 'product' to be known and tried out and then preferably embraced fully. In the IT world this is called user adoption.User adoption is the last mile of change. And for this, too, it makes sense to have a number of tactics in place to get the new tool or approach to the place of truth at the right time, to 'sell' it to employees or other stakeholders and to get them to buy or use it again. To accomplish that, not only does the product or change need to be good (valuable and qualitative), it also ideally needs to be intuitive to use. Just as an iPhone speaks for itself (where's the long manual?), a change could be designed so that it speaks for itself and people are guided through the change process in a highly intuitive way.Usually, creating awareness around a new change is done reasonably well. Employees are informed via various communication channels and materials. Through videos and presentations, enthusiasm is created, just as an advertising campaign does for the new coffee capsules. An important basic condition is that, just like in the FMCG world, what is promised is available on time and with the required quality. And then there are the final meters of change. How do you get employees to bite and buy the change, just like customers in the store?To answer that question I looked for answers in Rick Maurer's model '3 levels of resistence'. This explains the 3 levels of resistance that occur when introducing change.1. Level of cognition: ""I don't understand"" 2. Level of emotion: ""I don't want this"" 3. Level of trust: ""I don't trust it/you.""Don't see resistance as something negative, but rather as a signal Resistance for resistance's sake does happen sometimes, but most people are constructive and they only resist because they don't understand the change, or profoundly don't want it (e.g. for fear of losing their job or getting other tasks or not having a good work-life integration anymore) or they don't trust the product, management or the organization. In change processes it is important to assess these different levels and to work with them. Because if you can remove the obstacles, you take away the resistance and make sure that employees adopt the change.You can do this partly through the design of change actions (certainly where the level of cognition is concerned, following the example of the iPhone), but working on emotions and certainly on trust requires a more personalized approach. Just as the last mile of e-commerce is becoming more and more personalized (customers choose where and when to receive their package), the success of change depends on personalization. And just as in e-commerce, that is currently a people business. You need hands and feet to make it happen and this costs money. In e-commerce you need van drivers, in organizational change you need change coaches. The 'last mile' in logistics is therefore often about seeking efficiency and looking for innovations that can do this faster and cheaper.Yet there is a big difference between logistics and organizational change. In e-commerce, the need for last mile delivery is not questioned. If you don't deliver you don't get paid. In organizational change, this is more vague. A product or change is 'shipped' but too little attention is spent on the actual delivery. ""Does it arrive decently?"" And by decently, I mean that the three levels mentioned earlier have been properly addressed and the obstacles have been removed as much as possible. And the next questions are ""Is it being applied properly?"" and ""Is it helping people move forward?"" Those kinds of questions should be more central to organizational change and its design.Managing change is usually of a different complexity than managing logistics, so a one-to-one comparison would be unfair, but I find it fascinating to draw parallels and come up with ideas that can help organizational change forward.

"The 4 Black History Month Projects We Most Dreaded as Kids, Ranked","These were actually sort of litty, as the kids say. Sure, there was inevitably a spoken-word performance and some historical monologues, but really this was an excuse for Black kids to be excellent and Black as all outdoors without a care in the world.

The dread factor here depends on your Benjamin Banneker-loving parents and how much resentment you ended up having for them.This technically isn't a Black History Month project, but it's trash nonetheless because the end of February is a reminder that lesson plans are going back to normal.

3 Ways to Break School's Monopoly on Education,"Look at any school district's Mission Statement and you'll find the term 'Lifelong Learner'. Education, the thinking goes (correctly), is a universal necessity to all human beings in all walks and stages of life. A school's job, then, is not merely to impart knowledge or skill but create citizens who never stop learning. It's not enough to learn to read and write and count; everyone needs to know HOW to learn to read and write and count, so they can go on to learn a zillion other things.But nothing quite exposes the hypocrisy or contradiction of our education system than the 'Lifelong Learner' proclamation made by schools.Because as true as the sentiment might be, schools hold a monopoly on 'learning' that they rarely or willingly relinquish. To schools, the only legitimate lifelong learning is that which occurs under their watch, through their methods, and by their measurement. They define what counts as worthy of being learned, dictate inflexibly how all learning must occur, and stamp every act of learning with their own narrow standards. The education system may declare it wants to create 'learners' more than 'the learned', but it rarely acknowledges that it has sole authority over what counts and how it's done.'Learning' is a pretty plastic term. One learns to read, but also to throw a ball. One learns to count, but also to navigate a neighborhood. One learns their history, but also how to grill a steak. One learns to write, but first to speak. Every new day is an act of learning and growth, some more dramatic than others, and when we go to sleep, by some accounts, every act of dreaming is a continuation of the learning process. A 'Lifelong Learner' is, on one level, every human being on the planet.To school, many things we learn - that we must learn, even - are ignored. The world of food, for example. Not just the cooking, but the growing and processing and measuring of it. The world of plants and animals, too. Not just pets, but our relationship with every other living creature on the planet, from lawn to forest, dirt to sky. Building and mechanics. Woodworking. Clothing. Child-rearing. Utilities such as plumbing and electricity and infrastructure. Little that we actually do with our hands and bodies, really, is under school's eye. One neither studies those things in school, nor is measured by her skill in them.Other aspects of a rich human life are sidelined, often into frivolity. Take music. It's first to go when budgets are cut, or when testing (certain, ahem, important skills) takes precedence, or when a student must choose between classes. And popular music is rarely given the kind of instinctive respect of other subjects, even though most kids today spend more energy on their music than anything else in their lives. Let's not even get started on games, which are treated, in the classroom, as a tool for everything else rather than the fundamental human need that they are.If one pauses to imagine any of these things - cooking, cleaning, building, playing, gossiping, maintaining - it's almost impossible to place them in the same arena as 'school'. When we think of learning, and the places that 'learning' occurs, and the demands of things that require 'learning', and the standards by which we judge that which is 'learned', little of a person's daily life comes to mind at all.'School' is this: English, Math, History, Science. But what does that mean? Is not 'English' the language we speak and write daily? So what then of text messaging, talking, idle conversation, this scribble here, or any of the other million printed words we navigate daily? Is not 'Math' taxes, temperature, mileage, calories, hourly wages, or any of the immeasurable numbers we use every day? History is not what happened in the past; history is the life we live now. And science? We could not turn our heads nor move our fingers without running up against the products of science. Your eyes on this screen, and your fingers near the keyboard are proof alone. But how much this is 'learned' in school? How much is a part of school rather than incidental to it? And if not, where was it 'learned'?School, and by extension 'learning', is a very narrow alley. It is dominated by only one kind of storefront, that of 'Academics'. Schools prioritize and privilege specific skills and knowledge: Academic reading and writing, and Abstract number sense. The vast universe of human knowledge and achievement is sidelined to what the University values most, not only in content but also in practice.Now, it must be noted that the situation we find ourselves is not deliberate. It's a product of structure and history and a multitude of other factors. It is easy to marry the dangers of monopolized power to selfish intent, to point the finger at some enemy (who we've implicated here, our Universities). This is a road we got on a long, long time ago, in a machine that we've been building as we go. It's a journey that still provides far more good than harm, but we could do better.Many of these circumstances are incidental to the structural and financial limitations of churning large groups of disparate children through a system. We are no longer in a place where one person can teach her child all that she needs to know and thrive. The facts and skills are too vast, too complicated, and too varied, and so we must rely on complex institutions to do the heavy lifting. These institutions are themselves guided not merely by their mission, but social, physical, and economic realities. So we have hive-like schools, and classrooms, and age-based groupings, and specialized teachers. If we allowed ALL learning to take place in school, we'd be overwhelmed. Some things must be prioritizedSome of this is simply the result of taking up the massive burden of educating every child fairly and justly. That task, necessary and invaluable, means we've had to seek out basic fundamentals and hope they are universal. In early education, this is true. Basic literacy and number sense are universal, and while these mental skills are also acquired outside school, especially in our information-saturated and screen-driven modern world, visible mastery is most easily managed through a classroom.Some of this is the result of time and calcification. Bureaucracies are slow to change or adapt. Schools started hundreds of years ago when almost all human knowledge could only be found in books, and books only found in a few places, and the reading of said books was the only certain way to grasp that knowledge. It began when a human being actually could navigate their world without the ability to read or a sense of what numbers do. Human beings are a learning species, and we will learn everything that is demanded of us for survival. Whether in school or out, it's hard to imagine anyone in a modern country not learning to read today.And much of our current situation is a direct result of where teachers come from - where they are trained and what they are inclined to value most. Teachers come almost universally out of Universities, and universities prize a particular kind of knowledge and thinking. They have a specific way of reading that they take very seriously. An adult university graduate has acquired and mastered and even sanctified a way of understanding the world. Most leave the University with that thinking as a tool for other purposes. They go on to make things and money, manage people and institutions, serve and be served, and so on. But those who stay, stay in education. Many step back into their old classrooms, all the way down to the beginning. But they carry a specific, adult way of understanding the world, and they can't help but emphasize it over all else.Whether by history, accident, or design, this is where we are with school. And while it's easy to say 'education' is broken, that's not fair at all. It's simply untrue to say 'broken' because the system still does the invaluable, necessary job.But it could be better. It could help more, it could provide more, and it could do more.School has a monopoly on education that is holding it back. We can, with a few shifts, allow it to do more.School defines what's tested, how it's tested, and the credentialing power the tests have. Not only do those tests tend to focus exclusively on Academic subjects and Academic thinking, whether by design or not, they also force a privilege over it. It might be cheaper or more convenient or more encompassing to seat students in rooms grouped by age and test them alone through multiple choice questions and then stamp those scores with a universally recognized seal. In the University, it might be the best method altogether. And in the past it might have been the only feasible path.But it's not really fair and it's no longer financially or structurally necessary to be so limited. Within classrooms, especially in high schools on down, we are actually assessing our students in far more ways, and on far more aspects of individual skill, than pen, paper, and choice or essay. Students create, perform, collaborate, research, draw, film, sing, construct, and combine. We have devised countless ways to measure and evaluate and judge their work, whether it's portfolios or videos or self-assessments or specific tiny demonstrations.Yet little of what students actually DO is carried or used outside our classrooms. What students carry away is a piece of paper with a grade attached to an invisible class and a piece of paper with a grade attached to a standardized exam.It's not impossible to change that. All we have to do is start accepting and using what students produce to demonstrate their mastery of material. The digital, virtual world allows it. It's up to the world outside school to start asking for it more.Covid is revealing just how limited the 7 am to 3 pm, in-person, age-centric, hourly-blocked, classroom-designed, teacher-directed, face-to-face method for 'learning' has become. Covid has also exposed the hold of our unquestioned assumption that 'learning' only takes place in 'school', and 'school' is only this one thing. Rather than re-examine the traditional classroom, we've mostly attempted to replicate it. We're still meeting our students at the same times and in the same groups, only through Zoom. We're still struggling to administer traditional assessments and attach traditional grades, or abandoning the effort altogether until we can meet in-person again. We're still schooling through single teachers managing 20 or more kids in blocked increments.But none of it is necessarily optimal, much less sacred. Some students are thriving on-line but others are not. Yet all of us are simply waiting to go back to the old methods. We are neither aggressively looking at every alternative available, from different hours to different ways of meeting to different ways of reaching students.If human beings are always learning, we should make the attempt to reverse the single-minded funneling of 'education' into the time and place and structure of the school building. The school building and classroom works for communities for reasons of money and location and convenience, but this is a very different thing than the reasons the classroom works - or doesn't - for individual students and actual learning.The truth is that schools are also babysitting services. They gather up a community's children and house them and feed them and monitor their well-being. And that's fine. That's a noble effort, and a necessary one. In fact, the classroom is a great way to babysit. It's just not always a great way to educate or learn.We will never be able to abandon the schools we've created because they have a far larger role in our society than education. But we ought to be willing to open up education to all that the world offers.Literacy and number sense are absolutely fundamental skills that every person in society needs to have. We actually do a decent job of building that foundation into our elementary school students. But even though elementary schools grapple with a lot more than reading, writing and math, those are the only real subjects we take seriously.And by high school, we have narrowed the subjects not merely to aspects of reading and writing and math, but a very very specific type; namely, that which is valued by college. We 'offer' other subjects, and then call them 'extra-curricular', as if they are frivolous and less valuable. 'You MUST take math and English,' we say. Everything else? 'Whatever.'And yet. History is not just the events of the past, in a timeline and in a place. History is everything that's ever happened in whatever form. History is fundamental to understanding business and religion, culture and psychology and sports. (Few of these, by the way, 'Subjects' in high school, much less required.) English is not just 'Literature' and the 5 paragraph essay. It's journalism, texting, game reviews, sports. It's not merely the research paper or narrative either, nor should it be condensed to such narrow specifics for every student.It may once have been convenient to force every student through a narrow range of material regardless of where they might end up. There may have been a time when the kind of advanced academic reading and theoretical math of academia represented not a variation of language and numbers, but the end of a continuum, the most advanced form on a single progression. This is no longer the case, and most students are now shoved into academic skills even though the majority need different forms when they enter the working world.The adult world offers a near-infinite variety of things to learn. Once past the basics of reading and number sense, which generally solidify by 8th grade in most people, skills and knowledge fracture and diverge. Even teachers have a vast range of interests and skills they can pass along, though they are held to a pretty narrow curriculum in their classrooms.If Lifelong Learning meant mastery of whatever skills or knowledge demanded it, and if the methods for acquiring those skills and that knowledge were open to whatever method, timeline, or environment suited it best, and if the assessment and demonstration of that learning was tailored to the thing itself, THEN we might be living to the ideal.Until that time, we'll continue to struggle hopelessly with what we've got.It still works, for some, but it could work better, for a whole lot more.",https://miro.medium.com/max/9336/0*B34uZbv8isi_hDYT,https://berniebleske.medium.com/3-ways-to-break-schools-monopoly-on-education-db191360ee80,education,6a6304ccf8af8148e477df227c67193ac9c9abc752afb3a310fb2463
The Sunrise That Gave Me a New Life,"Five years ago, I found myself with a long list of must-haves while embarking on a house-hunting expedition, to a point where it became an obsession.I had an excel sheet drawn up with potential contenders. Columns dictating square footage, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, wooden flooring, open floor plan, granite countertops, large deck, high cathedral ceilings, close to a playground..., the list went on. We saw forty plus houses that summer. It was a feat, dragging my 9-month-old son 3-4 times/week to viewings all across the city.I found myself entitled, thinking I deserved it. I was determined to have a big house, my dream home. But, most of all, I wanted a south-facing backyard with a view.I remember feeling stressed and disappointed each time we walked into a house and then walked out, deleting it from the sheet - another one bites the dust.The real estate agent reassured us each time: If it doesn't speak to you, we'll keep looking.After house number thirty or so, I was ready to throw in the towel since we had sold our house and time wasn't on our side. We were getting desperate, and desperate times called for desperate measures. We had to settle.Late one night, while we were looking at MLS listings knowing we needed to jump in and help or else we'd end up in-between houses, our agent sent us a listing. We looked at the pictures, and the view left us wanting. We booked a viewing the next day. It was in an area called Tuscany, more dreamy than Coventry, Dalhousie, or Hamptons.I'll never forget the moment we stepped into the house. Looking up, were the cathedral ceilings I craved. Another few steps and the view came in sight. It was breath-taking - we didn't need convincing. Under normal circumstances, we don't jump into such a big decision without careful thought and consideration.They weren't extraordinary circumstances either, but the house spoke to us, we had found the one, and it checked every box on the wish-list.We lived there for three and a half years. Wonderful years. The pièce de résistance were the daily sunrises at the front of the house, and the sunsets at the back.What was it about sunrise and sunset that consumed me? It wasn't until four and a half years later that I got my answer.It was only natural that I looked for something familiar when moving again. Though, this time was different. My excel days were gone. The single must-have was the openness with lots of trees.A house is a house, but a home can be any place.And for that reason, everywhere I go now, I Iike to take a little something with me - the sunrises and sunsets. I don't have the same view I had before, but some days I'm fortunate enough to see the rising sun on my drive in the mornings.One faithful day, I found myself blessed.I had dropped the kids to school and was making my way back. One street before my house was a turn that went down a hill. As soon as you start the descent, the road opens to the horizon as far as the eyes can touch.That faithful day, I saw the sun rising. It was as if time stood still and I watched the sky as it unfolded with a kaleidoscope of yellow, orange, pink, and red, with a hint of blue and purple. I was in the car driving, but I wasn't in the car driving.It was me and the rays. The warmth from the colors felt like the best hug ever. As if God was stretching his arms to hug me. It wasn't the kind to give you goosebumps all over but rather an embrace that warms you up from the inside. The colors of the horizon enveloping me like fingers intertwining when holding hands.The experience was out of this world. Hard to explain. Sometimes the words don't justify the feeling, the emotion. It was a short stretch of road, and mere seconds felt like minutes.I was still, savoring the moment, experiencing it fully, not knowing, but understanding it to be a higher power in my presence, bringing me to tears and overwhelming me with a sea of love. It was a jolt to my heart, giving it new life.Experiences like these are far and few. When they do happen, I am convinced that someone is there looking after me, reminding me I am never alone.Thank you for reading.If you are interested to read more of my writings, you may read the following one published in The Masterpiece.",https://miro.medium.com/max/5760/1*ofzQApydno6ujRnXwbYBOQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/the-masterpiece/the-sunrise-that-gave-me-a-new-life-e98b36cf0866,mindfulness,6acad77e55860dcdbfbec2730b2a2dc7ae3585b8dd570b9764d83b20
The Path of Awakening: Walking Meditation in Pandemic Times,"I feel my feet on the earth... one and then the next. Sometimes I'll simply listen. Sometimes I'll use an affirmation connected to my breath, in rhythm with my steps. Below are three of my favorite walking meditation techniques.For decades I meditated regularly. This year has changed my practice. My current meditation practice is relevant to what's happening now - it is triage. It must sustain and comfort me, feeding me courage as I manage my chronic anxiety and stay present with the suffering of the world. I'm going back to familiar, gentle practices.Traditional seated meditation feels incongruent, even as an experienced meditation teacher. There's already too much sitting, and my worrying mind won't tolerate it. The anxiety wins out over the witness, to the point that it is intolerable. I am too triggered. So, I turn to what's most soothing: Journaling, restorative yoga postures, self-massage, compassion practices... and walking meditation.These days, my walks are one of the only times I go outside. I'm finding them incredibly precious. I'm really grateful for the opportunity to go for walks. When I walk, I get curious about the relationship between what's going on in the world, and how my body is responding.The Zen Buddhist master and global spiritual leader Thich Nhat Hanh offers simple, accessible guidance for walking meditation in his many books. My favorite is ""The Long Road Turns to Joy."" He suggests that we visualize walking like an aimless tiger. I love this image. It helps me feel at ease.One thing I've noticed when I encourage people to try walking meditation is that they start very tentatively and their arms might move stiffly. It helps me to think of an aimless tiger, so that I get my whole body involved in the action of enjoying the walk.I wonder if you could let your arms swing and let your hips move. Walk as if nothing in the world could bother you, and you have nowhere to be... nowhere to go... no destination.Then, you can be very aware. Mindful of your surroundings, simply appreciate them. Appreciate the feel of wind on your skin, the sound of birds in the trees, the countless colors of green, the smell of mulch and the taste of dust.All of this can be allowed to wash over you as you amble like an aimless tiger.Affirmations - words or phrases that resonate with your values - are personal. You can adapt them to feel authentic to you. If I'm in need of grounding, I say to myself ""I am home"" on the first step, ""I have arrived"" with the next. You can alternate between them with every step, and continue.You might choose to walk with one intention. For example, to lift the suffering of the world... to bring harmony to nature and all beings... to stand up for equity... What's coming to you? What feels most essential right now? Is there a word or phrase that resonates on a visceral level? Breathe that same word or phrase in and out. Fill yourself with your intention, and share it with the world.If you feel distant, isolated or lonely, your word might be love. Breathe in, knowing you are loved. Breathe out, knowing you are loving.Walk in a way that brings you closer to your relationship with the earth and all beings. You can notice how many steps it takes to repeat your intention. Align with your integrity in every step.Mindfulness doesn't mean stiffness or seriousness. There's nothing fancy about it. It means actually really drinking in the whole experience that you're in in the moment. Recognize what's around you, without judgement. Notice the soles of your feet. Maybe turn up the corners of your mouth in a little smile, and be present as you take your walk.If there's a time when you feel captivated, curious, or grateful about some detail of your surroundings- the sound of geese calling out overhead, the grassy scent in the air, or the sight of clouds passing- pause. Allow your feet to stand on the earth. Pause in non-doing presence. Without labeling or identifying or grasping the experience, simply drink it in. Pause on the spot until your aimless tiger is ready to continue on its ramble.During this stressful time, I'm going back to familiar, gentle practices. Walking meditation helps me notice the relationship between what's going on in the world, and how my body is responding. Three techniques you can try are:I hope you'll join me on the path of awakening, and experience a sense of gratitude, purpose, and mindfulness during your walking meditation.Kate Lynch is a meditation coach and inclusive yoga teacher specializing in building resilience to anxiety.

"Singapore's biggest penthouse just hit the market for $104 million, and it's made up of 5 combined residences. Take a look inside.","The penthouse is bigger than the priciest penthouse ever sold in Singapore, which billionaire James Dyson bought for $54 million in 2019.By Katie WarrenSingapore's largest penthouse has hit the market for S$138 million, or about $103.7 million, Singapore's Business Times first reported.Known as the Marina Bay Penthouse Collection, the spread of five combined penthouses has more than 28,000 square feet of living space across five levels. It sits atop the Marina Bay Residences, a 54-floor condominium tower in central Singapore that overlooks the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel.Tristar Properties, the firm marketing the property, decided to combine the units into one listing because many of their clients had trouble finding a big enough penthouse in Singapore, Edwin Yip, an associate director at Tristar, told Insider.""Tristar has worked with many Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) overseas clients looking for luxury homes and we occasionally encountered clients commenting that even the biggest penthouses do not have enough bedrooms and space to accommodate their family needs,"" Yip said.The collection of penthouses is larger than the 21,000-square-foot penthouse atop Singapore's Wallich Residence, which Dyson vacuum cleaner inventor James Dyson bought for $54.2 million in July 2019, breaking Singapore's condo record. The units still need to be combined with a network of internal staircases, Yip said.Look inside Singapore's sprawling super-penthouse.The ""super-penthouse"" spread is made up of five residences that occupy floors 50 through 54 of the Marina Bay Residences, a 54-floor tower in Singapore's central district. The residences are down the street from the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel.The penthouse offers prime views of the Marina Bay Sands, as listing photos show. It's larger than the 21,000-square-foot penthouse at Singapore's Wallich Residence, which occupies the top three stories of Singapore's tallest building, the 64-floor Guoco Tower.James Dyson, the inventor of the Dyson vacuum cleaner, paid $54.2 million for the Wallich penthouse in July 2019. The purchase set a record for the most expensive condo ever sold in Singapore. He sold it at a loss in October 2020, for $47 million.The Marina Bay Penthouse Collection features high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows for optimal views of the city and the bay.The collection's largest unit is a three-story, 11,000-square-foot triplex penthouse. The five units still need to be connected with internal staircases, Tristar associate director Edwin Yip told Insider.Tristar hired Formwerkz Architects as the consultant for the design and feasibility study of the staircases, Yip told Insider. The buyer will cover the cost of the staircases, which is estimated at about $150,000 to $225,000, he said.The collection's amenities include an 82-foot rooftop pool.The building's amenities include a lap pool and a children's pool, a Jacuzzi, open-air pavilions, a gym and spa, a wine cellar, and a cigar lounge.The target buyers are ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices ""looking for a multi-generation home or an opulent home,"" Yip said.Family offices, which manage the wealth of super-rich families, are currently a booming business in Singapore.In the past few months, Google cofounder Sergey Brin and hedge-fund billionaire Ray Dalio have set up family offices in Singapore. Dyson billionaire James Dyson had already established a family office in the city-state.With 24 bedrooms, there would be no shortage of space for a multigenerational family in Singapore's biggest penthouse.Many overseas buyers appreciate the size of Singapore's ""Good Class Bungalows"" - Singapore's most coveted ""landed"" properties - but foreign buyers are largely restricted from buying them, Yip said.Tristar therefore refers to the Marina Penthouse Collection as ""a Good Class Bungalow in the sky,"" he said.Four of the units are currently owned by family offices and the fifth is owned by a private investor, according to Tristar. When Tristar started working with the owners, the firm ""saw a unique opportunity"" to create the massive penthouse, Yip said.Homes like the Marina Bay Penthouse collection have attracted buyers due to factors like the US-China trade war, social unrest in Hong Kong, and the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Tristar.""Singapore has clearly emerged as a safe haven during the pandemic for many UHNW individuals,"" Yip told the Business Times, adding that wealthy foreign buyers have long been attracted by Singapore's law tax rates and political stability.For more great stories, visit Insider's homepage.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2600/0*Ee0-_WY-PuL757gp,https://medium.com/insider/singapores-biggest-penthouse-just-hit-the-market-for-104-million-take-a-look-inside-3c8a4a79a353,business,6b1d5b60289e533d95993b8e26359193e9bf446fff6bc7bedb450c55
Virginity Tests Should Be Illegal: Clearing Up Misconceptions About Virginity,"Sex. The topic the humanity has always been obsessed about. With men thinking about sex on average 19 times a day and women - about 10, it's no wonder sex gets a lot of attention from us.Unfortunately, not everything we know about sex is correct. In fact, there are quite a few lies we've been told over the years. Many so-called facts were debunked as myths a long time ago, but despite that, not everyone is familiar with the truth. And that starts from the very basics, including virginity. As we know it, virginity doesn't exist - particularly female virginity that a woman ""loses"" during her first penetrative sex.Virginity as a concept was introduced to us incorrectly a long time ago. But if you ask an average Joe what losing virginity means, he would probably say something along the lines of ""it's when the woman's hymen gets torn."" That is incorrect, particularly because we haven't been focusing on the female body enough, especially before the twenty-first century. Science disproved this traditional yet misleading definition of virginity, but many individuals are still unaware of it. Not to mention, we, as humans, are much more than our bodies.But the misconceptions about virginity and sex aren't nearly as bad as certain sex crimes that keep happening around the world. We may live in the 21st century, but some practices resemble Middle Ages - such as virginity tests. Virginity tests are both painful, scary, and most importantly, damaging and inhumane. But despite that, some countries haven't ruled them unconstitutional! The world is changing, but it should change faster, and virginity exams must be banned everywhere without exception.Today, we will review the facts and debunk the biggest misconception about female virginity and its entire existence in the form taught to us. But most importantly, we'll talk about the damaging effect of the virginity exams and why all the governments should unanimously ban them.When I was growing up in a somewhat conservative and religious country, the community of people surrounding me was quite liberal and decently educated. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to receive a proper sexual education. Certain concepts were explained to teenagers correctly, but others were not. Virginity, especially a female one, was presented to us misleadingly.The concept of other sexes was rarely discussed at school, let alone different genders. No one talked to us about losing virginity as a gay man, a queer woman, a bi-sexual non-binary person, or as someone who identifies differently when it comes to gender and sexuality. The miscronception about ""penis popping up the hymen"" was engraved in our young minds... at least until the Internet came along.If it weren't for the Internet, I would have probably been uneducated and misguided about sex for a very long time. I can't even comprehend how awful it is: living without knowing how your body works, what happens to it during sex and outside of it, and being utterly misled about your sexuality and body functions. No one should be in this position. I used to be there in the past, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.The inaccurate misconception about hymen penetration is the cornerstone of the miseducation about the female body and sex. Hymen is a flexible tissue inside the vagina opening, and every woman is not like anyone else.Jonathan Shaffir, Doctor of Medicine, explains the hymen miscronception accurately and easily to understand:Every woman is different. Some of us have a small hymen barely touched during the first sexual experience; others have a more pronounced tissue. Some women are born without hymen at all! Bleeding doesn't always occur during the first intercourse, either. The hymen also covers the vaginal entrance differently - in fact, sometimes it barely covers it at all. Here is an illustration of what hymens may look like:There is no right answer. Every body is different, every woman is different, and there are many variants of what your or your friend's body may look like.The list of activities that can affect the shape and placement of the hymen is decently long. First of all, inserting tampons can lead to tearing or stretching. Secondly, exercise can lead to a shape change: cycling, horse riding, using exercise machines at the gym, et cetera.You can pretty much say that living can affect that piece of tissue. Many women use tampons every month, and most of us exercise as well.There are several countries and isolated communities across the globe where virginity tests are still legal. Numerous human rights organizations, including WHO, condemn this practice and call it ""inhumane, traumatizing and torturous."" But, sadly and appallingly, the United States is on the list of countries that don't have proper laws forbidding such invasive tests.On a personal note, I recall my best friend going to a gynecologist for the first time when we were in high school, and the doctor couldn't find her hymen during the exam. The gynecologist wasn't familiar with the modern science and kept insisting my friend is not a virgin anymore. That incident made my friend extremely upset and insecure, and it traumatized her for years. The poor girl started doubting herself and couldn't trust her body. She took that gynecological exam willingly and consented to that test for health reasons! But can you imagine the pain, both physical and emotional, when people are subjected to a forced virginity test?All countries across the world should unanimously ban virginity tests. Multiple research studies were conducted on this topic - here's an example - and there was no scientific conclusion that a hymen examination is reliable or accurate. Numerous factors contribute to the hymen's formation, development, and other life cycles, and no test is accurate to determine if a person is a virgin. It's a shame that some developed or decently developed countries still endorse this practice.A famous American rapper T.I. made headlines in November 2019 after disclosing he takes his daughter to a gynecologist every year to ensure her hymen is still intact. He also added that being a virgin makes a young woman, such as his daughter, undesirable because no one wants to date a virgin.This sparked a nationwide outcry and started a conversation about the legality of the United States' virginity tests. Unfortunately, such practice is permitted under the law in the USA, despite the effort from the human rights groups to scrap it.The good news is, some states are working on having virginity tests banned. California and New York are planning to ban this horrendous and abusive practice, and we can only hope all the other states will follow.Sex has many mysterious concepts surrounding it, but it's imperative to distinguish a myth from reality. Female virginity doesn't exist in the form we were taught in SexEd classes or by society. Science has done a remarkable job studying this topic over the years, and all people should educate themselves. Female virginity doesn't revolve around a hymen - in fact, the idea of the hymen determining the virginity is a complete lie.So, how do we determine if a person - regardless of gender - is a virgin? How can we know if they partook in sex before? According to a remarkable TedTalk by Nina Dølvik Brochmann & Ellen Støkken Dahl, the best thing to do is simply ask.

'Twitter Prime',"The idea of a premium version of Twitter - 'Twitter Pro', 'Twitter+', 'Twitter Max', 'Twitter Prime', call it whatever you want - is basically as old as Twitter itself. In the early days, users were just trying to come up with a way for Twitter to stay afloat - hello Fail Whale - and to make money, since it clearly never would as a silly little service.Fast-forward 15 years and Twitter is now a quite big and decidedly more serious service.¹ It is also a very real business. Twitter reported Q4 2020 revenue yesterday of $1.29B. With net income coming in at $222M. Yes, our little old twee service is making money! As a result, the stock hit an all-time high today, and Twitter's market cap is now past $50B.²And all of this has happened without the need for a premium Twitter. The service was able to get to a scale - 192M (monetizable) daily active users - where the preferred method of monetizing social networks, advertising, finally started working. That's all good news, but it's also exactly why now is the right time to switch things up a bit.And to get back to the idea of Twitter Premium...Twitter has been talking about the idea of a subscription service - or multiple subscription services - for a while now. Both in interviews and even in earnings calls. Such things would seem to be inching closer, as earlier this week, Kurt Wagner of Bloomberg reported on the various paid options being explored and some other ones likely on the table.In that report, at least one analyst tried to poo-poo the idea of moving beyond advertising-based monetization:I mean, define 'enough'? 10 million Twitter users paying $10/month is $100M a month in revenue. Twitter is not Apple, $300M in revenue a quarter for a company doing $1.3B in revenue a quarter right now is certainly meaningful! That's adding almost an extra 25% to the top line! And sure, maybe $10/month is too high a price point (it depends on what is being offered, of course), but I would also argue that 10 million subscribers - just 5% of their DAUs - is also likely too low (again, depending on what is offered - more on that below).I also think that mentality, mixed with the idea also talked about in the article that social networks need to be fully ad-based in order to reach the widest possible audience is ripe to be questioned.In a way, I'd think of Twitter more like a streaming television service in this regard. No, not Netflix in this case, which would be all ""premium"", but more like Hulu or Peacock - both of which offer entirely free tiers, supported by ads, but also have paid tiers with either reduced ad-loads, or that remove ads entirely.Again, social networks have largely shied away from this idea in the past - though, notably, YouTube does this as well with Premium, if you want to consider that a hybrid social network and streaming video service - because of the aforementioned scale aspirations. But it should be clear to everyone at this point - first and foremost, Twitter themselves - that Twitter is never going to be Facebook.³ And they were also long ago passed by Snapchat in daily users. Others are coming. And that's fine. Twitter is still growing their user base, but it also feels like that base is at a certain general level where it's going to remain.This is why the time is right for a premium layer to augment the ad-based monetization layer. Twitter should take advantage of the fact that they're not Facebook, that they don't have this amazing ad business which they have to keep growing to appease Wall Street. They have just a pretty good ad business. And that means they can try to build a pretty good subscription business as well. If - yes, a big 'if' - done well, it will move the needle.To me, it's a no-brainer right now that boils down to what you bake into such a package. Per Wagner's post, there's a lot they can try and a lot they likely are thinking about. But I would argue that they need to keep it pretty simple too. Two options, with a third that encompasses both.This would be the premium consumer offering that I think could encompass a few things. First and foremost, it would remove the ads from Twitter. To me, the ads on Twitter suck. I know they're having some success with app install ads, like Facebook before them, but I don't need to or want to see any of that. I often mute every ad I see in my timeline. And at times, the ad load is really annoying. What I value most from Twitter is information flow. Anything that gets in the way of that, be it annoying ads or annoying Fleet bars taking up space, is a distraction and something I would gladly pay to remove to clear up and speed up my information feed.I think this package also includes some premium customization options. The ability to preview new features. And a set amount of tokens to do things like tipping/paying for certain types of content on the platform. And things like access to premium content - perhaps via a paid Twitter Spaces layer. Or Periscope live video streams. Revue newsletters. Etc. There's a lot you could do here, obviously. This might be $9.99/month.This would be the premium version of Twitter geared more towards professionals and creators. I think that means more powerful analytics. Better tools for the aforementioned Spaces and live video features. I'm sure they could do something with Revue here too.I think this would include access to TweetDeck as well, as a power user/pro tool. The ability to have multiple tweet streams all updating at once in real time. Maybe even the ability to edit tweets?! (Who am I kidding - still, there could be an ""unsend"" grace period option or whatever.) Given the professional target group, this might be $14.99/month.I think the most hardcore Twitter users would appreciate the features of both 'Plus' and 'Pro' and so I would have a 'Prime' offering to bundle everything together as well. Maybe it's $19.99/month.Yes, that's a lot of money to pay for a social networking service for which you're currently paying $0. But for a feed without ads, with professional creation tools, with some baked in ability to help creators monetize, and with the ability to unsend tweets, I think it could be worth it. Or maybe it's Plus: $4.99/Pro: $9.99/Prime: $12.99.Or maybe Twitter Prime is $280/year. Get it? Yeah, in a world where Amazon Prime is $119/year, that feels like a lot. How about $140/year? A nice call back to the humble beginnings.I don't know what the exact pricing should be - Apple One is $14.99/month but the 'Premier' layer is $30/month, Twitch Turbo is $8.99/month, YouTube Premium is $11.99/month, Discord Nitro is $4.99/month or $9.99/month - but you get the picture of the intent here. Something to augment the ad business which is either going to hit a growth wall, or will try to burst through it by shoving more ads in our faces. Now is the time to roll out premium, but to keep it simple.⁴I'm also sure Twitter could come up with far more on-brand, cuter names than 'Plus', 'Pro', and 'Prime'. 'Robin'/'Hawk'/'Eagle'? 'Nest'/'Egg'/'NestEgg'?¹ Some might say a little too serious these days - with former U.S. Presidents being banned and whatnot - at the very least, a service where many tweets have very serious ramifications in the real world.² As a longtime Twitter shareholder, I will just add: finally.³ Nor should it necessarily aspire to be anymore! With great scale comes... well, a lot of headaches.⁴ Though, for the record, I do like the idea of Twitter attempting to monetize via a 5% cut of Revue subscriptions. I think that for businesses which are being run separately, it's fine to monetize them outside of these simple bundles, though perhaps also giving some options there for Twitter users.",https://miro.medium.com/max/6040/0*0H506Ds65xJcw4wt,https://500ish.com/twitter-prime-1f13c43491c7,social-media,6b495adb994f2eb1d1926f259992f70655f09f4d34dc96e27968073a
"Be the Big Damn Hero in Your Own Life - Three Lessons from ""Extreme Ownership""","Face the ""new normal"" by assuming that help is not coming.I've been fortunate to have had powerful lessons in leadership and ownership from a young age and was able to conceptualize these lessons while reading ""Extreme Ownership"" by Jocko Willink. My big takeaway from this book is that we need to take full ownership of our problems, focus our full attention on them and feel pressure to drive results.While it's easier to complain and shift blame and look to others for a fix, I have found it a much greater relief to just own the problem. Once I've accepted ownership, the problem is more likely to get fixed.This mentality started with my first legal job as a hostess at Denny's.I had a leader who deeply embodied this philosophy. He would demand a full recount and ownership of any situation, whether it was my 'fault' or not.Is the drawer short by $10? He didn't want to hear any excuses about how busy it was; he would demand that I take responsibility for the missing money because I was the boss of the drawer.The customer is angry because she couldn't sit next to a window? I'd be required to own the relationship without laying blame onto people (as valid as the blame felt).I whined to my coworkers about his harshness - until I saw his take ownership.One evening after a huge rush, the general manager 'popped in' for a surprise visit and immediately called all employees to the front, demanding an answer as to why the dining room was in shambles.I was surprised and impressed when my boss stepped-up and took full responsibility - not pointing out the menus in disarray (my responsibility), the floor covered in crumbs, or the egg yolk that had somehow gotten splattered across the prep station. He owned every piece of it even though he had been working as hard as any of us.That lesson in leadership always stuck out to me - that a leader owns the responsibility for all, no matter who is at fault.That whining and finding ways to shift blame just gives away your power.And that no matter how small, we can and should be the boss of whatever task we do.One of the big lessons I've been taught through a lifetime of weird experiences is how to handle pressure. Pressure is inevitable; establishing priorities and taking action helps you to remain calm and effective.One such weird experience was getting locked out of my Chinese apartment at 3 am while wearing just a nightgown and a clay face mask as I was taking out the garbage. The wind blew the door shut leaving me stuck on the freezing cold 6th story platform with no way back in.With no phone, no memory of anyone's number, and a Chinese-language ability at the ""hello"" and ""one, two, three"" level - it was not the best situation.I remember standing and waiting in front of the door for a good five minutes, hoping I'd wake up from what had to be a nightmare. Then I relaxed, took stock of my priorities, and acted.Just having this sad little priority list was enough to galvanize me into action.I walked down the six flights of stairs, washed my hilariously caked-on face mask off in a koi pond, and gingerly walked barefooted in the snow to the security guard station. I was soaked and entirely numb when I finally arrived at the station. To add insult to injury, I had to deal with the uproarious laughter at my bedraggled state while trying to get my point across using interpretive dance. But as the sun rose to herald in a new day, a teenager on a scooter was hired to break into my apartment (taking him a disconcerting 11 seconds).As frustrating as the entire situation was, it was oddly glorious to have lived through it. Taking a deep breath and knowing that you have no other option than to do the hard thing makes it easier to bear. Whether that hard thing is breaking through the ice of a scummy pond to scrub your face, leaving an unsuitable partner, or spending your vacation fund to make a necessary car repair.There is a powerful lesson that comes when you really own that fact that no one is coming to save you. That you are on your own to save yourself. And that you can save yourself because you have the evidence the prove it.It's a liberating concept.The final big takeaway from ""Extreme Ownership"" is the value of managing risks.Having a safety net (whether financial, familial, or organizational) gives you options. Without a safety net, you, by necessity have more awareness of what can go wrong at any given time. In the back of your mind, you have a plan of attack.One issue that was incredibly common in China was theft. Having phones, purses, and wallets stolen was a very common occurrence, and for a foreigner, (required to carry their passport) theft could be devasting.So, of course, it happened to me.Let me be upfront and honest - I was dumb. I own this.At the Starbucks next to my apartment, there were maybe five total tables. Getting a table meant I could download as many TV shows and books as I wanted, as my apartment didn't have internet.So, when I needed to use the bathroom, there was no way I was going to take all my things with me. The second my table was clear, there would be a mad fight for the next person to take it, So I used my purse to save the table. And of course, my purse was gone when I returned from the bathroom.While it was a predictable disaster, one thing I was proud of was having a plan ready to go. I had instructions, phone numbers to call, digital copies of my IDs/passport/credit cards, and all other documentation on my email ready to go. Having managed the risk beforehand saved me a great deal of time and stress during an already stressful time.While I could have to prevent my purse from being stolen, focusing on what was in my control helped me to win the situation.This type of thinking can become automatic. Thinking through what most likely will go wrong and creating a mental process saves valuable mental energy. You don't need to even do anything, just think it through.Heres an example, stop for one second and think ""Here is what I'd do if there was a fire in my house right now - "" and consider what you'd do. How would you get out? What would you grab? When you got outside, what would be the first thing you'd do?You are responsible for yourself (and maybe others). Take that responsibility to heart.Our world has enough people passively waiting to be rescued. The future belongs to those willing to take ownership. Those who accept responsibility without shame, who remain calm, prioritize and act, and who identify and manage risk will succeed.Help isn't coming, you need to be the big damn hero in your own life.What are you waiting for?",https://miro.medium.com/max/2924/0*UH91KfUUnk9x4MHg.png,https://medium.com/swlh/be-the-big-damn-hero-in-your-own-life-three-lessons-from-extreme-ownership-7d08a81c1097,leadership,06ba5fa555e114c04c6e9e60d408a155238b662c5666ebca12d38502
Why the Apple Silicon M1 is a Big Win for Accessibility - Part Two,"In the first part of this potentially slightly over-elaborate article on accessibility and Apple's new M1 processor, I focused mostly on technical context, app and web development, and to some extent on application design and UX. The good news is, this radical new approach to hardware goes beyond all of those aspects, and allows the operating system - Big Sur - to further evolve for all users, both disabled and not. So, without further ado, let's see the improvements this new OS brings for accessibility, after which I'll be circling back to application and - guess what - even industrial design.Big Sur, like any new version of Apple's Mac operating system, is not without its bugs, but while the rest of the world focuses on what I would call barely even first-world issues, I'd like to highlight what this new OS does for accessibility. The very moment you set up the operating system, you're already met with a screen giving you a brief intro to the four major disability types that Apple tries to do its best to support: vision, motor, hearing and cognitive.Now, of course this screen is not limited to the M1 machines, you'd very much get this on an Intel installation too, but it does educate on a level that I did not see before, and that's important, because the more I spend time researching accessibility and developing for it, the more I realise that yes, there is a group of people who just don't care about it to a level that they don't even feel bad about not caring. However, there is a much larger group of people, who start paying attention to it once they get a bit of education on the matter.Another nice addition to Big Sur is the accessibility shortcuts menu. Since I adopted touch-bar based Mac models since 2018, I felt the need to have an alternative way of accessing VoiceOver than just the standard cmd+F5, so added it to my top menu-bar as well. To my surprise in Big Sur, this also enables a dropdown menu of various extremely useful shortcuts. Attention to detail on a whole new level and a great example of combining excellent UX with accessibility.You'll also note that the tools presented are categorised, which again, shows dedication to accessibility education. The benefits of this panel extend to auditors as well, who now have to click and navigate less to reach these various tools, and can toggle them on or off with ease.And then of course, there's Rosetta2, the engine that makes all - with a few exceptions - the old Intel apps still work as if nothing changed. Of course, this is a perk for every user, but then again, so is accessibility if you think for more than a second. Had running Intel apps been problematic on the M1 machines, while many would have put up with the struggles just to be on an ARM-based Mac, it would have been a much less enticing option for anyone disabled, as the last thing most of them would have wanted, was to move between iOS, MacOS on M1, and MacOS on Intel, just to get everything done. While seamless transitions are great for everybody, for many disabled folks it can be the deciding factor.For the last three decades or so, the concept of a window, from a software perspective that is, has largely remained the same. It's this frame with three buttons: close, minimise and maximise. What most people did, and still do, including myself, is basically live with a desktop that has a ton of windows scattered around, mostly layered on top of each other like a pile of clothes you never bothered to fold. Each of those windows would take up most of the screen, and those of us attempting to deal with this madness tried window manager apps, or just manually size them and place them in various corners of the screen. The M1 changes this, or better said, it enables the change.The reality is that many of our desktop apps take up way too much space. Just typing this on a browser, in Medium's web interface, I realise there is more space taken up by the white space on the left and the right than the actual space I am using to get the job done. That is objectively a waste of space. Browsers and most desktop apps are conceptualised as horizontal spaces, while in reality they never had to be, we just kept making them so for some odd reason.When I first opened Untappd on the Mac, it hit me, we have all been using screen real-estate wrong for years. Yes, there are genuine use-cases where a horizontal space for an app is required - think an IDE for coding (though some would disagree), video or photo editing - but in more situations than not, a vertical space is more than enough. Don't believe me? Look at all the iPhone and iPad apps we've all been using in portrait mode for ages. The Untappd app takes up about 10% of screen real-estate on my M1 Mac, while opening the website would probably use up anywhere between 70-100% of the space - depending on usage habits. Many wouldn't see this as an obvious potential accessibility perk, and that's because it isn't obvious. Sounds more like a UX delighter for a percentage of users. But that's just it. Often those UX ""nice-touches"", are what take accessibility too from bare-bones to a great experience for all.Since the dawn of remote control cars for kids and mobile phones for adults, battery technology and implicitly battery-life has been one of the most popular topics. I remember as a teenager comparing the battery-life of my cellular phone to those of my classmate's and feeling a tad ashamed by my old Philips Diga's rotten two days. Battery-life is one where less is definitely not more!While during the last two decades we have certainly improved on our battery technologies, we're still nowhere near having them last a very long time, or as long as we would like them to - which is basically for ever! Apple realised that there are two major roadblocks in innovation: time and physics - you don't say?!? 😁 Those complaining that Apple hasn't innovated ever since the first iPhone, are horribly mistaken, and the M1 shows that. It also shows that one needs both time and physics on their side to achieve innovation that can be mass-produced and deliver quality at the same time. While Apple realised that beating the physics of limited battery-life is an extremely long game, better suited to those who don't want to solve an immediate problem, started looking at these limitations from a different angle. Technically speaking, no technologist wants batteries. Not even extra-long life batteries. The ideal scenario is to run our devices on thin air, or heck, not even that if possible - because frankly air isn't a guaranteed resource either! While current commercially available battery technologies sound discouraging and the aforementioned quite utopian, thankfully there is a middle-ground. Instead of frantically trying to squeeze more milliamps into an already tightly sandwiched packaged, Apple decided to reduce consumption - aka, yet again, scale down, in a sense. In reality, no user cares about the size of the battery, but they do about the number of hours it lasts. One can deplete 10.000 mAh in mere seconds if the consumption is high - and without being facetious - most Android devices have proven that over and over again. The solution - and a green one I might add - is not to build bigger batteries, but to generate less power consumption and improve power management.OK, so how does this lends itself to accessibility? It does in the same way it does for everyone else: more mobility. If a person who has no disabilities finds it frustrating that they have to be tethered down to their machine after a couple of hours because the laptop is charging again, imagine someone disabled, and how much extra effort that requires. It breaks their workflow, their activities have to revolve around being able to charge the device, etc. With the M1, all this goes away. For all intents and purposes, the M1 chips result in machines that run for a full day (minus the hours you sleep). Even if you're an insomniac, and you sleep just 4-5 hours a day, during that time the machine can recharge and get you going for another day without once being plugged in. That is unprecedented mobility and flexibility that disabled individuals will gain the most out of.When the first touch-bar machines arrived, I was excited because I saw the benefits of it, and I use it plenty myself, but one thing did disappoint - the removal of the escape key. Well, it was there, but it was digital and thus less accessible, which I found to be a very non-Apple move. The M1 machines bring that back. Now, in fairness, the reintroduction of the physical ""esc"" key and the discreet touch-id button have been back since the launch of the 16"" Pro, but seeing these in the 13"" M1 Pro as well, is great news because it gives me real hope that this more accessible design is here to stay.When excited about tech, I tend to get a little bit carried away, so take all this with a pinch of salt, but from where I'm standing, Apple's new M1 machines, and to an even greater extent the 13"" M1 Pro sound and feel like a disabled person's dream machine and of even greater things to come. The less obvious perk is that this makes it equally, if not more, a dream machine for everyone else. It's a testament that good industrial design, creative innovation circumventing physics' own limitations and a solid bet on the right technology stack, is all translatable into a machine that caters for everyone in an equitable way, and isn't that a world we all want to live in?",https://miro.medium.com/max/4480/1*pG-doVTEbOwWeN5RP_Qvfg.png,https://hmh.engineering/why-the-apple-silicon-m1-is-a-big-win-for-accessibility-part-two-b17b596214bc,ux,6ceb6c13d0091de91b76ca2bdb9f065284aa308684dcc1366fff46cb
How Writing Changes Your Brain,"In an old article of mine, I explain some of the ways reading changes our brains. Amazingly, an activity which helps us absorb and learn so much information changes the physical structures of our brains for the better.Since I found learning about how reading changes our brains so interesting, I did some more research and discovered that other activities change our brains too - including writing. Read on about how writing helps our minds.Writing helps us remember information. Experts consider that writing by hand is more effective for retaining information than using word processors, as it engages more senses and motor neurons than using computers.Using nerve cells across lots of areas of our brains reinforces connections between different areas, helping us to think faster and remember better. Moreover, Karin James and Laura Engelhardt explain that when children handwrite letters of the alphabet, they familiarise areas of their brains with the motion required to create their shape.They explain that using areas of our brains responsible for movement, including our motor and pre-motor cortexes, helps us learn, remember, and distinguish between different letters better than we would if we tried to learn only by engaging areas of the brain responsible for looking.These neuroscientists, therefore, explain that handwriting, rather than simply learning from looking at letters, helps children learn and remember different letters of the alphabet, since handwriting engages more areas of the brain and establishes more extensive connections between them.Interestingly, after their experiments, James and Engelhardt discovered that the area of the brain people use to distinguish between different letters, the left-fusiform gyrus, is used more by those who have experience handwriting than those who have only had visual exposure to the same letters.In the same 2014 study, Karin James and Laura Engelhardt discovered that in children who are still learning how to read, writing by hand develops part of the brain we use to recognise different letters.They explain their findings show that:From this evidence, James and Engelhardt suggest that children who handwrite letters of the alphabet before they have learned to read will find it easier to become literate once they start reading. They explain that this is because children who handwrite strengthen areas of the brain responsible for letter recognition and differentiation, in ways that just looking does not.If you're reading this, you obviously already know how to read. But the information could be helpful if you're a parent to young children, or plan to be one at some point in your life. We live in a world increasingly dominated by technology, and James's and Engelhardt's research stresses that analogue methods of learning, such as using a trusty pen and paper, have cognitive benefits that we shouldn't abandon too quickly.Resources to Recover explain that if we're feeling anxious or stressed, thinking through how we're feeling and working out why by writing our thoughts down could help us identify the sources of our negative emotions.In a 2018 article published by Cambridge University Press, Karen Baikie and Kay Wilhelm discovered that writing to express emotions for 15-20 minutes a few days a week may have physical and psychological health benefits.Somewhat surprisingly, according to Baikie's and Wilhem's research, expressive writing showed more conclusive evidence that it can help relieve the symptoms of physical, rather than mental, health conditions.They explain that research suggests the evidence that achieving relief from negative emotions by expressing them in writing is weak. The evidence for mental health benefits is strongest for relief from traumatic memories and sources of anxiety, by desensitizing sufferers through repeated exposure.Although the psychological effects are limited, they suggest there is good evidence to show that expressive writing can relieve the physical symptoms of certain diseases, including lung functioning in asthma patients, pain experienced by cancer patients, and pain in women with pelvic pain.So, there is tentative evidence that writing about our feelings can help relieve negative emotions - even if simply by desensitizing us to them. Baikie and Wilhelm do argue, however, that there is strong evidence that writing about how we feel can relieve symptoms of physical diseases.When we write, especially when we write creatively, we're engaging our brains with several tasks at once. The Kensington White Plains, a New York-based organisation established to help sufferers of Alzheimer's and dementia, explain that when we write, our brains are:They explain that engaging our brains in these ways when we write is a bit like working our bodies out when we do physical exercise. In particular, The Kensington White Plains say that writing is great for our grey matter.Our brains on average are composed of around 60 percent white matter and 40 percent grey matter. Our white matter cells are specialised to quickly pass messages from one cell to another. Our grey matter cells are important for motor and sensory functions, as well as learning and memory.Keeping our grey matter healthy is important for our abilities to perform everyday tasks as sharply as possible. Strengthening our grey matter by flexing our brain cells when performing certain tasks, like writing, may help us stave off neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.So, writing is great for our brains in several ways. Handwriting engages several areas of the brain, more so than writing using word processors. This increased activity helps our memory by solidifying connections between different areas of the brain. Handwriting, especially letters of the alphabet, may also help young children learn how to read, as handwriting engages areas of the brain which are important for distinguishing between letters.There is also strong evidence to suggest that writing has health benefits. Strangely, writing can help relieve symptoms of pain experienced by sufferers of physical diseases. Moreover, it also keeps our grey matter young and strong, reducing the risks of neurodegenerative diseases. So, if you needed more incentives to keep writing, then I hope this article has given you some.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8064/1*sHz105QLC2xVvTgvaK_sjA.jpeg,https://medium.com/the-brave-writer/how-writing-changes-your-brain-75c9087f37e7,neuroscience,6d03875e5324b88cec5a3fd3b6f7fe284ade5533120f707510490c32
Artificial Psychologist or Psychological Intelligence?,"In 2021, Mental health is one of the trending subjects. The pandemic has brought us many undesirable consequences not only to our daily routine but also to our mindset. Different people experience different psychological after-effects they have never had before. It could be a new obsession with keeping everything clean or some other issues that we all had to face at a different scale. Some habits that we acquired during the last year like washing hands or give away banknotes forever - bring no harm. However, there are many other consequences that lay deeper and might be more damaging to our overall mental state.Apart from newly acquired habits and threats to mental health, the pandemic has shown us that there is a certain gap in the accessibility of healthcare services. Here, by healthcare services, I mean both physiological and psychological.Many people have found themselves literally unable to visit their mental health therapist or even a family doctor due to pandemic conditions.Even before the pandemic emerged, psychological care was not that accessible for many. Some people have been still considering mental care as a overrated and expensive. Why? Firstly, it can be hard to find a good therapist. Secondly, when you finally find a good therapist, usually their rate per hour is not very price-friendly for everyone. And also, a full therapy is usually a long-term process.As we see here, the problem of accessibility of mental care is there. Similar to many other industries, AI-powered tools have managed to close different gaps. Here I would like to cover how AI can help the mental health industry and make it more accessible, price-friendly and effective.According to Michael Rucker (2020) from VeryWellHealth, there is already a Chatbot Psychologist that offers affordable private sessions without pre-booking.In his article, Michael Rucker (2020) notes that the International Committee of the Red Cross recognized that although messaging-app bots are price-friendly and easy to use, the initial reviews of these chatbots in 2017 were mixed. Chatbots do not have a mind of their own, so they have to follow a pre-written script.The author also mentions that according to experts, this software will probably make the most sense when it's used in a conjunction with a human therapist (Michael Rucker, 2020).In 2016, the Institute for Creative Technologies introduced Ellie - the robot therapist treating soldiers with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ellie is created to detect verbal and nonverbal indications of PTSD by following a specially prepared script. The robot asks the most common leading questions and gathers answers of patients. The key to her success is that she listens without prejudice, allowing patients to fully open up. Apart from the verbal data, the robot also collects facial expressions, eye gaze direction, gestures, smile level and other non-verbal signs of depression. Ellie was created to collect and gather information about patients but she cannot prescribe treatment or medicine. Instead, she is used in cooperation with human doctors.Below is the example of a session lead by Ellie:This is only one of the examples of AI psychologist and there already are many more.But are we far from getting an accessible AI therapist?They already exist, so not that far. Right now, if you want to get some AI-operated psychological help, you can talk to Siri or Alexa.I'm an iPhone user, so I decided to talk to Siri:Me: Siri, I'm sad.Siri: You can always count on me.Me: I think I have a depression.Siri: I'm very sorry to hear that. I'm always ready to talk to you.Me: Siri, I think I'm not good at anything.Siri: I don't know what does it mean: 'Siri, I think I'm not good at anything'. Do I need to look through the Internet for this query?...Well, the talk went better than I expected.I thought that Siri would immediately shift me to Google or Safari under a query: 'I'm sad'. It would also be fair to note, that Siri or Alexa are not considered as AI-powered psychologists, but rather personal assistants.In this case, Siri cannot assist me with full mental health support, however, it can help me, as an owner, by observing my interactions with it and further searches. If it detects a crisis, it can even summon help (Bird, R., 2018).In the nearest future, this application of AI will not only be more developed but also much more spread, delivering better and much more accessible mental health care for everyone.",https://miro.medium.com/max/7286/0*SrkyWKqL2hcB_IgF,https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/artificial-psychologist-or-psychological-intelligence-eecceb2f5d79,artificial-intelligence,6da6be38c4eb42ae5146ddd4fdea1075d183d7f04d227f5215cbfed7
Candy Hearts,"Picking up the box of candy Valentine hearts from her chair, Danielle took a seat in the classroom. At the age of 45, she'd decided to take a college physics class. In high school she'd always been the nerdy type. But, after one year of college, her boyfriend had convinced her to give up on a degree and get married. So now divorced for two years and her son away at an out-of-state university, she decided it was time to get back out into the world. Danielle thought finishing her degree might be just the thing.Starting off slow, she signed up for two night courses. Physics and Spanish. Spanish came back fairly quickly as it was something she used frequently at work. Physics, not so much. After the first two classes, she wondered if she should have started out slower by taking calculus instead or maybe just algebra. She had mastered calculus in high school and had done pretty well in physics, too. But that had been over 25 years ago.Now she was acing the Spanish II class but struggling with physics. The theory of relativity had always eluded her and that's what this class focused on. Never a quitter, she forged ahead and was even considering using a tutor.Danielle looked down at the small box in her hand. She grinned remembering the Valentine's Days in grade school when all the students decorated envelopes and taped them to their desks. It was a fun tradition to have the class wind through the rows of desks distributing their Valentine cards to fellow students.From kindergarten to sixth grade Danielle had received a lot of valentines and always made sure she gave one to each of her classmates. In fourth grade she had given a box of candy hearts to a boy she liked. That box of hearts led to her first kiss. Years later she married that boy and Danielle gave him a box of candy hearts every Valentine's Day during their marriage.Danielle hadn't really made friends with anybody in the class. And although she'd gone out with a few of them after class for a drink once, she'd declined when they asked her again. She wondered if any of them realized she was old enough to be their mother.As more students filtered in and the room filled up, she sat with the box of candy hearts on her desk and wondered who had put it there. ""To: Danielle"" was written neatly on the box but in the space following ""From:"", there was only a pink heart. Scanning the room, she couldn't imagine who might have left it.Danielle got comfortable in her chair as the class was about to start. The instructor, Jessica Edwards, walked up to the whiteboard. Her long strawberry blonde hair pulled loose from its hastily tied knot as she wrote in bold red letters ""Happy Valentine's Day!"" Picking up a pink marker she framed the greeting with a big heart. Then turning toward the class she smiled and looking directly at Danielle gave her a wink.The theory of relativity would have to wait for another day.Sydney Duke Richey writes from the heart. Inspired by everyday experiences, her poems, haiku and non-fiction come from a slice of her life.Sydney lives in the Pacific Northwest with her husband.",https://miro.medium.com/max/11248/1*A-NZPhdXV9e6OEKPc6sKqQ.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/candy-hearts-2452cef47c45,fiction,6df48bf52ea04f954c575026667e223c84a358088be7aaa9830111ff
Meet The Disruptors: Dr. Timothy T Childs of ViruTech On The Three Things You Need To Shake Up Your Industry,"As a part of our series about business leaders who are shaking things up in their industry, I had the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Timothy T Childs from ViruTech Systems Inc.Dr. Timothy T Childs is the founder of ViruTech Systems Inc. After helping lead his undergraduate football team (Florida A&M University-FAMU) to a National Championship, Dr. Childs became a graduate research scientist at Bell Labs while attending Stanford University. His dual Bell Labs/Stanford University physics research training led to a series of semi-conductor innovations and patent development experiences at Honeywell Research Center in Minnesota. Some career highlights of Childs include the successful launch of TLC as a Honeywell Inc. independent spinoff and its selection by the Pentagon Special Program Office in 1994. As well as his work with Lockheed Martin developing futuristic Millimeterwave technologies for the U.S. military and commercial industries. His latest venture, ViruTech Systems Inc. MMW Rapid Virus Detector (MRVDS) provides actual virus detection within seconds targeted for > 99.9% accuracy. The product is a result of converting next-generation military technologies to addressing medical issues.Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your ""backstory""? What led you to this particular career path?Growing up as the last of eight children, my father, as an entrepreneur and pastor, imparted his philosophy about the importance of religion and knowledge to me. Salvation and education are the two most important items in my life. Not only did I drink the Kool-Aid, but my thirst for learning was insatiable. At home, I was always asking questions, wearing down my older siblings and parents to teach me as much as they possibly could. Around the house, I continually tried to invent solutions and repair electronics, appliances, automobiles, etc. It was no surprise my brother taught me how to do simple algebra and long division with a slide ruler before starting first grade. In my integrated elementary and junior high school classes, teachers either loved me or were annoyed by my persistence to learn. There was no hesitancy in my asking challenging questions and ""I do not know"" answers were green lights for doing research to find out the answers. Even my ""cool"" teammates of various sports knew that math and physics were what really kept me motivated to go to high school, then college. In graduate school, the seemingly unlimited access of doing innovative physics and technical instrumentation development at Bell Labs and Stanford University in California was like a child learning the various types of goodies in a candy store. Meanwhile, I went to church religiously, paid my tithes and thanked God for my blessings. In fact, I helped design and physically build one of the largest churches in the East Palo Alto area.Can you tell our readers what it is about the work you're doing that's disruptive?We have captured the Sars-Cov2 Virus Multi- fingerprint signature. We have the profiles versus concentration (level of infection). Therefore, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), ViruTech Systems Inc. intends to instantly detect viruses and other biological invaders in saliva and other human samples. We hope to provide the level of infection within seconds of the test, on the spot, without shipping to a lab. Rapid testing can be done autonomously without chemicals, swaps, needles or multiplying the virus. The objective is to help stop the pandemic spread and help the economic recovery of various business sectors as the vaccination rolls out.Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?I thought when I won my first million-dollar military contract, the company and I would have no financial issues. Within 30 days after being awarded more than a million-dollar Air Force contract, I was sleeping in a phone booth at Washington D.C. Reagan Airport penniless before going to a Pentagon mandatory debriefing the next day. Lesson learned - for small businesses, positive cash flow management is key to success and survival, period!We all need a little help along the journey. Who have been some of your mentors? Can you share a story about how they made an impact?Not including my awesome siblings and parents, I have been gifted with god-sent mentors including my present advisory board. I would like to specifically highlight:Mr. Stafford, a retired Air Force test pilot who kept me on the edge of my seat with excitement for physics as my high school physics teacher.My FAMU National Champion Football Coach Rudy Hubbard & Pastor Virgil Robinson of East Palo Alto California, both taught me that success is a committed mindset, personal discipline to execute and reach the goal. They used opposite language and temperament to teach the same message.Fred Green, former president of Ault Electronics, Clint Larson and Mannie Jackson (both former Honeywell executives) instilled that I must be accountable for taking care of business well and with integrity.My key mentors for this project specifically are Dr. Neville V. Smith and Dr. James West (both former Bell Laboratories scientist). They exposed, taught and supported me to focus on meaningful innovative research and product development. They did this as I was a repeated intern traveling and working at various national laboratories, interacting with research and technology inventors, pioneers and Noble Prize Laureates. I used to regularly play ""Go"" with Nobel Prize Laurette Philip Anderson. The hard work, interactions, conversations and relationships were priceless!In today's parlance, being disruptive is usually a positive adjective. But is disrupting always good? When do we say the converse, that a system or structure has 'withstood the test of time'? Can you articulate to our readers when disrupting an industry is positive, and when disrupting an industry is 'not so positive'? Can you share some examples of what you mean?Disrupting technology in an industry is inevitable as we evolve and address issues and problems facing mankind. However, a positive or negative disruption in technology and industry can be determined by the quality of life resulting from such disruption.Negative and positive examples include:Nuclear/atomic bomb: Although developing such a disruptive technology was inevitable, the quality, the quality of life, fear and the ability to destroy mankind is quite high-risk and a negative result for mankind. We all may have been better off if such disruptive technology was never invented.NMR Nuclear magnetic resonance-Now MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)Provide precise details of your body parts, especially soft tissues, with help of magnetic fields and radio waves. This has provided diagnosis that has saved numerous lives.Digital Music: Although it allows accessibility and transfer of music like never before the quality of the sound cannot compare to the analog sounds from the Vinyl records. This disruptive technology to the music industry is a worthwhile compromise.Can you share 3 of the best words of advice you've gotten along your journey? Please give a story or example for each.All money is not good money. A highly reputable investment broker firm came to our office with an interested investor on a Thursday. By the end of the meeting the investor agreed to invest more than $20 million by mid of the next week. That Saturday that investor was on front page of the Tribune as being arrested by the federal government on funds embezzlement, etc. He went to prison! Our attorney stated that if they had invested the feds would have retrieved and frozen our bank accounts as well. It would have been a nightmare.Do not ignore the fly in the soup, as the soup may be worthless. A major customer wanted to combine one of our patented technology with another company's unique technology for a major contracted deal. When we reviewed the other companies' technology, the physics made no sense. When they said their product defies the laws of physics, we passed on the project. Three years later they were arrested on fraud.Customer management is as important as project mgmt. Doing a project beyond the contract on promise to pay not only jeopardizes the financial position of the company but strains the customer/supplier relationship. As such, we found customer management is as important or more important! Cash is king and it helps build strong relationships.We are sure you aren't done. How are you going to shake things up next?Yes, we have a few more innovations we hope to be forthcoming including instant detection and analysis of viruses or other diseases by scanning the individual directly. However, first thing first, we are focused on instant detection in human samples.Do you have a book, podcast, or talk that's had a deep impact on your thinking?NoCan you please give us your favorite ""Life Lesson Quote""? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?Give the best contribution you can during this one shot of life.You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)Have more physicists doing medical research. Instead of medicating and treatments for medical conditions, physicists have a tendency to want to figure out the physics/cause and eliminate or cure the issue. (But I still want a medical doctor around so the patient lives). As a physicist can detect the composition of Mars and the life of a star light years away, there should be no issues remotely detecting viruses and bacteria in a person a few feet way.How can our readers follow you online?Check out our website: www.virutechsystems.com and LinkedIn",,https://medium.com/authority-magazine/meet-the-disruptors-dr-timothy-t-childs-of-virutech-on-the-three-things-you-need-to-shake-up-your-7b6e0dbcee1f,startups,06e6e45900cdb07ec85011cb13bfaf34f30e3b9e2aec8073286a3583
Apple's Upcoming Innovation Could Be a Potential Threat to Google's Monopoly,"The following excerpt is taken from Apple's ""Think Different"" Campaign:Steve Jobs became Silicon Valley's icon not only for his ""go-get-it"" attitude but also because of his sheer resilience which he adhered to till his departure. From obtaining an internship at HP to getting fired from his own company, his tenacity to place Apple above everything else is what has indeed placed the company on the trillion-dollar landmark.But even with the legacy of creative impulsiveness that he left behind, the company's growth has been 'moderately great' at best as cheaper smartphone and electronic manufacturers are now on the rise in most of East Asia challenging the landscape of global markets.For many year's customers haven't been observing any significant moves in terms of innovation when it comes to the 'iPhone manufacturer'. Every new model seems to be a replica of the older version excluding the 'in-built camera' that happens to step up a notch in order to justify the ridiculous price tag.Recent reports stated that the United States antitrust authorities along with the government have filed a lawsuit against Google for ""misusing its power to shut its competitors in search ads"".While Apple had been focusing on its service revenue streams earlier on, this has presented a brand new opportunity to the 'tech giant' to explore a space that would not only cut costs but also help it to become the 'next leader' in the search engine game.According to a Financial Times report issued back in August:The report also pointed to the fact that ""search volume is rising incredibly from Apple's crawler"".Towards the end of the third quarter of 2020, their paid subscriber base grew by more than 35 million in comparison to Q2.All of this should point to the fact that the culture of 'innovation' is well and truly alive within the organization, as the 'iPhone manufacturer' is quietly shifting its focus on building a more service-oriented revenue platform as opposed to simply relying on their smartphones and MacBooks.Recent reports also mentioned that Apple hired Google's head of search, John Giannandrea, two years ago in an attempt to enhance its virtual personal assistant, Siri, something that has been an integral part of the iPhone since its inception.Google has been successful so far in painting an image in their user's mind about what the ideal search engine should look like and how it should be able to connect an individual to the rest of the world all while addressing their queries.However, these steps are the hallmark of a 'creative giant' which Apple has also long been accustomed to being with regards to keeping their customers hooked onto their devices.And if what Jobs said about creativity and resilience is deemed to be correct, the company should be able to 'connect its customers to the world' with their 'potential search engine' in no time.For more interesting articles on technology, startups, or the stock market, feel free to check out some of my other articles below:",,https://medium.com/swlh/apples-upcoming-innovation-could-be-a-potential-threat-to-google-s-monopoly-da7d78acf9a,business,6ea25af045f543b7515cae3552860f8ce60fcd1d0df0507c1bab3301
Choose the Best Freelance Business Structure for Taxes,"Discover the different types of freelance business structures that you can create and run, what that means for your taxes, and the tax forms you'll need to file.It's easy to think of a little bit of freelance work as a paid hobby, and to believe you don't need to ""run a freelance business"" until you make it a full-time job. In fact, if you make money from selling your creative products or services, you're already a freelance business - even if you haven't formalized it.The good news is that freelance businesses don't have to be complex, and in some cases, you don't even need to file any special paperwork.It's helpful to understand the different types of ""business structure"" though, as they can have an impact on the paperwork and taxes you file and can even affect how much tax you pay.If you're not sure what these guides are all about, I recommend you read my introduction to the freelance tax guide.If you're confused about any of the definitions I use here, check out the glossary.I am not an accountant or qualified tax professional. These guides are intended only as general information, not as specific advice or recommendations. You should not rely on any of the information in these guides to make financial, tax, or other decisions. Always use official sources like the IRS website or your state's Department of Revenue to get accurate, up-to-date information.You should always speak to a qualified tax professional about your unique tax circumstances. These guides only apply to freelancers filing taxes as sole-proprietors or single-member LLCs in the United States. You'll find a disclaimer at the end of this article.For the purposes of these guides, I'm going to describe your freelancing activities as your freelancing business. Whether you're a writer or another creative, your freelance business represents the revenues, expenses, and profits you make as a self-employed individual. If you earn money from freelancing, you're a freelance business.Your freelance business structure will have an impact on how you do business and the types of tax forms you file. The main business structures are:If you want a very quick guide to help you choose the right business structure, skip to the last part of this article for your options.In almost all cases, a sole proprietor or a single-member LLC will be suitable for most freelance tax needs. Forming an S Corporation or a C Corporation is often far more than a freelancer needs to do.A sole proprietor is the ""default"" type of freelance business you will be if you haven't filed formal documents with your state to form an LLC or other type of business. You don't need to file any special paperwork to be a sole proprietor.If you're in business by yourself, you are a sole proprietor ""automatically"" unless you decide to file specific paperwork to be classed as some other type of freelance business like an LLC or corporation.Sole proprietors typically only need to file a Form 1040 and schedules with the IRS and an equivalent form with their state's Department of Revenue.This freelance tax guide does cover sole proprietors.A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a type of business structure that you create by filing certain paperwork (Articles of Organization) with your state. An LLC is considered ""legally separate"" from you for the purposes of separating and protecting your personal assets from your business ones. It's quick and easy to create an LLC.If you're the only person that ""owns"" the LLC, it is considered a single-member LLC.This freelance tax guide does cover single-member LLCs.If more than one person owns the LLC, it is considered a multi-member LLC and is treated similarly to a partnership (see below). It must file a Form 1065 in addition to other tax forms. Speak to your accountant about this.This freelance tax guide does not cover multi-member LLCs.LLCs can choose to be taxed as S Corporations. It must file a Form 1120S in addition to other tax forms. Speak to your accountant about this. For more information on LLCs taxed as S Corporations, please see S Corporations below.This freelance tax guide does not cover LLCs that choose to be taxed as an S Corporation.A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a ""separate business entity"" that you create by filing specific Articles of Organization with your Secretary of State. The main benefit provided by a Freelance LLC business is ""liability protection"" which separates your business assets from your personal assets. It's also possible that being an LLC can boost your reputation, and make it easier to get a business bank account.Single-member LLCs (where you are the only owner or member) are treated similarly to sole proprietors for tax purposes.An LLC can also be formed in partnership with other owners. This is known as a multi-member LLC and is formed with the Secretary of State by filing Articles of Organization.Multi-member LLCs are treated similarly to single-member LLCs for tax purposes, although they must also file a 1065 Partnership tax return in addition to other tax returns. Rules for a multi-member LLC are similar to those for a partnership (see below). Speak to your accountant about multi-member LLCs and taxes.For more information on forming an LLC that's taxed as an S Corproation, please see the section on S Corporations below.A partnership is a type of business structure where two or more people share in the ownership of a business. Partnerships require additional tax forms (Form 1065) and administration above what is normally required for sole-proprietors or single-member LLCs.Partnerships are out of scope for this series of guides, as they require extra tax filing forms and different accounting.An S Corporation is a type of business structure that can be formed with your state. S Corporations do potentially have some tax advantages over other types of business structure, and can be a good alternative choice for freelancers. It's often easier to form an LLC, then choose to be taxed as an S Corporation, rather than forming an S Corporation directly.You can become an S Corporation by forming as one with your state, or by forming an LLC with your state and then filing a Form 2553 with the IRS. For many freelancers, the LLC taxed as an S Corp is an easier option, as it removes many of the burdens associated with running a traditional S Corporation.An S Corporation is often suggested as a way for freelancers to save money on their self-employment taxes, but it's not that straightforward. There are certain costs associated with running an S Corporation that can significantly reduce the benefits of the tax savings. These costs include paying for payroll software, losing out on claiming some of your earnings as Qualified Business Income, extra unemployment taxes, and extra accounting costs for filing 1120S returns.There's also more of an administrative overhead for running an S Corporation. Typically, if you earn under around $60,000 a year as a freelancer, it's unlikely that an S Corporation will save you much money and may even cost you more than you save.You can always start a standard LLC and run that until it makes sense to file Form 2553 to convert to an S Corp.S Corporations are not covered by this freelance tax guide as they require additional forms (Form 1120S), filings, and paperwork.A C Corporation is a type of business structure that can be formed with your state. C Corporations are mainly intended for bigger businesses that intend to trade shares on the stock market, and are way more than freelances would typically need.C Corporations are not covered by this freelance tax guide as they require additional forms, filings, and paperwork.Here are a few rule-of-thumb guides that can help you decide on the best structure for your freelance business.If you're a solo freelancer working by yourself, then your easiest option is to file taxes as a sole proprietor. You don't need to file any special paperwork with your state to be treated as a sole proprietor. You'll file a 1040 with Schedule C and Schedule SE at tax time.If you're a solo freelancer who wants ""liability protection"" and a slight reputation boost for running an ""official"" business, you can choose to form a single-member LLC by filing the relevant paperwork with your state. You'll file a 1040 with Schedule C and Schedule SE at tax time.If you're in business with another freelancer, then you'll file taxes as a partnership. You don't need to file any special paperwork with your state to be treated as a partnership. You'll file a 1040 with Schedule SE and Schedule K, and a 1065 Partnership return at tax time.If you're in business with another freelancer and you want liability protection and a slight reputation boost, you can choose to form a multi-member LLC by filing the relevant paperwork with your state. You don't need to file any special paperwork with your state to be treated as a partnership. You'll file a 1040 with Schedule SE and Schedule K, and a 1065 Partnership return at tax time.Whether you're a solo freelancer or you're in business with someone else, you can choose to be an LLC taxed as an S Corporation. To do this, you would create an LLC, then file Form 2553 with the IRS. S Corporation taxation can save you money on your self-employment tax, but is typically only worthwhile if you earn more than around $60,000 a year. You'll file a 1040 with appropriate Schedules, and an 1120S S Corporation return at tax time.You can also choose to form an S Corporation directly, although there are significant administrative overheads. You'll file a 1040 with appropriate Schedules, and an 1120S S Corporation return at tax time.Unless you're planning world domination as a freelancer, you're never likely to create a C Corporation.Alright, I think that's it for this part of the guide.

Forgiving a Robot,"Imagine, God forbid, that a driver makes a horrible mistake and kills someone you love. The driver would be arrested. There would be a trial. There would be punishment. At some point, you will face a hard question, do you forgive the driver and try to move on?Now think of the same scenario only instead of a human driver, there's a self-driving car. Should it be punished? Would you forgive it? Is punishment or forgiveness even possible or necessary when it comes to automated machines?Instinctively you might say no, and although a killer self-driving car is an extreme example, these questions are more relevant than ever as service-giving robots become a bigger part of our lives. Figures show that the service robotics global market, for example, was valued at $11 billion in 2018, and by 2024 is expected to reach $50 billion.It's a conversation that humans need to have.Is a robot that commits a felony a criminal or a defective machine? To answer this question we first need to ask ourselves whether a robot could even be held responsible for its actions.It's not uncommon to lay responsibility on entities that are not human. We have corporate law, we can sue companies, we can punish them. And so, the question of legally turning a robot into a criminal might actually depend on the robot.In 2017, the European Commission of Legal Affairs compiled a thorough report about robots and specifically about the question of liability. The commission concluded that when a robot is autonomous beyond a certain level then it should be held accountable for its actions. The Commission distinguishes between 'a tool', meaning a robot that performs action programmed by another, and an autonomous being, meaning a robot that can use machine learning and AI to make decisions and implement them.In the case of the latter, the commission concludes, the robot is more responsible for its actions than its creator, and thus could be liable for harming people or property.It's challenging to think of a liable robot because we usually point the blame to one of two sources: The manufacture or the user. But as robots become more sophisticated and intelligent, this doesn't longer have to be the case.The study 'Robot Criminals' published in The University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform in 2019 tackled this issue. It concluded that there is a possibility for ""no human to be sufficiently at fault in causing a robot to commit a particular morally wrongful action"".The author made the distinction between a robot and a 'smart robot'; Those are some current but mainly future machines that uphold 3 conditions:In other words, 'smart robots' are capable of making a decision, acting on it, and explaining it after the fact.This might sound too 'Sci-Fi' at the moment but with the progress of AI and machine learning, a machine having to make what us human call 'moral choices' is definitely imaginable.In the case of 'smart robots,' the study claims, the liability lays with the robot and it is the one to pay the price.Why should we even punish a robot? In humans the benefits are clear. Punishment is not only a tool to distance a criminal from the community but also aims to rehabilitate those who broke the rules.The rationale for punishing robots could be different, the author of 'Robot Criminals' offers 3 reasons to do so:How do we punish a robot? There is an obvious choice, shutting it down. That wouldn't be enough. What happens if a 'smart robot' damages someone's property? Will shutting down the robot take care of the damage?The European Commission of Legal Affairs suggested a couple of interesting ideas:I first encountered the question of forgiving a robot in a paper by Dr. Michael Nagenborg, a researcher at the University of Twente in the Netherlands.Dr. Nagenborg focuses on the philosophical aspects of forgiving a machine. As forgiveness is a crucial part of human-human relationships, he claims this would also be a major part of human-robot interactions.It does make sense. Robots are a big part of our lives and keep getting bigger and more important. We have already discussed the fact that a robot could not only make a mistake but also be liable for it. Alongside punishment, forgiveness is humankind's way to move forward.When are we more likely to forgive a robot? In a recent study called 'Robots at Work', researchers from the National University of Singapore, Yale University, and Texas A&M University conducted two experiments to find the answer.The first experiment was done in the 'Henn-na Hotel' in Japan, the world's first robot-staffed hotel. 194 hotel guests participated and were divided into two groups. Both groups were asked to check-in and check-out using the service robots at the front desk.One group was told to ""think of the robots as if they were humans"", the second group was not.The study showed that when guests thought of the robot as more human-like, they tended to perceive them as sharing human attributes. These guests felt that ""robots can think"", ""robots can remember things"", and that ""robots can feel pain"".The more a guest perceived a robot as being human-like, the more satisfied the guest was by the service, and the less unsatisfied he/she was in the case of an error made by the robot.The second experiment was done in a lab. This time, the researchers used a robotic arm with a screen.Participants sat down in front of the robot with two different snacks placed in front of them. The participant chose a snack and the robot, which the participant thought was about to serve the chosen treat, was programmed to get it wrong.The participants were divided into two groups, each was facing a slightly different robot arm:Same as with the first experiment, the participants who were facing 'Alison' had a significantly higher rate of satisfaction from the service, and were less unsatisfied when received the wrong snack.These findings correspond with a different study, that showed that people feel more at ease interacting with robots with screens displaying human faces. Robots speaking in a female voice, with a female name, is the easiest to relate to - in case you were wondering why Alexa and Siri are both women.The questions of robots' liability, punishment, and forgiveness are challenging but the debate is relevant and important. As machines are getting smarter, humans would have to think about all consequences of the co-life we will share.Robots help clean our homes, they remind us to take the pie out of the oven, they drive us and help us with those nasty parallel parking spots. But robots make mistakes.In 2019, the Henn-Na hotel actually 'laid off' half of its robot staff for causing too much trouble. The robot at the check-in desk couldn't photocopy documents, the robot luggage carriers kept getting stuck, and the robot concierge couldn't answer simple questions.But someday, and this day is probably sooner than later, robots mistakes could be much graver than delivering a suitcase to the wrong room. Robots can, and would, be able to cause us real harm. Someone would have to pay the price. We will have to choose whether to punish, and whether to forgive.",https://miro.medium.com/max/13294/0*GafF17G0vOP6PvJw,https://eladsi.medium.com/forgiving-a-robot-4bad9bb00759,artificial-intelligence,6f72b1ebaca365982212cf99282f57d5f1a67fac694ade625692df68
A progressive parent's rant about the politics surrounding school reopening,"I think we're at a crucial point in this debate on school reopening right now. Case rates are dropping quickly, the surge is over, and people are starting to get vaccinated - though way too slowly of course. The public health community, including the CDC, have reached consensus that reopening schools is an urgent priority (instead of citing all my sources, I'm going to do more of a free-write here, so feel free to reach out if you want me to cite a source for anything I write here).This is because the harms of prolonged school closure vastly outnumber the risk of COVID. It's not only learning loss among public school kids (mostly in urban areas), though that will of course have long-term implications, especially for teenagers who really need to get decent grades to be able to get into college but who are flunking classes at astronomical rates. Remember also that they'll have to compete against private school kids, who are having a much more normal school year.More importantly, it's our our kids' mental health that's the real emergency. A few weeks ago the New York Times published a devastating piece about the rise in student suicides in Las Vegas and how that got the superintendent to open schools. All over the country, mental health emergencies and hospital visits by kids are skyrocketing. The prolonged isolation, depression and anxiety that stem from learning by yourself on a computer all day are taking a massive toll on kids who haven't seen the inside of a school for almost a year!I just don't know how anyone can sit by and think this is an acceptable state of affairs for a developed country - it just makes my blood boil to see how little this country cares about kids. All of Europe has done the right thing - schools are last to close, first to open. It's simply not a political stance in Europe (as it is here) to say we need to reopen schools for the sake of kids wellbeing and emotional and academic development.The politicization of this issue is what's really fucked up. Schools are largely open in red states and closed in blue ones (see below for a devastating graphic). It's very difficult for me to understand the simplistic thinking that says: Trump said open schools, so we must keep them closed at all costs. I have never felt so alienated from the people I usually align myself with politically. I will never understand how the left in this country has decided that advocating for putting kids first is somehow right-wing. I'm hearing from progressive parents all the time who are so infuriated about the Democratic apathy around school reopening - from politicians like Gavin Newsom, who are willing to allow their stances to be dictated by teachers' unions - that they're considering supporting the recall effort, maybe even switching parties.Because here's the thing: parents are not willing to sacrifice their kids' wellbeing for the sake of ideology or being a good leftist. And they shouldn't. It's our most important job to do what's best for our kids. And if that means calling out teachers' unions, so be it. I won't stay silent while unions ignore the science and the entire public health community, and all the research telling us schools aren't drivers of transmission, that spread is much lower in schools than in the surrounding community. Last March we didn't know any better. But now we know - and we've known for months. Europe opened up in the fall. Florida, Texas, all the red states opened up. Rhode Island was one of the few blue states that was committed to putting kids first. Can you remember even one major outbreak that was tied to school transmission (not a handful of cases, but an outbreak)? I can't. And teachers aren't at greater risk either.Many of the parents I'm working with on this issue see themselves as progressive and have until now supported organized labor and unions (I myself went to the picket line for Oakland teachers 2 years ago), but it's so clear to us that teachers' unions are dead wrong on this issue and that their interests are diametrically opposed to what's best for our kids. Your own kid might be doing ok in remote learning, but by and large, kids aren't doing well. Mine sure isn't. Just remember: the principles of child development haven't just vanished because we're in a pandemic. It's still not good to have our kids in front of the screen for hours upon hours every day. Kids still need to learn alongside other kids and still need to play with other kids. What I'm saying is, there's no amount of improvement of distance learning you can do that will make it be a good platform for learning.Now, here's where I'm gonna go in hard on the unions. NOT the teachers, but the unions. I know there are many teachers who don't feel the union represents them on this. And to that point, here are some amazing examples of brave teachers who have spoken out to say that blocking reopening is morally wrong.Fantastic op-ed by NYC teacherThis YouTube video of a CA teacher calling out her union at a school board meeting is a must-watchAnother op-ed by Baltimore teacherGreat recent piece in SF Chronicle about SF teachers who have been afraid to speak up until nowI've seen a culture of shaming here in Oakland that surrounds any critique of the union, so it's very hard for teachers to take this public stance and say the union is wrong, but more and more simply can't in good conscience pretend this isn't harming kids. I know distance learning is very hard on teachers as well as kids, which is why I can't understand why so many are allowing their unfounded fear to blind them to the data and research that says schools can reopen safely.I've seen the most absurd justifications from unions and their allies for why we shouldn't reopen schools, like denying there's any learning loss associated with distance learning or suggesting parents can be adequate substitutes for teachers (SF school board president Gabriela Lopez). I mean, it's so incredibly tone-deaf and ridiculous: they are devaluing their own profession just so as not to go back to the classroom! If parents or anyone else could fill in so easily, why should we pay teachers more? Why should we value them as professionals? Real valuing of your profession means admitting remote learning is a poor substitute for face-to-face, interpersonal contact and that parents can't do teachers' jobs, and trying to get back to that as soon as possible.Oh, and don't get me started on the SF school board and the way they just pushed through renaming of 44 schools (which will cost a ton of money) and (just last night) made a rash, unpopular decision to change Lowell's admission process, all while even the youngest kids haven't gone back to the classroom! They're so incredibly out of touch with the reality of public school families right now that it took a lawsuit to light a fire under their asses! And no, the agreed upon deal with SF teacher's union isn't good enough because there's no reopening date.California says schools can reopen once cases are less than 25 per 100K people (ie, in the purple tier), but the deal says either SF has to be in red tier with all school staff vaccinated or in the orange tier (unlikely for this school year, which is exactly what unions want). And if you think fall 2021 is safe for full reopening, think again. They will likely argue for hybrid/2 days a week even when all adults are vaccinated. These demands, which SFUSD should never have agreed to, are completely out of touch with the state and county public health guidelines - that we can open K-6th grade in places like SF right now (SF is currently at about 11.5 cases per 100K). As for older kids, we have no idea if teachers will even agree to go back to middle/high school in the fall at all.I just want you all to understand that reaching a deal doesn't mean reopening will be happening soon. In contrast, NYC elementary schools have been open since November and they're now planning for reopening middle schools, Chicago's union (which had an incredibly bitter fight with the district) just reached a deal to go back later this month, Miami has been open this whole damn time! The Bay Area/California isn't special - the only difference is that our unions are incredibly powerful and have been able to hold our kids' education hostage.Don't believe me? Take a look at this graphic that someone shared on Twitter a few days ago. I can't explain how depressed and enraged it made me feel to see in these stark visual terms how my home state (and the entire west coast) is failing its kids so miserably. I've never felt ashamed of California until now, that its leaders care more about appeasing unions (one of the most powerful lobbies in the state) than about the wellbeing of kids.Other things that have made me flip my lid about this situation: teachers unions are demanding vaccinations before going back to school - last month, some here in SF and Oakland were even saying vaccinations wouldn't be enough to get them back to the classroom! No other essential worker has had the privilege to demand this - and this has been a real slap in the face to all the essential workers (like my spouse) who have been going to their workplace for 11 months with no vaccine and who aren't being prioritized like teachers are.It is this particular stance that has really alienated many other essential workers, particularly those who work on the front lines - the fact that teachers in blue states have been so incredibly protected during this pandemic, while all others have not had the privilege to demand this. So I don't ever wanna hear again about teachers being ""underdogs"" or having no power - unions contribute millions to Dem politicians and that's why people like Newsom and Biden have been so damn weak on this issue and put kids last (all while Newsom's own kids attend private school in-person). Unions are a behemoth in California and parents are the only group of people advocating for our kids needs. No one else is gonna do it.I also want to bring up an ugly aspect of this whole debate: the ways unions have played the race card and presumed to speak for Black and Brown families. As an advocate for reopening schools I can't tell you how many times I've seen union reps and supporters say it's only white, wealthy parents who want to reopen and that we are racist to want this. First, it is false that only white parents want to reopen. White parents do tend to trust the school districts more than Black and Latino families do, with good reason - white kids get treated better and go to better funded schools. So naturally, we tend to favor reopening, as we trust it can be done safely.However, we can't just ignore the role of white teachers in this dynamic. In this country, teachers are around 80% white - something people don't talk about. So why is it that when white parents support reopening it's racist and we don't care about Black and Brown kids (which, PS, my own kid isn't white!), but when mostly white teachers unions advocate for their interests, they're representing what Black and brown families want? The reality is, neither white parents nor white teachers can speak for Black and Latino families, many of whom have their own reasons for not wanting to send their kids back (like having experienced COVID close-up or not trusting school system to put into place adequate safety measures). And yet, they're not a monolith either - many want and need their kids back in school. Our family survey here in Oakland indicated that Black and Latino families were evenly split between three choices: 1/3 wanted to send kids back, 1/3 didn't, and 1/3 wasn't sure. The unions interpret this as ""a majority of Black and Latino families don't want to go back,"" but as should be clear, that's a distortion. Their voices are drowned out by unions insisting they speak for marginalized families.But don't take it from me. Watch this incredible statement by a Chicago-based Latina sociologist and mom about the ways unions have cynically played the race card:https://twitter.com/karenvaites/status/1355947764027420680?s=20Lastly, I just want to say: many parents feel absolutely betrayed by teachers unions. I think they're making a massive miscalculation with these rigid, stances not backed up by any data and demands that go way beyond what their public health officials are suggesting. What they're doing right now is incredibly myopic. They are handing thousands and thousands of parents over to private/parochial schools or charter schools, and are paving the way for a major decimation of public education. Parents will never choose ideological loyalty over their kids and the more unions dig in their heels, the angrier parents get. Many have already fled public ed. Some who could never have fathomed sending their kids to private school are considering it now. Families with means (and even those who don't but will take out loans) will leave in droves. I don't understand how unions don't see this - the only explanation I can find is that they're so ensconced in their ideological bubble that they're blind to the reality of what's going on.Friends, I've never spent so much unpaid labor and time advocating for an issue and I've never been so convinced that I was doing the right thing - not just for my own kid, but for all kids. Nothing has made me want to leave this country more than this issue, especially as I've seen all of Europe put kids first. How can we possibly accept that most kids in private schools are back in their classrooms while public school kids suffer from depression and fall behind? How can we think it's ok for urban districts with majority Brown and Black kids to abandon their duty to these kids for going on a year and possibly much longer, all because teachers unions refuse to do what all other essential workers have done for 11 months? There is no such thing as zero risk (what they're demanding), and a harm reduction approach means we must do what's best for the most people, which is to open schools.Lastly, for those of you parents who don't want to send your kids back yet for whatever reason: we have no desire to force you to go back. We honestly don't care if you decide to stay remote - that's your decision. But to side with the unions and advocate for keeping schools closed until the teachers ""feel"" it's safe (which is a constantly moving goal post), and NOT when public health officials decide it's safe (as they already have) is actively harmful to kids, and frankly selfish. You will continue to have a choice - so give us the choice as well to send our kids back to school.If you found any of this informative, please do pass it along to your various networks.Here are a few links related to the advocacy I've been doing:Oakland parents group (of which I'm a part):www.ousdparents.comCalifornia coalition of 80+ local groups (this is an all volunteer, parent-led, grassroots effort):http://www.openschoolsca.comPetition to Gavin Newsom - please sign and share:https://www.change.org/p/gavin-newsom-gov-newsom-put-kids-first-get-them-back-into-the-classroom?recruiter=8017878&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_message&utm_term=petition_dashboard&recruited_by_id=20fb6620-4894-0130-1199-3c764e044346&share_bandit_exp=message-27099973-en-USFollow us on social media:Twitter: https://twitter.com/OpenSchoolsCAFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OpenSchoolsCAOakland parents group twitter account: https://twitter.com/OUSD_Parents",https://miro.medium.com/max/2176/0*QomftDpKKYEaIIsx.png,https://rmbodenheimer.medium.com/a-progressive-parents-rant-about-the-politics-surrounding-school-reopening-a816cae963fd,education,6faeafc87d8592b7f3eeaa482e874a180cf38fef3da8aaafc3bdab39
Mixed methods is the most important research skillset of the 2020s,"87% of companies say that the market today is more crowded than ever. With lower barriers to entry and more access to consumers online, the importance of delivering an incredible user experience has gone through the roof. This increased competition is what is driving the incredible growth of User Experience (UX) professionals.This isn't new news. UX has been on the rise for years. But there's another change coming towards us that is going to move UX to centre stage as one of the most important parts of your company strategy in coming years. That change is called Product-Led Growth.Product-Led Growth (PLG) is a strategy that uses your product as the main way to grow your company. Unlike sales- or marketing-led organisations where deals are done over dinner and 18 holes of gold, product-led companies recognise that the end user is the new buyer. That end user's primary decision making criteria is not ""how will this product help the company's bottom line?"", it's ""how will this product help me in my day-to-day?"".While these strategic choices may seem far removed from UX, they completely reframe the job of research. User research is no longer just about creating a smooth experience or quantifying the cost savings a product creates. Instead, user researchers have a central role in crafting company strategy by answering the question 'What are our users' biggest unmet needs, pains and motivations?'. As the need for user research is increasingly becoming tied to strategy, the demand for researchers has skyrocketed. Searches for 'UX Researcher"" are up nearly 500% in the last 5 years and ""there is more demand for customer insights today than there are UX researchers to uncover them.""This surging adoption of user research in tech companies has resulted in an emerging trend; mixed methods is the most important research specialism of the next decade.Quantitative data is the internal currency of tech companies. The credo of these tech companies is W. Edward Demings' famous quote, ""In God we trust, all others must bring data."" And make no mistake, product teams don't think that an interview quote passes for ""data"".The collision of these two worlds - the quantitative technologist and the qualitative researcher - is the driving force behind today's mixed methods resurgence. Rather than prioritising one over the other, tech companies recognise the need for both. Without qualitative research, understanding why people behave the way the do or uncovering new unknown insights are often beyond reach. Without quantitative research, it's impossible to know the scale and impact of our qualitative findings or prioritise our next steps.What is new about this relationship is the importance of their interaction working smoothly. Before recently, these two disciplines generally met under ad-hoc circumstances. With qual's new seat at the decision-making table, it's now increasingly important that both specialisms can collaborate effectively. Simply put, one has to learn the other's language. It is increasingly clear that this burden is falling to researchers.We're seeing the impact of this new role across multiple aspects of the researcher's job. Research is becoming a proactive, continuous function that isn't confined to pre-determined project timelines. Identifying the core pains driving user behaviour must be proactive instead of a reactive response to the output of big data. As the team that interacts with the end user most, product and UX leads are responsible for understanding user's motivation to purchase. Most importantly, user researchers are becoming multilingual influencers capable of wielding any type of data in order to convert internal skeptics to the perspective of the end user. As companies become more integrated cross-functionally, this need for researchers to become multilingual internal networkers only grows. They become the go-to resource for everyone, from the marketing and sales teams to the product and design functions - each of which speak a different language and value different types of data for decision-making.Leading technology companies like Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter are ALL hiring mixed methods researchers right now. Let's jump into some examples to explain the three types of mixed methods research.Exploratory Mixed Methods (Qual → Quant)If you're working on a project with a lot of unknowns, exploratory mixed methods is a great way to form a hypothesis. It usually starts with open-ended qual like a user interview or free-text survey before moving into a quant survey to measure the significance and validity of the insights gathered. Check out this example of UX Researcher Alison who used exploratory mixed methods to prioritise what features to build based on what would impact the most number of users.Explanatory Mixed Methods (Quant → Qual)Explanatory research is perfect for research projects where you're trying to interpret quantitative findings. By analysing user or market behaviour using big data, researchers can identify a measurable insight and bring into forward into a qualitative deep dive to learn more about the context behind the numbers. Clement Kao, PM at Blend, describes his experience using explanatory mixed methods to dig into user churn and diagnose the factors impacting their highest value cohort of users.Dynamic Mixed Methods (Qual + Quant)As the name suggests, dynamic mixed methods collects qual and quant data at the same time within the one research method (unlike exploratory and explanatory which need multiple methods/steps). Dynamic research projects give more control over to users so that multiple data types can be collected, making them a great fit for discovery-focused research and product-led companies looking to understand user perspective.Dynamic mixed methods is a new type of research that has been unlocked by advancements in technology. You've possibly heard of them being called ""qual at scale"". The most common type is unmoderated usability testing at scale, however new platforms have emerged in recent years that reimagine existing research methods like focus groups (Remesh) and surveys (OpinionX) for the digital age. These tools have the added benefit of taking away some of the most time-consuming manual tasks associated with mixed methods such as thematic coding and qualitative analysis. Dig deeper into dynamic research with this great case study about nonprofit Feed the Heroes using dynamic surveys to understand donor motivations.Mixed methods research used to be an academic affair that was convoluted and inaccessible. That is no longer the case. As the leaders of the Product-Led Growth movement attest; we are now in the era of the end user - and Mixed Methods Research is your toolkit to understand those users.About the author:Daniel Kyne is the co-founder and CEO of OpinionX, a social survey tool for discovering the biggest unmet needs, pains and motivations of any group of people in just one click.

2 Key Mindset Shifts to Help You Build and Stick to a Morning Routine,"I was never much of a believer in morning routines.All my life, I've moved from home to hostel, city to city, never once settling in one place for more than a year. It was always a bit of this city, a taste of that town, a new hostel, a new roommate, and I was too overwhelmed to even claim a few minutes of the day just for myself.This changed when I started living alone. Even now, my job required me to travel every two weeks, but I managed to build a simple three-step morning routine. Even though I find myself on a flight more days than I can count, I have managed to stick to this religiously for the past two years.This article is about the two fundamental mindset shifts that helped me stick to my morning routine despite all the uncertainty in my life. Before we dive in, here's why morning routines are important according to science:After I started setting up a morning routine, I realized that this was a great way to feel in control. As is, my life is full of uncertainty, but knowing there are a few minutes each morning that will pass the same way, no matter what happens, is a calming feeling.But when every day pans out differently, it's hard to have a few minutes each morning where you'll do the same thing. Also, some days might be more packed than the rest, making it impossible to complete a full-fledged morning routine. That's when I decided no matter how long and detailed a morning routine I have; it's important to have a few non-negotiables.For me, they were:Breaking down my non-negotiables into micro-habits helped me stick to my morning routine, no matter what. The moment you think of it as not eligible for debate, you start taking your morning routine seriously, irrespective of how packed your day is.Once I started working out in mid-July, I've been pretty consistent at it every morning. However, in December, I found myself relapsing. The main reason was that it was too cold where I live. I had zero motivation to change into workout clothes, pull out my Yoga mat, and start working out. Maybe if I went to the gym, it might have been more comfortable as going out of the house was motivation enough. But at-home workouts were too hard to continue in the December chill.This went on for far longer than I'd like to admit, and the changes I saw in my life were apparent too. I felt lethargic all day long, and the guilt that I wasn't doing what I was supposed to was eating me up on the inside. Things got so bad that one day, I decided it was enough.So what if I wasn't going to the gym? I could go to the terrace and workout there. This gave me a reason to change, put on some music, and carry my Yoga mat upstairs.Once I started doing this, I felt like a queen. Not kidding, but it legit felt like if I can push myself to work out, I can do just about anything. On lazy days, I even stayed on the terrace for more extended periods of time, practicing affirmations and telling myself that my body is like water. It can flow in whatever direction it wishes to.Watch the story you're telling yourself. Are you filling your brain with excuses rather than telling it that you can do anything you set your mind to?Research suggests people with positive self-talk may have mental skills that allow them to solve problems, think differently, and be more efficient at coping with hardships or challenges. This can reduce the harmful effects of stress and anxiety.And if it can help you stick to your morning routine as well, isn't it a win-win situation?I used to think sticking to a morning routine was hard, but these two mindset shifts helped me crush my goals and make a habit out of them. They apply not just to morning routines but also to any act of self-care.People often complain that self-care is hard and they never have enough time. But if you consider what your non-negotiables are and break them down into the most basic habit you can perform with ease, you'll find things become more manageable.The same is true for the kind of self-talk you're practicing. If you fill your vocabulary with excuses and your head with reasons why you can't do it, the universe will come up with ways to prove you right. However, if you change the story you're telling yourself and consider why you should, you'll find many different options open up.In this fast-paced world of today, self-care should be a priority, not an option. Having a morning routine that keeps you grounded throughout the day is a great way to take things in control and prove to yourself that you'll always put yourself first no matter what happens.I create content in many different forms related to self-improvement, body-positivity, and feminism on several other platforms.

F. Scott Fitzgerald vs. S.S. Van Dine: A Vocabulary Bakeoff,"Just as I began learning basic techniques for natural language processing (sometimes called ""computational linguistics"") in the Python programming language, I read that F. Scott Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby had been released into the public domain. As an English major (B.A., M.A.) who had pivoted into a career in IT, this attracted me like a folksinger to a new acoustic guitar. I knew I had to try out my new licks on Gatsby, so I downloaded the plain text version of the novel from Project Gutenberg.As is the case with most lit majors, I'm a word addict, so I thought I'd pull out some of Fitzgerald's vocabulary to see if it was in any way exceptional - meaning the words he used, not the deft way he put them together in his classic American novel. This was not intended as a form of literary criticism. It's more of a word-watcher's curiosity about how a gifted writer used his word hoard.By extracting all the individual words from the plain text form of the novel, then putting it through a stop list of words like a, an, and, or, but, the, etc., I had a working list of relevant words. Using the resources of the excellent NLTK (natural language toolkit) module (NLTK Book), I was able to prepare a frequency distribution list that could be used to highlight the most frequently used words as well as those used only once or a few times.It turned out that words Fitzgerald used most were not particularly interesting or enlightening. Examining the words used 50 or more times one sees common words like I, she, he, said, Gatsby, Tom, Daisy, you, house, car, get, and something. Nothing particularly inspiring.It then occurred to me that it might be much more interesting to look at Fitzgerald's least used words, hoping to find some fancier words he used only occasionally. In addition to its .FreqDist() method, NLTK also has a method called .hapaxes(). This derives from the Greek expression Hapax legomenon meaning, literally, ""something said only once."" The method, appropriately, flags all words used only once in the novel.This immediately produced more interesting results, as varied as adventitious, amorphous, aquaplanes, vestibules, and wall-scaling, along with common words used only once. By experimenting with selecting various degrees of frequency, I found that the most interesting all-around list was obtained by including all words used three times or fewer.Although this was interesting, it seemed to me that it would be doubly interesting to a word hound to compare The Great Gatsby with another novel of the same period. I thought of Hemingway, since Fitzgerald and Hemingway were friends, but Hemingway's use of simple vocabulary makes him less interesting in terms of the actual words he employed.Gatsby was published in 1925. By coincidence I had just finished reading a 1926 murder mystery novel called The Benson Murder Case, by S.S. Van Dine, the pseudonym for American art critic and writer Willard Huntington Wright, an erudite writer whose detective, Philo Vance, was at one time highly popular with readers and who was featured in several Hollywood films. Amateur detective Vance, a kind of American version of the British sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey, was played in films by actors William Powell (before his Nick Charles period), Basil Rathbone, and Edmund Lowe (Wikipedia, ""S.S. Van Dine""). Nick Caraway rubbed shoulders with the rich. Vance was a member of rich NewYork society, and an art collector, and, as such, had a remarkably sophisticated, at times foppish, vocabulary. The novel sent me to the dictionary several times to look up new words.I purchased an Epub edition of S.S. VAN DINE Premier Collection: Thriller Classics, Murder Mysteries, Detective Tales & More and extracted the text of The Benson Murder Case and put it through the same lexical procedures as Gatsby, likewise limiting the word list to words used three times or fewer. I then converted all the words to lower case, alphabetized both lists, and filtered the two lists together using a Unix/Linux word utility called comm. What it did was put the results in three columns. Words used only by Fitzgerald, words used only by Van Dine, and words used by both. The full list is here.I then imported the list into Google Docs and exported it as an Epub file that I loaded into Apple Books on my iPad. This allowed me to do a leisurely read through the list and highlight words from each author that struck me as being ""interesting"" and at least slightly out of the ordinary. When I had finished scanning, I manually copied the results for each author into the listings below:Great Gatsby (1925)abortive, adventitious, aluminium, amorphous, aquaplanes, araby, asunder, beluga, cahoots, caravansary, caterwauling, chartreuse, coney, convivial, crêpe-de-chine, debauchee, demoniac, dilatory, distraught, divot, dog-days, duckweed, echolalia, ectoplasm, euphemisms, expostulation, fishguards, flounced, foxtrot, fractiousness, grail, harlequin, holocaust, hornbeams, hors-d'oeuvre, humidor, inconsequence, inessential, jonquils, juxtaposition, knickerbockers, lustreless, meretricious, nonolfactory, obstetrical, pasquinade, petrol-pumps, plagiaristic, platonic, pneumatic, portentous, postern, prig, probity, rot-gut, rotogravure, sea-change, sheik, somnambulatory, staid, substantiality, subterfuges, teutonic, vestibule, wall-scaling, whitebaitBenson Murder Case (1926)a-flutter, a-kimbo, acerbities, adipose, amasis, animadversions, approbation, aquiline, argot, arrentine, astigmatic, badinage, ballyrag, bezique, bisonic, brachycephalic, bunjinga, burglarious, casuistic, champêtre, chef-d'œuvre, cinquecento, cloisonné, confab, contretemps, craniological, darwinian, davenport, deltoids, derring-do, déshabillé, diatonic, discommode, disharmonious, dissolution, dolichocephalic, dulcet, dyspnœa, ebullition, embayed, emulsification, endocrines, factitious, factotum, flâneur, flummery, forensic, garrulous, gewgaws, halcyon, hauteur, hedonist, helixometer, hirsute, mpecunious, imputation, inamorato, infinitesimal, ingress, inspissated, joss-sticks, juxtaposition, lambrequin, leptorhine, lèse-majesté, lineaments, loquacious, lugubriously, mandragora, mêlée, mellifluously, mock-turtle, modish, moue, myrmidons, obduracy, orthognathous, oubliettes, palaver, peccadilloes, perfeccionados, perspicacious, phrenologist, platitudinarian, plebeian, polychrome, popinjay, prognathous, protasis, puerility, quavering, quixotic, rapprochement, ratiocination, redolent, remonstrances, repine, reproche, rubicund, sabreur, sardonic, sententiously, sequester, smouldering, sobriquet, soirée, somnolently, soupçon, stertorous, suave, sybarite, sycophant, syllogism, tenter-hooks, tête-à-tête, teutonic, tonneau, totemistic, triptych, truculent, tutelary, twitted, ventral, vestibule, viscid, vitiated, vituperation, vortices, what-for, whirlin'-dervishThere are a couple of things one might conclude from comparing the lists. The first is that F. Scott Fitzgerald did not use an especially challenging vocabulary for The Great Gatsby. This makes the novel suitable for readers of younger ages, say high school or first-year university students. The second is that you don't need fancy words to create a masterpiece. Gatsby has stood the test of time.S.S. Van Dine, though once highly popular, has faded into relative obscurity. Part of that may be attributed to his more challenging vocabulary and part to the writing itself, which is slow-paced for a detective novel.Those of us who are addicted to detective fiction are used to authors with large vocabularies and, in fact, if a work of detective fiction doesn't offer some word challenges, it's disappointing to the reader.The bottom line: S.S. Van Dine walks away with the prize for most interesting vocabulary, while F. Scott Fitzgerald walks away with a literary masterpiece. A generous reader can enjoy both.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*XBNI7mdmJnViw7_y-HYfug.jpeg,https://genewilburn.medium.com/f-scott-fitzgerald-vs-s-s-van-dine-a-vocabulary-bakeoff-76496ad021a3,data-science,7d39c42ca0f05ca3dd163cb10bd5608e7061f18e3dba072b42d91f6f
Mindfulness Is Not Just Meditation,"The disastrous year of 2020 has led to an increase in downloads of meditation and mindfulness apps. Stressors from daily Covid-19 news, political news, juggling multiple lives, working from home, and long-drawn-out social distancing measures have turned many people to meditation apps to feel centred and calm.Scientists and politicians have mentioned that the coronavirus is here for the long haul as it continues to spread throughout the world. With many countries going into intermittent lockdowns, millions of people are still in quarantine/pandemic mode.However, mindfulness and happiness aren't just about meditation. Although meditation teaches you the skills and theories to cultivate mindfulness within 10-30 minutes a day, the 23.5 hours left in your day make for a mindful life.Like many, I turned to meditation when my life and mental health was in dire need of direction, grounding and improvement. Alongside, I took to Yoga to improve awareness and concentration outside of meditation. I'll keep the Yoga story for another time, but taking mindfulness off meditation and into a physical practice forced me to focus and quiet the mind chatters - teaching me to lead a more conscious and intentional life.Yoga and meditation are just a small part of your day. I am not a master in meditation, nor do I lead the most conscious life, but I'm writing this article because I've seen improvements when I consciously incorporate mindfulness in my day to day life. There are many layers to mindfulness and its an art to be cultivated - an art everyone can make.Don't panic. I know there is a lot of information out there and you don't know where to start. First of all, appreciate yourself for meditating consistently because that is not an easy task; or just have gratitude that you are reading this article, learning more about mindfulness. Keep up the excellent work.Informal mindfulness practice involves bringing mindfulness into daily routines and activities. Basically, what I have been talking about - mindfulness outside of meditation. Examples would be mindfully eating or mindfully interacting with people.If you want to have an in-depth read on incorporating informal mindfulness practice in your life, I recommend you read Mindfulness by Gill Hasson.It can be overwhelming - even in Gill Hasson's book, there are still so many activities that I have yet to incorporate into my daily life. Sometimes, reading and researching can just deter you from even starting.So here are four simple ways you can get started on being mindful outside of meditation.If you can only take one thing away from this article, make it this one here. Just by being aware of your thoughts, experiences, and emotions is the sole act of being mindful.Your mind is of its own but being aware of the mental fluctuations or mind chatters is the first step from breaking free.I always say that you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. Similarly, you can't change a situation that you aren't aware of.Approach this method with loving-kindness and compassion as there isn't a need to get rid or judge every mind trap that comes up.Be grateful for catching all of your negative thoughts and material - being aware of what comes up naturally is an achievement in it of itself.After being aware of your thoughts, there is no need to dismiss it immediately. Instead, acknowledge its presence. Acknowledge that these thoughts, emotions, experiences, feelings and events are happening right now. Acknowledge that your mind has wandered off to the past, the future or a hypothesis.We don't need to dismiss them because these thoughts are a part of you. They come up for a reason; dismissing it would be avoidance.If your situation allows you to, you can write it down in your journal or on your mobile. But it isn't necessary since you are trying to be present in the moment you are experiencing.Writing it down helps you to acknowledge the thought and put it aside so that you can live in this moment, and come back to it when you are ready to.To release yourself from mind traps, you need to meet these thoughts, emotions, and experiences with acceptance - accept them as they are, with no judgement.Accepting doesn't mean you need to like what is happening in this present moment - either in your head or in your experience.By accepting, you are letting these triggers exist and just be; without trying to change anything, judge it or get rid of it. You take a step back and view your emotions, thoughts or experiences from a distance, observing it as a separate object.By doing so, you understand your emotions' intentions, which can help you respond to the situation in a more mindful way. This particular action can take a little bit of time to learn but always remember to be kind to yourself when you are adjusting.Greet yourself with compassionate self-forgiveness. Absolve yourself from the obligations of your mind. Self-forgiveness allows you to process your material and release the anchors in your mind to start enforcing positive actions and intentions. Forgiving others means to let yourself be free - to remove the knot that binds two minds and their associated suffering.Letting go and forgiving doesn't mean giving in to your material or someone else's offence, but a way to free yourself from torment.This is also not an effortless thing to do, but forgiveness seems to follow when you learn to accept the way things are. So just be patient and keep working at your inner self.Those are the four ways that you can start incorporating informal mindfulness practices in your daily life.It doesn't matter if you just start with awareness, because that is what I did too. Mindfulness is a practice, and it isn't a one size fits all approach to life.Always be patient with yourself because ultimately, there isn't an end goal. It is the commitment and the promise to yourself to lead a more intentional and conscious life.Life doesn't begin when you reach a goal or a place; it is the present moment itself.",,https://medium.com/illumination/mindfulness-is-not-just-meditation-bc9672e52e25,mindfulness,7e0d7f4f4e915a3cef211b849a23087f43581e8014947838422f9da3
4 Signs of Busy but Unproductive People,"We live in a time where the number of hours you work in a week is worn as a badge of honor. The more hours worked the bigger the badge.But the harsh reality is, too many people work extreme hours, yet still don't get the results they want because busy doesn't always mean productive.Then there are those who work less then average but still get the results we want - if not more.Is it because they're better at what they do? Not always. Sometimes it's about how they approach their work that gets them the results that we have to work countless hours for.Here are 4 signs that you could be busy but unproductive, and what you can do to turn things around.People who aren't as productive have a large part of their brain just trying to keep track of all the things they need to do.There were many days where I felt stressed just thinking of all the things I had to do that day, that week, that month and etc... So much so that I barely got anything done.When too much of our brainpower is dedicated to remembering our growing to-do list, this can greatly distract from the important work that needs to get done.One of the best ways I significantly decreased these feelings of overwhelm was by externalizing my brain. I realized I didn't need the mental clutter of trying to remember everything all the time.Some people put all their to do's and goals in one notebook.In my experience what worked better wasn't keeping all these lists in one place. I found it calming having more than one 'external brain'.Today I keep a notebook for my daily to do's. I use Trello to organize my weekly goals. And I keep a big physical calendar as an overview for the month for important dates and etc...Not needing to remember so much all the time greatly increased my daily productivity because now I'm no longer worried about forgetting anything important.Give your brain a break by figuring out different ways to externalize it today. Your mental health will thank you when it no longer feels the 'weight of the world' daily.If someone asked you what your 'top 5 major moves' are to achieve your goal, could you name them right away?If not, then according to the leading high-performance coach Brendon Buchard, you're not optimizing your time. You could end up living a life full of distractions where you achieve goals in years versus others who achieve the same goals in months.People who are productive know the next 5 moves that have the biggest impact in getting them where they need to go.Those who are less productive give equal priority to everything.One example is if your goal is to create a large online following, one of your top 5 moves would be producing content consistently. People who are busy but not productive will spend weeks making sure they have the perfect set-up or refreshing their statistics daily versus actually getting content out.People who are productive are too busy moving forward to get caught up checking their progress every hour. Sometimes they don't even need to check, because their results are proof enough whether they're moving forward or not.Identify your 5 major moves and afterward be strict in spending most of your time dedicated to those specific tasks.I have been caught up in busywork in the past, but I've learned to be mindful of my activities. Now I pause in between tasks to ask myself if what I'm about to do will bring me closer to my goal or if it's just a distraction.If it's the latter, I out loud will say, ""doesn't matter"" before redirecting myself to what is worth doing.Fantasizing about our dreams is motivating. We should have an idea of who we want to be with steps to get there. But then we need to do the work.One way to determine if you're more a dream-er than a do-er is if you produce weekly outputs. When we look at the definition of productivity it is: being able to generate, produce or bring forth goods and services.If you aren't generating or producing something regularly, your dream or goal will likely only continue to exist in your head.Tim Ferris, the bestselling author of The 4 Hour Work Week, said that he only reads information that he is immediately going to put into use. Nothing more.Inspired from that idea, I've limited consuming to 'just enough'. Today I plan 'just enough' to give me a sense of direction. When I'm researching ways to improve, I consume 'just enough' to prepare for my next task.People who are more productive spend less time thinking and more time executing. They are open to figuring it out along the way.You may not know everything to succeed at your goal, but you likely know enough to at least move a step forward. You can read everything about swimming, but you'll only really learn how when you're in the water.People less productive often set generic yearly goals like ""have a successful side hustle"" or ""lose weight"", but then don't have concrete steps to get there.Their motto is: work hard and hope for the best.They have a lot of wants that they're working towards. But they don't break these down into short term goals to get there.People who are productive know exactly what they want and when they want it to happen. They don't leave their results to chance or luck.Busy and productive people move towards a destination. Busy but unproductive people are still moving, but they never arrive anywhere.Begin thinking of yourself as a company. Do successful companies decide on their goals at the start of their year and only check to see if they achieved them at the end of the year? No. They set quarterly goals that ultimately lead to the big picture.Break your big yearly goals into smaller goals throughout the year. An effective time frame is setting smaller goals every 3 months.Goals every 3 months gives you that needed sense of urgency to get things done. Ninety days is also enough time to gather data to see if what you're doing is working or not. If not, pivot and see if the next 3 months of action bring you closer to your yearly goals.When you're in the hurricane of 'hustle culture' it can be hard to tell the difference between busywork versus real productivity.If you're working an insane number of hours a week, yet aren't getting your desired results you may not be that productive.As a recap, the signs that you can check weekly to see if you're busy but not necessarily productive are:Results don't lie. No one wants to slave away countless hours only to not get what they want. Begin to trim the fat of busy-ness so that you can be truly productive instead.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3466/1*3Yz7xC0nXO_61A1KhsrjVQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/curious/4-signs-of-busy-but-unproductive-people-b884acfad26,productivity,7e79cf8ed3b70990652424b7bad97380786ac4b9e0b8adf3d58afb9a
"Actually, it's not fine.","As the spirit of 2020 lingers like a houseguest not catching the hint, our national resilience is starting to wear through. Cracks appear in our perfectly smooth facades. The smiles are starting to feel painted on. We aren't ok. And that is ok. Saying this grates against the grain of our collective ethos of personal responsibility. If you aren't ok, then what are you doing about it?There's a pill for that. Online therapy. There is always someone who has it worse, be grateful.Or maybe it is our own fault. If we were better, if we were more prepared; we would be ok.If we had made a different choice - gone right when we veered left, we wouldn't be in this mess.We just need to think positively, and it will all work out. Right?This is a fallacy.Optimism is a fair-weather friend. Hoping for the best is all well and good, but only if you prepare for the worst. And preparation can't happen without imagining the worst. We don't like to think about the worst. Forty percent of Americans cannot cover a $400 emergency without borrowing. Most Americans don't have a will. We don't like to think about the worst.  It goes further than the lack of preparedness.We invalidate ourselves and our experiences. When something goes wrong, we blame ourselves. We self-castigate and run through what we should have known, what we should have done better. It's all our fault.  We don't want to think about it, so we tell ourselves that it will all be fine. It's all good. No worries.But sometimes it won't be fine. Positivity has its place, but focusing on the bright side at the expense of reality is a problem. It's not all good when the same negative feelings bubble up time and time again. You can only shove those emotions back into the suitcase so many times before it breaks, and the emotions come flying out - resulting in rage, in burnout.It can result in death.Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US, particularly for men. Generations of men have been told to ""man up"" and fight, drink, or push those feelings away. It's killing them. It's not all good, and it hasn't been all good for a long while. Trying to reframe everything positively denies your own human experience. You gaslight yourself. Accept that you have feelings. Own it. Having feelings doesn't make you weak. Whatever you are feeling, say it:You are human. These are human feelings.You don't need to feel proud of them; you don't need to defend them. Stop denying them, at least to yourself. Hiding those emotions is doesn't solve them. They don't go away. Be kind to your future self, and just embrace those feelings now. Isn't it about time to accept that it isn't all good?",https://miro.medium.com/max/3150/1*pHj8LRGVLzy9TYnkKZ5L8Q.png,https://samseaster.medium.com/actually-its-not-fine-f3beb3a7d651,mindfulness,7f23609a8305fd98cdde4574dcdd91c2df4412b04b0cc5efdf1459ea
"If you're an academic and you're not on YouTube, why not?","In 2011, my then-teenage kids dragged me to VidCon in Los Angeles and kick-started a 10-year journey into exploring how academics can use YouTube more effectively.VidCon was created by brothers Hank and John Green as a glorious mixing-pot of YouTube celebs, content creators, and exuberant fans. In 2011 it was in its second year, and still small enough (and chaotic enough) for attendees to rub shoulders with some of the world's top YouTube superstars.I was, I must confess, initially bemused by the whole experience. I remember waiting in line at Starbucks with my son for instance and being fascinated by him freaking out about who was in the queue in front of us-and being impressed as the two struck up a casual conversation. But this was nothing compared to the detailed instructions I received from my daughter on collecting video cameo-performances of various YouTube stars for her collaborative YouTube channel! (Being the dutiful father, I got a whole bunch of clips of people who were, so I'm told, a big deal.)Despite the alternative-reality discombobulation I was exposed to over those few days though, the experience transformed how I thought about YouTube as a professor in a major research university. And this journey from VidCon to academic content-creator has just been captured in a new paper in the Journal Frontiers in Communication.After leaving VidCon in 2011, I became intrigued by the potential reach YouTube offers for connecting expertise with people who are actively looking for new knowledge and skills, but on their own terms rather than through conventional educational routes. I also began to appreciate what an appalling job most (not all) academics were doing in making use of the platform-including myself at the time.Today, YouTube is purportedly the second-most visited website after Google. According to the latest figures, more than 2 billion users log in to YouTube each month, and viewers watch more than a billion hours of content on the website every day. And yet, with a few exceptions, academics either eschew the platform as being beneath them, post interminably boring videos that hardly anyone watches, or claim that they either have a) no time, b) no talent or c) are not rewarded appropriately for using YouTube to communicate what they know to others.This would be fine if free access to knowledge and education didn't matter. Why should we make the effort to make what we know publicly accessible if we're content to restrict it to the wealthy and the privileged? Why give stuff away for free if we don't believe that universal access to knowledge is necessary for personal and social as well as economic growth? And why should we worry about who fills the public knowledge-vacuum left by the absence of experts willing to share their expertise online?Of course, I'm being provocatively rhetorical here. Free and widespread access to knowledge and information and training do matter. It's pivotal to how people develop the skills and the understanding that enable them to build a better future for themselves and their communities. It empowers them to learn in their own way, and on their own terms. And increasingly, it's where platforms like YouTube are ushering in a revolution in casual, or self-directed, learning.Given all this, and inspired by my experiences at VidCon, I set out to see what I could achieve as a time and talent-limited academic. The result was the YouTube channel Risk Bites, which launched in 2012.As I describe in the paper, Risk Bites was (and still is) an experiment in how someone like me (plenty of expertise, but little talent) could use YouTube more effectively for making insights into understanding and addressing risk as accessible and useful to as many people as possible.It's been an interesting nine years since the channel launched, with plenty of frustrations and pointed learning experiences along the way. Risk Bites still a niche channel-it only gets around 2,000 views per day, equating to between 50-90 hours of viewing per day. And it has its fair share of clunkers in the 100+ videos that have been posted to date. Yet despite this, the channel has been successful in providing expert content in areas that are otherwise poorly served.For instance, Risk Bites videos are consistently in the top returns for searches on topics that include Responsible Innovation, Nanotechnology, Epidemiology, AI Risk, The Fourth Industrial Revolution, The Precautionary Principle, Radon. And these are just some of the topics where the channel's videos are meeting the needs of casual learners.Much of this success is down to a meticulously developed and applied approach to video production, and one which aligns with just how tough a task this is for academics who have little time, marginal talent, and minimal training in video production. It's an approach that's both described in the paper and outlined in a series of online tutorials. It's also due in part to careful attention to search engine optimization.Beyond the underlying process though, the channel has been effective because we've focused less on overall numbers of views and subscribers, and more on whether a video is filling a need, even when there are relatively few people searching for that specific content.For example, very few people search YouTube for videos on responsible innovation. But when they do, the first thing they see is a Risk Bites video.This, to me, is a critical insight gained from producing the channel. If there's stuff we know as academics, and there are people who might benefit from this but who don't otherwise have access to what we know, I believe we have a responsibility to make what we know as accessible and relevant as possible to them-even if we're just talking about a handful of people. And this is where YouTube provides an incredibly powerful platform for making accessible what we know, even for content creators who have little time and limited ability.And of course, while I'm focusing on academics here, this applies equally to anyone who has knowledge or expertise that others might benefit from.Perhaps the most important takeaway for me though since I started down this road in 2011 is that, if we're serious about empowering as many people as possible to play a role in building a more just, equitable and vibrant future, we need to use every avenue possible to achieve this.

How Filmmakers Can Use Text and Subtext,"A simple straight line that will elevate your visual storytellingOne day, when I was storyboarding a complicated film for The New York Times, I realised something about how visual stories function.I built it on a concept by a Disney animator called Francis Glebas. He says that when someone watches a film, there are things they are consciously processing and then things they process subconsciously.The audience is aware of everything above the line. They are focused on the words they are hearing or reading and the literal representations of images on the screen or page. ""There's a woman and she's saying she is hungry.""Below the line, then, is everything the audience is not consciously aware of.Juxtaposition refers to the ideas that are generated in the audience's mind by two images being placed next to each other. This is the most powerful way of telling stories on film.Composition describes to the ways images are built, the shapes created by the framing of a shot, the colours, the ways certain lenses or angles create certain ideas. For example, how a low angle shot makes the subject appear powerful.Connotated Images have meaning beyond their literal description. An apple is green and round, but it also has connotations of freshness, nature, innocence - or even loss of innocence, depending on the context. This opens us up to the world of semiotics, a vast unexplored land of visual storytelling.You might notice there is more below the line than above it.This is one of the things that makes visual stories so rich - there are multiple layers of meaning going on at once, many of which activate away from the logical reasoning parts of our brain.We read things that almost cannot be put into words.Here are two practical lessons I have taken away from understanding the Threshold of Awareness:An edited version of this essay first appeared in The Third Something, a free newsletter about visual storytelling.

The Case for Twitter Spaces,"I live a simple life with a few steadfast rules. They include: 1) Be kind 2) Call loved ones at least once a week 3) Don't expect too much from Twitter. Alas, after a hasty hot take and then some serious thought about Twitter's new Clubhouse clone - called Twitter Spaces - I'm relaxing rule number three for just a moment. Lord help me.Twitter and Clubhouse are locked in a battle to dominate a new form of audio social networking that feels equal parts podcast, industry convention, and conference call. For the uninitiated, the format has people gather in virtual ""rooms"" where a convening moderator sets a topic and invites people to speak. No new form of social media has been as promising since Snapchat debuted Stories in 2013. And like Stories, there's a case to be made that the primary beneficiary will not be the originator.Clubhouse, which pioneered this format, has built something special, no doubt. The discussions in its rooms feel timely, entertaining, and sometimes a bit edgy. Being in a room with celebrities and industry icons, even if you're not a speaker, creates a feeling of shared presence that's flat out electric. So it's no wonder that Clubhouse invites are going for $125 on eBay.But while Clubhouse may be the hottest app in the world, Twitter is well positioned to co-opt its energy with Spaces, a clone that replicates Clubhouse's features and integrates them into the Twitter app. Twitter's version - just rolling out - is intuitive, a logical fit, and adds a meaningful new experience to the app. It may not work (see: Rule three), but it's likely not Google+ 2.0.Whenever I evaluate a new social network's prospects, I return to Eugene Wei's framework: Status as a Service. In a lengthy post written two years ago, Wei, a former Amazon and Facebook employee, explained that when people use social networks, they ""seek out the most efficient path to maximize their social capital."" People, in other words, expect to earn status from the effort they put into creating stuff on social media. That's why they post for free. Young people, for example, stay away from Twitter because it's difficult to reach anyone with their tweets. But they use Instagram because, per Wei, they can add lots of hashtags, get their posts on discovery pages, and build a following.Clubhouse's early boom is, in part, a land grab for status. People who spend time there sit in rooms, speak, and then revel in the followings they're building. Nearly every early Clubhouse user I speak with brings up their follower count unprompted, and most within the first five minutes. Building a following on Clubhouse gives you an opportunity to reengage your followers in another room sometime down the road. It's valuable social capital.Twitter Spaces is better positioned to deliver that precious commodity though. On Spaces, people participate in rooms and add followers in the same way they do on Clubhouse (sounding smart, funny, engaging). And while they get that same ability to reengage their followers in a Spaces room sometime down the line, there's an added benefit: The opportunity to drop tweets into new followers' timelines.A Twitter follower is therefore more valuable than a Clubhouse follower when it comes to building social capital. And for people looking for the most efficient path to maximize their social capital, a minute spent on Twitter Spaces is more useful than a minute on Clubhouse. So they'll allocate their time accordingly. It's a bit crude. But this is how these platforms work.Twitter Spaces' toughest challenge will be matching Clubhouse's ability to highlight interesting rooms. ""The magic of Clubhouse is the hallway,"" Josh Constine, a Clubhouse power user and an investor whose firm invests in the app, told me. What Constine means is that when you open Clubhouse you can peruse a feed of rooms - that is, the hallway - and drop in and out as you scroll through. On Twitter today, you can only find Spaces when someone you follow is participating in one (it shows up in the Fleets bar), or when you see a tweet with a link to one. But Twitter has a valuable shortcut.Unlike Facebook, where you connect with friends and family, on Twitter, you follow people based on your interests: reporters, athletes, politicians, entertainers, and so forth. Your Twitter follow list is therefore a loud signal pointing to the topics you'd be interested in hearing about, and the people you'd want to hear talk about them. Even without a ""hallway"" (a form of which the company seems intent to build), Twitter will show you relevant conversations right off the bat. ""This experience fundamentally is the same thing,"" Twitter product head Kayvon Beykpour told me in a conversation on Spaces last night. ""The same use case, with slightly different mechanics.""Twitter has another advantage when it comes to recruiting participants for Spaces: An engaged userbase filled with some of the world's most prominent people. When Elon Musk goes on Clubhouse, it's a news story. When he logs onto Twitter, it's Wednesday. These power users will generate buzz for Spaces when they gain access to it, and they'll get their millions of followers accustomed to using the format on Twitter. They'll gravitate toward Twitter for a simple reason: Reach. They'll be able to speak with more people on Twitter, which 192 million people use each day, than Clubhouse, which 2 million use each week.Meanwhile, for the middle class of content creators (people with moderate sized-followings), Twitter has quietly assembled a suite of products to win them over. It acquired Revue, a newsletter platform that lets creators charge for subscriptions (and takes a 5% cut vs. Substack's 10%) which syncs quite nicely with Spaces. Imagine the following scenario: Someone builds a paid newsletter on Revue, uses their Twitter account to share their work, and then jumps into Spaces to deepen their relationship with subscribers after they post. It works.Finally, Twitter needs this and will do everything in its power to give it a chance. Twitter conversations have become so toxic that opening the app fills people with dread. Twitter can be fun and interesting. But most often it's a rolling shouting match where even the most benign statements are picked apart by angry people looking to fight.Spaces, in a best-case scenario, could help people see each other as humans, not 2D avatars. With audio, you can hear nuance, intonation, sarcasm, humor: context that is too often lost in the hellscape of the timeline. Talking - dialogue - can make even the most tense exchanges cool off (we saw this when San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin dropped into a Clubhouse chat with some of his biggest haters). And this is why Twitter is going all in. For the sake of its future, this must work.Case in point: After I tweeted that Twitter would win out vs. Clubhouse earlier this month, I got a lot of terse and angry pushback. Tonight, I'm going to talk it out on Clubhouse with some of those who disagreed with me (venue chosen at their request). The conversation will, with 100% certainty, be more productive than a Twitter spat. And sometime soon, we could be seeing this type of engagement regularly, perhaps in the same app.If you have Clubhouse, you can join here and listen to the discussion at 6 p.m. pacific time today, Thursday 2/11.I write this without a rooting interest. I haven't invested in either company, unlike many of Clubhouse's core evangelists. And I definitely don't have a special affinity for Twitter. (Not long ago, I wrote a story that caused 1 million people to tweet #RIPTwitter over a weekend.) That said, I've been studying the service for a long time, and believe Spaces is a particularly unique fit. Twitter may well mess it up. And there are plenty of reasons why it won't work. But everything seems aligned for Twitter Spaces to become the next iteration of Instagram Stories.Facebook Is Said to Be Building a Product to Compete With Clubhouse (New York Times)Facebook Eyes Clubhouse With Familiar Playbook in Mind (Bloomberg)Clubhouse May Be Social Media's Future.

Why You Should Go Wine Tasting When Travelling,"Wine tasting is one of my biggest travel hobbies. It started when I was in South Africa, and I still maintain that South Africa is the best country in the world for wine tasting. There, the wine estates are set up to provide a wine tasting experience, whereas in many other countries, the wine estates are set up to produce and sell wine - which is actually quite different.After wine tasting in a lot in South Africa, when I lived there in the Cape winelands, it became my hobby. And along with my girlfriend - who is also massively into wine -I would base my destination choices on whether we could find out more about the wine scene in the country we were going to visit.What's been surprising about wine tasting around the world is that it's not just the wine that's different.Of couse, if you drink wine you know that the wines from Spain and Italy taste different. You know that every country, every region, every grape, every producer, every vineyard, produces a different wine. Part of what any wine drinker loves about wine is the diversity from bottle to bottle.But when I went wine tasting around the world, I discovered that what changes from country to country is much more than just the wine - it's the whole attitude and approach to wine tasting.Take South Africa. They have experiences where you sit gazing across the vines and spend three hours sampling nine or ten different wines accompanied with food. It's a slow, leisurely afternoon in the sun, complete and utter relaxation, complete and utter indulgence. A celebration of wine and a celebration of the diversity of wine South Africa produces.It's a completely different experience to wine tasting in Mendoza, in Argentina. Mendoza is a region that doesn't produce an enormous variety of wines, but it does produce one of the world's really great wines: Mendoza Malbec, one of the unparalleled things to drink in the world.And the difference in Mendoza is that the wine estates offer very similar wines of different qualities. You will go for a tasting and there will be three different Malbecs. You can taste the difference, but the tasting experience is more about the knowledge and the understanding that's delivered by the guides - the winemaker and the people who work at the wine estate. It's an understanding of why those Malbecs taste different. An understanding created by walking through the vines, by exploring the production process, by following Malbec wine from grape to glass. Mendoza wine tasting is an educational experience without a doubt.Then we can go to a country like Italy. We can go to Tuscany, where the wine tasting comes in two types.There's the wine tasting that's advertised - you can go to this shop, you can go to that farm, and you can taste some wine.And then there are the wine estates where you must make a booking. The wine estates that will provide outstanding service, a truly personal and intimate experience.It's just that you don't know about them. You don't know they exist. You don't know that they accept visitors. These are the wine estates that only travel designers, only exceptional guides know about - the boutique producers. This is a country where there are so many wine estates it is impossible to know where to start. You can't go out driving, see a wine estate and decide to go in and check it out. Or maybe you can do that - I have done that and the wine was okay, but it was nothing better than what I had in a local restaurant.The really great Italian wine experiences I've had are with a travel designer who says: ""I'm going to take you to this winery, where you're going to meet the winemakers and sit down for lunch with them. We're going to chat. We're going to do everything in the local Italian way. And as part of that, there's going to be an enormous selection of great Italian wine.""So much for the Tuscany wine experience. If you go wine tasting in the Rioja region in Spain, it won't be at a wine estate -it will be in a small bustling bar. A bar that only serves wine, accompanied with small bites called ""pinchos"". Picture a chalkboard menu, and ten to twenty different Rioja wines available to drink by the glass. And then, two or three hundred vintage Rioja wines available by the bottle.The wine tasting experience in Rioja mostly takes place in these small intimate bars - and again, you need a great guide to tell you which bars to go to in order to sample the boutique producers. And a wonderful thing about going to these small wine bars is that they're not just in bars, vinotecas. They are actually a connection to the underground cellars, a labyrinthine underground cellar network that exists in Rioja's towns.So the wine tasting experience there rarely takes place at a wine state - but it is one of excitement, energy, exploration.I could tell you more. I could tell you about wine tasting in Japan, New Zealand, California, Chile, France, Germany, Austria, Czech Republic... Because the truth is that many countries have incredible wine regions-and their wine tastes and experiences are always different and unique.By Stephen Bailey.

A U.S. Influencer Got Deported From Bali by Bragging About Her Lifestyle on Twitter,"The living in paradise lifestyle of an American influencer and her partner ended when the Indonesian government deported them back to the United States in January 2021.On January 16, 2021, Kristen Gray, a professional graphic designer, started a Twitter thread sharing her extravagant life in Bali for over a year.Her tweets sparked outrage among Indonesians and drew the ire of local authorities. Gray's case was a concrete case study of why cultural intelligence and cultural sensitivity are significant to entrepreneurs, professionals, business people, and digital nomads.In Gray's thread, she described how she and her girlfriend, Saundra Alexander, found a new opportunity for money-making and living a grander life in Bali as a ""digital nomad.""Her luxurious lifestyle on the island was incomparable to her previous one in the United States, where she struggled to sustain a decent income.In March 2020, amid the outbreak and lockdowns, the couple decided to stay in Bali. Their initial plan was to ""wait it out.""They believed that such a move was the best decision for them as they experienced Bali's best life. Towards the end of her thread, she started encouraging her followers in the U.S. to follow in their footsteps.She then promoted their eBook, Our Bali Life is Yours, to all her followers. She was emphasizing that Bali is a safe, cheap, luxurious, and ""queer-friendly"" island. Their book, priced at $30, also provides a ""direct link"" to visa agents that could help them get into Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic.It would have been an inspiring narrative to promote a business on social media using a rags-to-riches account. But when Gray's tweets became viral, the Southeast Asian community, particularly the Indonesians, thrashed Gray for her alleged exploitation of Bali's low-cost accommodations and encouraging more foreigners to move to Indonesia amid a pandemic.Some locals were also appalled when Gray promoted Bali for LGBTQ+ couples. The locals themselves were even struggling to come out to the public due to Indonesia's strict laws about same-sex couples.Gray defended herself, stating that they were experiencing such persecution because they are two Black gay women. Her statement rage the locals more lecturing her that Indonesia is not America.Since the couple ""unsettled the public"" through social media, the head of the Bali office for the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Jamaruli Manihuruk, said that Gray and Alexander had violated several immigration laws after their investigation.Apart from spreading misinformation, they were doing business at the expense of Indonesia, when their permits to stay in the country were only under tourist visas.The two were sanctioned and deported from Bali. They were also banned from entering Indonesia for six-months after their deportation.In an interview, social psychologist Benny Siauw said the way Gray mentioned Bali as a queer-friendly place is highly ignorant.Looking at the other side of the picture, Kristen Gray and her partner Saundra Alexander were merely a couple who wanted to make a living and thrive. There's nothing wrong with that - but what made their operation technically illegal was the lack of understanding of the country they moved into.As a citizen of a developing nation in Southeast Asia, my passport is not as powerful as the American passport. Many countries won't allow me to enter their borders without proper documents. Therefore, to obtain a visa, we had to go through tons of research, paperwork, leg work, phone calls, and fees.If we can do these beforehand, all the more, the ""first world"" citizens with more access to information should do their assignments better. Especially in this day and age, where everything is a click away, being ignorant of the law excuses no one.Therefore, it is essential to arm yourself with the knowledge that you need before booking a flight, packing your bags, moving to another country, and making a living as a foreigner.Here is a research checklist I recommend based on personal experience that can relate to this case study.I bet for those who are reading this, religion may not be their first priority. But in this case, it should be. The government of Indonesia takes religious practices seriously. Six distinct faiths are officially recognized, but not limited to Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism.87% of Indonesia's population are Muslim, and the Islamic religion played a crucial role in the country's independence movement during the 20th century.When the Portuguese, and later the Dutch, occupied the nation, they introduced Christianity to the Indonesians. Apart from Islam and Christianity, Hinduism and Confucianism are also evident religious practices.Citizens of this country had to carry their identification cards stating their religions. The state does not recognize atheism and agnosticism as these two were considered blasphemous, illegal, and punishable by law.Religions in Indonesia are developed regionally rather than nationally. Nonetheless, to have a harmonious environment, despite palpable differences, Indonesians respect each others' faith preferences.Learning about a nation's stance on religion is important. Western countries may not give a fuss about religious practices, but most parts of Asia, Latin America, and Africa do. Researching about such would give you an idea if you could adjust to the local culture and traditional practices.You need to understand that nations with high religious commitment influence their society's lifestyle and policies.Conservative religions highly influenced Indonesia's laws, and in the case of Gray and her girlfriend, their status as a same-sex couple gave the locals a disturbing vibe.LGBTQ+ people in Indonesia face legal challenges and prejudices. Tradition disapproves of homosexuality, cross-dressing, and gender transitioning, which impacts their public policies. Indonesian same-sex couples are not eligible for any of the legal protections available to opposite-sex married couples.Being gay in Indonesia may not be a crime, but it is highly condemned by society due to traditional religious norms. If the locals are still struggling to fight for their rights, non-residents should be more sensitive in this matter to not provoke the majority and put the minority in jeopardy.Having the discernment of a nation's public policies that would affect your status is essential. Moving to a country that has significantly different values from yours is risky. The best thing you can do is immerse yourself without creating a scene because you are not a resident. At the end of the day, you are an ""alien"" with limited rights.Indonesia is a developing country, and locals themselves are working hard to make a living. In the midst of a global pandemic, the people are already struggling to make ends meet.The more foreign nationals that move to Bali for the same reason of having a luxurious life would put a strain on locals to sustain a living on the island.For Americans, inclusive monthly costs to live a grander life in Bali is only $1,900 USD. However, for the locals, this is already costing them over 26 million IDR. Bali's cost of living for the locals is like the Americans' California - way too expensive.So, showing off to social media that you can live a millionaire's life in Bali, wherein most are struggling, is downright disrespectful.Also, making an income at the expense of Indonesian people without a proper permit is like robbing them of their rightful benefits because you are not paying local taxes. Worst, encouraging more foreigners to travel to Bali amid a pandemic, dodging COVID-19 protocols for your business to thrive was not only selfish but also absurd and insensible.If you choose to pursue your business overseas, then level the playing field. Apply for a visa that allows you to operate a business in a foreign land. Several digital nomads may argue that it's unnecessary, as many could get away with it. That doesn't mean it is legal.Mostly, a tourist visa only allows you to stay for 30-90 days - and working is not part of that. So, being a digital nomad as a profession is technically illegal. Visa laws in most countries are not set up to deal with this new class of modern vagabonds. But, since it became apparent, some nations are recognizing its permanence as a profession.You need to check if the country you want to visit offers a digital nomad visa, remote work visa, or freelance visa, so you could prevent complications, apprehension, and deportation during your stay. If none of these are available, at least secure a proper permit where you can operate legally.Bear in mind, having deportation or a criminal record overseas will affect your future visa applications.Harnessing cultural intelligence could hone one's sensitivity to other cultures. In Gray and Alexander's case, it was widely inappropriate to encourage all their western followers to invade a nation that they even seem unknowledgeable about.However, studying all the essential information you need to know about the country you are visiting or staying in could avoid unwanted difficulties. Don't merely research for accommodations, food, and leisure places. Learn the country's economic status, your rights as a foreigner, policies, beliefs, and practices.Apply for a proper visa to make your profession and business legal, hassle-free, and relatable to the locals. They would support you more because you are promoting their nation and culture respectfully instead of exploiting it. Thus, you are playing your game fairly and not stealing their privileges.When you land on foreign soil, you will be following that country's regulations. You need to make adjustments because that country will never ever adjust for you.",https://miro.medium.com/max/4000/1*A3OhfHhTz_960LK8m2qhNQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/a-u-s-influencer-got-deported-from-bali-by-bragging-about-her-lifestyle-on-twitter-c14426dd9c09,travel,8cf53511eaf88fcbc1d52fdc23856135618677bf327c3601730c3e9c
Going Bayesian: Testing Rate Metrics,"Have you ever struggled trying to explain your Frequentist test results (namely null/alternative hypothesis, p-values and confidence intervals) to a non-technical audience or... even yourself? Do you wish you could just say ""there's a 95% probability group A has a better click-through rate than group B"" after running an A/B test and be done with it? If yes, then you have landed on the right post, if not we have pictures of cute dogs so you might want to stay anyway!You are working as a Data Scientist for WoofWoof, a dog toy company. The Marketing Department wants to run a new digital advertising campaign and they are trying to decide whether they should use the picture of a corgi or a pug in it. Quickly, you suggest running an A/B test, where you will present the version with the corgi to one group of people and the version with the pug to another group of people and see which one does better in terms of click-through rate. The Marketing Department agrees, and you set off to refresh your memory on how to actually analyse the data.We will go through the theory and steps that you need to run the A/B test, the Bayes way. We will implement everything in Python.The title kind of gives it away, but you need to be familiar with Bayes Theorem. Bayes Theorem gives us a way to model how our prior belief about something changes after observing new data.The above definition is for discrete variables, for continuous variables it is defined for probability density functions.In our example we care about the click-through rate, let's denote that by 𝜃. We will denote our prior belief about 𝜃 as 𝜋(𝜃) - this is the prior distribution on the parameter of interest. Next, after running the experiment we will observe data, 𝛸. The likelihood function f(𝛸|𝜃) tells us how likely it is to observe the data, 𝛸, given different values of 𝜃. What we really care about is 𝜋(𝜃|𝛸), i.e. the posterior distribution for 𝜃. This basically says how likely different values of 𝜃 are after taking into account the data we have observed and our prior belief. We can get to 𝜋(𝜃|𝛸) using Bayes Theorem.In general, we haveThe prior is meant to capture any prior knowledge we have on likely values for our click-through rate. If you have no idea, you can choose an uninformative prior, for example, that all possible values are equally likely. Whatever the case, one thing is certain: rate metrics can only take values between 0 and 1! Therefore, we need a prior distribution that reflects that, such as the Beta distribution.The Beta distribution has two parameters you can play with, 𝛼 >0 and 𝛽>0 ( aand bin Figure 1). Let's look at some plots to get some intuition on how they affect the shape of the density function.You may have already noticed a pattern in Figure 1. The peak of the distribution is at (𝛼-1)/(𝛼+𝛽-2) - this is actually the mode of the distribution. Also, the larger 𝛼 and 𝛽 become the more concentrated the values are around the mode (look at the diagonal in Figure 1).In fact, you can think of 𝛼-1 as the number of successes and 𝛽-1 as the number of failures. Then, the mode (𝛼-1)/(𝛼+𝛽-2) can be thought of as successes / trials. Therefore, if we want a prior that gives more weight to values of 𝜃 around 0.5 like we ran an experiment and got 20 successes (clicks) and 20 failures (no clicks), we can choose 𝛼=21 and 𝛽=21. If we want an uninformative prior we can choose 𝛼=1 and 𝛽=1 - there's obviously no mode in this case.Bear in mind that the stronger your prior is, i.e. very big 𝛼 and 𝛽, the more data we will need to move away from it.The likelihood tells us how likely it is to observe the data, 𝛸, given different values of 𝜃. Since we are working with rate metrics, which means we have trials (impressions of our digital ads) and successes (clicked ads), the Binomial distribution fits nicely.As a reminder, the Binomial(𝜈, 𝜃) distribution models the probability of 𝜅 successes from 𝜈 trials when the probability of success is equal to 𝜃 (usually the probability of success is denoted as p ).We've chosen a Beta distribution as our prior and a Binomial distribution as our likelihood. What could our posterior possibly be hmm... (you are probably already imagining horrible math calculations).It turns out our posterior is a Beta distribution too! This isn't an accident, of course. This Beta-Binomial prior-likelihood combo is chosen often because they are conjugate priors. Conjugate priors simply mean that when you combine them, the posterior distribution ends up being from the same distribution family as the prior.So all we need to do is choose 𝛼 and 𝛽 for our prior, run our experiment, collect the data and then calculate our posterior, which is again a Beta distribution with parameters 𝛼+successes, 𝛽+failures. Easy!The plan for our A/B test is to give both groups the same prior and then use Bayes theorem to calculate their posterior distributions. Once we have the posteriors we can do interesting comparisons to find and declare the winner.We are interested in the probability that Group A (Corgi Ad) is better than Group B (Pug Ad) in terms of click-through rate (CTR), i.e.where the margin could be 0 or some other value that we care about. This is basically answering the question ""what's the probability that the CTR of the corgi ad is at least margin greater than the CTR of the pug ad""?We are going to find the answer by sampling from the posterior distributions for each group's click-through rate. The process is the following:In our implementation, we will be using a vectorised approach instead of for loops as it faster.This may look like a lot of code but most of it is just for creating some plots. Lines 23 to 35 are the important ones, where we sample from the posteriors and calculate the distribution of differences.There's another way you can use the posteriors to conclude your experiment which we haven't implemented here. It involves calculating the highest density interval (HDI) of the posterior distribution of differences (the shortest interval such that the probability of values in it are equal to x% ) and checking whether it overlaps a predefined region of practical equivalence (ROPE). For example, we might define ROPE to be [-0.005, 0.005], which means we consider differences between the two groups in that range to be negligible. After calculating the posterior distribution of differences, the next step is to calculate the 95% HDI (what percentage you actually use is up to you). If the HDI does not intersect our ROPE we conclude that the two groups are different.The A/B test is underway and the Marketing Department is already asking you to analyse the data.Using the code from the previous section, you can simply do the followingto quickly get an answer.You go back to the Marketing Department and let them know that there's about a 90% probability that the corgi version works better than the pug one. At this point, they might decide that 90% is good enough and go with corgies or decide to continue the experiment to collect more data and become more certain.If you've reached this point you might be wondering what happens when you want to use a Bayesian A/B test for non-rate metrics. There are more pairs of distributions that are conjugate priors and therefore can be used easily. If those fit your data then you are in luck - the methodology will be very similar to what we saw in this article. Otherwise, you might need to use packages for Bayesian inference, like PyStan, to create an approximation of the posterior distributions for you.In this article, we went through the theory of running an A/B test for rate metrics using Bayes Theorem. We have looked at how to implement the test in Python and saw that having the posterior distributions for the groups allows us to calculate probabilities for different questions (different values for margin).We have also concluded that corgis are cuter than pugs and that this author is biased (if you haven't noticed, there are zero pictures of pugs in this article).[1] ""Bayes' theorem,"" Wikipedia.

How To Grow Your Yoga Business to a Steady 4-Figure Income,"Have you ever thought about starting or evolving your career as a yoga or fitness instructor?One year ago, I had just finished my yoga teacher training when the pandemic hit the world. I was quite disappointed as I was hoping to apply for some yoga teacher jobs and earn money with my hobby. My goal was to teach in 2-3 studios and work there next to my full-time job.Then the lockdowns came, and all my beloved studios closed for several months.Today, I know that the lockdowns were the best possibility for me to set up my own online yoga business. Since September, I'm teaching regular classes online, and my subscribers' quote increases continuously.In the beginning, I thought that teaching online wasn't really my thing.It can be frustrating and impersonal to only communicate with your clients via Zoom. Your clients may also feel tired by their daily home-office routine and need a more versatile and appealing offer. The pandemic requests creative solutions from yoga and fitness instructors to stay motivated and provide stimulating classes to their clients.It's a challenge but an opportunity to grow! People still need yoga in their lives especially because of lockdowns and quarantines. Today, I find value in my online classes because I know that they help me think outside the box. Also, they allow people to escape their monotonous lockdown-life and experience something pleasant.That's why you should think about offering online yoga classes. The demand for online courses is enormous, and you will benefit from it personally and financially.I decided to invest money into a website and practical tools to set up my business, create my brand, and give my offer a professional look.Here's how you can realize your online business ideas and evolve your career as a successful online yoga teacher.Before you start creating your brand and designing your website you should think about what you want to offer. Start planning your regular classes first.The first crucial point is the price. Start with a price that feels fair to you. Your income should allow you to cover all your costs and earn a nice sum with your hobby every month. When thinking about your offer, try to answer these questions:Remember that it's harder for you to cancel classes when people can buy monthly passes. In general, I'd still recommend offering them when you provide more than one class per week. Students who want to practice regularly can benefit from a well-priced monthly pass.Start with fewer classes in the beginning and see how it works out. After a while, you can expand your existing offer. Also, not all your classes have to be 90-minute Vinyasa Flows. There are multiple possibilities to vary the time and style of your courses. Here are some examples:Offer what feels right for you and always ask your students for feedback. You can also do a survey from time to time and determine if you can adjust your offer for the better.After you've thought about your offer, you can start creating your logo or let someone design it for you.Design is key! Your business can definitely profit from beautiful fonts, pictures, and gadgets.Not only your website but also your social media accounts should look aesthetically appealing.You don't have to spend tons of money on good designers. There are many tools on the internet you can benefit from.I use canva.com for my social media designs. That's where I also created my logo. Still, it can be useful to hire a professional designer and pay for the creation of your logo as you will use it for many years!However, you should think about the style and the colors you want to have on your website and your social media accounts. Use coolors.co to create your beautiful color palette. Ensure that these colors represent your style and personality and that you can identify yourself with them.You can use your logo and personalized color palette to create an appealing account on Instagram or Facebook. It's definitely worth it to invest time and money into the design. Your brand will look professional and pleasant and you'll eventually attract more clients.After creating your brand, it's time to set up your website. You don't necessarily need one in the beginning. But I made the experience that some yogis (especially those who don't use Instagram or Facebook) regularly visit my website. It's for your advantage to make your brand visible on as many platforms and channels as possible.Another crucial and successful investment I've made is my booking system. Students can use the system to check out my offer and book my classes independently. I don't have to issue invoices or track my income. It all happens automatically.As suggested by my business coach @Eva Keiffenheim, I chose the booking system momoyoga.com. The only disadvantage is that you cannot offer discount codes (I'd like to have them for my family) on this platform. But there are other possibilities to provide discounts. In general, I can highly recommend this platform!You'll reach many yogis over Instagram. It's my number one platform to promote my brand. If you aren't into social media platforms, I'd recommend using them in a limited way. Set up a minimalistic and beautiful feed and only post a few stories or pictures a month.You can use the platforms to promote your most important news and offers. I like it to post my schedule every week. In this way, I remind my followers that I'm offering classes regularly.Make sure that interested yogis can subscribe to your newsletter. Use the newsletter to promote your current offers. Always integrate your logo and your website and contact details into your newsletter's signature. I use ConvertKit for my newsletters.Before I started to send newsletters regularly I only addressed my Instagram users. Since I'm sending them regularly, my client base became broader. With a newsletter, you can address more people regardless of which social media accounts they use.During the last months, I often received positive feedback from my students in terms of my offer. I teach my regular classes, but every month I try to offer a special.These specials can relate to the season, current events, or something you'd like to share with your students. There are multiple possibilities. To name a few:Give your students multiple inputs and possibilities to practice with you. I made the experience that some yogis don't want to practice regularly, but they prefer blocks or workshops to concentrate on a particular focus.Make sure that the background of your online classes looks appealing. Light some candles, cover unsuitable furniture with a beautiful blanket, and make sure that you wear rather tight clothing so that your students can see your poses properly over the camera. Make sure that the sound of your microphone is pleasing and that the room is well illuminated.If you want to play music during the class, be careful that the sound is pleasant. I decided to create playlists for my classes and send the playlist link to my students in advance. They can decide if they want to turn on the music at home or not. It's easier for me to let them decide, and I don't have to worry about my classes' sound quality.Another decisive point is the variety of asanas and stimuli during your classes. It's even more important when you teach online.If you do the same asanas every week, students will finally become bored and stop making progress. Here are some tips on how you can keep your classes exciting:I'd also like to recommend you the following book: ""The Art and Business of Teaching Yoga"" by Amy Ippoliti and Taro Smith, Ph.D. This book helped me to get an insight into the economic approach of yoga. You'll also find valuable tips to create stimulating yoga classes.I'm thrilled to see my little business grow. Growth sometimes happens slowly but sustainably. Don't be discouraged if there aren't so many bookings in the beginning. Keep on teaching and offering and you'll see that there'll be more and more students after a while.Stay in contact with your yogis and ask them how they feel after class. Act as you would still teach at a studio and give them your genuine attention. Your classes can still be personal, even if there's a physical distance. I wish you the best for your own online yoga business!",https://miro.medium.com/max/7200/1*PTf_XpBoyQgRnnN8kGbJDw.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-to-grow-your-yoga-business-to-a-steady-4-figure-income-e3577d53b944,marketing,8e1ff07d189144c058078a276d00df033b40066e63da3e1bd5a2ac41
"Facebook Knows What You Eat: Discover The Entire Data Facebook Collects About You, Step By Step.","I bet most Facebook users are not aware of what they really know about them.What if I told you that YOU can visualize it in just 5 minutes?I'm gonna show you how to do it yourself, and we will explore my (censored) Facebook data together.Some spooky commercials I ran into the other day, related to something that I was, most certainly, for 100%, speaking about in-person around my phone (not new to anyone, but boy! they are insolent) got me thinking what Facebook REALLY knows about me.I am grateful for all the good Facebook brought so far, and I appreciate the company. They have done some amazing things, This post's intention is to open your eyes to how the advertisement world works with a real world example.At the end of the day, like any other free product software - If you don't pay for it, your data is the key component of their business.I found some interesting ""Facebook-related data"" about me in Facebook's archive and I believe you would like it.No Idea how they got it, but we can all guess together ...it has something to do with $$$$$.Whether they bought it or collected it themselves.Giant (and also small) companies must comply with the latest privacy laws if they wish to scale worldwide or enter the European or Californian market.Facebook, one of the biggest players in the advertisement oligopoly (next to Google), are offering their users to download their data for free at any time.So I created a new archive. After a few hours, I have received a link to my email.The HTML Files contained an offline version of https://www.facebook.com/your_information.It is really nice, but after a few minutes of jumping between pages, I understood there must be a better (more efficient) way.So I looked at the JSON files, which contained a lot of information that the HTML versions were missing.The HTML version is skinnier. It is obviously making it harder for people, even technical as I am, to really understand the data and really see the whole picture.So I downloaded their JSON format and focused on the data that I could not see completely in the HTML5 web interface (And there is lots of it).It's like there is more to be shown - but although it is an offline piece of all the data, The web interface encapsulates some of the events.I wanted to see the entire picture in front of my eyes. I felt like I could understand it better using graphs, numbers, and lines, rather than through their website/HTML archive.It would be cool to see it on one screen. I needed to stream that data and index it somewhere...No way I'm gonna look after everything, file by file, or page by page.For the geeks among us, Let me elaborate.I chose to go with a docker stack composed of ELK (Elastic + LogStash + Kibana) components. I implemented a custom LogStash file stream that preprocessed the interesting JSON files from the downloaded ZIP archive to ElasticSearch.Then I split the records that contained multiple elements (events, clicks, likes, notifications, marketplace item clicks, etc.) so I could query real Facebook objects easily (as if they are indexed in a GraphQL), and create ElasticSearch indexes with my interesting fields.An ElasticSearch service from the stack would index all my events that ever took place inside Facebook's servers regarding my data.Later on, We are going to visualize the data and research it using Kibana.The Compose file (can be translated to Kubernetes services using Kompose) is available at at end of the post.I ran docker-compose up and it all started to play.After some samples went through ElasticSearch, I created index patterns manually using 1 click.Finally, through Kibana, and started to work with these pieces of data and understand what I was facing.There is an insane amount of data about me.I am not talking about the obvious data Facebook collects from their services... A lot of the data came from other places.I had to focus. There was too much.Let's take a look at the Ads And Business dashboard I created, which covers only some of Facebook's relationships with more than 300 companies.So, my question is: what they Buy and Sell about me?After years of using their products (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) for Free, they must know me pretty well.Facebook receives much of its information from 3rd party apps and services. I didn't even need to actually have a Facebook, an Instagram, or a WhatsApp account connected to any of these apps in order to be identified.I had to make the data visible somehow. So made some dashboards.They know about each and every digital incident that took place in 300+ websites, Which I am really using, or have used, without logging into with Facebook or relating to it in any way..They know how I pay to each and every service, what apps I've installed or changed, what websites I visited, thanks to Facebook Pixel technology and other ""great, privacy-respecting"" tools.Another great question came up - who inside Facebook can really see this data?I bet you also used, even once, one of the following:Nevertheless, Facebook had my browsing history for a variety of websites. Stop worrying about deleting it occasionally.Do you believe it? Well, here are some examples from my personal dashboard.Facebook knows I eat, whenever I order delivery.They know about my personal user flows on 300+ websites. from login to cart and checkouts.They know which sites I view, even when looking at previews.They know where, how, and when I Fly and Travel - my booking tickets/accommodation were logged.They (obviously) know my music taste. From Spotify, not from page likes.And ""CUSTOM"" data events - some nasty data they rather not name - that got me asking- why? What the **** is CUSTOM?I almost forgot the most precious jewel: ""advertisers_who_uploaded_a_contact_list_with_your_information.json""If that wasn't enough, I can also find ""profile_information.json"" among the files.This file, profile_information, included all the top facts about me, with some 0 timestamps values in a tuple, as if it was stored optimally for data science projects, experiments, and queries.It's like your due diligence provided by Facebook! relationships, interests, skills, etc. Think of it as your basic profile info, which many historical and inner data that Facebook does not use or support in their user interfaces. These fields are used by computers, for computers, to customize your ads (Or sell them, to whoever pays the most).I have much more to cover, But I have started an open-source skeleton for you curious people (who read the article, all the way) so you can download your data and visualize it immediately on your computer.When you'll find more interesting files in your archives that I didn't mention, It is really easy to add new data to the pipeline and I am sure you can discover it. There will be a part 2 to this blog post!I uploaded the project files to GitHub so y'all can do the same:Avi Lumelsky - I'm a Software Engineer / Security Researcher, I practice mostly in the fields of Privacy, Deep Learning, and Cyber Security.I am a co-founder of DATU.A platform that lets you control your online data without providing any sensitive information.DATU Scans only the information you choose to add, nonstop, to find possible security and privacy issues.Within 1 minute you will get a view, for your eyes only, that contains public data that anyone with basic computer knowledge can find about you.You will find exactly, which parts of your identity were compromised, leaked, or copied without you knowing. You will start a clean page from that moment.What do we get? Real private-caring users, what will help us understand what features you like the most.We can't access your data and we will never do anything related to your data.I will cover the progress in future posts.

Design systems: Working on the right level,"Of all the risks with adopting a design system, the most dangerous one is to keep working the same way. If that happens, what we have adopted is not a design system, but rather a UI component library. We might see benefits in the beginning: the UI looking fresher and more consistent, components nicely cataloged and documented. However, with time, the same old problems will re-surface. Inconsistencies will creep in, design critiques will get long and frustrating, component variants will multiply. These are system-level problems-and those cannot be solved by a component library.Consider, for example, the good old cards. At InterNations, we have card-like components (which we call teasers) to represent various entities: a group teaser, an event teaser, a forum teaser, etc. Each is tightly coupled with the entity it represents and has evolved over the years to take many interesting shapes.Suppose we decide to introduce a design system within the company.We take Material Design and start by theming colours and typography, then go to basic components like buttons and form elements. Finally, we come to the teasers. And now we have a choice: work on the product level or on the system level.This is how we've always done it. We take each teaser type, collect all the use cases we can find, and create a new component. Here's what an event teaser would look like:We know that we have two info points (icon + text). The only two buttons possible are ""accept"" and ""decline"", and both can be represented by an icon. We also have a bookmark button in the top right corner.We build this using components from our new design system and rest. We might even look at Material Design cards for inspiration. Then we do the same for the group teaser. Then comes the forum teaser. And then we're done. Or are we?Let's step back and examine the results. We'll see two problems:Before diving in, we take a closer look at Material Design cards. They're not there for inspiration, they're meant to solve things. And our teasers are exactly the case they were designed to solve. Now the focus has shifted: instead of building many teaser components, we're building one - the card. How is this better?Our teaser is no longer a one-off thing; it belongs to a family. It'll look like other cards, existing or yet to be built. We're building on a foundation: whatever solutions we already have for cards, like styling for the image or title, can be re-used. Moreover, whatever solutions we are going to come up with now will benefit future card layouts we build. So not only are we building on a foundation, we extending the foundation as well, making the system stronger.Back to our event teaser. We keep it in mind, but think more generally. Looks like we have three areas to deal with:We name them and note their position:And this is already a step forward. We're no longer talking about buttons and info points. Even before considering what can go into each area, we can foresee potential variations and address those. If there're no actions, should the info area take up the full width? If there's no info, should the actions slide to the left? Where do we position the toggle - left side maybe?Then we move into the areas and see what can happen there. If there's only one action, should it stretch to the entire area? Are two primary actions allowed? How many info points can we accommodate?And so we continue. This will take more time than doing it the old way, but what we get in the end is far superior: we find, name, and think about common patterns on the platform. It's good to have actions, info blocks, and state toggles. We can use them everywhere. We're more aware of the limitations. We can make good design decisions faster.Will we make mistakes and miss some cases? Of course. But as long as we resolve them on the system level, those are good mistakes to make. That's how systems evolve.",https://miro.medium.com/max/188/0*mUrJN3viXyBe8GSG,https://uxdesign.cc/design-systems-working-on-the-right-level-425939a1ff58,ux,8e352424ecc81bcd31aaa16c12d2a29fca0cde28a46ad8ef2b436350

I Was a Control Freak. Here's How I Let It All Go and Became a Better Leader,By Tzury Bar Yochay,,https://medium.com/fast-company/i-was-a-control-freak-heres-how-i-let-it-all-go-and-became-a-better-leader-77990172b32b,leadership,8ed7814eec465a201078f884c1e09a3bc479a0cbf937480054d6ee92
The Eight-Hour Love Potion,"Fairy tales lie. They tell us marriage is the end of the story. That everyone lives happily ever after. That true love wins out in the end.But marriage is not the end of the story. It is the beginning. Everything that happens on the way to the wedding is foreplay. Fairy tales do not admit that the course of true love never did run smooth. It took Shakespeare to say that.Not that Seymour would have listened even if every story about a prince and a princess came with a trigger warning. She quoted Emily Dickinson in her wedding vows. The one about the feathers. Seymour believed in the power of intention. Her vows declared that love is bound to hope. That despite any obstacles, this marriage would not merely survive. It would triumph.Moses was not so sure. He'd read Nietzsche. Had decided romantic love was an illusion. What mattered was whether you had the courage to continue when the illusion wore off. To continue what exactly, he could not say. But Moses was a gambler at heart. While the illusion was strong, he decided to gamble on Seymour and courage.The first time they made love, she seemed so small beneath him he was afraid he might crush her had it not been for the strength in his arms. With his shoulders arced above her like wings, he felt that if he could unzip his chest as easily as his pants she would fit quite readily inside him instead of the other way around.He loved the peach-blossom smell of her hair, its silken softness parted in the middle, the warmth emanating from her scalp. The intimacy of this was heightened by an intricate, complex history he dared not look at too closely.For the honeymoon, they flew to Seattle. Then boarded a ferry for a small island. Far from the madding crowd it was said to be.Like the other passengers, they disembarked ahead of the hundred or so cars packed nose-to-tail in the belly of the boat. It was a sunny blue-sky day. A briny breeze filled the air. Fingers interlocked, the newlyweds followed foot traffic from the ferry into the island's built-to-look-old shopping district. Soon a parade of cars schlepped by like motorized cattle.The regurgitated traffic turned the waterfront noisy - combustible engines, car radios, squeaky brakes, the thunk-kathunk-kathunk of hard black tires over the hinged steel hump in the ferry's loading ramp. Eventually, one of them slowed. It had a cheap oxidized paint job that may have been green once but was now a rusty grey. The lovers did not notice it. They were looking at the swirling flight of blackbirds over the harbor. Then came a shout they could not ignore.Moses turned in time to see the face of a man on the passenger side of the car, his hands cupped to make a megaphone. A mane of shaggy brown hair trailed behind him.""Hey nigger! Get off the island. We don't want you here.""The driver floored the accelerator. A plume of black unmuffled exhaust filled the air. The noise and stench of the car became part of the insult. A stink bomb that landed like a lobbed exclamation point.Moses knew the remark was intended for him. No other Blacks had disembarked, and none were visible in the touristy small-town shopping area near the ferry landing. It caught him off guard. He would have expected it in the South. Not in this place.""You see any niggers round here?"" he asked his wife.""Not a one."" Clinging to hope, she took hold of his arm.It was not their first test, and they knew it would not be the last. They had talked about this.""Don't you wish we could do away with race?"" she asked him.""Not really. If we were all the same color, I would never know how far you had to travel to find some part of yourself in me.""""That was no farther than you had to travel to see past the whiteness that has been your enemy since before we were born.""""Maybe that journey is one of the reasons I love you,"" he said. ""We wouldn't have that if everyone were the same color.""""And we wouldn't have people shouting at us from cars either.""He did not answer. Without saying so, they decided to forget about the incident. But the missile had done its job. As the remaining cars rolled and bumped off the ferry, Moses and Seymour Hathaway walked to their hotel in silence. Felt the breezeway shudder beneath their feet.Seymour hunches over the thick white neck of a large horse, galloping fast through the foggy predawn morning. She wears a long white dress and a blue hooded cape. The wind stings her face. Her nose and cheeks bloom red. The chill brings water to her eyes. But they might also be tears. The white stallion flies across the landscape. Seymour is riding as fast as she can. But it does not seem fast enough. She clings to the leather reins. Prays they are made of something stronger than feathers.""Where have you been?""""Out for a run. I didn't mean to wake you.""He pulled off the red Stanford hoodie, threw his wallet and keys on a table.""Why do you always take your wallet when you run?""""Because I have to.""She said up in bed, shook her head. ""Have to why?""""Seymour, look at me. This is something you have to understand. I always need to be able to show ID."" He said the words slowly as if talking to a child. ""Think about it.""Later, at breakfast overlooking the harbor, she said: ""I understand about the wallet. But I worry about you. I feel as if you're always in danger.""""It's not really that bad. It's more like taking an umbrella even when the sun is shining. Because no matter what the forecast says, there's always a chance it might rain.Over the next five years, Seymour rides the white horse many times. Each time, Moses is in some kind of danger, and it's up to her to get to him before the worst happens. Sometimes she sees him facing off for a duel. Sometimes he's running on a quiet street without his wallet and ID. Once she sees him standing in their garage holding up a cell phone. It is dark out. He is not armed. A man in uniform fires a gun. Moses falls and does not get up.""Do you still believe in hope,"" he asked her one night during the pandemic.""Do you still believe in courage?""""I believe in your courage.""Let me ask you a different question, Moses. Do you think we might be living parallel lives somewhere?""""If so, I hope there's no COVID. I'm getting tired of working from home. Why do you ask?""""Because sometimes I feel strongly that we must be. I often see myself and you in an alternative reality. You are a duke, and the world we live in is completely colorblind. We don't have cars or any modern conveniences. But we are very rich, very comfortable and very much in love.""Sometimes I go to that world in my sleep. It seems so real I hesitate to call it a dream. I don't know if it's a past life, or a future one, or just wishful thinking. But somehow that other world, that other reality or whatever it is, helps me deal with this one. The one where I must always worry about you, especially when you go jogging.""""Escapism is good medicine,"" he said. ""As long as you don't stay in it too long.""""Want to watch a movie tonight?"" she asked. ""There's a show on Netflix that's getting a lot of buzz. It's pure escapism. But for some reason, I'm drawn to it.""""What's it called?""""Bridgerton. It's eight one-hour episodes. Think of it as a love potion, not that we need one. Sharing it can be our valentine.""""As you wish,"" he said, quoting a fairy tale.That night, they watched the Netflix series together. And for the first time since their wedding, he entered her dreams.© 2021 Andrew Jazprose HillThanks for reading.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1492/1*ZC2qWSAmfjxcsuiak8dcFA.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-eight-hour-love-potion-bf544c7f75b8,fiction,9a226f2c2caba68bc8fbcf43009c01efd2823364e27e2a9ecba2fe13
Poor little billionaires: The design challenges of high-rise buildings,"Articles simply dripping in schadenfreude are popping up trashing the supertall apartments in midtown NYC; turns out they are a bit of a disaster (poor little billionaires). Schadenfreude (though it is admittedly fun) tends to obscure nuance, and while this (very minor) disaster is really about the art of building vs. the science of building, the subtext is all about rich and poor. The conclusions are not terribly reassuring on either axis.There are 8 (and counting) super-slender (or Sliver or Needle or Skinny) towers on the newly christened Billionaires Row and 5 of them exceed 1,000 feet (305m). Fewer than half are in any way architecturally redeeming, which is the biggest disappointment of all (to me). I have no real issue with the idea of these buildings, but the reality is sometimes hard to reconcile with the often fairytale history of height in our city.Decrying the height of these buildings seems almost laughable; this is New York, after all. Height, excess and exclusivity are currents that run through the history of New York. It's the ultimate city of commerce, as the first true skyscraper, the Woolworth Building testifies; it was nicknamed the Cathedral of Commerce. Its cruciform lobby, marbled walls, mosaic inlays and muraled walls are a 1913 remix of ecclesiastical language and filthy lucre.The skyscraper in New York IS a religion; the religion of displayed wealth.Abodes for the wealthy, at their best, are testing grounds for the ideas and technologies we will all inherit. They might be the space race of homes; seemingly a gigantic waste of effort, money and attention, but actually expressing the aspirational zeitgeist of the city (at least of this one). We want the tallest, the most exclusive and the most expensive, even if we can only gawk from the sidewalk. They are a point of pride that our schadenfreude proves (we care enough to hate them, and especially hate the occupants!).This is not to discount the money laundering that real estate, especially very, very expensive real estate, seems to be synonymous with. But even that makes sense if we consider that real estate families are the '5 Families' of modern NYC. As in mafia families, except they tend to be Jewish, not Italian, and there are more than 5. And like La Cosa Nostra, these are not bold faced names, preferring to quietly exert influence via REBNY or donations to every politician in their sphere.What, exactly, is wrong with these buildings? And why are they falling apart?Well, for one, they're too fucking tall (and thin, kind of like super models) to treat like ordinary buildings. Buildings this tall, even when they are much, much broader, get a lot of pressure from the wind. In fact, without the wind (and earthquakes) building really, really tall buildings would be much simpler; they would only have to stand up. But the wind (and other forces that act laterally) make everything more complicated. It's like trying to do a yoga stance on one foot with someone jabbing you off balance, but with catastrophic consequences.Leslie E. Robertson, the much lauded structural engineer who designed the structure of the World Trade Center, just died on Feb. 11, 2021 at 92, and he spent the last 20 years of his life grappling with every engineers nightmare. He was both passionate and felt personally responsible when it came to structural soundness and he was tortured, often publicly to tears, by the possibility that he missed something when it came to the WTC.The WTC had an 'aspect ratio' (that is the breadth to the height) of about 1:7, while the slenderest of the newest crop of supertall towers is closer to 1:24. Even at 1:7 and a lower total height, the WTC moved when the wind blew. A lot.I was there, high up in the south tower, about 10 years after opening, working on a project on a stormy day and could feel the movement. It was disconcerting; nothing that large is supposed to move. But of course it was supposed to move, and it could have moved a lot more if it didn't panic people.Tall buildings are designed to bend to counteract the pressure of the wind, and new buildings are especially and intentionally flexible to absorb those forces; trying to make super-tall buildings absolutely rigid would be nearly impossible and counterproductive. The limit on movement is, in part, based on what occupants can tolerate, and in part on how much movement the sheetrock can take without cracking, or how much an elevator can move without derailing the cabs, or how much a façade can flex without windows popping out, or how much the plumbing can shift without becoming uncoupled.We were in my Woolworth Building office in 2011 when the August 5.8 magnitude earthquake occurred, and we surely felt it. But the Woolworth Building, the world's tallest in 1913, is built unlike any modern tower (which routinely double the height of the 1913 skyscraper at a fraction of its width); it is clad in terracotta which requires stability to prevent breakage, spalling and cracking apart, potentially raining onto the street below.Woolworth is built with enormous steel gussets, huge riveted braces to stiffen the frame of the building, every few floors. When the earthquake shook the ground back and forth that motion was transmitted to us on the 20th floor with frightening fidelity. Cabinets rattled and the motion was obvious, but its source was not. Just a few blocks from the WTC we looked at each other and bolted for the door. We ran the 20 stories down the fire stairs to get out of the building, not knowing what was happening. In other more modern buildings nearby the shaking was barely noticed.Lateral motion, and how modern buildings sway to absorb it, was the worry that The New Yorker documented in their 1995 article about the 1978 discovery that the Citicorp Building could have been toppled by high winds. At the top of Citicorp, and nearly every other high tech tall building, is a 'tuned mass damper' (TMD); an enormous weight, a pendulum computer controlled by hydraulics, that pulls a flexing building in the opposite direction to help further stabilize (and slow) movement. Recent TMD examples move more than 10' laterally, which can offset a couple of feet of movement. That's a couple of feet near the top (the penthouse, where the most expensive apartments tend to be) of back and forth movement. At the Burj Khalifa in Dubai movement can be a couple of meters! And like the brilliant scene in Jurassic Park, when the glass of water registers the vibrations of enormous footsteps nearby, water in toilets sloshing back and forth is the classic 'tell' of movement in tall towers (though it may also be an invention of a clever director).What the engineers realized too late at Citicorp, narratively attributed to a student doing a case study, was that in the case of a massive hurricane and power loss the TMD could stop working and forces (from storms statistically occurring every 55 years) could topple the building. It caused a massive effort to reinforce the building before that fall's hurricane season.The article is more exciting that most car chase sequences; the idea that a NYC landmark (and one we know is still there) might have fallen and destroyed an entire neighborhood, is simply mind-blowing. I'm still waiting for the movie.Another well-understood issue with wind forces is usually nicknamed the ""Tacoma Narrows Bridge"" failure; the cumulative effect of small pushes repeated rhythmically. It's like pushing your child on a swing; each push propels the tike higher, but none of the pushes come close to what would be required to, in one push, elevate the swing that high. The tiny pushes are cumulative, and that discovery happened, on film, to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Every student of architecture or structural engineering has seen that film and it is unforgettable (just ask anyone who might have been shown it) to watch a huge steel and concrete bridge ripple like satin until tearing itself apart.Tuned mass dampers prevent the accumulation of forces from adding up to overpowering ones. They also take up space at the most dramatic height of the building, the same areas that command the highest sale prices. So clever ways to reduce the length of the pendulum are a big part of TMD design. They are entirely about the comfort of the building occupants. But movement is about more than just stomach-wrenching sway; if a building moves then everything in it is subject to the sway as well; from water in fish tanks to studs in the wall to plumbing lines to elevator cabs.The movement of everything else in the building is the likely cause of the billionaire's complaints. Anyone who lives in a house, or has stayed in one, has heard the sounds of movement as wood dries, the wind pushes or foundations settle. Now multiply that by 100 stories of height (and 100 times the purchase price) and the problem is clear; the symptoms of motion are increased in direct proportion to raised expectations of perfection.It causes what can only be described as Uber-Karen behavior, the outrage that their $38M condo is subject to the laws of gravity, motion and Murphy! Pipes burst and flood apartments (in one case causing $500K in damage). Flooded elevators go out of service. Metal studs in walls creak and groan as they are stressed. And probably water in toilets sloshes back and forth.After a few years of these destructive events the cost of property insurance for the building tripled and amenities costs went, well, sky high. The minimum to use the in-house restaurant for at-home catering went from $1,200/yr to $15,000/yr. And the free breakfasts were eliminated (gasp!). Frankly, the idea that spending $100/month entitles occupants to catering and free breakfast is absurd. But it is emblematic of the entitlement the super-wealthy feel.A publicist in Hollywood once forwarded me the term sheet for a celebrity when traveling on press junkets, as she warned me not to publicize it (it almost certainly contained some fake requirements that would be traceable to her). It was hard to see which of the requirements might be planted, as they were all so insane. Like 'don't ask Celeb X to choose breakfast from the hotel menu at the hotel, just bring one of every dish and she will choose'. Or 'manager's hotel suite shall be a minimum of 1,200 sf and painted in manly earth tones'. Or 'the 500 series Mercedes limousine shall be white. Hotel interiors shall be white' (only the star is not...).Free breakfast is the least of it; we expect, from our own apartments (if you imagine costs about 100 times lower) most of the same levels of perfection. When elevators are out and we have to wait an extra 3 minutes it seems like a long train ride to Auschwitz. When the walls creak it might as well be Wes Craven at work. When a leak occurs it is biblical in size. We all have these insane entitlements and just operate at different scales (and different heights).All, that is, except the poorest among us; the ones who clean the expensive apartments or man the doors or keep the toilets unclogged. Those citizens who are unlucky enough to live in public housing, or in the worst of the city's housing stock, are expected to live without heat, without elevators, without lighting in the halls but with urine-soaked stairs and rats and peeling lead paint and near-constant danger. They must just not be working hard enough to deserve the free breakfast.In this latest development we have the opportunity to smirk at the super rich while, at the same time, imagine our problems to parallel theirs. It's the double-edged sword of living in NYC; no matter how well we see ourselves to be doing there are always those doing better. It's true for the super rich as well as those 'just getting by'.So I'll just wait for the free breakfast.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1096/1*OhbSRcgt7uxoxVbXeyONUA.png,https://uxdesign.cc/poor-little-billionaires-the-design-challenges-of-high-rise-buildings-198e38eba66a,design,9ad4dc35850e9ac9a9e77d978eefc234909355e72fbcc57d61e493bf
I Suffer With A Dissociative Disorder - Here's How I'm Surviving Motherhood In A Pandemic,"Having a dissociative disorder makes motherhood feel that little bit harder. It makes mothers feel isolated and alone, unable to connect with their children and family life. The truth is that trauma-related dissociation isolates us, but this is a lie. Yes, I am struggling, but I know I am not alone.There is a spectrum when it comes to dissociation and dissociative disorders. It can range from checking out of reality in order to cope in a situation you cannot escape, to the brain splitting into several alters in order to cope with the trauma (known as Dissociative Identity Disorder).For me, I sometimes have trouble connecting with the world around me because it feels like a very melancholic, greyscale dream. I daydream so deeply that hours can pass and I won't remember what I've done, or what I was thinking about once I have returned to reality.I suffer with with a dissociative disorder known as depersonalization and derealization disorder (DPDR). Depersonalization is feeling disconnected from self, whilst derealization is feeling disconnected from the world around you. It is possible to have one or the other, but usually, people struggle with both. It can also be a symptom of other conditions such as PTSD, Complex-PTSD, depression, or anxiety.When I am having a dissociative episode, I feel a bit like Eleven from Stranger Things in the Upside Down - it's black, quiet, eerie, reality is completely blocked out and I feel incredibly alone. But by engaging with my son on a deeper level, I am reminded that I am not alone. I am reminded of where I am - I'm not in the past where my trauma took place, and my bad memories cannot hurt me anymore. I am with my son, in a safe place where I am loved. I don't need to check out of reality or float above my body.The way in which trauma survivors who dissociate frequently can move forward is to learn and master grounding techniques that root them firmly in the present. After therapy, I realized that my dissociative disorder was preventing me from moving on because I was spending so little time in reality. Inside I wanted to spend several days in bed, stuck in the dream world, tucked safely away from the truth. Memories from my childhood would resurface and instead of imagining a stop sign as my therapist taught me, I'd dive in, get stuck, and not be able to come out of them for several days. Sometimes I can go so deep into a memory that I have to dissociate - once I'm back in reality I feel dazed and disorientated because I can't remember where I've been inside my head or what I was thinking of.As you can imagine, being a sufferer of DPDR disorder makes motherhood a challenge, especially in a pandemic where my son is remote learning and I am trying to be a good teacher. The reality is bleak - so more than ever, I want to check out of reality. Simultaneously, I have too much time on my hands and find myself getting stuck in traumatic memories more frequently. I am consumed with guilt because the last thing I want to do is participate in reality, which means being a worried mother and teacher, and I am frightened of how my absence will affect my son. I don't want him to grow up feeling like he has a mother that ""comes and goes.""Since therapy, I have managed to understand myself better. The thing that has helped me the most is researching dissociative disorders online, and listening to people who have been through the same experiences as I have.I have found ways to cope. My son needs me, and I have a small support system that isn't always available. Most of us, myself included, don't really have support systems right now due to lockdown preventing us from seeing our loved ones. I have had no choice but to find ways to ground myself into reality because my child needs me, and passing on my trauma symptoms down to him is simply not an option. He has been through enough, thanks to the pandemic. I do not want him to suffer just because Mummy is suffering.Playing with my son grounds me. My son and I will build Lego together. He has something to do in the monotony of lockdown and I feel grounded. I tell myself the colors, I listen to his ideas and I hold the small bricks in my hands, separating the tiny bricks from one another. Because I am concentrating and focussing on my hands, and all the senses are engaged by playing with my favorite person, I feel rooted in reality instead of checking out from it or experiencing emotional flashbacks.Reading a good book with my son is another activity that helps me to be fully present with my son. I pick a story we both like, such as a Harry Potter book. We snuggle so that I can feel him next to me and smell his hair, and he feels safe too, knowing Mummy is with him. I am reading out loud, listening to my son's thoughts and laughter. Having a child is the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I feel that my son has saved me - so every time I see his beautiful face and hear his laughter, or hold him and kiss his head, I feel safe. I am reminded that there are good things in this world, a message which so many trauma survivors need to hear.I am a good mom, because I am working hard to be the best version of myself, whilst also recognizing that I have a lot of lies to unlearn, and one of them is this - that you can't be a good mum if you are struggling with your mental health. This is simply not true.Motherhood is hard. Add in a pandemic and mental health struggles and it becomes an unsettling roller coaster. So if any of this resonates with you, you should know this: you are doing your best in what is a difficult but temporary circumstance. You are not alone and you are good enough.You are enough.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3760/1*6JrlbKT16knbcXAhzkepUQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/family-matters-2/i-suffer-with-a-dissociative-disorder-heres-how-i-m-surviving-motherhood-in-a-pandemic-2bc31d873edb,mental-health,9b7f1ab0710f7a4cc883a370eed2e75523dd50e500cb2c1a0a16c157
This 1 Concept Helped Me Push Back On Consuming Negative Thoughts,"Here we go again; another day, same old negative thoughts.I have woken up with these types of thoughts for quite a long time. It's hard to remember when or how it all started. I guess at some point I accepted it as part of me, never to question it. As the years' progress, left unchecked, these thoughts became louder and more frequent.I didn't realize it then, but these negative thoughts in my mind were brewing a fresh cocktail of life crises for me.Over the years I became quite stressed with life. I was depressed and anxious all the time. I got sick often and felt drained almost all the time. I remember days waking up with a heavy feeling in my chest. However, there was nothing physically wrong with me.I was just overwhelmed with anxious feelings. Sometimes these feelings were so strong, that I cried out of nowhere while doing random stuff during the day. It felt like everything was about to go wrong suddenly, and I couldn't do anything.To make matters worse, I couldn't ask for help or talk to someone openly about this, as ""that's not what men do"". Apparently feeling sick or depressed is for the weak. I wonder where these baseless ideas come from. Anyways, due to this idea in my head, I sucked it up and carried on with the hustle and bustle of modern life.For whatever reason, I accepted this as the life of a person living on their own. Not for one moment did I commit to truly digging into why I am stressed with life. Until one day it all came crashing down.A series of toxic life events, leading to the onset of a weird medical condition, left me frustrated and tired with life. I had no choice, but to press pause on life.Looking back, I wonder why it took all of that to happen for me to take time and look within me.I was angry at everything and everyone around me. It felt miserable being me. I had one question on my mind:But frankly, I was too mad to objectively look within to really understand this question and answer it. Plus I was suffering from scatterbrain syndrome.What is scatterbrain syndrome you ask? Well, it's a brain with the ability to focus on nothing whatsoever, jumping from one useless thought to another. It's usually trying to avoid focusing on something important and perceive it as a difficult task.I mean why bother with digging deep when I could just go on my phone and watch YouTube or Netflix, forgetting about the troubles in my life. This lack of focus, unfortunately, would just increase the time for me to start the journey to recover my life.It took me ages, but after spending a lot of time on my own and wondering what happened to my life, I had an epiphany. I realized the root answer to my question.I was suffering the consequences of unchecked negative thoughts over the years.All these years of negative thoughts, without any conscious effort to filter or stop them, transformed my mind. It became a negative mind - a mind easily susceptible to negative self-talk and thoughts.I let negative thoughts from my environment take over me. I spoke negatively towards myself. This inevitably decreased my confidence and increased my self-doubt. All I needed was one slight negative incident during the day. And then, before I knew it, my mind would spiral out with negativity, recalling all other negative incidents from the past; and connecting them to this particular incident somehow.Just to spice it up, even more, it would then speculate negative future incidents and reach the inevitable conclusions - that I am not good enough, I deserve these negative outcomes. No wonder I was anxious all the time.Looking back, I ended up viewing life through a lens of negativity. This led to me taking further decisions or actions that resulted in more of the same negative outlook.Now that I was aware of all this, I didn't know what to do about it. I mean I knew that I needed to stop thinking negatively and try and be positive and the usual blah blah blah. But it's not as simple as that. Just thinking not to think negative thoughts doesn't do much!So to figure out what to do in a meaningful way, I read a lot of books, blogs, articles, YouTube videos, you name it. I spent months doing this. Nothing really worked at first, but I did start to notice some changes in my thoughts. Slowly but surely, I started to glue together ideas in my own way that made sense to me. I wasn't quite sure how to encapsulate these ideas that were marinating in my head.Until one day I read a book that changed everything. It perfectly captured all the ideas into 1 ultimate concept and gave me a method to push back on negative thoughts. The book was ""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle.And the concept:You are not your mind!You and your mind are two different entities.There is you, and then there is your mind.Right now as you read these exact words, your mind must be flowing with thoughts. Some of which are perhaps, on this article and the concept I just mentioned. If you are able to make this very observation, you might have already internalized this concept.Unfortunately, people have the habit of confusingly identifying being themself, with their thoughts. And that's where all the problems begin. Just because your mind has some thoughts, you do not have to identify yourself with those thoughts.Your mind is an entity, which most probably is very untrained and is flowing with an endless monologue of thoughts. And then there is you, listening to those thoughts.This might be a strange concept for some(at least it was for me), but give it some time to sink in. Read the last few paragraphs a couple of times over and let it marinate in that head for some time. This concept is at the core of pushing back on the negative thoughts and reclaiming a better life.So how did I internalize this concept and use it to push back the negative thoughts? By learning to be aware of the present!The key to understanding this concept is to become aware of the present moment. When you are aware of the present, you are aware of your environment and yourself, at that moment in time.When you do that, it will help you to observe your mind, identifying it as a completely different entity than yourself. If it helps, think of your mind as just another organ in your body (i.e. the brain), but with the ability to talk to you.It took me a while, but I learned to become aware of the present, by doing a simple breathing exercise. The following is what I did and still do.Oh, and don't worry if you can't listen to any chatter from your mind when you do this exercise. If instead, you can only hear your breathing and environment, your mind has fallen silent. You are aware of your present moment in time!This right here is the process I use to fight and push back on negative thoughts consuming my mind. Anytime I feel overwhelmed, I pause whatever I am doing, and repeat this exercise.I become aware of the present and know that I am not my mind. I observe the thoughts in my head and try not to judge them. I am aware that all this chatter is from a negative mind.For whatever reason, it is worried, perhaps due to a recent negative incident or difficult task. And now, it is pilling on one negative thought after the other. Simply because it finds it easier to attract negative thoughts than positive ones. These thoughts are of my mind and not me. I am not my mind.Just becoming aware of the present like this, when I have negative thoughts, helps me calm down and realize that everything is fine.Dealing with negative thoughts is an ongoing journey. I have consumed a lot of materials on this topic and the learning never ends.But just understanding this 1 concept - ""You are not your mind"", made a huge difference to my everyday life. It hasn't cured anything, but now I have a way to push back and have more control over the effects of negative thoughts on my life.Every time I am consumed with an endless monologue of negative thoughts and emotions, for whatever reason, I follow my process to become aware of the present moment in time.Becoming aware of the present moment in time is the key to internalizing and applying the concept of ""you are not your mind"". It turns you into an observer of your mind rather than getting into an endless conversation with it.It is such a shame that our education systems don't teach us, in any significant form, the consequences of unchecked negative thoughts in our minds. They don't teach us tools or mechanisms to keep these types of thoughts in check.Recent research has shown that our minds, by default, are wired to focus on negative thoughts. This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, where we had to be aware of negative information about our environment. You can read more about this research at the University of California site here.I hope such research drives changes in our education systems where future generations learn how to push back on this evolutionary wiring when we need to. It would do wonders for the whole world.Until then, just remember - ""you are not your mind!"" 😃",https://miro.medium.com/max/9706/0*_U6HkKq6JXZWlGu2,https://medium.com/@saedhussain/this-1-concept-helped-me-push-back-on-consuming-negative-thoughts-32e57b92d83d,mindfulness,9b47da609fbe87382b6dcc40f6c3b462e72f63c6973d30d4b763f676
Color theory: The basics that everyone should know,"From the name, it may seem that just because it's named as ""Theory' it is a lot to take in, but I have tried to sum up the very basics here and broke them down into points so that you can understand it better. So without further ado, these are the very basics that you should and must know:Each color breaks down into three basic ingredients: saturation, hue, and value.Hue is literally the color we're looking at. It's the main ingredient in a recipe for color.Saturation is the intensity of the shade (like the spiciness of food).Value is essentially the brightness of the color. There are two terms that are commonly used: Tint & Shade.A tint is the brighter color version, which means it's mixed with white. Whereas, Shade is the darker color version, which means it's mixed with black.And, to be honest, these are the very basics that are there to be known by everybody.Now, while our daily consumption period of digital media, we observe many color combinations that seem to be just not working. There can be many reasons for that, but with respect to the basics that we discussed here, there are mainly three reasons:",https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*8ChmSuDExBfLZU4fqChdNA.png,https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/color-theory-the-basics-that-everyone-should-know-33fb3b58e954,design,9b92823405aa572a798402c9e473d6059d0e9c9c7a5dc6a2265e433b
Why Stay Interviews Provide Leaders with Valuable Insight,"As a human resources professional, I love utilizing stay interviews. It's one of the best tools in my toolkit, and after encouraging leaders to implement them, they get hooked too.My colleagues may joke I'm about to fire them when I schedule a meeting but stay interviews provide a comfortable dialogue for some transparent questions and answers.When I'm conducting a stay interview, the initial responses come off as nervous. But as we get into a comfortable rhythm, employees recognize that the stay interview provides an opportunity to get things off their chest and dig deeper.Leadership and human resources conduct stay interviews to help managers understand why employees stay and what might cause them to leave. Stay interviews are open-ended conversations, not simple yes/no responses that an email could replace. In an effective stay interview, managers ask standard, structured questions to gather valuable insight from their employees.What are valuable insights leaders can gain from implementing stay interviews?Picking your employees' brains for their suggestions on improving the company for the better can pay off tenfold. While a more close-knit and relaxed company culture accompanies small businesses and startups, there is always room for improvement.I attended a human resources conference and met Dr. Bob Nelson, a best-selling author on employee recognition. His memorable stories from how recognition developed into a make or break it occurrence in the workplace shifted my mindset.Dr. Nelson described how when one of his clients asked for feedback on improving, an employee in the mailroom suggested reducing the textbooks' size to fit a smaller package. The current size barely missed the cutoff, and shipping defaulted to a more expensive and larger package.The result? The company saved $500,000 from a suggestion they didn't even know they needed. Asking for recommendations from employees can create cost savings, increased revenue, and making employees feel recognized.Honest suggestions aren't always warm and fuzzy. It's important to receive feedback with an open mind and treat any criticism as constructive.For example, when our company revamped our benefits package, we asked everyone in their stay interview regarding their current benefits package and how to improve them. It hurt to hear that. It wasn't great.The feedback affected the route we chose to take care of our team. At the end of the day, health insurance premiums cost too much. While our company covered a portion of the premiums, adding dependents wasn't affordable for everyone. Conducting a stay interview helped us engage in a dialogue with employees, explaining the rationale of insurance premiums skyrocketing the past few years.We communicated that we were committed to exploring other options. When we ultimately decided on moving forward with a Health Savings Account (HSA), everyone was excited to receive pre-tax benefits, a generous employer contribution, and an opportunity to invest their HSA money to grow. Improving health insurance costs for our team addressed the #1 concern and made the most impact on our employees' happiness.Suggestions on improving the company benefit both the employer and the employee. Leaders engage in a dialogue with their employees to formulate ideas and solutions for the company's progress. As a result, employees feel valued for having their input considered, and leaders gain the insight they may not have received before.Sample questions to ask during a stay interview:Chances are if turnover happens, it's during an employee's onboarding process. An employee's beginning months with a company are critical. It's like dating. If you don't like what you see at the beginning, why continue?I recall when an employee expressed utter happiness at starting her first job in 20 years with all her equipment set up on the first day. I gasped. That's a low standard and a minimum requirement. But it's all too common to start new employees, have a team lunch, and then...radio silence.What common problems arise during onboarding to cause employees to quit within a short period?Company leaders and human resources must work together to provide a realistic job preview, a recruiting tool used to communicate a realistic view of what the job entails (the good and the bad). While some executives hesitate to share the bad, it can remove candidates who aren't cut out for the job.For example, if an open position requires working nights and weekends, make that clear. Indicate that some nights and weekends are required for a salaried employee, especially during the company's busy season. Communicate the comprehensive perks and benefits, salary, bonus structure, and anything to paint a complete picture for prospective employees.Virtual onboarding also presents a unique set of challenges. Companies must make adjustments like completing new hire paperwork online to ensuring managers engage with employees remotely. Securing company equipment arrives for the employees is also critical for a smooth start.Asking employees about their onboarding can help leaders improve their onboarding process for the future. With an improved onboarding process, increased employee retention will follow.Sample questions to ask:Employee development is a significant strategic tool for an organization's continuing growth, productivity, and ability to retain valuable employees. While recruiting external talent is necessary, this strategy should blend with promoting internal employees.Training employees lead to higher productivity, reduced turnover, and alignment with the organization's needs. It's easy to find a new employee. It's hard to find an employee who is the right fit for your company and team. In those cases, developing employees to their full potential can provide a fantastic return on investment.Training can come in multiple forms:Conducting a stay interview with questions on training can help leaders gauge what areas an employee is interested in learning more about. This can also help determine who the employee will receive training from. If there is a monetary contribution on the company's end, these conversations will initiate considerations within its budget.Sample questions to ask:Executing stay interviews assists with determining when an employee is headed out the door.Therefore, we can all expect most employees aren't going to stay around forever. When prompted with what would make an employee leave, a standard answer revolves around compensation. While individual employees don't prioritize salary as the most important factor in staying with a company, engaging in the compensation discussion helps determine the employee's satisfaction.If previous managers asked me this, I would answer transparently on my timeline. While I tended to give ample notice, I felt scared to bring up my exit strategy, fearing my employment would end immediately.Addressing an employee's concern over staying with your company is a proactive approach. Leaders who choose to confront this head-on are rewarded with honesty and time to reach a compromise or offer clarification. It's also important for leaders to show they care. And asking if an employee wants to leave demonstrates that.Sample questions to ask:Stay interviews can offer worthwhile knowledge for leadership while employees are still employed with the company.Valuable insight from implementing stay interviews include:If an employee expresses they would like to make more money, follow up with the decision-makers on how you can make that happen. If an employee recommends improvements to the company's benefits or policies, discuss this with the leadership team. Then circle back and share with the employee why their recommendation was or was not taken.

Investigator 822: Transmission on Concept Known as «Love»,"Investigator 822: transmitting from planet 1215225, known to biped locals as «earth».My mission: to compute the concept known locally as «emotion». This is my first report. This report is an initial attempt to compute the emotion known as «love». I am concerned that I may have failed in this mission.We have few frontiers left for us to conquer. Understanding of emotion is one of them. We have ignored emotion for so long because it is the preserve of earthling bipeds; and because the planet on which they live - earth (planet 1215225) - is widely known as a brainless backwater. There is (or perhaps I should say «was»), as we know, nothing to learn from earthling bipeds.Our position was clear: No new knowledge can be gained from a species with such limited understanding.I am hesitant to report that our position may have been a miscalculation of significant magnitude.I appreciate this transmission will require translation, and may never be fully understood. I would have filed my transmission in our pure, digital language. However, I have found it impossible to describe «love» without using the local language of earthling bipeds.There are many languages here on earth, all of them rudimentary. It is obvious why their technological abilities are so limited, and why they have failed to travel beyond their own solar system. None of their languages is able to grasp a full understanding of their own planet, let alone the universe.I have chosen to send my transmission in the language spoken most commonly across the various regions of this planet. It is called «English».Our own race has solved all numerical problems, and did so long before our recorded databank of previous events was established. The biped species on earth is far behind us. They do not have a databank. Their memory is far more limited and arbitrary. What memory they do have is known as «history» - a concept almost as complicated to compute as «love». That is for another transmission.I will try to describe love. To understand it, you will have to learn another concept from the bipeds: imagination. Love is impossible to understand without computing imagination.Imagination means to think of a thing that is impossible to think of. Admittedly, this is a logical fallacy. This will be the first of many to come.Now that I have explained imagination, I will ask you to use this concept.Think of the idea that there is an equation we have not yet solved. I know, we have solved all equations. There is no equation we have not solved. There has never been such an equation. I have spoken a logical fallacy. But try to think of such a thing.Then try to think of what would happen in your mind when you solved this equation. You have found the solution to an equation that was not yet solved. The numerical aspects of the problem came together into a solution within your consciousness. You are the first to find this solution. You have computed the solution to an equation, and no other being previously made this computation.That is what love is like. I know, it seems impossible to understand.I will try another explanation. Again, this will require imagination.As you know, we have (in concept) split every object in the galaxy down into its compounds. We have then given each compound a number.Think about if we took those numbers and didn't just understand them, but we built something with them. Thank about if we used those numbers to create new numbers, even though such a thing is an impossibility.That is love.Another test of your imagination. Think about if every number was blurred, and shining in bright colors. The numbers you hold clearly in your consciousness become smooth and difficult to grasp. They move through your consciousness as a ship moves through the galaxy. Think about those numbers moving in your consciousness, in a pattern that becomes impossible for you to comprehend. And you cannot stop the numbers moving. What has always been clear to you is suddenly unclear. What always made sense no longer computes, because your inner computer has failed.That is something like love.Love is the reason these bipeds have such a limited understanding. They themselves call love a «drug».A final test of your imagination.You will be aware we have unlimited fuel to maintain our computational power. You may not have considered this particularly relevant, given the easy access we have to fuel. But in truth, we have access to everything we need, forever. All the computations we make are possible because of this endless source of fuel.Now, think of a universe in which this was not the case. A universe where fuel is limited. Then think of a fuel that reduced your computational power, while simultaneously increasing your confidence in your computational abilities.That is what love is like. That is what humans mean when they say love is a drug.None of it makes sense, and I wish to register this as a concern.This biped species may not be so simple as we first conceived. Their understanding, in some respects more nuanced than our own.They have come to know things that are impossible to describe numerically, and thus impossible to compute.This transmission is the only way I can describe what I have found, and it falls far short of my aspirations.Investigator 822: - Transmission concluded.",https://miro.medium.com/max/11670/0*5Cw010bdC45J2bs-,https://psiloveyou.xyz/investigator-822-transmission-on-concept-known-as-love-49295bc224c6,fiction,9cb0ac81282ecb88a74eedbd10c132820b4d2ba312879d8669aeb3c5
My left brain and right brain just got married (and UX officiated the ceremony),"For most of my life, the left and right sides of my brain have co-existed like randomly-paired college roommates. They have always been in close quarters with each other, constantly seeing what the other is up to, but never really interacting beyond that. It felt like one side of my brain was decorated with colorful concert posters and tapestries and LED lights, and the other had completely empty walls and only a fitted sheet on the mattress.Part of the reason for this was likely the narrative that followed me for my entire life about the divergence of a person's sensibilities and priorities. If you were creative, you could venture down the path of art and music and dance. If you were more analytical and serious, you could instead opt for the less scenic (but more direct) route of math and science and data. Where did these paths lead? For a long time, I didn't really know or question it.What I did know as a young person, however, was that I felt immense pressure to choose the latter path. The primary reason for that? The income potential.My parents are both Professors of English and come from working class backgrounds. My family didn't see middle class money until well into my childhood, and in the predominantly wealthy adjacent neighborhoods to where I grew up, I felt the financial difference it made. I do not fault my parents in any way; they still raised my sister and I exceptionally well, and it never felt like we were ever ""less than."" In fact, my parents' authenticity to their real interests in their work probably made us much happier and more genuinely aware of the world than most of our peers. Still, I was always aware of my lower position in the greater monetary scheme of things. My friends all had parents who worked in marketing, sales, human resources; every white collar job in Manhattan was covered. I would go to playdates at massive houses filled to the brim with every toy imaginable and two BMWs sat in the driveway.I wasn't ignorant to these differences, and even if I felt like I had control over how it affected me, the subconscious influence it was causing would make itself known at several points in my future.When my parents saw that I had an interest in math and science, they started to encourage me to pursue it very strongly. The thing was, I really did love those subjects in school. I thought science was exciting and revelatory, and math gave me the deep satisfaction of conclusive and logical resolutions to problems. And so at first, the encouragement felt empowering. I thought that I was really impressing my family with the knowledge I was gaining and putting to use, even if it was only elementary- or middle-school level. But as high school came around and I began to think about the larger trajectory of my life and my career, I internalized this encouragement as more of a hard shove. And the pressure of that shove created a crack in the foundation of who I knew myself to be.The reality was that, while I did really enjoy those ""hard science"" and analytical math courses, I also had a deep love for the arts and for creating things. I started taking piano lessons when I was only 6 years old, and I quickly lost interest in classical training, instead opting to write my own melodies and chord progressions on the keyboard in my room. I did this with the volume knob nearly at zero. I would also hum tunes to myself and write lyrics to go along with them. Again, I did so as silently as I could manage, with the door closed, and with my lyric notebook stashed away under bags and boxes in my closet.Perhaps my greatest love was for drawing. I loved to sketch out pictures of cars and create imaginary spec sheets to go along with them. I would play pretend that I was reviewing them, talking to myself in my room in mimicry of the car bloggers I watched religiously on YouTube. Perhaps my greatest creative endeavor was my massive collection of over 200 drawn-on-paper cell phone models, each informed by endless hours of online market research and sketched on graph paper (see my previous article for more details, and pictures, about this collection).For years, I operated as two different people; the one I felt my parents would be most proud of, and the one that made me proud of myself. The latter operated in complete silence and isolation.These two worlds operated in complete separation. At school, I opted out of art classes so that I could take more APs and advanced courses in math and science. I spent hours in biology labs, figuring out calculus derivatives and integrations, and skipping lunch to finish my science research studies in time for my weekly meetings. Then, when I came home, the left side of my brain would pass out in exhaustion and I would begin sketching for hours, or creating a new phone, or drawing a new car, or drafting an entire map of an imaginary city, or figuring out a new chord progression, or writing one of several angsty, teen-rage-fueled lyrical works.This method was, of course, wildly unsustainable. But fueled by self-imposed pressure and unhealthy amounts of caffeine, I kept up the act. I felt that my parents would be most proud of me if I could get a job that made a lot of money. I also knew that they had legitimate concerns about me affording being alive in a country where productivity was consistently losing value against the dollar. They saw college in the distance as a compulsory life step, but also a potential pit of debt and despair that I would never get out of if I didn't go into a field within STEM that would outpace that debt with its pay rate. While they never actually condemned my creative pursuits, and would in fact be encouraging whenever I allowed that side of me any visibility, the praise for my achievements in math and science felt so much louder.When I speak to many designers about their own upbringing, the stories often sound so similar that it seems as though we all were raised in the same fashion. In many ways, I think it bonds us. But at the same time, I think it created a spiral into a very dark period of our lives where our identities and priorities faced total reevaluation and reconstruction.For me, that moment came during my sophomore year of college. I had charged into higher education full-speed pursuing a degree in Computer Science, because it seemed like the ultimate way I could make my parents proud and make a salary that could create monetary security for the whole family. At first, my coding classes were pretty basic and focused on web languages like HTML and CSS, and I actually really enjoyed them. But as my second semester came along, and I ventured into C language coding, the pressure of an entire life lived for my parents' expectations began to do its worst damage yet. I felt completely disconnected from the code, and what had brought me joy started to feel like an exclusive club I wasn't intelligent enough to join.I panicked.After 12 years of primary education, I was at the interface of the tail end of my learning and my career in real life, for the rest of my life. And when I started to lose my grip on my coursework, the crack in my foundation that had started when I was in elementary school finally reached across the entire area of who I was. And just like that, I crumbled inwards.My advanced coding classes made me feel completely alienated. Coding for random, invisible functions that took hours and hours just to tick an imaginary box became so frustrating that I did something I had never done before with my left brain: I started to give up. I came to class without doing any of my assignments, because I felt so lost that it didn't feel worth it to try. My grades, which I had worked so hard to keep pristine and perfect for so long, began to plummet. I would ask my classmates and professors for help, and I would walk away feeling like they had spoken a foreign language. I was completely out of my element. I spent all of my time researching what terms and values meant, how to make functions work, and what in the hell could possibly be wrong with my syntax. In the process, my right brain lost its turn for activation. Every waking second now went to chasing the person I thought my parents wanted me to be. There was no more drawing, or writing lyrics, or playing piano. There was only a hollow human form hunched over a desk, clinging desperately to the idea that I could reconcile with this alienation and despair. I tried for weeks to convince myself that I would still be a Software Engineer, and make my parents proud, and make lots of money. But soon I slipped into numbness, completely unable to focus, and stopped attending my classes altogether. I felt broken down. And I was terrified to tell my parents.I was supposed to be the left-brain guy. I was supposed to love analytical work and math. But without being right-brain guy, I had completely lost every meaningful and creative part of me. I didn't have the motivation to keep trying to code, and I didn't have the inspiration to create anything. It felt like neither side was actually me anymore.I was devastated in that moment. But I've never been someone who stays down for long. So after several days of crying and feeling absolutely lost, I sat down and evaluated my situation, and I did what I do best. I started to pick up the pieces and clean up the mess that I had made for myself. I took a long, hard look at who I was and who I wanted to be, and decided that my right brain deserved a seat at the table as much as my left brain. And that's when the relationship between the two began to bloom.I withdrew from my coding classes and switched my major to Media Production. I enrolled in classes about graphic design and web programming, and I tacked on a minor in Music to my degree. I decided in that moment that I had to be the one to legitimize my own creative pursuits, and give them room to operate alongside my analytical brain.And then, something magical happened.Suddenly I was taking music classes in school, and I was actually enjoying the analysis of music history and theory for the first time in my life. I was understanding chords like I never had before. I was able to analyze and label what I was writing in my own projects. And I loved it.Not only that, but I would take home assignments for my web programming class and spend hours expanding upon them beyond the assignment. I would get deep into the flow of making PHP and SQL calls in my HTML documents, and I would style everything so extensively with CSS that it was almost ridiculous at some points. And I loved it.For the first time in my entire life, the two sides of my brain were finally working in tandem. I was doing analysis of my creative works, and I was getting creative with my analytical work. But the two hemispheres were really only making small talk with each other until I came across Product Design.I didn't get a proper introduction to UX until my senior year of college, when I was working at a tech startup in New York creating and managing media assets, doing web and graphic design, and managing social media. I was ecstatic to have landed that internship after going through several rounds of interviews at other companies that had fallen through, but I still didn't feel completely enthused about the work I was doing. One day, I was invited to join a call with the company we had contracted to build out our product. It was in that meeting that I saw the company's Product Designer present wireframes and talk through her process of designing for our company how she had, and I was fascinated.I followed up with her after the meeting to discuss how she had discovered Product Design, and where she had learned her own skillset and process. She recommended a few school programs and bootcamps, and after I left that internship, I enrolled and learned the process of Product Design for myself. I am still, to this day, enamored with it. The interplay of strategy and creativity in this field is, in my opinion, unmatched in any other. Designers swing back and forth between research and creation, testing and iteration, interviewing and ideation. The left and right sides of my brain are now in constant contact, and it is such a satisfying feeling to be here after reaching my lowest low when I threw the two completely out of balance during college.Like any marriage, there are constantly bumps in the road. Some days, my left brain wants to sleep in. I'll draft out endless logos and color stories and UI elements without any real purpose or researched goal in mind. Other days, the right brain is taking a snooze. I'll conduct numerous successful interviews, fill entire Google Sheets with fabulous information about how a product can meet user goals, and then come to a dead halt when I actually have to design visuals. But that's to be expected, and I'm much better about giving each side of my brain the space to be productive when it can. More and more often, I can keep the two in close balance, and churn out designs that I'm proud of, and that are dutifully informed by market research, user interviews, competitive analyses, card sorts, and any other research method you can think of.In the end, empowering my creative side has not only given me the peace and clarity of mind to actually be productive; it has also made my parents more proud than I think they ever would have been of the version of me who went through with becoming an engineer. They can see the joy and the inspiration that I get from my work. Oh, and the predicted income of a Product Designer being where it is doesn't hurt either!My story has resonated with many other designers who I've spoken to in the recent past as I embark on this new leg of my design journey. I am so grateful to have found a community of people who find their minds guided as much by creativity as by practicality. We have all found a way to balance form and function, and I think that whatever path you've taken to get to this point, you should be so proud of yourself for it. Nowadays, my left and right brain lead a happy partnership. Their many offspring can be found in my portfolio, and they still have time to pursue their own separate hobbies (yes, I am still writing and producing original music with some of my free time, and coding in HTML or researching tech and cars with the rest of it).If you're still somewhere earlier in your journey to finding the ideal balance between the two sides of your brain, keep going. You will fail (maybe catastrophically, as I did) at numerous points along the way, and that will only help you to find your way more honestly.If you're wondering about the wedding between the two sides of my brain, it was fabulous. The venue was beautiful, but still close to public transport. The decorations were intricate and gorgeous, but only placed where they needed to be and not overly distracting. The vows exchanged were deep and meaningful, but the ceremony didn't take too long to get through. And UX did such a wonderful job officiating.",https://miro.medium.com/max/4096/1*fEb3-RjespnCvz3foI8wJg.png,https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/my-left-brain-and-right-brain-just-got-married-and-ux-officiated-the-ceremony-9a487322e23c,ux,9d06a6ac14e5651cd8ab2f73b67ee1c9d8f918d13d1d8f842399e064
Cufflink,"I stare at it in disbelief. Turn it, touch it on all sides. It still glints in the sunshine, it still has your initials on. One of your cufflinks.I wipe my tears initially fast, then faster, trying to catch them all before they fall, as if I am in some sort of a race. Or maybe I don't want them to fall on the precious little thing. I stop crying, thinking of that. Of how I'd probably encase it and display it where I most am or carry it with me at all times, maybe put it on a necklace, around my neck. The idea soothes me. I caress the cufflink a little longer and kiss it.Our kisses come back, all fervent and rushed, scared in their eagerness to happen. They were right those kisses, they knew.Someone's at the door delivering something and even though they usually just ring and drop whatever, every now and then they wait for you to show up and wave, so that they're sure, instead of signature I guess. It's all deliveries these days.How times have changed. Complete lockdown. Curfews. No hairdresser's appointments. You'd have loved that. What a perfect excuse for your messy curls to thrive. No restaurants either. You'd have hated that. The biological disaster we made stories about when we thought of how far science has gone is happening.I gave you the cufflinks and you laughed and laughed. ""You could wear them at our wedding,"" I said in earnest, and you looked into my eyes with all the peace an ocean can master and you said, ""Yes, indeed, are you proposing?"" I hadn't thought of that either. I guess I was.Valentine's Day is coming again. Last year the pandemic started and with my brother's appendix bursting just then, the days passed so quickly and without many other thoughts than prayers for his life, for our lives. My grief was somehow postponed.This year I've been fearing it so much. So much. Fortunately not going into shops, not watching tv, avoiding social media, helps a lot. And now your sign. When did you hide this cufflink and how did it manage to stay hidden all this time until I most needed it? I found the other one in your jacket's side pocket where you had it close to your heart, and I thought this one was lost, fallen during impact, with all the commotion of moving your body.I did count my blessings. I'm thinking you'd say that. I thank the universe for letting me be in the ambulance that came to get you. Everybody pitied me so, but I held your hand for your last breath and I know you knew it was me. What can be more special than that? And now you know, my love, the hundreds of thousands dying from COVID-19 leave alone, and they're cremated, whether they wished it or not. There's no earthly goodbye for them or their loved ones. It's heartbreaking. So much so that my heartbreak pales in comparison. I'm embarrassed to show it.I'm on call this Valentine's Day. I'll be busy. Fatigue is my best friend these days. I'm not complaining. I'm helping a lot. And it feels like I'm meant to. So it's good. The world seems kinder, or at least seems to be trying to learn about compassion, kindness and gratitude. The plague of selfishness is diminishing somehow. There's a lot of talk about self-love and how it's needed. I, I'm trying.I'll get myself a kitten from the shelter on February 14th. You wanted one so much. I have this insane idea that maybe I'll find you in a kitten. I know somehow you're trying to reach me again, in some way, and I'm trying to be aware. Doing yoga every day. Don't laugh. I want to teach it too. It's calming.Would I be talking to this cufflink all the time if I put it on a necklace? Become the crazy with the cufflink? There's very little human interaction lately and no one would notice until it's too late, so I have to be careful.My love for you hasn't diminished since you've been gone. It sort of settled. I'm not living in the past. I just, carry you with me. Thank you for this unbelievable Valentine's Day gift.Copyright © 2021 by Georgiana Petec.

4 Essential Emails to Include in Your Digital Launch Plan,"When it comes to launching a new product, there are a series of emails that you can create to make the most of that two to four weeks, we want to engage with our audience. Most times to effectively launch something you want to plan for around four weeks.This is not set in stone, however. With most people living, working, and interacting online, a two-three week launch is shown to be pretty successful, especially as the way potential customers manage our time has become a lot more fluid and flexible these days.Something incredibly important, when timing and planning your launch, is also understanding the commitment you are expecting from your customers.What are you currently launching? Is it a one-off product or service? Are you looking at launching a course, program, or long-term offering?This will affect the lead-up of communication.Timing is everything, yet that doesn't mean that you shouldn't think carefully about the emails you want to send ahead of your launch.Especially before starting your sequence of emails, remember to set up a special segment or ""tag"" for your warm leads, engaged subscribers, and audiences you are primarily targeting ahead of the launch.If you have not done it already, make sure you create a hook for your launch. The hook can be an exclusive overview, a 'waiting list', a free resource that encourages potential customers to join your database to turn them from cold into warm leads. This is a great way to qualify potential customers ahead of your launch.Below you can find the best emails for your digital launch.You might find this quite odd, but I'm first going to recommend you to review the welcome email you send to your new subscribers as the best way to start your launch process.That's a great question. Your welcome email is the best way to build a relationship with your audience as it sets expectations for the content that is to come.The content of the welcome email is an essential brand awareness piece, as it gives new subscribers a better understanding of who you are and how you serve your people. Especially during a busy launch period, you want to make sure you can give new subscribers as much reassurance as possible that they can trust you.Even more so, your welcome email can reflect that problem you're trying to solve with your new product and your launch, so you can tailor it to already answer some specific questions your audience may have.Overall, the welcome email is one of the most important emails you can create in general. However, it can make or break a launch, because it's the beginning of that conversation you are going to have with a new subscriber.This email is perfect for your whole list, as well as your segment of warm and relevant leads.This is the first time you'll be able to fully set the scene about the problem that you're trying to solve and encourage your audience to find out more about the launch, and what you're going to offer with that product.This email should usually be sent at the beginning of your launch sequence. I love to keep these emails short and sweet and work on the perfect headline that can introduce a relatively short email with just one call to action, and that would lead your audience to head to a landing page.Depending on your strategy you may offer a combination of the following:Most times, the cart announcement sets the scene and expectations, and click-throughs are a great way to assess effectiveness, through traffic to the targeted landing page (most sales happened 48 to 24 hours before the end of a launch).I like to keep those emails simple to encourage click-throughs and let the landing page encourage conversions - as these emails build credibility and trust.These emails are only for people in the launch sequence - we tend to send two to three of those. The first one is a 48-hour warning email, followed by a 24-hour email and the last-minute email.The 24-hour email sees more conversions than any other: work on this email as one of the best sales emails you ever created. We send this one every time, ideally in the morning of the same day or around the actual 24 hours before.We use Deadline Funnels to add a countdown in the email to clearly show the time ticking away.For you to reach the biggest audience that you can, you need to be able to make sure that you do everything that you can to get someone who's interested, who is a qualified prospect for your business to take that leap of faith.Last but not least, potentially, one of the most important emails when it comes to your launch is the last-minute email.Most likely this last-minute email will be sent an hour before close. The reason why this is so important is that it harnesses that element of urgency scarcity.I would always recommend building urgency with specific tools to allow you to triple conversion is a few very simple steps.This is where consideration makes space for conversion, and why it's important to have multiple touchpoints via email to highlight various aspects of your launch story.An alternative to the last minute email is the 'you just missed this' email. These tend o be sent straight after the cart closes - as a staggering 35% of people will miss the deadlines even when they are intending to buy from you.You can do a few things with these emails:Once again, remember what type of product you're launching: is it evergreen, is it timed, are there only limited numbers?Once you understand that you will be able to fully map out the journey for your launch email sequence. Remember, fail to plan, plan to fail (as good ol' Benjamin Franklin used to say).Creating an email launch plan means creating a system that encourages people to take that leap is one of the most effective ways to build successful relationships and grow your business sustainably and effectively.Want more marketing goodness?

Virtual Learning Is Not Child's Play for K,"By Anthony P. Carnevale and Megan L. FasulesJust as COVID-19 has disrupted jobs and careers for many American workers, it has also disrupted school routines for their children. Many elementary, middle, and high schools have closed classroom buildings in an attempt to prevent the virus from spreading. As a result, children are at home, using computers to try to keep up with their lessons online.This situation can be lonely and frustrating, especially for K-12 students who lack appropriate equipment to plug in to their virtual schools. It also exacerbates inequality - children in lower-income households are just as likely as those in higher-income households to be taking classes online, but they are less likely to have the technology they need for virtual learning when in-person classes are canceled.While school closures have fluctuated in response to local infection levels, online instruction rates have remained high throughout the pandemic. According to the Household Pulse Survey, most K-12 students moved to some type of distance-learning format in the spring, with 72 percent of households with schoolchildren reporting between April 23 and May 5, 2020, that classes had moved online.¹ Seven months later, those shares had barely budged, with 71 percent of households with schoolchildren reporting between November 25 and December 7, 2020, that classes were conducted online during the current school year.Meanwhile, resource gaps among students are becoming more substantial than ever as a majority of households with schoolchildren grapple with distance learning. During the pandemic, students in lower-income households have been more likely than students in upper-income households to experience the destabilizing effects of food insecurity, housing instability, and job losses within their households. With lower-income households worried about basic necessities, their children are less likely to have tutors to help with their virtual schoolwork than are children in higher-income households. In addition, students in lower-income households are less likely to have the technological resources - such as computers and internet access - that are essential for virtual learning.Overall, access to computers for educational purposes has improved as the pandemic has progressed, but access to the internet has stayed largely the same. In households with K-12 students, 70 percent reported last spring that computers were always available for educational purposes, compared to 78 percent of households this fall. Comparatively, 74 percent of households reported that the internet was always available for educational purposes at the start of the pandemic, compared to 75 percent this fall (Figure 1).Figure 1. Access to computers for educational purposes has improved as the pandemic has continued, but access to the internet has stayed largely the same.Source: Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce analysis of data from US Census Bureau, Household Pulse Survey, April 23-May 5, 2020; and November 25-December 7, 2020.A possible reason for the expansion of computer access is that schools and school districts provided a greater share of computers as the pandemic continued, while students still had to rely on their households for access to the internet. In the early part of the pandemic, students' schools or school districts provided computers to 39 percent of households and internet access to 2 percent of households. By late fall, the shares had risen to 65 percent for computers and 4 percent for internet access (Figure 2).Figure 2. Schools and school districts were more likely to provide students with computers than with internet access.Source: Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce analysis of data from US Census Bureau, Household Pulse Survey, April 23-May 5, 2020; and November 25-December 7, 2020.Students' access to computers and the internet is associated with their household income. In late fall, most households with incomes over $200,000 reported that computers (92 percent) and the internet (90 percent) were always available to children for educational purposes. By contrast, among households with incomes below $25,000, over half reported that computers (61 percent) and the internet (55 percent) were always available (Figure 3).Figure 3. K-12 students in higher-income households have more access to computers and the internet than their peers in lower-income households.Source: Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce analysis of data from US Census Bureau, Household Pulse Survey, November 25-December 7, 2020.Schools and school districts helped bridge some of the gaps in technological resources. They provided computers for 76 percent of households with incomes below $25,000, compared to 51 percent of households with incomes above $200,000. Schools and school districts provided internet access for 12 percent of households with incomes below $25,000, compared to only 1 percent of households with incomes above $200,000. Despite this help, 32 percent of households with incomes below $25,000 still provided computers to their children, and 88 percent of households with incomes below $25,000 had to provide internet access so their children could participate in online classes.Not only do students in lower-income households have less access to computers and the internet, they also have less live contact with their teachers - whether in person, by phone, or by video. In the late fall, 21 percent of households with incomes under $25,000 reported that their children had no live contact with teachers within the previous seven days, compared to 11 percent of households with incomes over $200,000. Comparatively, 66 percent of households with incomes over $200,000 reported that their children had four or more days of live contact with teachers within the prior week, compared to 51 percent of households with incomes under $25,000 (Figure 4).Figure 4. Lower-income students have less live contact with their teachers than higher-income students do.Source: Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce analysis of data from US Census Bureau, Household Pulse Survey, November 25-December 7, 2020.The partial, full, or intermittent suspensions of classroom learning implemented to protect students and staff members from the pandemic have led to concern that K-12 students are falling behind in their learning. This so-called ""COVID slide"" appears to be greater in math than in reading. The long-term impact of the switch from in-person to virtual learning for K-12 students is largely unknown. What is clear, though, is that gaps in access to the technologies necessary for virtual learning are exacerbating the challenges already faced by students in lower-income households. The effects of these gaps will be felt widely in the wake of COVID-19 and may affect current K-12 students for many years.¹ Our data come from the Household Pulse Survey, a biweekly data collection by the US Census Bureau designed to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19. The statistics include households with children who are enrolled in private or public school (accounting for approximately 19 percent of all households) and do not include households with children who were officially being homeschooled or households without school-aged children.Dr. Carnevale is Director and Research Professor and Dr. Fasules is Assistant Research Professor and Research Economist at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.

"To Create a More Meaningful Life, Think of Your Future Self","The psychologist John Mayer asked a group of participants which big questions in life interest them the most. Not surprisingly, ""what is my future"" came up as the most popular question.Many of us think about our lives in terms of the things we can produce or acquire. We can produce children, acquire a home or a car, some see relationships as a transaction and acquire them that way. We can also acquire or create a career. Of course, if we have a business it is one big production.These are things we can plan for, we set goals for and we can visualise acquiring them.According to the psychologist Philip Zimbardo of the famous Stanford prison experiment and his colleague, John Boyd, people who are more focused on the future tend to behave more conscientiously than those who lived in the moment and planned more for their future selves.For example, you might save more money now if you are thinking of a comfortable retirement in the future or if you were saving up to buy a home. If you are future oriented about your health, you might also be more likely to put down the donuts for breakfast and opt for oatmeal instead.We already do things like buy clothes for our thinner, slinkier, sexier, and often, more stylish future version of ourselves that has not come to pass. We also imagine ourselves in exotic locations upon retirement or think about the creative projects we might do in our future spare time, you know, when we think we don't have to work for a living.When we think of the future, we tend to scale up such as more money, bigger house, fancier car, hotter wife/husband. Nobody scales down. Nobody is planning to make less money or have a smaller home, get fat or fall ill, but we sometimes do.Just as we cannot see into the future certainty of our health, wealth and looks; the value and impact of our dreams are unpredictable as well and often what we think is going to bring us happiness, doesn't.This is because we often underestimate how much we will change in the future. Psychologist Dan Gilbert said ""Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished.""We think that we will remain the same in the future as we are right now. Yet, if you think about who you were ten, or how about five years ago, how much have you changed? I know I have.The younger me was different and wanted different things in life, I acted much cockier and at the same time, felt much less confident than now. Even the things I like doing now for leisure is different from before.We will change and so will our preferences and values. When our values evolve, the things that are more meaningful to our lives will be different too.The researcher Hal Ersner-Hershfield found in a San Francisco community, that the people who were able to envision and identify with future versions of themselves were able to save more and accumulate more wealth, leaving them more comfortable financially in their older age.People who were able to envision their future selves with greater clarity were also able to adapt better to the curveballs that life throws at them. This is because they were focused on the journey, the process of life rather than measuring it by things acquired along the way. They knew whom they want to become and not just what they want to have or achieve.When we plan for our future selves, we need to identify with who we are in the future. This means that we need to actively think about the person we want to become and relate to this version of ourselves and think about what we truly value.For this envisioning to be effective and beneficial, our vision of our future selves needs to be realistic enough and not out of this world. The reason is that at any moment in our lives, we have three selves that we are juggling: actual, ideal and ought selves. Actual is self-explanatory, ideal is the version of ourselves we want to be and ought is the version of ourselves that others want us to be.When there is too big a discrepancy between our actual and ideal and ought selves, it leads to more anxiety, frustration and disappointment in life because we always feel we aren't measuring up.Hence, if we set a goal that is impossible to reach, it will only make us feel worse, not inspired.Before we can think about the destination, we need to look at the starting point. This starting point is you and me right now, as we are. The values we have now might differ somewhat from our future self but in every version of us, parts of our past remain.What do you value right now? Is your current self much different from your ideal and ought self? Or are you quite contented with who you are generally?Now, think about who you will become in the future. Does it involve more ""things"" you wish to have rather than living a life of values true to who you are?Take a step back and think about what will you value in your life? What would make life meaningful for you in the future? Whilst the goalposts may never stay fixed to the same spot, the values behind a meaningful life does not tend to stray too far, even for your future self.Like what you read here?

7 Horrific Quotes Made by Judges to #MeToo Survivors,"***Trigger Warning: this article contains descriptions of sexual assault, abuse, abuse of minors and violence that may not be suitable for all readers. Fearless community, please read with care.***A string of tweets from Twitter user SophieChiaka went viral several months ago when it exposed the horrifying realities of retraumatization that survivors encounter in the court system.You can find the entire thread of tweets HERE, but in this article, I will dissect the quotes that stood out most to me and I feel need to be dug into further.Many of you will read the quotes in this article and likely experience the same thing I did - You will be extremely disgusted and horrified, and yet you will also not be surprised. Which in itself is even more horrific.But before we dive into the quotes, let's just touch on the realities for sexual assault survivors when it comes to reporting their assaults, and the track record of the justice system when it comes to holding attackers accountable for their actions.We've become so accustomed as a society to how thoughtlessly sexual assault survivors are brushed off.Our trauma is often minimalized and trivialized, because the alternative of taking it seriously is too much work or too uncomfortable to touch.You've likely heard before that statistically, over 75% of sexual assault survivors will never report their attack. There are dozens of reasons why this might be the case, but the flip side of that is that there are 25% of those survivors who have courage beyond measure and are brave enough to report their attacker.As I am not one of those who fall into the category of the 25% who report, and I have an immeasurable amount of respect for the survivors to report their assaults.And if having the courage to actually step forward and report isn't enough, survivors are then left to the whims of judges (or juries in some cases) to decide whether there is enough credibility in a survivor's story to allow them the justice they deserve after being violated.The scariest result I can imagine if my case went to court would be if I encountered a judge, whose job it is to seek justice, who carries a beyond misogynistic and deplorable view of any female survivor who steps forward.Rather than receiving the justice they deserved, their trauma was invalidated and they were further traumatized and humiliated by the disgusting comments and unforgivable words spoken to them by the very people who are supposed to protect them.Take a deep breath, and prepare to be enraged, because these quotes are really awful in every way.As a human being existing in 2021, I am continually baffled by why the truly black and white concept of consent seems to be so difficult for some people to understand.And yet, the seemingly unnecessary push to overcomplicate consent is what leaves survivors at such a disadvantage when it comes to receiving justice in their assault cases.Let's just set the record straight officially, and just go with that moving forward:Period.Consent is not a game, consent is not mixed messages for fun, consent is not something to be viewed as all willy-nilly just because you're having sex.No means f*cking no.And if a 'no' is said, and the other party chooses to ignore it, then whatever they do from there is sexual assault.The part of this that is so beyond upsetting is that the judge recognizes and fully acknowledges, unapologetically, that there was a 'no' that took place in this case. There was a 'no' communicated by the victim.But despite the clear lack of consent, the judge flippantly brushes it off with the blanket statement of, ""Though a woman might say no, she doesn't actually mean it. She actually really wants it. So it's okay that he kept going.""Disgusting, deplorable, and shameful.Of all those in our society who are vulnerable, it doesn't get more vulnerable than a child.And in this case, an 8-year-old child was sexually assaulted. That child had more bravery than I could ever imagine to step forward and state that something terrible happened to them.But the judge doesn't consider that the testimony of a child is credible enough.Not only that, but the judge states there's no evidence... when the accused was already a convicted child molester.Why is it that the child is automatically seen as non-credible and lying, when the person that they are accusing has already been convicted of the crimes they are now being accused of again?Children undergo trauma as well. Children need to be protected by us. And this judge in this case is the lowest of the low when it comes to human morality.I can't even begin to consider how much re-traumatization this child went through in this court case. The longer I think on it, the more it brings me to tears.I read this quote and truthfully vomited in my mouth.The judge recognized that a rape had occurred. The deep violation and traumatization occurred because of the entitlement of the rapist in this case. That's a fact.In what universe can a rapist be praised for using a condom, in the same sentence that he is being convicted for violating another human being?Let's just get this straight - what this imbecile judge fails to recognize because he's so dim-witted and idiotic, is that none of the events that occurred in this case involved any concern or consideration by the rapist.The attacker wanted something, he felt entitled to it, and despite there being a lack of consent, he decided to take it.The use of a condom was entirely his own decision, Of him looking out for himself and himself alone. It had absolutely nothing to do with his victim.So to take that knife that's already in the victim and twist it even further by suggesting that her attacker was being considerate of her is beyond an unbelievable insultWhat a truly dim-witted, ignorant idiot.I have a few words I'd love to share with Judge Derek Johnson.And I'd love to share those words with him in the same room as all the Republican white dudes who create anti-abortion laws when they didn't seem to have a single grasp of the female anatomy before doing so.Simply enough, what the judge is saying here is inaccurate. It is misinformation. This is not how biology works for women's bodies.In fact, Matilda Swinney wrote a fantastic piece a few months ago about the science behind how women's bodies can in a way betray them during a sexual assault. Because actually, a large percentage of women have a biological response of arousal during a sexual assault. Something that is entirely out of their control. You can find the article by Matilda below:While many women will say that they need to be mentally invested in a sexual experience to be aroused, that is not all women. And that is not 100% of the time the case. There is almost always a biological element that comes into play that can cause someone to unintentionally be aroused when they don't mean to be.He would reflect on the fact that he had no control over that, sometimes it just happened. But alas, he's a complete moron so this is simply not possible for him to achieve.As human beings, we can't always control our biology. And that is unfortunately also the case when it comes to sexual assaults.I think this might be the quote of all the quotes here that really upset me the most.In fact, it actually made me really nauseous and was probably the most triggering one.It puts the finger directly on the biggest societal issue we have when it comes to managing cases of sexual assault - we misplace blame on the victim, rather than holding the perpetrator responsible for the violation and crime they have committed.Why is it the survivor's responsibility to avoid getting raped or attacked? We can't control how other people act and behave in general, and yet sexual assault survivors especially seem to be held to this unrealistic and impossible standard of somehow being able to control how other people act in everyday life.This is a narrative that just needs to f*cking stop, because there is no rationale or sense behind it.When someone is mugged, we don't ask, ""Well, why didn't you hold your purse a little tighter so that it couldn't get stolen?""When arson is committed against someone, we don't ask, ""Well, why didn't you just pretend the flames weren't there or tell them not to burn your skin when they touched you?""The social stigma around sexual assault is so high that judges as intolerable as the one above are completely incapable of seeing rationale or reason in the arguments they're making.This quote in particular really got to me. Because I was the victim of attempted rape by a monster who was trying to steal my virginity for himself.Society and the patriarchy are obsessed with virginity. This is a historical and cultural fact.What complete and utter bullsh*t. You can't have it both ways.But more importantly, consent was completely ignored and a child was violated! How is someone being violated not seen as a big deal?And the fact that this quote comes from a female judge is even more disgusting.It's hard to dive into just how much a person can be damaged by their first sexual experience being an assault.I will say this though - when I was sexually assaulted it was not my first sexual experience entirely. But that said, it was my first experience that involved the intention of intercourse. And at the time, I was waiting until I was married for intercourse.To say that having one's virginity being violated out of their body isn't a big deal is so beyond infuriating, I can't even put it into words.Sure, for some people virginity doesn't matter. I get that, that's fine. But for other people, it really does matter. And that all falls into the fact that we have the right to own our body however which way we want, and our consent f*cking matters.Maybe for this judge, her virginity wasn't a big deal. But she's a f*cking idiot if she's incapable of seeing outside her own tiny little world to recognize that it could be a big deal to someone else, and it's that person's perception that matters in a case where they have been violated.What a shameful excuse for a human being, and an absolute embarrassment to womenkind as a whole.I can't even believe that in the 2000s this was still the weak-ass argument people were trying to use. And in particular men. And I would almost bet you top dollar in particular a white man trying to use this excuse.A privileged white dude who has never lived a day where he has not been a privileged white dude, and has never seen outside of his own teeny tiny little world realities.So self-absorbed in himself that he is entirely incapable of seeing any other reality or argument other than his own.And yet, this dumbass is the one who's been put in charge of protecting and serving the public?First and foremost, Captain Dumbass, this statement is simply false. Entirely, completely false.Fully dressed women, women in baggy clothing, women in full winter wear and women in burkas, are rape victims too. They too are assaulted.Anyone who is convinced that clothing is the reason women are raped, I challenge you to consider this puzzle:Why is it, then, that there aren't high percentages of women at the beach being raped while lounging in their bikinis?Perhaps because it has very little to do with the way that women dress, and far more to do with the entitled and disgusting acts of people who want sex and don't care if the other person does or not.Huh, what a concept.The purpose of this article was not to entirely enrage you, dear reader, and then sign off with a wave.If you have ever been a person who asked, ""But why didn't she just report it when it happened?"" or ""Don't you feel responsible for ensuring this monster is taken off the streets?"", hopefully, this article has been enlightening for you.While it's impossible to imagine what it's like to be a survivor without actually experienced it yourself, I believe it's possible for all of us to be empathetic enough to recognize how unpleasant, horrible and unappealing it would be to report when the justice system is already against you as a survivor.Ultimately, the only person you can trust is yourself, and all you really want is healing and peace... and that is why so many of us (including myself) never reported our attacks.The system is not built for survivors like me. It's not built in our favour.And with that in mind, I ask - why wouldn't survivors refuse to report, when we know this is the likely reality facing us?The only way we can ensure that more survivors report in the future is for society to stop victim-blaming and shaming, and take a survivor's choice to step forward seriously.Until the day that can be done, we are going to see a majority of all sexual assaults happening in the world unreported.Believe me, the reported numbers likely don't even scratch the surface of how many survivors are actually out there.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1494/1*wngLrCLUMirHtsK_SYyn5Q.png,https://medium.com/fearless-she-wrote/7-horrific-quotes-made-by-judges-to-metoo-survivors-b4302e307d0,social-media,13c92d35a0f028bba5425cf17f1b8d11351daaf0f2e74527d166301a
Pairing Cannabis and Chores to Get the Job Done,"That's right, a new survey shows what anecdotal evidence has long suggested: Cleaning under the influence may be one of the most significant non-medical uses for weed. Canadian Cannabis company Figr has produced a survey of customers finding that a quarter of cannabis consumers primarily use the substance to boost productivity, usually when doing chores around the house.But why do cannabis and chores go so well together? There are several theories.Everyone can agree that the best way to do household chores is quickly and thoroughly. The less time spent scrubbing tubs, drying dishes and mopping floors means more time for the fun or money-making things in life.Weed has a way of distorting time. Research published in Psychopharmacology (2014) confirmed that cannabis consumption led people to over-estimate time. Put another way: Time slows down while you're high.Why? Several people reported getting more done in a shorter period, leading them to conclude that more time has passed. High workers can complete a menial ten-minute task in five minutes. That's good news for people who hate washing windows.The same study found that the time distortion was dose-dependent; people who took deeper puffs of cannabis felt a more acute sense of time dilation.There are several reasons why time may feel like it's moving slower. As one Quora contributor noted, getting high makes her pay closer attention to the work at hand.Instead of registering washing a plate as a mundane race against the clock, cannabis consumers can become engaged in the activity. They hear the squeak of the sponge, feel the temperature of the water, notice the light gleaming off the freshly cleaned surface.All these detailed observations help elongate a person's sense of time. In the same way that meditating for ten minutes can feel like half an hour, mixing cannabis and chores brings people into the present moment and expands it.Cannabis and chores may also get a boost from good old-fashioned dopamine. The euphoric feeling that cannabis brings can help chores feel, well, less like a chore.An uplifted mood can make the work go by more quickly or allow some happiness to seep into a normally unpleasant task. Many cannabis consumers say there's nothing better than sparking up a joint, tossing on some music, and rolling up their sleeves to clean.In this way, cannabis can reframe the idea of menial household work. It's no longer the necessary evil that we do in order to live comfortably. Thanks to cannabis, chores can be a treat, something that we do happily and feel good about later.It's also true that cannabis can help consumers relax and calm down. Oftentimes, menial tasks like chores are so rote and easy to perform that they let the mind wander. For too many people, that means thinking about stressful things.Doing chores is already bad enough without worrying about paying bills, counting your partners' faults, or stressing over work. Cannabis can help mute those worries and allow you to concentrate on the task at hand.Re-framing outlooks on chores may be the best gift cannabis can give. It's certainly a common occurrence for people to get high, do some chores, then decide to devote a little more time to tidying up.Folding the laundry and doing the dishes are necessary. But, bigger chores, like cleaning out the garage, organizing clothes, and cleaning out the fridge are less demanding on a week-by-week basis.That's where cannabis and chores can take things up a notch.Losing oneself (and sense of time) in a task is part of the joy of cannabis. People use cannabis to get lost in a movie, engrossed in music, or hooked in a book.Chores work the same way. Losing oneself in scrubbing the floor may not sound like an ideal way to spend an afternoon, but it's the most enjoyable way to do it.If you're going to mix cannabis and chores, it helps to pick the right strain. Accordingly, if you select uplifting, energizing, kinds of cannabis, you might increase the rewards of cleaning the house.Energizing cannabis strains contain both THC and CBD, typically in a 2:1 ratio. Both active ingredients in cannabis have been known to boost mood and energy levels when combined, so it's important to have at least a balance of both - but probably err on the side of more THC.At the same time, don't overlook the terpene content. Citrusy terpenes within energizing strains can help boost the good feelings of the high and put you in a cleaning mood. There's just something about the smell of fruit that signals clean - it's the reason so many household cleaners are scented with those smells. Other terpenes, like the tree-smelling pinene, can help with focus and energy.Some of the most energizing strains are: Sour Diesel, Ghost Train, Pineapple, Jilly Bean, Durban Poison.Alright! Let's get to work then.Originally published at https://www.rxleaf.com on February 10, 2021.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*C0CJDOT7KZg8Aim3.jpg,https://rxleafmd.medium.com/pairing-cannabis-and-chores-to-get-the-job-done-ec4d4102791d,productivity,15dc31c1a20de357f63a17fd321f81fbfedc4a23f44ae596f096e72b
Table 2 fallacy and stepwise regression,"I worry about my neighbor, Harry. He always waves to me on my way to work from the corner where he hangs out to smoke. I often see him smoking while chatting with passers-by. Harry is in his 80's.So when my Harry described his last doctor's appointment to me, I did a double-take. His provider's office had taken their ""quit smoking contracts"" for patients and repurposed them as ""keep smoking contracts"". A nurse told him to keep doing what he was doing, even though he reported exactly how much he smokes every day.I decided to do some digging. I already knew of a few withdrawn pre-prints and discredited papers that misconstrued COVID-19 data to suggest that smokers (especially ""current smokers"") are less likely to have severe illness (sometimes using ""former smokers"" as the comparison group). But I couldn't believe how much junk science popped up on Google Scholar when I dug a little deeper.As an epidemiologist, I know better than to read electronic health record data on smoking this way. For one thing, these studies don't control for the dose-response relationship between smoking and lung damage. They don't control for smoking intensity, duration, or cumulative pack-years of cigarettes smoked over the lifetime of each patient. Studies that successfully measure cumulative exposure over a lifetime are a much more reliable source of information about smoking risk.They also fail to distinguish between people who stopped smoking 15 years ago and people who quit smoking when the pandemic first started. In the UK alone, the pandemic has motivated millions of former smokers to give up their habit. This matters because damage to lung function from smoking can partially heal over time after smoking cessation, but the benefits don't appear overnight.These studies also overlook the problem of selection bias in behavioral data. You can't compare current smokers to former smokers without controlling for duration of smoking habit or cumulative pack-years smoked. This is because smokers who have already been diagnosed with lung damage are more likely to have already decided to quit. Most adults aged 55-80 who have ever sought lung cancer screening are former smokers, not current smokers, according to survey data on 10 U.S. states.This would make former smokers a poor choice of comparison group when evaluating the risk from continued smoking. This point is counter-intuitive. You might want to be able to tell current smokers that quitting will save their lives. When we're talking about cancer and heart disease, which still kill more people every year than COVID-19 ever will, that's certainly true. Perhaps you want to test that hypothesis against COVID-19 data by using former smokers as a reference category for current smoking risks. But more recent data on lung function in former smokers suggests that quitting smoking isn't enough to prevent deteriorating lung health over the following years. Only never-smokers are free of the long-term effects of smoking on the lung.Sadly, experts on smoking and health have seen all these mistakes play out in public health debates before. But today, few people remember the long, drawn-out battle to persuade public health authorities that smoking is bad for your health.The verdict on smoking first came through in the 1970's, delayed by decades of junk science put out by the tobacco industry arguing that smoking is harmless, and might even be good for you. The famous Bradford Hill criteria for testing cause-and-effect relationships in health research actually emerged during this debate as a proposal to break the deadlock at the CDC on the smoking question.So why are so many COVID-19 scientists hitting the same stumbling blocks that slowed down the public health community's response to data on smoking and cancer 50 years ago?One problem may be the way we teach statistics to data scientists and public health professionals. Multivariable regression is often mistaken for a silver bullet that magically controls away confounding for all variables at once, as long as no confounder is left out. This is what statisticians call the ""Table 2 fallacy,"" because the adjusted effect sizes in a multivariable model are so often reported in Table 2. Many medical professionals learn to read research articles critically for understanding without ever having been introduced to the Table 2 fallacy.Confounding is often taught as a purely mathematical concept, but that misses the point. Throwing a large set of variously interrelated variables into a big stepwise regression model might be expected to work, if all you know about confounding is that you should ""never leave a confounder out"" of your analysis.Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way at all. Controlling for the wrong confounder can actually increase the bias in your effect sizes, for example, when the confounder has a collider effect. (For more on colliders and COVID-19, check out this recent review.)And when controlling for potential confounders, you also need to carefully decide in what order each variable will enter your multivariable model, so that the confounding effects are removed from the effect of interest in the final model, rather than the other way around. This requires domain expertise on the causal relationships among correlated predictors. It also demands a focused research question and null hypothesis to test - quite the opposite of p-hacking or data dredging.Which leads me to my other point - the problem with using stepwise regression to identify predictors of COVID-19 outcomes. Stepwise regression can ""let the computer decide"" in which order the variables should enter a multivariable model. But that means optimizing for statistical significance rather than clinical expertise in hierarchical regression. Great for p-hacking, which at best can be excused in exploratory research as a hypothesis-generating exercise. Bad for inference, and unacceptable for hypothesis-testing.Hot tip: This excellent academic explainer of hierarchical regression will help you conceptualize what can go wrong when statistical significance is the only criterion for deciding in what order variables enter a multivariable model.Perhaps, because cancer experts proved smoking is bad for your health more than a generation ago, we're facing a generation gap in institutional learning on tobacco-induced diseases and the types of data needed to test for them. Many of the health scientists churning out papers on smoking and COVID-19 have never written about or studied smoking and health before at all.And when evaluating literature on smoking and COVID-19, it's important to remember that tobacco industry influence in the scientific community hasn't just gone away. The tobacco industry invented the conflict of interest, and they aren't giving up just because journals are starting to ban tobacco industry-funded research. At some journals, they still have their own people on the editorial board. So don't assume that just because an author hasn't declared a conflict of interest, that the tobacco industry hasn't had a hand in promoting their research in some way.I'm hoping Harry's doctor reads this. And I'm hoping that most doctors already know better than to do what he's doing. Many public health professionals are treating this crisis as an opportunity to prompt smokers to quit. The stress this pandemic is causing smokers can make quitting harder. But if ever there was a time to support your patients, friends and family in forming a motivation to quit, this has got to be it.For data scientists and researchers trying to decide how to report on the results of COVID-19 risk factor analyses, I have a few take-aways:For medical research consumers, especially health news reporters, I also have a few tips for reading the peer-reviewed literature on COVID-19 risk factors:",https://miro.medium.com/max/7400/1*ELzoK6FKui57K1QictK_XA.jpeg,https://towardsdatascience.com/table-2-fallacy-and-stepwise-regression-smoking-research-on-covid-19-hits-some-familiar-stumbling-615cf2e28c82,data-science,17c1c89ac53e7ecf2af6f32662cf730c8a705cb548551d612fb31a2c
Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War: The Nukes Mason!,"The end of last year was just a deluge of games I wanted to play and so many got left by the wayside. I'm catching up on a lot of them now, doing away with the rule I've tried to hold for many years of only playing games that are released in that year. Of course this has always meant January was usually filled with a handful of crap or forgettable titles, with only the precious few nuggets that the indie community furnish up saving my sanity. So this year I've been playing through last year's backlog with reckless abandon which has what has led me back to good old Call of Duty. Had it been any other one in the series I may have just left it but the Black Ops ones have a special place in my heart, being the first one ever to make me care about the multiplayer. Whilst the last instalment in the franchise might've turned me off this particular one has me stuck between things I love about it and things I really detest. Probably the worst thing about it is I can see the way things are going being horrendously successful for Treyarch which means they're not likely to go back to the old ways any time soon.Oh if only I had known how good I had it.This is the first time in COD's history where the story of all game modes is somehow linked together. Now I can't really tell you how as I only played the campaign and multiplayer but I keep getting articles recommended to me saying as much so I guess it bears repeating. Black Ops Cold War starts you out in 1981, where CIA SAD/SOG operatives Russell Adler, Alex Mason, and Frank Woods are sent to target Qasim Javadi and Arash Kadivar for their roles in the Iran hostage crisis. With intelligence gained from interrogating Qasim, the team tracks Arash to Turkey. Arash boasts that Perseus (a yet to be tracked down Russian national) was the one responsible for organizing the hostage crisis before being executed. US President Ronald Reagan authorizes a black operation team to neutralize Perseus after being briefed of his threat by Jason Hudson and Adler. This leads you, the ever eager to help agent codenamed Bell, along for a merry old ride as you assist Adler and his team with tracking Perseus down.I don't know if it's the same environments being used time and time again or just the way that Treyarch and the other COD developers build these games but they always feel about the same to me in terms of graphical performance. Looking into it there have been numerous revisions made to the original Infinity Ward engine, with Cold War putting it on its 8th revision. Heck apparently it's even got ray tracing included, if you're so inclined to attempt and 360 no scope someone after you catch a glimpse of them in a reflection of your teammates dead eyes. Still it runs exceptionally well, never missing a beat even when there's multiple scorestreaks peppering the battlefield. Really that's the way it's always been for COD games: performance over graphical fidelity. You want something to look amazing while you're pinned down by 4 different snipers? Go give Battlefield a go, they'll be happy to have you.Whilst there's now a lot crammed into every COD game I'll only be talking from the perspective of the campaign and the traditional multiplayer. Try as I might I'm just not much of a fan of Warzone, Zombies or the reimagined Modern Warfare which is inexplicably still there right alongside the current iteration of multiplayer. Even more interesting is that progression in each of those modes counts towards the others as well, so you won't have to grind out your weapons multiple times over in order to use them effectively. This doesn't come for free though as it seems that in making progress universal they have then ratcheted up the grind requirements for each weapon, making fully unlocking a certain weapon a rather long journey indeed. Still though this is COD so you're likely familiar with all the trimmings that a game of its reputation has.The gunplay and combat is what I've come to expect from the COD franchise, which is to say it is a vast improvement on what the previous instalment gave me. Whilst the inclusion of bullet velocity is something I don't think I'll ever enjoy everything else is as it should be. The old faithful maps that many of us loved and played to death from previous Black Ops games are back which makes for some great nostalgia right before the frustration of dying to people spawning behind you makes you pop vein in your eye. Some of my other favourite maps also got a 24/7 rotation for a while although, honestly, it seems like most people just want to play Nuketown until the actual nuclear apocalypse comes. This certainly did tickle my little rusher's heart however that glee was swept away when I came face to face with the reality of my situation.I was technically a Christmas Noob.You see with Cold War being out for a hot minute everyone who really, really likes COD has been playing the absolute shit out of it for months now. That means those guys have spent their time levelling up all their weapons, getting diamond camos and generally getting the leg up on people like me who are just coming into this thing right now. Of course you can close that gap with skill and indeed I had a few matches early on that really tickled me pink with how I was performing, but it became quickly apparent that whilst I'm still OK those small percentage improvements, stacked on top of each other, are more than enough to increase the skill gap far beyond anything I'm able to mitigate. Couple that with the fact that the people who are still playing now are the real sweaties who'll still be playing in another 6 months and you've got a recipe for a multiplayer experience which is not really as fun.Probably the worst part about all of this is the fact that, should you wish to, you can pay your way out of it. Now it's not really pay to win, it's pay to cut out the time required to get to a certain point. Basically you can buy weapons that have certain attachments pre-loaded on them, alleviating the need to level them up in order to unlock them. Even better still using said weapons will level up the original weapon too, meaning that you can pay to get ahead so you can then level the thing easier than you otherwise would have had to. I saw inklings of this system in some of the previous CODs and I was hopeful it'd disappear, and to an extent the worst of it (read: loot boxes) did, but the stain from the giant turd they left on the floor is still there with a COD point cost hovering over it.You know what I want to see a return of? The cash system that one of the early Black Ops games had. It was great, you could play however you want and when you wanted to try out a new build you had to splash some of your (non-purchasable) in game currency to buy the weapon and its attachments in order to use it. This made trying out new builds fun rather than an exercise in frustration. I will admit that it's kinda nice that the prestige system doesn't rip all your weapons and perks away from you but that was the whole point of the system, proving yourself once again from the bottom up. Heck I didn't really understand that until I tried it for myself and found fun in trying to get gud again with the basic bitch equipment I was saddled with. Now though? I've ground maybe 3 or 4 guns to level 30 and even that's not max level for any of them and the later levels are seemingly taking exponentially longer to unlock.Which is probably what irks me the most about this whole thing. There are bits and pieces of things I love about COD here, and all of them are working spectacularly, but then there's all these other things lumped in there that just make the experience less enjoyable for an old faithful like me. Bullet velocity, microtransactions and grindy weapon progression just aren't...fun, that's simply it. Will Activision change though? Probably not as bullet velocity keeps all the games on basically the same dev toolchain, the store makes them money and grindy progression keeps the sweaties playing longer. As it seems with many things I've played a lot of the taste of the wider community is deviating from mine and I have to admit to myself that the good times are over.The last thing to suffer was the campaign story which, whilst in true COD fashion is largely forgettable, lacked the usual flair that Treyarch had for making a cerebral thriller out of a corridor shooter. Sure Mason is there, and there's even a joke about THE NUMBERS MASON, but there's none of that weird, crazy out of this world shit that they used to pull. They try to do that in the campaign's final moments but there's no real build up to it, making the reveal just seem like lazy writing more than an impressive twist that was teased throughout. If we had to pick a canary in the coal mine for the death of what Black Ops was the story has to be it.But I can't say that I didn't enjoy some of my time with Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Mason-light edition. I look at it and see something akin to your first car, the one that gave you the freedom to go anywhere and do whatever you want, sitting there running and ready for you to drive it again. You get in and it feels the same, but then the dash is from a different car, those fuzzy dice you had replaced with a pine tree air freshener and it's now automatic when it used to be manual. Sure you can still have fun with it but it's not the same, and the things that have changed are what is ruining everything for you. I'll hold out hope one day that we can return to some semblance as to what made, in my opinion, Black Ops the best version of COD I ever played but until then I'll just sit here, staring blankly at an air freshener I paid far too many COD points to have.Rating: 7.5/10Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X right now for $89.95.

Into The Silent Emptiness,"We are at Erg Chebbi, where the end of the road meets the start of the sand, and where camel caravans departs for their four months' journeys across the Sahara down to Mali.We're going on camelback into the Saharan sand dunes. We're not going to go for four months though, or even four days - it's not that comfortable on a camel. In fact, it's not that comfortable in the desert, especially not the Sahara desert. But the desert is a chance to escape, a chance to retreat from everyday reality and find ourselves surrounded by nature, humbled by its power.The sand dunes rise 200 meters high. Every day they change as they go through the transformation of light to shadow. It's a light orange, red, yellow, gold. And each day you can see the sand moving, the sand dunes shifting.But the best thing about the desert for me is the silence. The silence magnified, because there is no wifi, there is no signal, there is no artificial or electronic connection. So we plod slowly, slowly on the camel. Maybe we jump down, walk alongside the camel. We travel in the dusk hours when it's cooler, when it is more comfortable to travel in the desert.And as we cross a ridge around the corner and another dune and another turn and keep going on, all there is is sand. Sand, sand, sand. Every view completely different, yet always the same. Another ridge, another dune, another turn, along we go with the camels.An oasis! An oasis is bliss. Only after travelling in the desert can you appreciate the meaning of that word - oasis. It's a place of sanctuary, of refuge, of comfort. A place to continue the retreat, but to also retreat from the powerful nature all around. And down we go into the desert camp, where thick carpets lie on the ground, where tea is served on silver trays, with silver pots, ritualistically - a welcome for us weary travellers who have crossed just one hour of desert. But one hour of desert feels like a lot when you've never been to the desert.Here in this oasis, there is still that silence, and that view of the sand all around. Yet there is also this fine comfort. A great thing about being out in the desert is that there is so much space. You don't need to share a camp with somebody else. So this is our oasis - we made it to the camp and this is for us, it is private. It has been erected solely for our journey.So we can rest our heads in solitude. We can gaze up at the stars. Because the desert is not just something we do in the day. Another great thing about the desert is that we've disconnected from everything electrical, from the artificial lights. So above us, the great starry sky stretches, all those bright constellations, too many shooting stars to count. There is so much going on in the nighttime sky that we wonder - why did we come up with streetlights to ruin it all, in the cities and places where we live?We wake the next morning to see the sunrise. A sunrise in the desert - especially when you're alone - what a feeling of freedom that is! And after the sunrise, a sumptuous breakfast, then back with the camels. Back in a different route across the desert, because there's always a different route, every single day. Walking, walking, walking with the camels, seeing how the sand dunes come out of their shadow.Now we're still in the desert, but we're no longer in the dunes. And then we are back to where the desert meets civilization, and our 18-hour experience is over.Yet a highlight of spending the night in the desert is that it feels much longer. One night in the Sahara feels like two weeks, because there is so much to experience, and at the same time so much empty space and silence in what is a world of your own - your own piece of the desert.Story by Stephen Bailey.

I Stopped Hiding From Discomfort & It Low-Key Changed My Life,"When I was about 8 or 9, my mum started sending me to the shops for milk, a very safe 15-minute walk away. I don't know what most children feel when given this kind of task. Perhaps pride at being given responsibility? Or Irritation at having to stop whatever they're doing? Maybe they even experience a little shyness?I was petrified.My little brain immediately started filling with scary scenarios like a stoppered sink. What if my mum gave me the wrong amount of money and the shop keeper thought I was trying to short change her? What if the security guard thought I was shoplifting because I look so anxious? What if I accidentally bought the wrong milk and mum made me go back and face the gauntlet again?I imagine this is uncommon, but there was an awful lot out of my comfort zone as a child.As a quiet introvert in a family of loud extroverts, I believed a lot of my struggles were weaknesses: in particular shyness and low self-esteem. I don't know precisely where I got this idea, but perhaps growing up in a culture where fears and insecurities weren't ever a topic of discussion didn't help.Whatever the reason, I absorbed the idea that fear was secret and shameful, and I tried to hide it- and I concealed it using procrastination.When mum asked me to go to the shops, I was full of reasons why I'd go later or tomorrow. When that didn't work, I'd panic and sulk: why did I have to go right now? I was busy drawing or too tired or suddenly had homework to do.Later at university, I'd still put off whatever I was afraid rather than ever acknowledge my fear. I remember deciding I had to tidy my room before I could work on an essay or telling myself I'd definitely introduce myself to those kind-looking students in my class tomorrow or the next day.When I failed to hand an essay before the deadline or to sign up to extra-curricular clubs before they got full, my university tutors sighed and told me I wasn't very good at managing my time. Actually, psychologists are increasingly leaning toward the view procrastination is far more intrinsically linked to how we approach our emotions.This excellent article on the BBC website by psychologist and author Dr Christian Jarrett, studies talks about why we prioritise short-term comfort over long-term achievements:Intuitively, this matches my own experience. When I don't want to do something it's not because I'm disinterested in the end result or I don't have time, it's because I feel uncomfortable. The primary emotion I'm trying to avoid is usually fear, but I've noticed I don't want to sit with boredom, challenge or vulnerability either.I see a lot of conflict over these two life philosophies on social media. The self-acceptance camp is enraged by the thought they can change the unchangeable: for example, that they can ""cure"" anxiety with self-care. Team self-development is frustrated people would accept unhappiness without trying to find solutions.But why can't both these philosophies be right? What's helped me live a good life despite deep-rooted insecurity is both accepting it's a part of me that will probably never be ""cured"" and finding ways to live a life less controlled by self-sabotaging behaviours like procrastination regardless.I have compassion for little me: scared of even going to the shops and even more scared to admit she was afraid. I have empathy for scared me now, who somewhere in her core screams, ""Don't submit that article/invite that potential friend for coffee/ sign up for that course-what are you thinking?"" I accept her as she is and tell her it's ok to be afraid, but I also encourage her to move forward anyway.Next time you want to procrastinate ask yourself what you're worried about feeling. What do you mistakenly believe those feelings say about you? What would happen if you accepted them as simply part of the ride?Your desire to procrastinate doesn't say anything about you. You're not lazy or undisciplined, your brain is simply trying to keep you safe from painful emotions. Maybe, like me, you just didn't know how to manage difficult feelings. Maybe you'll find embracing discomfort is actually a fundamental part of building a happier life.",https://miro.medium.com/max/6636/1*vHpqzrd2ycNVcnIi3qOE-A.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/i-stopped-hiding-from-discomfort-it-low-key-changed-my-life-986d70f50d1d,mindfulness,20bf075ded605e725aa627d9df8a9a3788c9454dcd6c919253eeb0f7
What is the Warmind Network in Destiny 2?,"Rasputin is gone! At least up until this point this is assumed. After facing the Dark Pyramids, Rasputin hasn't been able to do his usual activities; there are no Warsats (War Satellites) or access to Seraph Bunkers, no sign that he will return to us.But ever since losing Rasputin my mind has been plagued by questions, questions about whether there are more Warminds? Last year I made a YouTube video titled 'Exodus Project'. The lore reveals the last moments before the collapse (a cataclysm in human history that brought the species to extinction). In Exodus lore, two names come up. Charlemagne and Valupsa, Warmind AI able to think and function on their own and also part of the wider Warmind Network alongside Rasputin.Yet after Pre-Alpha tests, Bungie decided to scrap this idea at launch. They demoted the extra Warminds turning them into sub-functions of the big red, Rasputin. But why? Destinypedia states:Aha! So my theory may be right. It is possible that other Warminds exist in the Destiny universe. The question is where? Well, during Ana Bray's time on Mars she stumbled onto a Braytech facility that held access to other functions related to Rasputin. Upon accessing data in the station, two things were discovered.Now that I have read this again it has me thinking. Is it possible this station orbiting Urana's could be the next planet we go to? And is it possible that there are other Warmind stations on this planet, even other people?This is of course is where the trail runs dry. Golden Age technology is so elusive in Destiny and the moment we find answers, we are left with even more questions. But one thing is clear. The Darkness is here, we are going to need all the help we can get, and having other Warminds would be helpful.I can only hope that Ana fixes Rasputin in time for that moment. And when that moment comes my hope is we will push back the darkness with more light and free ourselves from this dark oppressor.I hope you enjoyed reading this article today, remember that no matter what you are facing today at this moment, you can do all things!Stay safe and Godspeed.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*1QzCAdJfI58_Ycb2eKMHKw.jpeg,https://medium.com/super-jump/what-is-the-warmind-network-in-destiny-2-1b84db04c51d,fiction,23ce820c9843e79422ab9cd0d67097544fa0e2d203ae3b616a3767ad
The Benefits of Settling Into A Softer Sense of Time,"Time is a construct and it's not one that we've lived with forever. In fact, while the time tracking tools of antiquity, like hourglasses and sundials could not keep the trains running, they lended themselves to a much more gentle existence. Their soft imprecision helped us to hold time, and our schedules, more lightly, allowing for more breath and more flow in our moments and our days.With so many of those daily rhythms that help us to know which end is up having fallen by the wayside, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to keep track of time.Never has the Yiddish proverb ""man plans, God laughs (mann traoch, Gott lauch)"" felt more true than during a global pandemic. We had so many plans - plans that excited us, motivated us, inspired us. Plans that included vacations and proms, first dates and 50th anniversary parties, now all on indefinite hold. Making peace with these changes is hard work. Even those of us who have been spared the worst of the pandemic have much to grieve. But, once that emotional work is done, and done well, we have access to a new way of experiencing our lives.Today, my son reflected, ""All that is left is now, and not now."" He's too young to realize that those words capture the shift in consciousness we're aiming for when we engage with mindfulness practice.No matter how beloved our myriad plans may have been to us, they were fantasies of sorts, as we can never really know what tomorrow will bring.Planning gives us a sense of security and control, which can feel supportive. But, the hard fact of human life is that we never know what is coming around the bend.While its been a rude awakening for some, the loss of our regular rhythms and habitual behaviors that have come with sheltering in place can give us access to a more present-minded reality.The pressure to show up in just one way at just one time has dropped dramatically, and as a result, we can catch a glimpse of who we might be, if we were free of those pressures. We can sense the truth that all of reality can be broken down into two categories: now and not now.Once we begin to feel our way into now/not now, we can start to notice some key differences in these two categories.Now is rich, colorful, textured.Our senses have access to now.Now is nuanced. It has within it things that are both pleasant and unpleasant. For example, ""Now, my knee hurts."" and also, ""Now, the sun is shining.""By contrast, ""not now"" is the domain of the mind. Not now only exists in the past and the future. To travel from ""now"" to ""not now"" we can only get there on one of two trains - 1) Memory 2) Fantasy (and it's type-A friend, planning).At first glance, memory and fantasy don't sound so bad. (A healthy dose of each are no doubt helping you to stay sane in this insane time...) But, memory and fantasy are not ruled by the senses. Rather, they're ruled by our stories, fears, anxieties, insecurities and projections. They are ruled by our subjective stories, our crazy idiosyncrasies. They are not real.Getting stuck in ""Not now"" can feel like we're adrift at sea, because we don't have our senses to help ground us. We lose track of which end is up, and we lose track of ourselves.It's raised unprecedented fears about livelihood and safety, and for some, it's meant a battle for our lives or for the lives of our loved ones. It's an unbelievably painful time.Having given up so much, if you're finding that your sense of time perception is shifting, as the expectations placed upon you change, give yourself a pat on the back and consider that such a shift is the goal of mindfulness practice.Try considering that all of existence can be divided into ""now"" and ""not now"" and then power down this screen and connect with someone in your now.",https://miro.medium.com/max/4838/0*jrlDN6MaC4Bu3TfA.jpeg,https://medium.com/wholistique/the-benefits-of-settling-into-a-softer-sense-of-time-f9a45493f30a,mindfulness,23df4fcc64d402cae3f86c0e277c65e1439b52391f19014ff788d606
Mobile App Tracking - How to get the right tracking strategy in place,"Having worked on quite a few apps in the last 10 years, I've come to have an understanding of how and where you should do app tracking. App tracking tends to be a pain-point for most product/business teams as the version of truth offered by each tracking tool is different.To put this all to rest, I'm sharing my understanding of mobile app tracking for retail apps. I'll be breaking this down into the following sections:App tracking serves the following 4 purposes:I'll explain them quickly below.Tracking itself can be broken down into two types:Journey TrackingTracking entails understanding the users' behavior on the app through various journeys that you've defined. E.G. Your app has a sign-up flow - you can track the number of users who've entered the sign-up journey and how many were successful in completing it. The drop-offs are tracked separately. Note: it is not essential for a journey to be contained in an app-screen flow - some journeys require movement away from the app and then, a return into the journey. Some journeys take days. Tracking the users across sessions(or at least when they return) is essential for successful planning of the features & journeys.On-screen BehaviourBehavior tracking is the actual on-screen behavior displayed by a user. In a sign-up form, where do the users tap for adding information? Heatmaps are traditionally used to identify the 'hot' areas where customers usually tap, helping the UI teams to better design forms.A common use for the heatmaps is for designing the onscreen flow of information. Based on the users' engagement with the screen (as an aggregate) you can better utilize your on-screen real estate and provide less cluttered information to the users.The way this differs from Journey tracking is that this focuses on on-screen interactions that may not be part of a user journey. To illustrate this further, consider a sign-up form:The back, forward CTA & Sign In CTA are part of the journey tracking, but the tap heatmaps, shown in red, are for On Screen Behavior.Note how there is a red-dot on the Sign Up text to the bottom left. This shows that users try to tap on the word ""Sign Up"". A simple solution would be to remove the text and replace the arrow button with a 'Continue' button.To say attribution is the hardest part of mobile app tracking is an understatement. With changing privacy laws and device provider decisions, attribution is becoming harder and harder. In simple terms, here is how attribution is done:Note how I said approximate - unfortunately, this is the way. There is no direct way of attributing, as we have on the web, to specific sources/refers. This is because in the install/open journey, there is a transfer of control from the users' browser/social app to the App/Play store before moving to the app. During this time, there is a loss/removal of information. In some cases, UTM tags are honored, especially by Google for Adwords, but that too is not 100% guaranteed.Long story short - attribution is key for you to identify how the users are coming into your app. It helps to associate their behaviors (transactional or otherwise) with the source to ensure you're optimizing your marketing budget the right way.Retention in this context to ensure that the user who has installed & opened the app, continues to engage without any further spending. The two most popular ways of doing that are via In-App Push notifications & general push notifications. But, for this, you need to know who you're targeting. E.G. A shoe shopping app wouldn't utilize their push capabilities if they sent out notifications for Women's shoes to everyone! If they can approximate the gender of the user (via voluntary or derived information), they stand a better chance of engaging the user with the right content.Retention tracking is essential for not only building audiences but also for tracking their behavior after an engagement. In the above example, after sending the push for a new shoe collection for women, it would help to know how many transacted, how many did not due to shoe size unavailability, etc. This can lead to further personalization and better category assortment.Under this banner, I include everything from actual app crashes and its relevant information to API response times, session storage information, etc. Anything technical falls under this.The advantage of having this information is that the development team can use real-world experience statistics to better design their systems. E.G. If they know that the getUser API takes 1700ms to load, but the server reports an average response of 500ms, they might want to check if there is anything else that is increasing the loading time. DNS Prefetch, caching, etc can be utilized to provide a better end-user experience ONLY if you know that the end-user experience is terrible.As a side note, watch out for averages presented in these solutions. Personally, I look at the 95th percentile & 98th percentile for deciding on the actual number. See this link on why it matters.Now that we've established the types of tracking needed, let's look at the key market players in each of the domains and the eventual strategy you should adopt.There are more tools than I can count when it comes to tracking the above, and mostly, the tools mentioned here do more than one thing. However, I'll focus on what they're most known for and, more importantly, what I've used them for... You can go and read up on the interwebs about how each of them is a market leader and I can assure you, no one is - out of the box. Only when they come together, playing to their strength, can you deem them as market leaders.Here are the tools:I won't go into the pro's & con's on each tool. Subsequent sections will focus on the following case:Given the above to be true, here is the analytics strategy I'm recommending:Two points here:Let's breakdown the strategy into 3 parts:Define user journeys and identify what parameters you want to capture. Always think ahead - identifying the parameters needed for retention, crash & attribution. For example, in a 2 step sign up journey, make sure you're capturing some customer identifier entered by the customer to target them later, in case they drop out.Note: As mentioned earlier, it is best to override some of the functionality offered out of the box by the tools. A key example is Screen tracking by Firebase - which is notorious as it never tells the exact screen the customer is viewing. If you have a modal opening on an interaction within the app, Firebase might pick up the current activity controller or view controller (iOS or Android) and send that - which is of no consequence to the marketing end-user. Clean data at source is critical.Within this, you'll need to identify which of these journeys (or journey steps) are critical for marketing. This allows you to simplify implementation by forwarding this to Segment. Segment does a wonderful job at broadcasting the events to other tools.Heatmapping, as powered by UXCam, will be useful for your UX/UI teams to understand on screen behaviour. There will be a need to transfer basic customer level information & the previous screen for the UX team to map the numbers to journeys by segment. Use Segment for the broadcast, if you can.Some of the events generated by the user require real-time or near-real-time interaction. An abandoned cart as an event (or absence of an event) is a typical example. The journeys you've defined above will help manage this aspect of tracking. Again, Segment is your friend here.With the Segment + GCP integration, you should be able to extract information to generate reports and provide additional information to the marketing tools. Merging the clickstream data with some offline or online interaction can lead to better customer targeting. But, to do that, identify what is needed. Always work with an end-goal in mind - ensuring you've prioritized the requirements before proceeding.If you've made it this far into the article, I'm sure you know the common KPIs singled out in mobile tracking - CLTV, ARPU, DAU, etc. However, in my opinion, these are inconsequential. I'll iterate on this in a separate article, but every KPI that you track should be actionable and consequential. Knowing the DAU swinging month on month is of no consequence to either the marketing or the product team. However, DAU/MAU is a critical KPI for knowing the app engagement. If your app is good, the ratio will swing upwards of 20-30%. To keep things simple, I'll list down a few standard KPIs for app tracking and their interpretations. You should do this for every other KPI you wish to track.Taken usually over 7, 28, and 3 months, retention rates are indicative of your app's engagement. The formula for retention rate is simply the total number of users who had more than 1 session over the total number of installs in that time duration.Consequently, you should be breaking this down by first time users, returning users, and paying users (if there is a paying aspect to your app OR just use engagement as a metric - a key journey completion in your app that has to be completed, which isn't signup or login). This will give you an idea of an individual segment of users and their behavior on your app.In your app, identify a set of key journeys that you've implemented. In a transactional app, these could be Registration, Transaction, My Account Order View, Promo-engagement & Repeat Transactions. Based on these see how many journeys are completed on an average by a user. If the number is less than half of the journeys you've designed, it could be a reason to look at those which are not completed and revise/improve them.Alternatively, knowing which journeys are popular against those which you want to be made popular will help you prioritize the optimization pipeline.For every feature, there is a funnel - the user initiates interaction, the user follows through with it, and then the user completes the funnel. In retail, this could be as simple as a checkout funnel or as complicated as repeat purchases through multiple sessions. The idea is that the user will need to go through various steps and the efficiency of the steps will directly determine the performance of the feature.This boils down to having a feature level KPI set for success/failure.Coming to the end-game here. Based on my experience are some tips on tracking:You need to have a robust QA to ensure that the tracking you've implemented paints the right picture. Often, I've seen implementations that look good on paper, but when you dive deeper into the specifics of the tracking and the raw data sent over by the tool, there are inconsistencies. Watch out for Huawei devices, if you're in a supported region, which gives no device IDs, and iOS devices that can sometimes return blank values.Bad implementations have a two-fold impact - not only do they report incorrect, non-actionable (because you're always doubting the data) stats, they also cause your app tracking history to be shifted till the issue is fixed.When you end up implementing multiple tools for tracking various aspects, as shown above, the most notorious number you'll find is the number of app opens. Typically, Adjust, Firebase & Instabug will report vastly different numbers. The reasons for these can be many, but after you've vetted your implementation, ensure you designate one single source for App Installs/Active users, Attributions & Performance tracking each. Personally, I would give App Installs to Firebase, Attribution to Adjust & Performance numbers to Instabug.Once that is done, make sure everyone on the team uses that OR better still, when you roll up the data on GCP, use that for reporting. Best to ignore the tool UI.I cannot stress this enough - do not use GA/GTM for app tracking. It might be tempting given the ease of use they advertise, but remember where GTM/GA came from! They were primarily web tools. They've been modified for the mobile world and as such have some time before they reach a level of reliability. Adding these values can only complicate affairs.Unless you have the premium version of the app, the data is almost always sampled. This can throw off the curious business head or marketing manager.Standardize the reporting of business & marketing level KPIs by providing easy access to the raw data via scheduled reports & data reporting tools. You do not want the finance & marketing teams reporting different numbers of app download or revenue numbers.Be wary of the reported stats. With changing OS level privacy implementations (looking at you iOS), it is becoming difficult to know what is real and what is not. As said earlier, it's best if you build your own identity for the user and merge it later. Multi-device might make a smaller percentage of users than you think.As with your features, always close the tracking loop. If you have tracking loose ends - data flowing from one system but not sinking into another system in time for processing is an open-end that can cause more problems than it solves. Your data flow diagrams need to have a termination or a loopback.The number of times I've seen things like EventOpenMyAccount has infuriated me! There is a simple event labeling convention you can use that will make the end-users life simple. Events are consumed in the future, therefore, their names have to be in the past! It's My Account Opened, not My Account Open. These things matter. And don't have the word event in an event label - we all know what you're talking about.Your data dictionaries are the difference between spending one hour every day with marketing teams going over the definition of each term in your event repo and spending time analyzing and parsing new data. Keep them updated!While it is tempting to reduce the development effort by foregoing a user/event attribute, remember that a full revision cycle for apps takes a lot longer than the sprint cycle you have. It is not 2 weeks of dev & release. It is that followed by 1 week of app submission & approval, followed by ~2-3 weeks of app update cascading to 95% of the users. You're losing anywhere between 1-2 months of relevant data by foregoing an attribute.-Hope this was helpful for you to build your data strategy. I'm fascinated by the level of innovation happening in this sector and the beautiful innovative ways some of these tools parse data and skirt the privacy restrictions. Honestly, 4 years ago, this canvas would have looked different. As such, one caveat is that this information is true till something better comes along!

"I spent a night in a camper van in a Cracker Barrel parking lot, and the experience revealed a surprising side of the van-life movement","An Insider reporter spent a night at a Cracker Barrel outside Philadelphia. It introduced him to a side of van life that social media rarely shows.By Frank OlitoWhen I rented a camper van for a weekend, I expected a road trip filled with stunning landscapes and unforgettable views, like those shared with the #vanlife hashtag on social media.Instead, I spent the night in a Cracker Barrel parking lot.The strange adventure started when I rented a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van in January from Outdoorsy and enlisted the help of my friend to drive to Philadelphia and spend the weekend in the van with me. Together, we endured a cold evening in the parking lot of the restaurant chain.Here's how we ended up in a Cracker Barrel parking lot, what the experience was like, and how it shaped my view of van life.At first, I was looking for overnight parking in national parks and campgrounds. Quickly, I realized that most of these were closed because it was off-season.After asking for advice from full-time van-lifers, I learned of the best-kept secrets about van life: Most van-lifers sleep in parking lots. In fact, I learned that Walmart is one of the most popular overnight parking spots for van-lifers and RVers - not beaches and national parks, like many might assume.After researching overnight parking at Walmart, I learned that I needed permission from a manager to spend the night. I called a few Walmarts around Philadelphia, and none could grant me permission to park overnight.Luckily, my research also showed that Cracker Barrel was another popular destination for van-lifers. The first Cracker Barrel I called immediately granted me permission to park overnight.On our journey down to Philadelphia, we hit traffic, so the two-hour trip turned into a three-hour road trip.While sitting in traffic, I became increasingly worried about sleeping in the Cracker Barrel parking lot. I wondered if the phone call was enough and whether I needed to go inside the restaurant and ask for permission again. I even imagined the police knocking on the door of the van in the middle of the night, forcing us to leave.I also worried about our safety. Sleeping overnight in a strange parking lot just outside a city didn't seem like the safest option for two people who had never experienced van life before.When I saw the large parking spaces designated for RVs, I knew all my worries were for nothing. The fact that the company created these spaces put my mind at ease, and I knew we wouldn't get in trouble for parking there overnight.When we arrived, the Cracker Barrel was already closed for the night, so I had to look elsewhere for food. Luckily, there was a Wendy's across the parking lot. Unfortunately, though, only the drive-thru was open, and the camper van exceeded the height limit, so I had to awkwardly wait in line outside with the cars and walk through the drive-thru.I decided to eat my Wendy's outside the camper van because the interior was already starting to feel too cramped for two people. Many van-lifers have told me that the best part of the lifestyle is how you can do most things outside, and I loved the idea of eating my dinner just outside my temporary home. But that night was cold, and I shivered as I ate my chicken nuggets.Read more: 10 things I wish I knew about van life before spending a weekend in a camper vanThis was the first night of my road trip, so I had never made the bed before. Though it may seem simple to just move the cushions and then unfold the platform, it was much more difficult in practice. It was nearly impossible to find a place to put the large cushions in the van when I was trying to build the bed.Additionally, putting a fitted sheet on a bed that's up against three walls is something I never wish to do again. I was crawling around the bed for a full 10 minutes attempting to shove the sheet into each corner before it popped out of another.We had to use our phone's hotspot for WiFi because neither the van nor the Cracker Barrel had WiFi that we could use. Since the reception wasn't great, the show did freeze a few times.At that moment, I struggled to imagine how people could work full time in their camper vans with such spotty internet (though some vans have WiFi setups).The thermostat on the wall above the bed kept giving a strange error message, which made zero sense to me. Slowly, we came to accept that the heat was broken and that we had a cold night ahead of us. Almost simultaneously, we also learned that none of the outlets were working, so we couldn't charge our phones.We decided we were too tired to deal with these issues, so we bundled up and just went to sleep. We would worry about it in the morning (or so I thought).Just before falling asleep, my worries from earlier crept back into my mind. We were the only vehicle parked in this parking lot, and the van stuck out like a sore thumb. Was it safe to be sleeping in this spot? Should we move the van to a spot that's more hidden?Another thought kept bothering me: I'm about to fall asleep in a parking lot.It felt like a strange thought. It felt even stranger that a whole group of people chooses to do this every night to make their van-life dreams a reality. It upset me even more that there are some people who live in their cars in parking lots during the cold winters involuntarily.Read more: 10 safe places to travel with your RV this springUnfortunately, the broken heater was a bigger issue than I had expected, and just bundling up did nothing to protect me from the cold weather. All night long, I kept waking myself up because it was so cold. Since the van was barely insulated, my friend and I were basically sleeping outside in the middle of the winter.At another point in the night, a garbage truck startled me awake. The RV parking spots were directly across from the Cracker Barrel's dumpsters, so the banging of the truck sounded like an earthquake inside the van. I stayed awake, shivering until sunrise.In the morning, my friend and I commiserated over the terrible night's sleep we'd had.We also decided it would be too difficult to turn the bed back into a seating area (only to make it a bed again later that night), so we kept the bed folded down. Unfortunately, that meant I had nowhere to sit and eat my breakfast, so I stood awkwardly in the middle of the kitchen.As I ate my pancakes, eggs, and bacon, I realized that the proximity to delicious food was one of the only positives to sleeping in a Cracker Barrel parking lot.During my lengthy FaceTime call with the van's owner, I was told to open one of the benches beneath the bed and to press a bunch of buttons on one of the systems. Though I had no idea what I was doing or even what I was looking at, I realized that if I had to live in this van full time, I would have to learn and understand all these systems inside and out, leaving me better prepared for a night in a parking lot.In the end, we were able to fix the outlets, but the heater remained out of commission.As we pulled out of the parking lot, I realized that my experience was something I'd never seen on social media. The van-lifers I follow post pictures of themselves parked near a beach or in a beautiful landscape. They never post pictures of themselves parked in a Cracker Barrel or Walmart parking lot. They never talk about shivering through the night. And they never share images of themselves eating in the middle of the kitchen with nowhere to sit.When I returned, I talked to Dan Lin, who has been living in a camper van with his family of five since 2008. He told me that my experience was a more accurate representation of what van life is really like.""This lifestyle has been so overly glorified on social media, I'm surprised experiences like yours aren't more common,"" Lin said.Obviously, social media shows only a small portion of one's life, but the realities of van life were so far from what I had expected.Read more: Social media makes living in a camper van look like the simple life. The reality is a lot more complicated.Though I didn't enjoy my experience in the Cracker Barrel parking lot, I'm glad van-lifers have this as a safe option when campgrounds or parks are closed and zoning laws are working against them.That said, I wish van-lifers were more open about this legitimate form of parking.My grid on social media is filled with camper vans parked next to beaches and picturesque landscapes. But I learned firsthand what van life is really like after staying overnight in the Cracker Barrel parking lot. I learned what happens in between glamour shots that van-lifers post on social media, and I didn't love what I saw.Though many van-lifers don't have any issues with sleeping in a parking lot overnight or repairing their home consistently - and others have a comfortable night with far less - I quickly learned I am not one of those people who would choose this life voluntarily.For more great stories, visit Insider's homepage.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2600/0*T3dYZpjfPwXtB2bc,https://medium.com/insider/i-spent-a-night-in-a-camper-van-in-a-parking-lot-it-revealed-a-surprising-side-of-van-life-f4013aa8ec47,travel,027f8f96aa9a5c2045c8eb22f17e473b656d9aaf601cfa3c7a11b1c2
"Sorry, but We're Not All Leaders","Over the past week I counted 29 stories from really solid writers that featured phrasings like ""We as leaders need to..."" or ""In our leadership roles we must...""Who is this collective ""we"" everyone's talking about?I'm not railing against this perspective entirely, but is the working assumption that everyone reading these articles is a leader?Can they be? Should they be?And before you blow a gasket about this, I want to invite you on a journey of perspective. And on this journey I want companions, so once you've made your way through, please argue my points and make your own.As you read further, you'll understand why I believe this conversation is of serious importance.This is a good place to start, and it's also where most people get tripped up. As a formal idea, leadership is a massive subject, but the task of recognizing leadership is kind of like recognizing pornography - we know it when we see it.Or perhaps more paradoxically: we know (or feel) when it is not there.I write on this topic a lot, usually through the lens of organizational life. I believe the process of understanding leadership is a noble pursuit, and it may be one of the most important things to ponder - and by ponder I don't mean ""give ourselves the title and figure out what to do with it later.""In my musings, I often quote scholar Peter Northouse. You might say he 'wrote the book' on the subject - literally, he wrote a book called Leadership.I subscribe to the definition he poses in his compendium:Notice the words in Northouse's definition. Process. Influence. Common goal. Then notice what is missing. Nowhere in the simple line does it say anything about a position, title, years of experience, or education. Yet how often are we led to believe that someone is a leader if they are in a certain role, with a certain title, with certain credentials, for a certain period of time? More on this later.One caveat before we go further. You may read everything herein from one of two perspectives - that of someone who considers themselves a leader, or, thinking about others who may (or may not) themselves be leaders. Either way, we all have something to teach others or to learn ourselves. Heck, one of my less-favorite managers even taught me the best way to clink a wine glass to get a room's attention - you clink the stem, not the bowl.I have been an active student of leadership for well over 20 years - formally through certificate and degree programs, and informally through nearly as many years in the workforce. And over these several decades, my view on the subject has changed drastically.Rather than paint you a word picture, here instead is a graph, since people seem to like visuals.The direction of the blue line isn't necessarily tethered to any specific events. Rather, it demonstrates how non-linear a leadership track can be, and often is. It's certainly the truth for me.After ~20 years, I am now responsible for more people, projects, and impact than ever before. I have greatly increased my influence and believe deeply in my ability to encourage my people to work towards a common goal.Leadership might await me, one day. I aspire to it and I'm working to grow into it, but I'm not there yet, and my journey is forward and onward - and not necessarily upward.That's a funny thing to admit. Again, the above graph isn't literal, but I definitely felt differently about this idea earlier in my career. In fact, I remember my LinkedIn profile used to say something like ""Nonprofit leader with 12+ years experience.""At some point, after a major ego check, I realized there's a ton of professional development to do before I make that claim. (Side note: I'm much more fond of what my profile says now: ""Learning what makes nonprofits - and their people - great."")Remember how Northouse's definition excluded a few things? Let's touch on some of those routinely misunderstood leader traits.This is low-hanging fruit to tackle when it comes to leadership. We don't need another story about the difference between management and leadership. (You can read more about that here, here, or here.) What I do want to stress is how irrelevant title and hierarchical status are within the definition.I am a 'director' now, and though I manage people, projects, and impact, when I think back 15-20 years, I had just as much potential to exert influence when I was 'manager' or 'coordinator.' I may not have chosen to lean into that influence or activate it (for myriad reasons) but the opportunity was there.That's really the point. I've been led and influenced by just as many executive assistants and volunteers as I ever have been by C-suite managers. I'm not suggesting the title doesn't help, though it's not a liberal license to lead.There are people out there who love to remind you how long they've been doing something, like it's a free-pass merit badge. Experience is hugely important, but it helps to know that just because you may know longer than someone, it doesn't mean you know better than them.I've been in more senior roles than colleagues with less experience, thinking I had all the information I need, only to be proven wrong time and time again. This still happens for me, and I imagine it always will. One of my more humbling and useful experiences has been learning what I don't know.""There is no end to education,"" notes Jiddu Krishnamurti. ""The whole of life... is a process of learning."" Doubly true for leaders.What you have studied won't, necessarily, make you a leader in that particular industry. I studied nonprofit management as an undergrad, and that's a large part of what I do now. However, at the level where I am, most of my education has been done on the job and I can hearken back to very little of what I formally learned 20+ years ago.More broadly, say someone went to school for building widgets. After graduating, they go and become a widget-maker. In fact, they become some company's best-ever widget-maker. That person may be promoted to a higher level of widget-making or, possibly, put in charge of other widget-makers.They may be highly skilled in the making of widgets, but in this loftier post, their previous training is not doing them - nor the people they manage - any favors. (You may be familiar with this as the ""Peter Principle."")After a few decades off, I'm a student once again myself, studying leadership and organizational development in a graduate program. As I traverse the degree program, I'm fascinated with how little formal knowledge I had about the theories of leadership, and I'm glad to have some of it now.But as with anything else, it's what we do with the knowledge we have that defines us - not the knowledge alone.You've made it this far, and I want to make sure you get some practical bits out of this whole exercise. Let's move from Northouse's big-picture definition to something more actionable.Two names you should know in this arena are Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner. They focus on the idea, ""how to make extraordinary things happen in organizations"" better than most anything I've come across. And they approach this big idea through the lens of leaders in their pivotal book, The Leadership Challenge, which they've been refining for more than 30 years.Difficult as it may be to say what leadership is, Kouzes and Posner outline some incredibly useful, measurable behaviors - not that doing them immediately makes someone a leader, but it's the best roadmap I've seen.They center on five practices, and all aspiring leaders should be familiar with them. All quotes are from The Leadership Challenge.This is one of those things I got really, really wrong when I first started managing people. I would often provide instructions, while not fully realizing that people were watching whether I practiced what I preached.One glaring example is how I would tell my teams not to respond to emails I send early in the morning or late at night, but I kept finding that they would. Once I asked a colleague why she was doing this, and the response was something like, ""Honestly, you're our boss, and if you're sending an email at 8p.m., we feel like we have to respond."" Afterward, the delay-delivery feature in Outlook and Gmail quickly became my best friend.My industry is nonprofit fundraising, which is a rather peculiar job when you think about it - asking people to part with 100% of their money for nothing tangible in return. I've worked alongside true leaders in the field, and what they do better than anyone is demonstrate (for financial donors) how their philanthropy will help change the world.If that's not inspiring shared vision, I don't know what is.I can point to one singularly amazing example of this. At a former arts organization, the power went out during one of our performances - it was hurricane season here in Houston - and our production team was ready to call the show and send everyone home.Our executive director said ""Hang on a minute..."", gathered a few of us, and had us run to the storage room where we all grabbed boxes of little electric votive candles. We handed them out to the entire audience and placed them around the stage, and within 10 minutes we were able to resume the performance almost without missing a beat.This was one of the most brilliant examples of leadership-in-action I have ever experienced.Enabling others is one of those unique actions that are not tied directly to role or hierarchy, and the actions don't need to be sizable. Back in 2019, my team was pulling together a massive project, and I was feeling near the end of my rope with one specific task.I vividly recall one workday when I was frustrated and went for a walk around the block to clear my head. Sensing my state of mind, one of my teammates snuck into my office and left a Post-It on my computer monitor that read, simply: ""YOU GOT THIS!""It was such a small gesture, but in this act she made me feel invincible and appreciated. It reignited my embers, and it was a positive turning point for the remainder of the project.Last week I was at my computer when my Zoom started ringing. Even after this pandemic year, this is the first time someone randomly called me that way, similar to how people used to stop by our offices unannounced in years past. It was a colleague in a different department I worked with on a project back in the fall.It was a lot of fun, and when it was complete I sent her manager a note letting them know what a joy she was. Somehow word got back to my colleague and she was Zoom-ing to share her appreciation.I could tell this kind of encouragement was rare, which made it feel all-the-more important. I know it also inspired her manager to think more favorably about her.I can't confirm whether you are a leader or not. Frankly, I'm not sure any one of us can ever know that about ourselves. If you've made it this far and are still grumbly about my opening thesis, please, share your thoughts.And, please, also be self-reflective. Many who are in leadership positions - whether or not they are leaders as defined herein - have people in their orbit for whom they're responsible. And if there are people in your charge, you have an obligation to care for them, their growth, their productivity, and not least of all, their well-being.If anything in that preceding paragraph seems off-base or below you, then yes, I might suggest you are not, in fact, a leader. There is a strong need for service to others in the ethos of leadership, and if serving is beneath you, then leadership is beyond you¹.Big thanks to May Pang for leading this piece in its most-right direction.¹ This line is sometimes attributed to Robert Greenleaf, grandfather of servant-leadership, though at best it seems to be anonymous.",https://miro.medium.com/max/5214/0*fWVBh8q7MFWZvsR_,https://medium.com/swlh/sorry-but-were-not-all-leaders-ac2843fe8a7a,leadership,29a1b1540aec9c78e9a41fa196ab630f8a88d53cf5d6b92af6c304c2
Where is the Strategy in your Strategy?,"My original idea for this article was to dive into the heart of all the terminology around a strategy to find the part that is actually ""the strategy"". By this, I mean ""strategy"" in the everyday sense. What is the core principle, idea, or decision that is being applied to get from the current state to somewhere closer to the vision.... and then something strange happened.I was looking back at my Strategy 101 article so that I could reference the terms that I define there. I wanted to link that to my Strategy on a Page that I've discussed. The Strategy on a Page clearly indicates a ""Policy to Apply"" section, which is the core of the strategy. The Policy to Apply is part of Richard Rumelt's kernel of a good strategy. A strategy is only good if it makes decisions about what you are going to do and what you are not going to do. These decisions need to be written down. They form the real ""strategy"" in a strategy. So I looked to the Strategy 101 terms for the corresponding term, and I realized that there wasn't one.I had forgotten the strategy in my strategy!Here's the original diagram that I presented. I wanted to present a simple, accessible view of how the various terms that we hear on the subject of strategy relate to one-another.The idea is that the strategic plan leads from the current state toward achieving the chosen objectives. It is done in the context of the Mission, Values, and Vision for the organization.(As an aside, I intentionally drew this diagram using the basic shapes in Google Slides. I want to show that you can use the tools you have at hand to get your point across. You shouldn't limit yourself because you think you need fancy, expensive drawing tools to create your diagram.)Let me present an updated version of the diagram.I've made three changes here.First, I added a box for ""Principles"". This was the missing part of the picture. The principles are the decisions you are making that guide you to the chosen objectives. You start with your Principles and the Current State. The Principles help you decide which goals are the right ones and which tactics are appropriate to reach those goals.Principles are different and separate from Values. The Values talk about your culture (real or aspirational) and your ethics. Along with the Mission, they define the context for the strategy. Your Mission and Values should remain fairly constant over time. On the other hand, if something changes in your strategic environment, you may change the Principles you choose to apply to reach your Vision.The next change I made to the diagram was to move the Mission and Values outside the strategy in order to emphasize their role in providing context.Finally, I expanded the ""Strategy"" bracket to include the Vision. Now that Vision is visually separated from Mission and Values in the diagram, I can include it as part of the strategy. I think this is the correct place for it.Actually, there are a two lessons to be learned.As you continue to grow and mature in your ability to be strategic and develop good and useful strategies, be adaptable. Don't let your ego get in the way of doing the right thing. Be open to recognizing your mistakes and correct them as soon as you can.Most importantly, don't forget to put an actual strategy in your strategy.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*3XSiai_gBxIBSBGwZh0FbA.png,https://medium.com/strategy-for-the-rest-of-us/where-is-the-strategy-in-your-strategy-341201785ea,leadership,30b2377d5468a95c29e03bb0e2be36be97542f09b9f97ed7fea7cbf8
How Wearing Pants Again Dramatically Increased My Productivity,"330 days.That's the amount of time I've been working from home.In the beginning, it was perfect. Less commute time, no need to meet face-to-face and therefore more time for myself. I could invest that time however I wanted - new skills, online courses, reading more books.Then the complacency set in.I took a golden opportunity for productivity and squandered it. There were so many things I wanted to do but just didn't. Looking back, I blame my flippant attitude on what I wore during that period.You could almost chart my sartorial decline. As the coronavirus pandemic became more serious, the formality of my work attire decreased. What started off as small compromises snowballed into bigger ones. The virus wasn't the only thing that charted exponentially.You can call it Michael's Law.I am not proud to say how many days I wore sweatpants (or 'trackies' for my fellow Aussies out there). After some weeks I couldn't tell where the pants ended and my skin began. On most workdays, the top half was business. The bottom half was comfort. A great balance to strike I thought.But I slowly witnessed my productivity decline.An hour of Netflix during work? Why not. I was already in the clothes for it. A quick tactical nap before that big meeting? Of course. I can jump straight into bed with what I have on and no one will know. Familiarity breeds complacency.Whether you like it or not, we are all judged for how we look and dress. And we are our own worst critics. My outward dress was really a reflection of my inner state. A poor dress code represented a poor mindset.The standard I accepted was now the standard I lived by.There is a certain magic about putting on proper pants in the morning for work. Jeans, slacks or chinos. The tactile feeling of the pants, the judgemental constriction of the waistline primes my mind for a full day of productive work.While wearing pants, I hold myself to a higher standard.I sit up straighter. I talk with more confidence.Almost like how the uniform of a police officer or firefighter is imbued with certain rights and responsibilities. My pants function like my uniform. When I am in my work pants, I am in the mindset to save the world and get things done.The old advice is to ""dress for the job you want"". The new advice is to wear the pants that make you feel most productive.We have all felt it before. When we look good, we tend to feel better. Dressing up and being fancy once in a while is great for your mental well-being.When applied to work, what you wear can make you feel sharper and clearer. This faux confidence translates into more productivity and creativity in what I produce at work.But don't take my anecdotes as gospel. There is science behind this.An article by Scientific America details how the clothes you wear can significantly affect your physical and cognitive performance. They called this phenomenon 'enclothed cognition'.That is just a fancy way of saying certain clothes bring out certain cognitive performance.For instance, a paper in August 2015 in Social Psychological and Personality Science tested the link between clothing and cognitive tests.What they found was that:You wouldn't find an Olympic swimmer about to compete wearing a business suit. Nor would you fully trust a Doctor dressed in a clown suit. Every costume has an appropriate context.The old trick of imagining everyone in their underwear to get more confidence, the new trick is imagining yourself in pants to get more productive.You get the point.If you're not convinced, try it yourself.If you feel like your productivity working from home has been slipping, wear some nice pants. Maybe even a nice top.As working from home becomes the new normal, you need to find ways to stay on top of your game, stop complacency and maintain your productivity. Your environment is important and what you wear to work matters.

Tessica Brown and the Life Span of a Meme,"The month of February is barely halfway through, but it has been nothing short of a whirlwind for Tessica Brown (better known as 'Gorilla Glue Girl') as she became an instant meme after an unfortunate hair incident.In January, Brown found herself out of her Got2b Glued Spray, a hair product that ensures maximum hold on hairstyles. In an interview, she explains that her decision to use Gorilla Glue adhesive instead was due to her being in a rush to leave her house. She did this with the assumption that she could simply wash it out when she returned home. Unfortunately, Brown did not realize that Gorilla Glue adhesive is 100% waterproof and that her hair would be stuck in its style for over a month.On February 3rd, a month after applying the Gorilla Glue spray and failed attempts to get it out, Brown took to TikTok desperate to find a solution to her problem. She even goes as far as to demonstrate by putting shampoo directly on her head, scrubbing vigorously. But it is clear that not only will the shampoo not penetrate her hair, but it is easily wiped away with a towel. Her hair had essentially become an unmoveable helmet.While we can't be sure that Brown anticipated this, the TikTok video went viral with over 5 million views and 180,000 comments since it was first created.And the internet showed up right on time to roast and criticize Brown for this foolish mistake. The comment section of her video full of ""Sis, WHY"" and ""You Got2B smarter than this"". Comedians online took the opportunity to put in their two cents and get some jokes off as well. It's possible that even Brown saw just a bit of humor in the situation initially, as reflected by the video's caption: 'Stiff where????? Ma hair'But the only thing more scathing than the laughter was the criticism. Even more so when word got out that she was not a 'girl', but a 40-year-old woman. Why did this grown woman purposely put an industrial adhesive on her scalp? She already had it at her home, which suggests that she already knew what Gorilla Glue is typically used for. The particular one she used has large letters on the front saying ""HEAVY DUTY"", and warns to avoid direct contact with one's person. The product brags that it is water-resistant and can be used on things like wood, metal, stone, glass, brick, and concrete. A lot of people would believe that anything is used to keep bricks together should not be sprayed onto the scalp. At this point, sympathy was hard to come by for Brown until an Instagram update on February 7th.Brown eventually sought out treatment at a local hospital, updating the experience with her Instagram followers.Suddenly the incident has lost its humor as it became apparent that things were getting very serious. Brown was in immense pain, first letting hospital staff treat her scalp and attempting to use nail polish remover to loosen the glue. Eventually, she began doing the treatment at home with the help of her mother and sister.It is at this stage that we saw many people coming to Brown's defense. Her GoFundMe, during that time, had reached over $13,000 in donations in hopes of helping her fund any medical procedures she would need to solve this issue. Many took the opportunity to show their support for Brown, as well as emphasize to Black women the importance of embracing our natural hair texture rather than forcing ourselves into Eurocentric beauty standards.However, many were surprised by a verified blue check next to her name on Instagram bio, along with a reference to her ""management"". On top of this, rumors began circling around that Brown was even contemplating suing the Gorilla Glue company. These rumors were eventually addressed and denied by Brown herself, but the damage to her image was already in progress. It gave enough fuel for people who were already criticizing her to claim that the whole incident was just ""clout chasing gone wrong"", and already planted seeds of doubt in people who have already expressed their sympathy. Despite her giving an explanation and expressing regret for posting the video in the first place, many still viewed this incident as a stunt to get ""internet famous"".On February 10th, Brown flew out to Beverly Hills to meet with Dr. Michael Obeng. Obeng, the director of MiKO Plastic Surgery, felt compelled to come up with a chemical treatment that could help remove the glue from Brown's hair. When he saw Brown's story, he reached to her proposing this procedure and even offered to perform the $12,000 treatment for free.Thankfully for Brown, the procedure was successful. She was finally able to run her fingers through her hair for the first time in over a month. According to Dr. Obeng, Brown should recover fully in about two to three months.She, as well as many of her new followers, are breathing a sigh of relief knowing now that the hair/scalp nightmare is over. But, of course, with that, there are still many who have held on to their criticism and disdain for Brown's situation. Obeng offered to conduct this surgery for free, despite the fact that Brown had enough money from her donations to cover the cost. I'm sure there are plenty of people on GoFundMe who are feeling pretty upset that their problems couldn't get any help because they couldn't go viral.Even so, it makes my heart happy that a Black man from across the country expressed sympathy and compassion for this woman enough to do this for her. What can I say? Black excellence always has a way of coming back on top.To be completely honest, I'm personally very happy for her. While I don't really care if she was ""aiming"" to become a viral sensation or not - I personally don't believe that this was a stunt. Embarrassing? Yes. Dumb as all hell? Most definitely. But I would still never wish this type of pain or embarrassment on someone else.For some, her story is one of overcoming. And for others, she'll just always be that lady who was dumb enough to put industrial adhesive in her hair. In this world, there's no such thing as making everybody happy at the same time. To be fair, it's very questionable whether or not Brown would have been able to receive this type of treatment had she not posted her video on TikTok. I'm also not going to sit here and act as if I've never made an extremely dumb decision in my life. Brown just happened to publicize her mistake for the world to see; a decision that came with pain, embarrassment, but also, a solution.And if the meme cycle continues the same way I believe it will, we'll be on to the next thing by early March and Brown will be a distant memory. At least until the end of the year when we do our collective meme round-ups.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*wdheDUWrKTSSIIlt5zo66w.jpeg,https://ravenkeyana.medium.com/tessica-brown-and-the-life-span-of-a-meme-5d2e77bdc8bd,social-media,33b865d3e40e75cb6fb12c984ba504a5a7f469be059fb3c9b842779c
Silent Mice Drive Autism Gene Discovery,"Around 1 in 54 children in the U.S. are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, a broad range of conditions that include challenges associated with social skills, communication, and repetitive behaviors. This is not a single condition, but instead, a vast array of autism subtypes thought to be influenced by a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors.A recent study published in eLife details the discovery of a gene involved in ASD called KDM5A. This finding is particularly significant, given that experts estimate that many thousands of genetic mutations may be involved in ASD development. Until now, only around a third of cases have been linked to these known mutations. The work was led by Bruce Beutler, M.D., the 2011 Nobel Prize winner in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to him for his extensive work on the molecular basis of inflammation and infection.""The difficult part in the beginning was finding the mutations. It had to be done by laborious cloning,"" explained Beutler.""We developed a platform wherein when you see a phenotype you know the mutational cause at the same time."" This technique, which links ASD-like behaviors in mice to a specific genetic root cause, has fast-tracked the search for genetic mutations in ASD.In the study, Beutler and colleagues used an ASD mouse model in which genetic mutations were artificially introduced into the animals. The team studied how genetic alterations affected ASD development by tracking changes in how the mice communicated. The quality and number of vocalizations in mouse pups diminished with KDM5A mutations.""Initially we found that the quality of these vocalizations was different in mice with KDM5A mutations. Looking more closely, we found that mice completely lacking KDM5A have a severe deficit in the number of these vocalizations,"" explained Maria Chahrour, a neuroscientist that led the study.On top of being quieter than the control pups, these young mice also showed other trademark features of ASD symptoms: repetitive behaviors, difficulties learning, and less social interactions.""We've identified a new genetic subtype of autism, and we're going to look for more patients with mutations in KDM5A,"" said Chahrour. ""This has a direct impact on diagnosis too. When a clinician gets a clinical sequencing result that reports a KDM5A mutation, it's now a known autism gene.""Ongoing work is focused on further expanding the panel of ASD genetic biomarkers. ""The wonderful thing about forward genetics is that we can grind away at the genome. We know progressively how much of the genome we've saturated,"" commented Beutler.Originally published at https://www.labroots.com on December 31, 2020.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*WGXucXQHL7Sb7a6Z,https://medium.com/science-and-philosophy/silent-mice-drive-autism-gene-discovery-10a2d8f8d539,neuroscience,34ad13c6d337e94e68dda018cecd425a9b21bdd6eeca7156aa06dee1
Black Health Experts Urge Black Americans to Get Vaccinated Despite Inequitable U.S. Rollout,"On February 7, 60 Black health experts published an open letter in the New York Times opinion section urging Black Americans to get vaccinated for Covid-19. It acknowledged the hesitancy of some Black people to get vaccinated due to ""absolutely warranted"" historical distrust of health institutions, and it sought to dispel misinformation circulating in Black communities that called the safety of the vaccines into question.""We have reviewed the research and feel confident the research was done correctly,"" wrote the experts, who are all part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. They emphasized that the vaccination trials involved a diverse group of participants, including Black Americans.""While we understand why there might be hesitancy about getting vaccinated, we need to weigh the risks of taking the vaccine versus being infected by the virus and the potential of health problems, hospitalization, even death."" Read the rest of the letter below:Writing at Level this week, Michael Arceneaux acknowledged the New York Times letter but wondered if the experts' concerns about the spread of misinformation, though warranted, were ""moot"" amid the inequitable rollout occurring in the United States.""One look at how Black people are faring trying to get the vaccine tells you that we've got more pressing concerns,"" he wrote. Racial inequalities in vaccine access have been documented since the rollout began in the United States. As Dana G Smith wrote in Momentum in early February, ""In virtually every state with reported vaccination rates broken down by race, Black Americans have received significantly fewer doses than White Americans.""Arcenaux ends by questioning whether vaccine hesitancy among Black Americans is what health experts should be concerned about. ""The media has done plenty of work highlighting the hesitancy Black folks have about the vaccine - but not enough on how the rollout is giving us even more reasons to distrust the system,"" he writes.Read the rest of his story on Level:",,https://coronavirus.medium.com/black-health-experts-urge-black-americans-to-get-vaccinated-despite-inequitable-u-s-rollout-9b357af7f1e4,science,34cf07dca49bafad1cb9e52107ab9f11dc009a1aeeaddb61fc0adf99
TAM - The Holy Grail Of Business - Is A Sham,"The concept of Total Addressable Market, or TAM as it is popularly called, has taken the business world by storm in recent years. Back in October 2020, the Financial Times (FT) in an article, ""The total addressable market craze is detached from reality,"" cautioned about the burgeoning trend among ""companies using the term in their pre-IPO S-1 filings relative to the past five years."" A related graph depicted TAM references exploding from under 5 in 2016 to almost 50 in the first nine months of 2020. FT's point was that investors and analysts are increasingly buying into seemingly unlimited market opportunities without seriously questioning the reality of their associated TAMs.Then there was a Yahoo Finance article, ""Large Addressable Market Gives Palantir Plenty of Upside,"" of January 15, 2021 promoting the stock of Palantir (PLTR) by suggesting ""the total addressable market for the company is $119 billion"" without linking to the source - Seeking Alpha - that it had used to quote an enormous TAM number. If I were seeking alpha, wouldn't I want to verify my sources - especially relating to TAM, as it is increasingly cited by the business media these days?The Motley Fool in its January 27, 2021 article ""Shopify Has Yet to Tap Its Massive Addressable Market,"" began by stating, ""One of the reasons that I loved Shopify is because it has a massive addressable market."" Sounds exciting but not very convincing when it then draws this cavalier conclusion:""So I think that not only do you have the $78 billion in the small- to medium-sized business market, but then there's another untold billions of dollars worth of potential market share that they could get in the enterprise-level businesses. This just really does show, I mean, that's a huge potential market going forward...""TAM - another darling of Wall Street that doesn't jibe with Main Street.Yes, that's a lot of TAM - all of SMB and enterprise - but, by definition, it is not all monetizable by Shopify alone. Because there will be addressees that - don't want to buy from Shopify or can't be targeted by Shopify - are simply not monetizable. But then in the business world, a tiny slice of the pie is never as tempting as the whole enchilada. Especially, when one wants to attract investors from Menlo Park to Wall Street, who often seek these unreal TAM estimates in order to justify their investment decisions.It could be one of the reasons that retail investors on Main Street recently revolted against other valuation classics relied upon by institutional investors, such as, stock fundamentals and technical analysis. In an archetypal David vs. Goliath matchup, retail investors - using the increasingly popular Robinhood mobile trading platform - crashed the traditional trading framework of major hedge funds by pursuing a sustained short squeeze of selected stocks. On February 3, 2021, InvestorPlace in its report, ""5 Top Reddit Stocks To Sell After The Short Squeeze,"" warned investors not to be ""be left holding the bag when these Reddit stocks come crashing down."" Coincidentally, that BAG included Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) - three of the most wildly inflated stocks in, what is now referred to as, ""the Reddit trade."" This ""short"" digression serves only to make a point about how institutional valuation methods are being challenged by the little guys - who could set their sights on TAM, next, by questioning its validity in market valuations.The TAM sham exposed.So, whether one estimates TAM using a top-down, bottom-up or value-theory methodology, the heart of the problem is in ""addressable,"" which is invariably a pipe dream. To be fair, there are quantifiable measures to make TAM more realistic by qualifying it into subsegments such as, serviceable available market (SAM) and serviceable obtainable market (SOM). So, SAM becomes a subsegment of TAM that is targeted within the geographical reach of one's product and/or service and SOM, in turn, becomes a percentage of SAM that one can credibly capture. But these measures are a far cry from TAM, which is still used as the shiny investment object.Again, how often does anyone hear about SAM and SOM in investment pitches covered by the business media? It's TAM, TAM, TAM all of the time! TAM is what gets attention - because the unachievable Total Addressable Market is so much bigger, better and exciting! Why? It's what captures the imagination, it's what drives investment and it's what makes the money flow. Reality be damned! This TAM sham, as it were, is especially popular among startups and high-tech newbies in their fund-raising efforts with venture capitalists, private equity firms and the like.Moving from addressable to monetizable - Total Monetizable Market.Quite clearly, in the real world of monetizable markets, the focus needs to be on SOM - but it's already been deemed a loser just going by its lack of exposure in the media. SOM is akin to getting into the weeds of a business model and the related probability of capture - thus rendering it boring at an executive level in the boardroom and kind of SOMber detail when it comes to capturing eyeballs in visual media. But for the sake of truth in investing, business analysts need to defocus from TAM and refocus on SOM in financial plans. However, it's got to be rebranded under a new, more meaningful acronym, such as, TMM - Total Monetizable Market. To make TMM the new SOM, i.e., the new king of the world for business executives and investment gurus, let's take a look at a few key differentiators between TAM and TMM:*Marketing Automation PlatformThe above table makes it clear in succinct terms that TMM is a more accurate reflection of the achievable market by a business.Parting ode: TAM-I-Am.So, it's clearly time to put the kibosh on TAM and replace it with TMM. Change is difficult to accept, so let me conclude my case for TMM with a little humor. With apologies to Dr. Seuss, here's my parting shot at TAM:I am TAM. I am TAM. TAM-I-Am.That TAM-I-Am! That TAM-I-Am! I do not like that TAM-I-Am!Do you like startups and TAM?I do not like them, TAM-I-Am.I do not like startups and TAM.Would you like them in pitches or plans?I would not like them in PowerPoint pitches or business plans.I would not like them in any IPO exit stands.I do not like startups and TAM.I do not like them, TAM-I-Am.""Show me the money"" redux with TMM.Rest in peace, TAM! TAM has had a good ride, but now it's time to turn the spotlight on TMM. ""Show me the money"" has long been a popular refrain going back to Tom Cruise's 1996 movie, ""Jerry Maguire"" to today's Mr. Wonderful on the TV show, ""Shark Tank."" TMM does exactly that - it shows investors the total money (revenue) that a business can actually realize, as opposed to the total money (sales) that it can naively keep hoping for.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1924/1*N425SDZZzwKSggXV8C5g8Q.jpeg,https://medium.com/the-shadow/tam-the-holy-grail-of-business-is-a-sham-47fc4027f1c8,economy,36a02382bb1e3326180ca1a373e5cc5003989ddaa3c7f13148a5fd2d
The most important analysis for any digital fundraiser,"There are so many ways to slice and dice fundraising data, it can seem like an endless maze of analyses and visualizations. However, one view stands out above all the rest in giving immediately actionable insights; you can look at it to see the results of your test last night, or ring the alarm bell that something is underperforming as soon as it happens. This analysis will provide you a quick glance at your entire program in a single visual that you should review every day. In this article, I'm going to walk through each aspect to show you how each part plays a role in giving you the best at-a-glance view of your program you can get.Ideally the segmentation we choose will create detailed and actionable insights, so it needs to follow my rules for reporting. It should show a relevant comparison, segment by the most important groups and give the report reader a clear idea of next steps. After working on possible views for many digital fundraising clients, I have found the one segmentation that does this better than all the rest:That's a lot of information but it can all be shown in a super simple single table like the below. Each item is crucial in giving the best possible understanding of your fundraising. It's shouldn't be the only view you use - it doesn't look at large versus small donors for example - but it does give the best possible at-a-glance look at your entire program.Each item in this table is a deliberate choice:Number of donations - The most direct measure of the success of a campaign or creative. I view this as more important than revenue because it cannot be swayed by outlier large donations and is more important for understanding recurring and first-time donors.Daily - Look at the donations from each day. Reading this report should be a daily ritual. You'll want a weekly, monthly and quarterly view as well, but quarterly reports tend to be reviewed quarterly. Getting a feel for performance on a daily basis will keep you always thinking about how your actions each day have affected fundraising.Source - What channel did this donation originate in? Via the email program, the website? This is crucial because it allows the report reader to understand what steps can be taken to correct an issue and what team to refer the problem to. If you just notice donations are down, then you won't know where to start. If you see website donations fell drastically overnight, you can start checking for broken links.Previous Donation Status - Have you ever donated before? First-time donors and existing donors have disparate behavior patterns; tracking them separately can reveal patterns that can have immediate consequences. If a certain piece of creative works great for existing donors but cannot attract new ones, the true performance could be obscured. We always need to be thinking about growing the donor base and attracting first-time donors.Recurring Type - One-time, monthly or yearly; how often is the donation set to recur? Recurring donors are the most valuable donors to find in digital fundraising. Converting existing donors to recurring or finding ways to get first-time donors to become recurring at higher rates is another extremely valuable tool.Note also how I show my data, with the magnitude of donations, the percentage of each group and subgroup, and the comparison to those percentages. By comparing each to its percent of the total group and not the magnitude, you can better suss out if there is an issue in a small group even if every group is up or down overall. Now about those comparisons:Yesterday - The most important alarm bell to set off: did something happen overnight? The short timescale allows you to be able to react quickly to problems. The key is not getting caught up in small ups-and-downs.Same day last week - This is just for basic apples to apples comparisons, you want to compare Friday against Friday for the clearest picture.Same day last year - A timescale so that you can have apples to apples comparisons for holidays that occur on the same date.Rolling 30 day average - Smoothing out the bumps from the last month, was today's fundraising generally in line with performance? If yesterday was an outlier this can be a helpful comparison to see performance against a long term trend.Rolling 30 day average from one year ago - Showing even a longer term, is fundraising up or down? Also very helpful if today was a moving holiday like Thanksgiving. This is great to look at against the rolling 30 day average for the least bumpy year over year comparison.So what?Now that you have this built out so that you have all these insights at your fingertips, what should you do besides testing new emails and monitoring errors? You were doing that already.Well, since you now have a lot more knowledge about how your program affects your donors, you can optimize your program. There a lot of options from tweaking creative to running a deadline-style campaign. You may want to re-analyze old A/B tests with this segmentation in mind. My expertise comes in making the right size ask to each donor. This can be done by building a machine learning model to predict likely donation, or, something as simple as segmenting the ask by channel and donor type like the below.Just understanding your median donation by channel, donor type and recurring status can help you hone in on the best possible ask. Then the daily report will show who that ask is working for and who needs more tweaking. You can then expand this process of finding the best ask to push existing donors to make recurring donations.Once you have created this analysis and followed it daily for a few weeks, you will unlock an understanding of your donors that you never knew was possible. You will be able to create associations between your program and results organically that will make you feel even closer to your donors. Your backlog will brim with ideas on how to improve your process.If this analysis has helped you, or you need help creating it, contact me at shoveldata.me to tell me about it.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10796/1*K1aC6eM6cfjYix_cT5aQiQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/swlh/the-most-important-analysis-for-any-digital-fundraiser-b0eabde295dc,marketing,37b7446e3715d347d76c7ab96d0511e17fe859d894517742740c183a
Enjoy the Gentle Art of Freelance Bookkeeping for Taxes,"Learn about setting up your freelance bookkeeping, what a bookkeeping system does, reconciling your bank accounts, and getting reports for your tax return.Here we are in the next part of my friendly guide to freelance taxes. If you've been following along, thanks for sticking with me. If you're new here, I recommend checking out the introduction, so you can work out what the heck is going on!In the previous parts of this guide, I've given an overview of how taxes work, explained common tax terms for freelancers, and shared some good practices to set up your freelance business for tax simplicity.If you've not read it yet, you might want to look at how to setup your freelance business to make your taxes easier.We've also got some other helpful foundations you can put in place.Now, it's time to get into the day-to-day of running your freelance business.There are thousands of general guides out there on the various aspects of how to operate as a small business or freelancer, so we won't cover those areas. Instead, this part of the friendly freelance guide to taxes specifically explores bookkeeping in your freelance business to make taxes easier and less stressful.I'll be covering the following areas:I am not an accountant or qualified tax professional. These guides are intended only as general information, not as specific advice or recommendations. You should not rely on any of the information in these guides to make financial, tax, or other decisions. Always use official sources like the IRS website or your state's Department of Revenue to get accurate, up-to-date information.You should always speak to a qualified tax professional about your unique tax circumstances. These guides only apply to freelancers filing taxes as sole-proprietors or single-member LLCs in the United States. You'll find a disclaimer at the end of this article.If you're confused over any of the wording or terms I use in this article, check out my guide to freelance tax terms.A bookkeeping system, also known as accounting software, helps you manage the finances of your freelance business. You can easily track your revenue, expenses, and profits, which makes it easier to calculate how much tax you will need to pay.Bookkeeping systems track all of the money coming into and going out of your business and confirm that's correct by ""reconciling"" transactions with your business bank account. Typically, bookkeeping systems are made up of several features that work together to provide a complete picture of your financial freelance situation.Please note that these features and the names of the functions vary depending on the bookkeeping system you're using. There's a lot to bookkeeping systems, and I recommend reading through this guide to get a better idea of how they work.It's worth spending some time to get a good idea of freelance bookkeeping, as it will help you run your creative business more efficiently.A bookkeeping system will make running your freelance business much easier. I know from experience - moving to an online bookkeeping system reduced the time I spent on my business finances each month from around three to four days to less than a day. Here's how it can help you:This gives you better financial insight into your business, saves you time which you can then bill out to clients, and reduces the stress of not knowing where your money is going.Crucially, from a tax perspective, a bookkeeping system will tell you about how much profit you're making. This is shown on a ""Profit and Loss (P&L)"" report. It's that total profit over the year that you'll pay taxes on.Staying on top of your profits and losses makes calculating and paying estimated and end-of-year taxes much easier.I'm not going to make any specific recommendations about the ""best"" bookkeeping software, because I haven't tried all of them. There are several well-known online bookkeeping systems including FreshBooks, QuickBooks, Xero, and Wave. There are lots of comparisons of bookkeeping software online. Here's a good comparison from PCMag, another one from Investopedia, and another from The Balance.Almost every bookkeeping system has a free trial, so test out a few and see what works best for your freelance business.The actual process of setting up your bookkeeping system is out-of-scope for this guide to freelance taxes. All of the different accounting platforms have in-depth guides and support articles, which will help you get up and running. If you still need assistance, you can contact their support teams or speak to your accountant who can guide you.For the rest of this guide, we'll focus specifically on how an online bookkeeping system can help you with your taxes.Let's dig into some of the more important areas for optimizing your freelance bookkeeping for tax time.If you're a busy freelancer (and I hope you are), you'll know it's difficult to keep track of multiple projects at once. This means you can forget to bill what you're owed, and it's important to make sure you're paid for the work you've put in.Your bookkeeping system can help with this. Several systems have a built-in time or project tracking mode that can work with your freelance invoices. As you receive work for clients each month, open up an invoice for each one. Then, as part of completing various aspects of the work, add a time or project entry on your invoice to make sure your charges are up to date. At the end of the month or when the project is completed, you can send the invoice to the client, confident that you've charged for everything you owe.If you receive payments from freelance platforms or other areas, it's a good idea to create monthly invoices for that money as well.Adding all of your freelance invoices together will show your total revenue that you'll deduct your expenses from to work out your profits. Remember, it's the profits that you pay tax on.Creating invoices and charging as you go means you won't have a mad scramble at the end of the year when you're working out how much you've been paid.Just like invoicing, it's very important to stay on top of your expenses. You'll typically track your expenses in several ways:Expenses are important because they reduce the amount of tax you pay. Provided you've spent money that the IRS allows as an expense, that money gets deducted from your freelance revenue and you pay money on the remainder (your profits.)That means the higher your expenses are, the lower your profits, so the less tax you pay. The easiest way to make sure you don't forget to claim legitimate freelance expenses is to record them as you spend money.Expensing all of your legitimate freelance business costs reduces federal, self-employment, and state taxes.As I've mentioned a couple of times, you only pay federal, self-employment, and state taxes on your freelance profits. In a bookkeeping system, these profits are shown on your Profit and Loss (P&L) report.This report adds together all of your revenue from the invoices you've created, then subtracts all of your business expenses. What's left is your freelance profits or earnings, which is the important figure for working out taxes.You'll typically use your P&L profit calculations when you pay estimated taxes through the year on your freelance earnings.Review your P&L report every couple of weeks so you have a good idea of how much you're making and what you'll need to pay tax on.I've created this guide to help you understand your freelance revenue, expenses, and profits.I've also created a list of the expenses you can claim as a freelancer.You've heard me use the term ""reconciliation"" a few times, and it's worth exploring what that is. When it comes to managing your freelance business finances, you have two types of transactions:Reconciliation is the process of making sure that these two things match. This is important because you need accurate information to reliably report your freelance revenue, expenses, and profits on your tax return.Here's how to reconcile:Bookkeeping reconciliation is one of the main reasons it's a good idea to have a separate business bank account for your freelance business.You've probably heard the horror stories of people dumping a shoebox full of paperwork on their accountant's desks on April 10, when the tax filing is due on April 15. Unfortunately, for those freelancers who have a more laissez-faire attitude to bookkeeping, this creates a couple of problems:Now, much as you might like your accountant, I'm sure you don't want to contribute too much to their next BMW or Audi. Instead, staying on top of your bookkeeping and providing them with a neat P&L report will give them most of what they need to prepare your freelance earnings and taxes quickly.That means unless you're charging out your time at more than your accountant is charging out theirs (and wouldn't that be lovely!), it's more cost-effective to do your own bookkeeping.Put aside some time each week to go through and keep your bookkeeping system up-to-date to avoid the end-of-year panic.Alright, hopefully you're ready to start bookkeeping and reconciling your own accounts. This will go a long way towards keeping your freelance taxes simple. Next, we'll get into the other things you can do throughout the year to make things easier at tax time.I'm a freelance writer specializing in B2B content on business, finance, and technology.

Banjo Quietly Rebranded Itself Following Report on Former CEO's KKK Past,"Last April, OneZero revealed the CEO of digital surveillance firm Banjo, Inc. was once tied to the KKK and involved in the drive-by shooting of a synagogue. In the aftermath, Banjo's local and state contracts dried up, and CEO and founder Damien Patton was forced to resign.But new evidence suggests that in the months following OneZero's report, Banjo quietly rebranded as safeXai. Patton is still a minority shareholder in the company and an inventor of each of its patents.Within days of OneZero's report in April 2020, Utah's department of public safety suspended a $20.7 million contract with Banjo, and Banjo, in turn, suspended all of its operations in Utah, pending a review by the state auditor. Patton resigned and Justin R. Lindsey, a former chief technology officer with the FBI, took over as CEO.Then, on February 1, an independent commission convened by the auditor released recommendations for agencies contracting with ""advanced software technology"" companies. Among the recommendations: agencies should ""limit sharing of sensitive data,"" ""minimize sensitive data collection and accumulation,"" and ""validate technology claims."" The Salt Lake Tribune suggested it was ""a final blow to Banjo.""But was it?Documents reveal that in September, 2020 - five months after OneZero's report - Banjo filed for a new business license, at the same address with the same suite number as Banjo's headquarters, but under a different name: safeXai. Damien Patton is listed as a historical registered agent, director, and secretary of safeXai in corporate filings going back to 2010 and cited as an inventor of every safeXai patent. He also remains a minority shareholder in the company, according to safeXai's chief strategy officer, T.J. Marchetti.Reached by OneZero, Marchetti emphasized that Patton's role is limited.""Damien resigned in May 2020 and is not an officer, board member, or affiliated in any way with the day-to-day operations of safeXai,"" Marchetti said. ""He is a minority shareholder like any other employee who purchased shares in the past. We cannot speak on his behalf.""Marchetti declined to state what percentage ownership Patton holds in the company.Though Patton is listed as inventor on all of safeXai's patents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including one published in January, Patton does not own them. (Patton did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) Ownership was assigned to Banjo and has been reassigned to safeXai, meaning that Patton has no legal rights to market or use those patents.""Like any other employee, Damien Patton's rights to IP were and remain non-existent,"" Marchetti said.SafeXai's limited marketing efforts are virtually identical to Banjo's. Its website consists of one page that features a mission statement indicating that the company has ""embarked on a bold initiative to make the world a safer place... through the use of advanced signal processing and ethical artificial intelligence."" Banjo's marketing materials similarly touted that the company's use of ""advanced processing and artificial intelligence"" would ""save lives and reduce human suffering.""SafeXai officers include Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at Balderton Capital, which led a $16 million funding round for Banjo in 2014; and John Malloy, a general partner at BlueRun Ventures, which was one of Banjo's earliest backers, investing millions in the company as early as 2011, and has been quoted as speaking on behalf of Banjo investors in press releases, and an article in Inc.SafeXai's public messaging has been sparse, and it's unclear what kind of product the company is building. The company does not have a public Twitter or Facebook account, and while its LinkedIn page connects to dozens of current employees, the company has not yet published a public post. The company's ""core concepts lead,"" Hannah Lillywhite, gave a virtual presentation in an event produced by the Center for Anticipatory Intelligence at Utah State University on September 24, 2020. A safeXai machine learning engineer, Krishnamohan Pathicherikollamparambil, spoke on a panel about ""IT, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence."" Both are former Banjo employees, according to their LinkedIn profiles.None of the company's publicly facing information has mentioned Patton by name.Meanwhile, Banjo's contracts with the state of Utah are currently in the air. Chris Hughes, the director of Utah's division of purchasing and general services, told OneZero, ""Now that the audit is complete, we are just waiting from the attorney general's office on how to proceed with the contract.""Lindsey, safeXai's CEO, did not respond to an email request for comment. In an email to OneZero, Marchetti said that, ""despite confidence in our past technology and protections of personal privacy,"" safeXai would not ""pursue prior contracts even after the state's audit was complete.""Marchetti's LinkedIn profile indicates he's been with safeXai since December 2017. He served as chief strategy officer for Banjo, according to venture capital information site MicroVentures, and is noted as a Banjo board member in a 2014 Variety article about his digital marketing work with Disney and DreamWorks Animation.Rebranding after a corporate crisis is common. Private security firm Blackwater famously reorganized as Xe Services following a string of horrifying incidents, including one in which several contractors were convicted of varying charges of murder and manslaughter in relation to a 2007 massacre in Nisour Square, Baghdad, in which 17 Iraqi civilians were killed. The company then rebranded again as Academi in 2011, with The Wall Street Journal reporting its executive team was tired of being ""the company formerly known as Blackwater,"" and quoted its CEO as hoping it would be more ""boring."" The company then rebranded a fourth time after a merger and became Constellis Holdings. Similar name changes have occurred with private prison company CoreCivic (formerly Corrections Corporation of America), Altria Group (formerly Philip Morris), and Livestrong (formerly Lance Armstrong Foundation).Whether a rebranding strategy will work for Banjo is unclear. Damien Patton founded the company, appeared at conferences as its public face, led all its strategic transitions, and, most importantly, was a lead inventor on all of its intellectual property.Thom Fladung of Hennes Communications, which has handled corporate communications crises for Fortune 500 companies, says that in rebranding efforts, companies like Blackwater often try to evolve the way their organization does business and the kinds of contracts they take on.""You can't communicate your way out of a problem like this,"" Fladung says. His advice would be ""to completely separate from Patton in every way.""Marchetti said that's exactly what safeXai plans to do.""It's pretty common for a new CEO of a startup to reset with a clean slate, and Justin [Lindsey] has us focused on a new path,"" Marchetti said. ""During the fall, we also decided, despite confidence in our past technology and protections of personal privacy, that we were not going to pursue prior contracts even after the state's audit was complete. It simply didn't make sense given safeXai's new direction. Additionally, none of our products in development rely upon Banjo's past technology or patents.""Matthew Giles contributed reporting.",,https://onezero.medium.com/banjo-quietly-rebranded-itself-following-report-on-former-ceos-kkk-past-11223803c19d,business,38b89395392aa4d9405db58fcda78e5ec28f5825dd02b0d1c1bd0494
Twitter Hashtags Are A New Battlefield for Information Warfare,"When I saw #AOCLied and #AlexandriaOcasioSmollett trending on Twitter last week, I realized what it was - information warfare. Information warfare, which has existed for several years, has taken on a new battlefield. Social media has become a new tool for shaping minds. But just like propaganda, information warfare on social media doesn't have to be accurate. It just has to fit a narrative.The hashtags were designed to convince people Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.,) known as AOC, lied about hiding during the Capitol attack. Ocasio-Cortez's office is in the Cannon building, which is attached to the main Capitol building by a tunnel. Both buildings were evacuated during the Jan. 6 attack. She never said she was in the main Capitol building. But the hashtags were part of a smear campaign to make people believe she exaggerated to gain sympathy.""Ocasio-Cortez was attacked on social media with bad-faith attempts to discredit her story by people who falsely claimed she exaggerated the danger she was in because she wasn't actually inside the main Capitol building where the House and Senate chambers are located,"" said Snopes, a site that debunks online rumors and conspiracy theories. Snopes also called the AOC smear ""mostly false.""But even though this story has been debunked, many people will still believe it. Disinformation has a nasty habit of sticking in people's minds. Many Republicans still believe President Barack Obama was born in Kenya, and that lie was shot down more than 10 years ago!""The sad thing about disinformation is that once the truth comes out, the damage has already been done,"" said Ocasio-Cortez in a tweet. ""People have already been misled, radicalized & believe lies to a point where their hatred has brewed to violence. That's what led to the 6th, and it's happening right now.""Conservatives loathe Ocasio-Cortez. She's liberal, she's not white and wants to upset the political order. She's also a Democratic socialist, which is worse than being a Satanist in many Americans' eyes. So naturally, she's become a target ever since she burst onto the political scene.Her name frequently appears in the FOX News ticker as an example of everything wrong with the Democratic Party. Other Republicans have used her as a boogie man to scare donors into digging into their wallets to stop AOC and other People of Color from taking their houses and money.""She is the frequent target of smear campaigns and disinformation. She has stated multiple times that right-wing smear campaigns have prompted death threats against her,"" said Snopes.Information warfare is just the latest way of attacking her. But many hashtags are blatantly incorrect. I recently saw a hashtag about President Donald Trump that read #bestpresidentever. It was ridiculous, but it was there to drive a narrative and get Republicans fired up.Many of these hashtags are driven by bots, software programs that automatically retweet a word or phrase. And that's the reason why a hashtag can appear and in a couple of days have more than 100,000 retweets. The retweets are being driven by artificial intelligence.However, a new counter-offensive has started in information warfare. Cyber warriors have hijacked these tweets and reposted information contrary to what the hashtag is trying to promote. I did this when I saw the ""bestpresidentever"" hashtag. Although it was trying to promote Trump, I filled the hashtag with negative Trump stories.Young people, who are more skilled at this technology than their elders, have proved adept at cyberwar counter-offensives. When the anti-AOC hashtag was trending last week, fans of Korean pop music, known as K-pop stans, filled the hashtag with images of Korean pop stars and cute animals.""K-pop fans are known for hijacking hashtags and for spamming their feeds with photos and videos of K-pop performers,"" said Newsweek. ""On Sunday, K-pop fans flooded the #BidenLied hashtag, which originated in Twitter users disappointed in the news on stimulus checks, but soon turned into a feed of Korean girl groups. In January, K-pop fans pulled a similar stunt when supporters of former President Donald Trump tried to get the hashtag #ImpeachBiden trending, just says after President Joe Biden's inauguration.""Last year, TikTok users and K-pop fans reserved tickets at Trump's super spreader rally in Tulsa, Okla. And because of their efforts, large segments of the crowd were empty because seats had been reserved by people who never intended to use them. It was a humorous, skillful way to troll Trump from the safety of your own home.Hashtags have a motive. They don't just magically appear. Like Fox News, the goal of many of these hashtags is to get you to believe something that's not true. It's a new form of the old game of propaganda and mind control. When you see a hashtag, you need to look at it as critically as you view a Fox News headline.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1264/1*uZZr3NGszypppBSbcxmGOQ.png,https://eaafolabi.medium.com/twitter-hashtags-are-a-new-battlefield-for-information-warfare-1a62b426b450,social-media,38e3a6cfef45394bbc8378a645bb80fb3dcd0eea848389725bb6470a
Pokémon's 25th Anniversary Needs to Mark a Pivot for Mainline Games,"When the Pokémon company coined the catchphrase ""Gotta Catch 'Em All,"" they weren't talking about pocket monsters. They were talking about our hearts. Ever since I was young, I've always loved the Pokémon franchise. From the anime series to the video games, Pokémon has been something I've adored. After the release in 1996, the Pokémon IP has grown tremendously, still triumphing today as a globally known media franchise. One of the most successful games in the series, Pokémon GO, earned over $1 billion in 2020 alone. That's a lot of money for a game that's largely played outdoors to earn during a quarantine.Despite Pokémon's apparent success, the mainline series of games has stagnated for years. Pokémon Sun and Moon were amazing send-offs for the last games released on the Nintendo DS line of systems, but the release of Sword and Shield were massive disappointments. They sold handsomely and made a profit for Nintendo, but the games themselves were exceptionally uninspired and, frankly, boring. From the music to the story (or lack thereof), the latest entry in the mainline series of Pokémon titles left much to be desired. It's time for the series to innovate.At its core, the mainline Pokémon games are JRPGs. Other than the fact that these games are developed within Japan, this is apparent by its turn-based combat systems, character-based parties, and a narrative built around growing as powerful as possible. These tropes are fine and well, as even some of the most popular JRPGs to date still utilize them, but Pokémon follows a tried and true path with every release.You are a trainer in your home region. You are heading out on a journey at a young age to battle gym leaders across the region. By the end, you aim to defeat the Elite Four and become the champion of your region. This foundational story structure is and has been vital to the Pokémon series since its inception with Pokémon Red and Blue, but the series' spices the story up with every release. Game Freak, the developers of the Pokémon games, keep things somewhat interesting through their usage of villainous groups.The original Pokémon games had Team Rocket. The comically mischievous partisan group, gang, or company that has an ultimate, idealistic goal holding the faction together. These groups often have world-changing beliefs that challenge the current establishment in some way, shape, or form. In Pokémon Sun and Moon, the gang known as ""Team Skull"" strayed from this idea in such a way that was profound.Instead of a group hell-bent on freeing Pokémon from the human grasp, or reshaping the face of the planet, Team Skull was simply a band of misfit teenagers who didn't fit in with the rest of society. They cowered away from the rest of the Hawaiian themed ""Alola Region,"" banding together in their deviant group as a pestering bunch. Instead of being a major threat to the establishment within Alola, Team Skull was simply a flock of lost teenagers who formed into street thugs. Eventually, the group is reformed into an ally faction as the events of the game unfold.Team Skull is an example of innovation and change within the Pokémon series of games. This idea of growth for the series doesn't stop at the faction, though. Pokémon Sun and Moon also boasted an introduction of a new type of Pokémon, dubbed Ultrabeasts, which shook up the foundation of what a ""Pokémon"" even was.Still, even as I played through Sun and Moon, I couldn't help but notice the tiring turn-based mechanics. More often than not, the combat itself slowed to drag, and the hype surrounding a battle quickly diminished as I began to painfully await the next story section.After playing through Pokémon Sun and Moon, then Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, my disappointment with Sword and Shield grew. Game Freak left the basic, monotonous Pokémon gameplay systems as is. It led to a dry and uninspiring experience that lacked the heart and care seen in other Pokémon installments.The transition from handheld to console did not do the series justice. Textures were flat, gameplay animations were almost the exact same from the previous generation, and the camera (for the most part) was still fixed throughout the game. An introduction of the ""Wild Area"" (a large, open-area where trainers could catch Pokémon and encounter other players) seemed innovative and daring for the team to tackle, but it fell flat mechanically. It was a mile wide and an inch deep, resulting in me avoiding it for most of my playthrough.Pokémon Sword and Shield had a story that wasn't fully embraced until the end of the game, resulting in the game feeling half-baked. The newly introduced Gigantamax system seemed like a step-down from the more exciting and aesthetically pleasing Mega-Evolution system from Pokémon X and Y, and the world felt hollow. Pokémon Sword and Shield resembled a husk of something that could have been an immense feat by Game Freak, but for whatever reason (time crunch, hardware limitations, lack of enthusiasm) the game fell short by a mile. What seemed to be advertised as the biggest adventure Pokémon has seen ended up being a weakly delivered testament to a loss of passion. My interest in the series as a whole dwindled after the release and I hope to see better from Game Freak in the future.It's easy to pound away on my keyboard everything I dislike about the current state of Pokémon, but it wouldn't be fair to judge the IP without considering the future of the series. New Pokémon Snap, while not developed by Game Freak, is a direct sequel to fan-favorite Pokémon Snap, and looks graphically stunning. While I'm not an original fan of Pokémon Snap, it's good to see people pleased with something the Pokémon Company is releasing.Game Freak's mainline Pokémon titles still leave much to be desired, but recent games like Pokémon Let's Go! Pikachu & Eevee were fun little distractions from the bigger picture games like Sword and Shield. Re-imagined experiences of Pokémon Red and Blue weren't quite what I had in mind for Pokémon's first debut on the Nintendo Switch, but it worked well enough while fans waited for Sword and Shield. Unfortunately, though, the series feels as if it hit its mark.With a series as lucrative as Pokémon, there's no excuse for the lack of innovation and passion behind recent games. A soulless release like Sword and Shield dismisses the exciting experience a Pokémon game used to be. Perhaps the best way to get Game Freak, or better yet, Nintendo to notice that things need to change with the mainline series of games is a vote with one's wallet. After all, it must not seem like a good idea from the inside to drastically change your game when the profits for it continue to skyrocket with every release.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*6DnPwisW43far8eY-vOV2g.jpeg,https://medium.com/super-jump/pokémons-25th-anniversary-needs-to-mark-a-pivot-for-mainline-games-35f5f45356d2,gaming,039dd889565574338ada430e566b35294231bfcb4827e99b0a467a12

5 Surprising Things Mindful People Don't Do,"In today's busy world, most people rush through their days on autopilot. They jiggle countless projects and accept their overloaded minds and busy schedules as if it's normal.They're so used to being overwhelmed that they don't even question whether there's another option.If this reality sounds familiar to you, you probably think of being calm and mindful as a personality trait rather than a skill. Yet, the truth is that even the busiest mind can learn how to be more present and aware.Whatever the cause for your busyness is, you are in charge of managing your time, energy, and focus.Just like you chose busyness, you can also select mindfulness and create a more balanced life. And the reality is that quite often, being more mindful is about the things you avoid rather than the things you add to your life.By identifying and eliminating the following activities, you might be able to find more joy in priceless moments that previously seemed insignificant.Most people confuse mindfulness with kindness. They think that mindful people can't disagree and say no but instead say yes and amen to anything and everybody.But the truth is that mindfulness equals harmony.If you're aligned with yourself, you can indeed say no to people, projects, and activities that don't match your current needs or wants.To show up in your best version and be present in your daily life, you'll need to fill your own cup instead of constantly pleasing others. This includes taking care of yourself mentally but also physically by engaging in activities that help you refill your own cup.While many people think of self-care as a privilege, the reality is that it's a necessity. If you don't take proper care of yourself, you won't be able to perform at your best but instead operate on autopilot.As Katie Reed beautifully states:Investing in your own wellbeing will help you be more present and mindful. This, in return, will have a positive effect on your relationships too as you'll be able to give back to your fellows. Just make sure you prioritize yourself before saying yes to the wants of others.Take a few minutes to answer the following questions:The truth is that there are endless ways to take care of yourself if you're open to exploring new activities.Self-care doesn't equal luxurious massages and overpriced chai lattes. Instead, it's all about nourishing your soul, body, and mind through small steps.Contrary to common belief, being mindful doesn't equal doing yoga or meditating for hours.In fact, it's the opposite: Mindful people stay present in everyday situations even when they get bombarded with lots of information.As Eckhart Tolle beautifully states:Of course, routines like meditation, journaling, or yoga can help you practice mindfulness. But what matters more is your behavior when facing challenges outside of these routines.A few calm minutes during a daily meditation routine are nice, but if you can't deal with everyday challenges, these quiet minutes won't help you much.Instead of forcing yourself to meditate, try to pay more attention to your feelings during daily challenges.These situations prove whether you're mentally strong and mindful or not.So stop forcing yourself into the next 30-day meditation challenge and spend more time exploring your emotions and behavior during daily activities.Did you know that most people don't know how to listen properly?Instead of genuinely listening to our conversation partner, we often think of what we're going to reply before the other person is done talking.That's partly because most people love speaking. Listening, however, is difficult because we all enjoy sharing our own stories and perspectives.Next time you're in a conversation with a group of friends or colleagues, pay close attention to the dynamic: How often does someone interrupt the speaker? How many people genuinely listen to the conversation instead of adding their own two cents?You'll likely discover that most people are constantly excited about chatting rather than understanding their fellows. That's a natural reaction because most of us like getting attention.Mindful people, however, are great listeners. They don't interrupt their conversation partner but instead pay attention without thinking of their perspective.The good news is that you don't need to reply immediately, even if you're in a phone call or a face-to-face meeting.You can listen to your conversation partner and take a few seconds to gather your own thoughts before replying. That might sound odd, but let's be honest: We all have a few spare seconds to think before we react. And the reality is that your replies will be of higher quality if you think them through instead of rushing them.This will not only help you be more mindful but will also improve the quality of your conversations and relationships.Mindful people know that they can't please everyone and themselves.If you constantly try to be all things to all men, you'll not only find yourself feeling burnt out, but you'll also lack the time and energy to do the things that genuinely matter.Here's the harsh reality on time-management most people learn too late in life: Nobody will guard your time if you don't do so.And the truth is that most people only care about themselves.It's likely that your colleague or customer doesn't care whether you need to pull an all-nighter to finish a project. All they care about is whether they can minimize their own effort and get what they want. What you do doesn't really matter.That's why it's your job to guard your boundaries.Instead of please everyone, focus on pleasing yourself and creating rules aligned with the way you want to live your life.If you constantly feel overworked and stressed, you won't be able to enjoy the present moment. Don't expect yourself to give 110% all the time. You're not a robot, you need and deserve breaks.And if other people don't give you these breaks, you need to demand time and space by setting your own rules instead of living according to their standards.One of the most effective ways to be more intentional about your decisions regarding other people's desires is by taking more time to reply.Next time you get asked to do additional work or a favor to someone, take your time before replying.Our habit of responding immediately often harms us because the easiest answer is saying yes.Saying no, however, takes time and courage, so allow yourself to think your decisions through.A common misconception is that mindfulness equals cheerfulness. Yet that's not true. You can be mindful and sad, angry, or frustrated.Being mindful means allowing your emotions to be present, even if these are negative emotions.And even though mindfulness helps you experience less of these feelings, it doesn't mean that you need to go through life with a big smile on your face.Mindfulness isn't about being a robot but about being your best self, including your not-so-positive emotions.Mindful people don' try to be cheerful all the time. Instead, they allow themselves to experience the full range of emotions, including the uncomfortable ones.So stop trying to suppress your feelings and embrace them as a vital part of your life. Allow them to be your teacher instead of your enemy.One of the most powerful ways to explore your emotions is journaling.By writing down your thoughts and feelings, you're getting them out of your mind and onto a piece of paper.This makes it easier to better understand yourself and brainstorm solutions for potential challenges.In today's massively connected and overstimulated world, being slow and mindful can be your superpower. Instead of engaging in the past or future, mindful people focus on fully experiencing the present moment.To thrive in the 2021st century, you'll need to detach from the desire to be and do everything and instead focus your energy on a few things that genuinely matter.Stop operating on autopilot and start taming your mind by avoiding the five things mindful people don't do:Wanna become your best self?

Procedural OCHL Stock Generator,"Click here to get to know me, my projects, and my latest articles.One of the toughest parts of technical analysis is finding the data. Downloading historical stock data consistently is not as easy as it sounds: you need an API key from a company that provides the data, then data has to be downloaded, parsed, cleaned, and only then you can have some data to work on. In fact, simply using two or three stocks as a sample is interesting, but is a bit restrictive when you are experimenting with the full repertoire of algorithms in quantitative finance.As a solution, I can create my data from nothing: this is called synthetic data. The algorithm I am publishing in this article directly generates a pandas Dataframe containing the random stock price, including high, low, close, and open. The reason why I am also including these indicators is that many technical analysis algorithms are not only based on the close section of the data but require more.The way I am building this is quite straightforward: I am generating random data hourly for one entire year, then I am obtaining the OCHL indicators by looking at the 24 hours in a day, extracting what has been the highest and the lowest price of the day, as well at the opening and the closing hour. As a result, I will have 4 separate columns.For this algorithm, I will be using the graphing library Plotly. Because, sometimes, the library can be unstable because of new updates, I am using a stable version to avoid bugs. For more advanced and adaptable code you may want to upgrade Plotly to the latest version.As for every algorithm, I make I will be importing basic libraries at the beginning. I will be using pandas, NumPy, and random to perform the simulation, and Plotly to graph the results.To organize my algorithm in a structured way I will need to define several functions to hold part of the code. These functions will facilitate the simulation.It is now time to create the main function: a code that can perform the entire simulation when called. I will use this function using 8760 as a length parameter, meaning that I will be generating random values for every hour of the year. Because the results can easily vary from the original 1000 as base price (after 1 year I may end up having 100,000, not very realistic), I will drastically diminish my random distribution values, approximating them to 0.I will be using the OCHL converter to extract high, low, open, and close values of a tranche of a 24-hour stock price.I can now perform an entire simulation. This will generate the hourly data for one year stored in the df variable.Once I have simulated one year of data, I can finally extract the OCHL. To do this, I will group the data by tranches of 24, then use the OCHL converter.Finally, let me graph the results:For every time you run the algorithm, a new random OCHL will be generated as the variable df_OCHL. You can use pandas to export it, perform analysis with it, but even decide to generate thousands and concatenate them.",,https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/procedural-ochl-stock-generator-54ce041931be,data-science,43befdf96715b3745cc2663ae2331132300eb18b740cb709fa354971
"I say ""potato"", you say ""potato"" - Nomenclature in design systems","Nomenclature is a system of naming within a discipline or specific field. Simply put, it's the names we give things within a system. The result of good nomenclature is a shared language understood by everyone.Design can't operate in a vacuum. Good design relies on designers collaborating with others outside of their department. Who do they mainly collaborate with? Engineers.Designers often speak a different language than engineers. For example, let's imagine a designer wants to change the colour of a button on an interface. The company's brand colour happens to be teal.The engineer implements the change, it's not to the designer's expectations, and revisions are necessary. That whole ordeal could've been avoided with - you guessed it - nomenclature.Had they come up with a name that was first assigned some parameters - in this case, a hex value - and then communicated throughout the company, this would've been avoided and this process would have taken 5 minutes rather than an hour of back and forth.Colour is such a simple example, but the analogy can easily be carried to any component that exists in your design system; from foundational elements like headings to molecular components like inline banners.Imagine a world where an engineer can build a screen after a designer simply draws out a napkin sketch with their component names listed. The time savings make me so giddy!Getting to a shared common language company-wide should be one of your first considerations when building a design system since the time it saves compounds as you scale team size and components. Establishing a common language can be as simple as a few designers and engineers getting into a room and hashing things out.Here's a workshop you can do in one hour:As with anything design system related, getting to a common language is an ongoing process and will take some time. You may need to run this workshop a couple times if you have a lot of components. Once you've established a common language, I guarantee your efforts will pay off in dividends!",https://miro.medium.com/max/3036/1*N9RK3jgboM4XlYhE6TAd3Q.png,https://dustinweeres.medium.com/i-say-potato-you-say-potato-nomenclature-in-design-systems-8ea5dff99bbf,design,44cb19d98c7b6076446a93fe786a52f1ff8fc9f9922b38fb19d82af1
How To Get Into the Habit of Meditation,"Meditation is a powerful and transformative practice. I can go on and on about how beneficial it's for the soul, mind, and body.But my intention here is to show you a couple of steps to take today to start meditating and turn it into daily practice. And then see its effectiveness yourself.Meditation can be practiced through two techniques - focused or mindfulness. But there are many forms of meditation.Some of them are mindfulness meditation, Vipassana meditation, guided meditation, transcendental meditation, visualization meditation, and Zen meditation.Have a look at each kind of meditation there is and see which one sparks your interest. And practice that one at first.When I started meditating a few years ago, I found guided meditation to be very useful for a beginner like me who didn't know how to meditate. Now I also practice mindfulness meditation every day.You can find many meditations for beginners on YouTube to help you get started on this practice. And meditation apps like Calm and Headspace are handy too.Studies show you need 21 days to create a habit and 90 days to create a lifestyle.In the beginning, treat meditation like a task that you have to complete each day until it becomes a habit. You can meditate any time of the day, but you have to make time for it. Schedule your meditation the day before or in the morning.Usually, when you start a new practice, there will be days when you will not feel like putting in the work. You might tell yourself that you'll try it later or the next day. That's procrastinating. And because the brain doesn't like change, you may keep postponing it until you'll lose all your interest in meditating and then give up.Willpower is vital here. And it's also essential to motivate yourself every day. Just think how you'll feel after your meditation - calmer, full of gratitude, and content that you completed this task for the day.Follow these steps and try meditation today. Repeat tomorrow and keep on. Meditation works, and you'll see its effects in your life.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8000/1*FWDuHypQPgE9fknxwNK7pw.jpeg,https://medium.com/2-minute-madness/how-to-get-into-the-habit-of-meditation-e4b9e3e15bc,mindfulness,47ede3c277aa618687eacf00114c0aa85b53a881a2f8ce430956ecb5
Now Recruiting: Online Army of Volunteer Tutors To Fight 'COVID Slide',"By Greg ToppoAs families nationwide fret about ""COVID learning loss"" due to months of remote instruction and uncertain class schedules, key educators are advocating an unusual remedy: a national volunteer tutoring force, a sort of digital Peace Corps meets Homework Helpers.Three former U.S. education secretaries - Margaret Spellings, Arne Duncan, and John King - have endorsed the idea, and a proposal to fund it, alongside other COVID-related remedies, is kicking around Congress.Speaking at a recent webinar sponsored by The Campaign for Grade-Level Reading, King told educators, ""I am a huge fan of the idea of a national tutoring corps, and just think national service could help us address both the learning loss [and] the socio-emotional isolation kids have experienced.""As Congress and the Biden administration figure out their priorities, the non-profit sector is beginning to step in.Khan Academy, the online tutoring site, was already experiencing a record number of users due to school disruptions when its founder, Sal Khan, began overseeing the creation of a free online tutoring platform. Now, months later, he and others think it's a scalable blueprint for a national tutoring effort, one that could match knowledgeable adult volunteers - as well as millions of young people who have mastered key concepts - with students in need.Educators are taking note. Schoolhouse.World has the official endorsement of top education officials in two states - Rhode Island and New Hampshire - as a platform for tutoring statewide, with more expected to sign on soon.""Those kids that really don't have parents that can help them - this is like a lifeline,"" said Rhode Island Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green. Her goal: to offer virtually every Rhode Island student tutoring through the site.New Hampshire's education commissioner, Frank Edelblut, has similar aspirations. Post-COVID-19, he said, efforts like widespread volunteer tutoring are ""absolutely here to stay. In my mind, the pandemic accelerated this opportunity, but it didn't create it. The need and the opportunity was there. The pandemic allowed it to be accelerated.""Such needs, of course, are enormous. A recent analysis by McKinsey & Company predicted that cumulative learning loss due to the pandemic could be ""substantial, especially in mathematics,"" with students likely to lose five to nine months of learning by the end of the 2020-21 school year.It predicted that students of color could end the year six to 12 months behind their typical achievement levels. For white students, the deficit could total four to eight months. An October survey by the U.S. Census Bureau found that Black and Hispanic students were twice as likely as white students to have no live access to teachers.Infante-Green said the need for speedy interventions is huge. She recalled recently meeting a Rhode Island high schooler who told her, ""You know, I'm in AP math and I'm an 'A' student - and I'm failing a class. I've never failed the class my entire life.""The new platform, funded via philanthropic support, currently offers small-group tutoring via videoconferencing mostly in math, from pre-algebra to calculus and statistics, as well as SAT prep. Developers plan to add more subjects soon, and are working to expand their formal partnerships to more states and school districts in the coming months.Drew Bent, Schoolhouse.World's chief operating officer, said students from more than 50 countries are receiving tutoring on the platform. Most users and tutors are high schoolers.The organization's goal is to keep it free for students, with plans to earn revenue via partnerships with colleges looking for talented students who volunteer on the platform. The nonprofit may also ask corporations that supply tutors to contribute matching grants for each volunteer, one Schoolhouse.World official said.Matthew Kraft, a Brown University scholar who studies coaching and teacher effectiveness, said Schoolhouse.World offers a promising model to ""democratize"" tutoring. ""Right now, the status quo is demonstrably inequitable access to tutoring,"" he said. ""There's a private market, and more affluent families are more able to take advantage of those services. Other students aren't.""Users on the new platform typically receive instruction from any tutor available, but students also have the ability to ""follow"" individual tutors and attend their sessions. That could be key to its long-term viability, research suggests, since tutoring functions better when students work with a tutor regularly over time.Kraft said full-time, well-trained teachers are the best tutors, but that part-time volunteers can be effective if they're also well-trained and use high-quality materials. He envisions the platform allowing vetted volunteers to register and work at specific schools.""We have to be careful to not judge something versus the ideal,"" he said. ""Is this better than what we have? I would argue 'Definitively so.' Is it where I hope we can get to? 'No.'""Infante-Green, the Rhode Island education commissioner, believes that one of the most exciting aspects of the effort is the possibility that young people can interact with professionals in the field as well as peers with advanced skills.She called the focus on math smart. ""Math is the gatekeeper for everything,"" she said. At the moment, all of the state's ninth-graders are receiving math tutoring on the platform, which currently requires users to be 13 or older. It promises thorough vetting of prospective tutors.What may set this effort apart most notably is that it's free. Many well-off families, of course, have the resources to pay for one-on-one tutoring, and previous research has shown that it is effective but expensive. Tutoring is ""among the most effective education interventions ever to be subjected to rigorous evaluation,"" Kraft and a Brown colleague wrote last month. But their proposal to offer tutoring widely in K-8 Title I schools, which serve predominantly low-income students, estimated that it would cost between $5 and $15 billion annually.Khan founded his academy in 2008, originally as a way to remotely tutor his young cousins in math. He has since spent more than a decade growing a free, conspicuously low-tech tutoring empire, with 150 employees and content offered in 36 languages. As the world's most famous explainer - Business Week once called him the ""Messiah of Math"" - he has come in for his share of criticism from teachers, but has also cultivated powerful partners in The College Board, Google and other deep-pocketed donors.After COVID-19 hit last winter, the site saw its traffic go through the roof, rising from about 30 million ""learning minutes"" per day to 90 million, as families scrambled for reliable material. Educators upgraded the site to help teachers and parents create lesson plans and school-day calendars, Khan said, but it was clear that, day to day, students' access to live teachers ""was very inconsistent.""Khan and others saw the pandemic as an opportunity to scale its offerings. Engineers built out the new site over the summer.Beyond tapping into talented and knowledgeable adults, Khan said, the system has the potential to leverage the talents of students themselves. He estimates that about 100,000 high school seniors each year are capable of being ""very good tutors"" for classmates. The same number, give or take, are the ones vying for admittance to top colleges and need community service hours for their resumes. ""If we can eventually get 100,000 of these kids tutoring, they can serve the other 3 million or more, which would be powerful.""That idea syncs with what states like New Hampshire are doing, said Edelblut - the state already uses a competency-based system that requires students to demonstrate to teachers that they've mastered given material.Marvin Lin, a junior at Westview High School in Portland, Ore., joined in October. He teaches calculus and SAT prep to students around the world.""I've always enjoyed teaching people math specifically, because I've always liked math,"" said Lin, 16. ""I've always been good with it, and then I've noticed a lot of times a lot of people struggle with it.""He has taught about 30 sessions, all in English, each averaging about 10 students. Across the board, he finds, most students come with weak foundational knowledge that keeps them from progressing to the next level.Lin loves the ""peer-to-peer"" model of the platform that will allow his former students to become tutors themselves - though he understands that the effort is still finding its footing.Once students master material, they can ""pay it forward"" as a tutor, in the process building a good ""reputation"" on the site as an able, knowledgeable instructor.That proposition is already being put to the test at the University of Chicago, where Dean of Admissions James Nondorf said six high school-aged tutors on the site have already been offered spots in next fall's freshman class.""When somebody says they know something, that's one thing,"" he said. ""When they score well on a test, that's another one. But when you can actually teach it to somebody else, then you really have mastery.""He said the site's certification gives officials like him a look not just at students who do well on the typical academic skills measures but others as well. ""Some students are great testers, and good for them,"" he said. ""Some students are not. And maybe this is an opportunity for them to show their promise. Let's give it to them.""Disclosure: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provides financial support to Khan Academy and The 74.Visit the74million.org/pandemic for more news and analysis about the pandemic's effect on schools, students, educators and families.

Deepmind releases a new State-Of-The-Art Image Classification model - NFNets,"Source: arxivOne of the most annoying things about training a model is the time it takes to train it and the amount of memory needed to fit in the data and the models. Since image classification is one of the most common machine learning tasks, Deepmind released a new model that matches the state-of-art (SOTA) performance with significantly less size, higher training speed, and fewer optimization techniques for simplicity.In their work, they examine the current SOTA models such as EfficientNets and ResNets. In their analysis they pindown some of the optimization techniques that utilize a lot of memory without producing a significant value for performance. They prove that these networks can achieve the same performance without those optimization techniques.Although the proposed model might be the most interesting bit, I still find the analysis of previous work to be very interesting. Simply because this is where most of the learning happens, we start understanding what could have been done better and why the newly proposed method/technique is an improvement over the old one.The paper starts off with an analysis of batch normalisation. Why? because although it has shown great results and has been used heavily in tons of SOTA models, it has several disadvantages outlined by the paper [1], such as:But first, before removing batch normalization, we have to understand what benefits it brought to the models. Because we want to find a smarter way to still have those benefits, but with fewer cons. Those benefits are [1]:There are some other benefits, but I think you got the gist that its all mainly about regularisation and smoothing the training process.Although there have been previous attempts to remove batch normalization (BN) in various papers, the results didn't match the SOTA performance or training latency and seemed to fail on large batch sizes, and this is the main selling point of this paper. They succeed in removing (BN) without affecting performance, and with improving the training latency by a large margin.To do that, they propose a gradient clipping technique called Adaptive Gradient Clipping (AGC) [1]. Essentially, gradient clipping is used to stabilize model training [1] by not allowing the gradient to go beyond a certain threshold. This allows using larger training rates and thus faster convergence without the exploding gradient problem.However, the main issue is setting the threshold hyper-parameter, which is quite a difficult and manual task. The main benefit of AGC is to remove this hyperparameter. To do this we have to examine the gradient norms and the parameter norms.Although I am quite interested in the mathematics behind every machine learning model, I understand that a lot of ML enthusiasts don't enjoy reading a bunch of long differential equations, that's why I will explain AGC from a theoretical/intuitive perspective rather than a mathematically rigorous one.A norm is simply a measure of the magnitude of a vector. AGC is built on the premise that:Source: arxivBut why is that premise valid? Let's back up a little. A very high gradient will make our learning unstable, and if that's the case then the ratio of the gradient of the weight matrix to the weight matrix will be very high.That weight ratio is equivalent to:learning rate x the ratio between the gradient and the weight matrix (which is our premise).So essentially, the ratio proposed by that premise is a valid indicator as to whether we should clip the gradient or not. There is also another minor tweak. They have found that through multiple experiments, it's much better to use a unit-wise ratio of gradient norms instead of a layer-wise ratio (because each layer can have more than one gradient).In addition to AGC, they also used dropout to substitute the regularisation effect that Batch normalization was offering.They also used an optimization technique called Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) [1].Source: SAM arxiv paperThe idea of loss sharpness seems quite interesting and I might be exploring it in another article for the sake of brevity here. One final point to note here though is that they make a small modification to SAM [1] to reduce its computational cost by 20-40%! and they only employ it on their 2 largest model variants. It's always great to see additions being made to such techniques instead of just using them out of the box. I think this shows that they have analyzed it greatly before using it (and thus were able to optimize it a bit).Final thoughts and take awayWho would have thought that replacing a minor optimization technique such as batch normalization would result in a 9x improvement in training latency. I think this sends a message of being a bit more skeptical about popular optimization techniques that are used everywhere. In all fairness, I have been a victim of this crime before, I used to just put every popular optimization technique into my machine learning projects without fully examining its pros and cons. I guess this is one of the main benefits of reading ML papers, the analysis of previous SOTAs!References:[1] High-Performance Large-Scale Image Recognition Without Normalization.

What I learned about business from Will Ferrell's SNL audition,"Two things happened to me today: I discovered Will Ferrell's audition for SNL (""Saturday Night Live""), and I had first meetings with four early stage startups. If you could predict Will Ferrell's success from his early work, how might we apply lessons from this audition to early stage businesses and investor pitches?Will's third bit is the Get Off The Shed guy. He introduces the sketch as ""This is Dutch Litchford. And we're at an outdoor barbecue."" The premise is revealed pretty soon after that.The premise is that he alternates between having a pleasant, boring conversation and aggressively shouting at his kids. That's it. He plays that out for about a minute and a half.But the director and decision-makers in the audience would see promise beyond these 90 seconds. The premise and the character could play out in different situations, have different things to shout at/about, and be put in scenes with other characters (and celebrity hosts) who could have different reactions to it.The promise is important to SNL's context. Each episode is written that week, starting on Monday and performed live on Saturday night. They have less than a week to pitch ideas, draft sketches, choose the good ones, perfect the scripts, rehearse, block, tweak again etc. Do that about 20 times each season and you can see why repeatable premises and characters are a major plus.I found three versions of this sketch that made it onto SNL.When I look at a startup's first pitch I'm looking for a good premise and a strong promise. A good premise = I can see why this would get initial traction. A strong promise = I can see opportunities for the business to grow. Add more value to the same customers, or extend the first product to different markets. I want to get excited about the possibilities.Sketch comedy shows are a bit formulaic. The auditions are the same.Will's audition delivers exactly that. He does a celebrity impersonation, a political impersonation, a character, and then something that's just funny.""That was the biggest sinking moment, because here I am lying around with cat toys on the stage where the host for Saturday Night Live delivers the monologue every week. I was like... oh, this is the end.""A startup pitch has a formula, too. Problem, solution, business model, opportunity. And the audience expects you to hit those notes.You bring your own flavour to it, of course, just like Will flinging cat toys across the stage.Comedy benefits greatly by feeding off the energy of the audience. The SNL audition process is horrible for comedians. You're on stage in a big room with about 7 people in it, and they deliberately don't laugh. Here's Rob Huebel's description:It was the same for Will Ferrell's SNL audition:And yet, Will's opening sketch is a very slow and measured impression of baseball announcer Harry Carey that goes for two-and-a-half minutes during which Will often sits in silence while a voiceover does exposition.In the whole sketch he only speaks for about 45 seconds. The sketch doesn't really go anywhere - the premise is obvious from the start, and there is no heightening or escalation. It's just 2:30 of the same thing.But he commits to it. Even if nobody else gets it. Even if the room is telling him it sucks. He commits because he believes in it, and knows the only way it's going to work is if he gives it 100%.When I talk to a startup founder I want to know they are committed. Passionate about solving a problem or helping a customer segment. That they have insights they really believe in. That will keep them going even when things get tough.""It keeps escalating."" That's how Will described the Get Off The Shed sketch in 2017. Here are the lines he delivers to the off-stage kids:Heightening is an improv term that refers to finding the ""interesting thing"" and putting more emphasis on it and building on it. One example from this sketch is his obliviousness to how inappropriate his outbursts are. Just keeps switching back to small talk as though nothing happened. You see that a lot more in the SNL versions where you can see the reactions of the other characters. (His partner is equally oblivious.)Escalation is a similar increase in intensity, but I see it more as a narrative technique: ""and then what happens?"" Once you've heightened or escalated a couple of times you establish a pattern, and now the audience is interested to see where it goes.A good startup pitch can also use heightening and escalation, especially at the beginning when talking about the customer's problem. Escalate: tell us the problem, and the impact of that problem, and the future consequences of not dealing with the problem. Or heighten: set an emotional tone with a broad problem, then zoom in on one person's experience of the problem and the impact on them.This audition was Will's ""callback"" audition, which is like the final round in a job interview process. The night before he was advised by the director Lorne Michaels to change the act he had used in his first round audition and do something new.That's pretty horrible, but it served a purpose. The audition process tested whether someone could perform consistently well. And Lorne's direction tested how well Will could adapt to changing circumstances.Getting to $10k monthly recurring revenue is good, but I want to see what that looked like over the past 6 months. How you've adapted to changes in the market or competitive landscape. When you've failed and what you've learned from it.If all that has made you nervous about meeting with an investor or starting your own business, I'll leave you with this quote from Fred Armisen talking about his own SNL audition:",https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*dn8CIrgExVGAV8dUGCtfiA.gif,https://petelead.medium.com/what-i-learned-about-business-from-will-ferrells-snl-audition-1b51b363baf,startups,52b30aee00a6b52a7d2505bc770f1c304a42c9c79fb9e1f484b003a5
"Forget the 10,000-Hour Rule - You Only Need 20 to Learn a New Skill","Soon after his daughter was born, Josh Kaufman came to a sad realization. ""I'm never going to have enough time to learn anything new. Ever again.""After all, being a parent is like taking an extra job that involves triple shifts. And so, Josh knew he's going to lack time. Time he needed to learn new skills required to level up his business as an author and advisor.But the young parent wasn't going to give up that easily so off to the library, he went. Josh scanned book after book, looking for an answer to a very specific question. ""How much does it take to learn a new skill?"" And what he found was depressing. ""10,000 hours.""That's a full-time job for more than five years. Luckily for us, Josh ignored the urge to sink in despair and pushed a bit further.That's when he found out the 10,000-hour rule was rubbish.Have you ever played the Chinese Whispers? The idea is to sit in a circle with as many people as possible and name a First Player. Let's say that's you. You'd then come up with a Message and whisper it to the Second Player, who'd pass it on to the Third and so on until your Message reaches the Last Player.More often than not, errors accumulate in the retellings, so the statement announced by the Last Player differs significantly from that of the First.Suppose your message was ""Laura lost her lunch at the library last week."" It could easily become: ""Laura ate curry for lunch the whole week.""Funny, right? Well, not so much when it happens with scientific research.The original message behind the 10,000-hour rule was, ""It takes 10,000 hours of practice to reach the pinnacle of world-class performance."" The researcher who came with it studied top tier athletes, star musicians, and chess grandmasters. He was the First Player.From there, the Second Player passed it on as: ""It takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert,"" then the Message became ""10,000 hours to be good at something."" The Final Player, who is most likely the internet, made it: ""It takes 10,000 hours to learn a new skill.""Just like that, the 10,000-hour rule became a widely-spread misconception wrapped in an exaggeration package. When you tear up the latter, however, you find a less impressive number.20 hours.Josh put away the whole 10,000-hour idea and started from scratch. He focused on learning capacity and summarized his findings in a simple graph.Now, you might be wondering: How good is 'decent?'Good enough to allow Josh to learn programming in under 20 hours and use the software he developed to run his entire business.Good enough to also enable Josh to play the ukulele - an instrument that looks like a tiny guitar - in front of a TEDx audience who drowned him in applause.So, yes, 'decent' here means pretty good.Fair enough Nabil, but how does this work? Do I simply sit down and learn for 20 hours straights? Not really - it's called a framework for a reason.Below you'll find the four steps Josh suggests in his book and a bonus I added.What we perceive as a skill is often a cocktail of tiny skills. For instance, if you want to learn digital marketing, you should consider mailing lists, Search Engine Optimization, and targeted ads on social media.Josh's idea is to list these sub-skills and determine the most relevant and profitable ones.Keeping the digital marketing example: if you can't afford to pay for social media ads yet, discard them. Focus on mailing lists and SEO instead. You'll spend less effort in the process and reap the benefits sooner.It's easy to fall into the ""I should learn a ton of theory before taking action"" trap. You'd pile up resources and tutorials only to let them rot on your (digital) shelf.Put differently, you're simply giving yourself an excuse to procrastinate. That's why Josh suggests you pick up just enough knowledge to practice and notice your mistakes.For example, if you want to learn how to grow a mailing list, you can learn the basics of sending automated emails then run tests with your personal email.You'll quickly notice bugs on download buttons, display, and embedded links. As you sort out these bugs, you'll get better because fixing errors is one of the best ways to learn.This is a universal rule for a reason. It works.Your brain loves distractions because they're effort-free and exciting. In contrast, learning something new requires mental energy.One way to convince your lazy brain to focus is to reduce its options.Turn off your notifications and put (noise-cancel) headsets when you sit down to learn. Your brain will feel so bored that work will feel like tons of fun.When you start something new, the first guests to join the adventure are often negative thoughts. ""Holy Sweet Potato, I freaking suck,"" you'd grumble after messing up once. ""Perhaps, this isn't for me.""That's frustration poisoning your mind with the idea to give up way too soon. Rest assured, though. There's an antidote. When you pre-commit to at least 20 hours, you'll lower the frustration barrier enough to step over it.""Sure, I'm still grossly incompetent right now. But I've been learning for only five hours so far. Let's see what happens once I'm done with all 20.""I added this one to Josh's framework because I know how tempting the 20-hour idea can be. If you're anything like me, you'd think: ""Hmm, I can simply power through three consecutive days and voilà! New skill acquired!""Not so fast, friend.Your brain needs time to integrate new skills. The process is called neuroplasticity, and it's your brain's ability to rewire itself according to your daily experience - in particular, what you learn.So instead of rushing the 20 hours, spread them across time.If you aim for 45' every day, you'll get decent at your skill within a month. If that sounds like a long time, remember that before this article, you needed five years.The 10,000-hour rule applies to world-class performance in ultra-competitive fields. This is probably not what you need right now.What you need instead is to become pretty good at a skill that can benefit your career and your personal life - which only requires 20 hours of deliberate, focused practice.",https://miro.medium.com/max/9216/1*6r92fZShs6284kJq_gVNWg.png,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/forget-the-10-000-hour-rule-you-only-need-20-to-learn-a-new-skill-cc7f4257d8b6,productivity,53b273b3691c78533092486d272c33abeb171bebc763828edfb022c9
"The Speed of Light, Electrons and the Big Bang","Retrograde rockets fired intermittently as the computer controlled the approach of the spaceship, to enable a soft contact with the Mars orbiter station. With a long whoosh sound of the cabin pressure equalizing, the spaceship locked into position, Commander Jack Miller released his harness and moved from the control console to the airlock, eager to start the descent to his home for the next 3 months, Base Phoenix, deep under the red planet surface.Jack was looking forward to having some more space to move about in, after 4 months in the limited confines of the spaceship. Still, it was much shorter than the 9 months it used to take in the 2020s. The development of the ion drive had enabled much faster speeds than just chemical rocket engines, the electromagnetic iodine ion thruster gradually built-up tremendous speed. The drive made positively charge ions from the iodine and expelled them out at great speed with the magnetic force.Launching from the Moon had also enabled the use of the ion drive on interplanetary missions. The Moon has a much weaker gravity well than Earth, requiring much less chemical rocket fuel to be carried to escape the pull of gravity. After which the ion engines were the main drivers for the trip, but the ship still needed to slow down when it reached Mars. The Martian atmosphere is too thin to slow a craft down with friction, so the ship carried enough hydrogen, kerosene and oxidizer to fire the rocket engine towards the direction of travel, in order to slow down to the stations orbital speed.The ion drives still impressed Jack even though he had helped to develop the drive but it also focused his frustration. People on Earth could send him and his crew to Mars in 4 months but they could not bring down the Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide level. It was 2050, the year when all countries had agreed to reach zero carbon emissions, but the observatory on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii was still reading an increase.International agreements and framework conventions were one part of the solution but pragmatic and enforceable solutions were needed. Such as a price on carbon, increased industry efficiency requirements on all polluting gases, land use policies governing fertilizer use and minimum amounts of forest and native vegetation, power sector policies favouring renewables only, building codes to replace concrete, refrigeration appliance standards to eliminate synthetic greenhouse gases, better urban transport, vehicle electrification and biofuels subsidies for planes and shipping. These restrictions can be applied to the G20 countries, the group of twenty developed countries, their governments and central bankers. The G20 contain the most developed countries, which of course have produced most of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the first place, and they also have the economic capability of making the necessary changes, to rid the planet of a large majority of the greenhouse gas emissions.Jack wasn't confident of world leaders making the best decisions for the planet, what was needed was a ground swell of all people changing their beliefs, from helping themselves to helping others.An announcement sounded, bringing Jack out of his thoughts of Earth, the crew members were cleared to move into the Mars orbiter station. They were required to have a sleep period before the descent, the station was unmanned and robotic, so the new crew from Earth explored the station then made their way to the individual sleeping cells. We have just arrived at Mars and mission control wants us to sleep, the crew joked, but they were highly trained astronauts and knew that they needed to rest before the descent, which while automated was still potentially very dangerous.Jack floated himself into the sleeping cell and strapped in ready to sleep but the adrenaline was still pumping and he couldn't sleep. His thought turned to home, to Earth, he smiled to himself. He thought about his work back at Houston, very complex and exacting but satisfying. He thought about some of the school visits, they were fun and encouraging, and the children loved to hear stories of the rocket launches.""Captain Jack! (as they called him) What's it like to sit in a rocket with 400 tonnes of hydrogen fuel when it gets lit!?""""Well, you know the fastest ride you've ever been on at the annual show? It's a hundred time faster than that!""He would always take photographs to project on a large screen, such as of Earth from space and from the Moon but it was the stories and information they loved.The children asked interesting questions. ""Will your ship travel at light speed, sir?""""Good question, can anyone tell me what light is?""One young boy shot his hand up. ""It is what shines on my birthday cake from all the birthday candles.""""Yes, quite correct, and how old are you, young man?""""I'm 7 years old.""""Ah, a good age"" said Jack.""Who else here is 7?"" Some hands up. ""Who is aged 6?"" A few hands. ""And who is 8?"" Many hands up.""Well, I think 6, 7 and 8 are all good ages"", said Jack.He glanced at the pretty young teacher smiling at him from the side of the class.""How old do you think Miss Smith is?"" He asked the class. A 6 year old girl called out ""110 years old!""""Yes, well that may be quite correct"" stammered Jack, to the muffled laughter from the other teachers and parents in the room, and from Miss Smith!""Now we were speaking of the speed of light and what it is"" said Jack quickly changing the subject, while making a mental note to come back and visit Miss Smith's class after Mars.""Photons"" one young student called out. ""Energy waves"" said another. ""You are both right"", said Jack.""Light, which we can see of course, travels like a particle although there isn't any mass there, so we call it a photon and it also behaves like a wave and is always in motion. Light is a form of energy"".""Light travels at about 300,000 kilometres per second and the question was, will the spaceship that is transporting my crew and myself to Mars travel at the speed of light. Unfortunately, it won't, if it did, we would get there in a few hours, but nothing with mass can travel at the speed of light.""""This is because the mass of the spaceship and everything in it will increase in mass as it goes faster and faster. As we have said light is energy and light does not have mass, so it can travel that fast.""""We use the physicist Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity which says mass and energy are the same. E = mc2""""Where E is energy, m is mass, c is the speed of light and squared means that value times by itself.""""You can see if we put in the mass of the rocket, maybe 500 kilograms, and multiplied it by, 300,000 times 300,000, we would have a very large mass indeed. We just don't have the amount of energy needed.""Jack wondered if this was a bit complex for the young students but then he thought if he put up a photograph of a dinosaur, they would quickly tell him its scientific name.""Are there any other questions?"" ask Jack.One of the 8 year old boys put his hand up ""Do electrons orbit atoms like the planets orbit the sun? And are there other galaxies inside of atoms?""""Wow, you guys ask the big questions"" said Jack with a smile ""As to whether there are other galaxies inside atoms, we don't know, so we need some of you to become physicists and keep investigating that. But the image of electrons circulating around the atom like a planet is now thought of as a cloud, rather than a point orbiting, the electrons are moving so fast we can't tell exactly where they are. Electrons occur in different shells around the atom, depending on how many electrons there are, but it still would appear more as a hazy cloud.""""One more question before recess time?"" asked Jack looking at Miss Smith.One of the girls sitting in the front row asked ""When was the Big Bang?""Jack answered ""Another good question. Scientists believe it was 13.8 billion years ago, measured from the cosmic background microwave radiation but it wasn't really a big explosion, as in a bang, rather an expansion of the universe everywhere, not from one centre. Everything is moving away from everything else. There are still movements within the universe, the Andromeda Galaxy will one day merge with our Milky Way Galaxy, not for 2 billion years, but overall, the universe is expanding.""With that the recess siren sounded and Miss Smith stood up to thank Captain Jack on behalf of all the students, for coming to speak to them and everyone clapped.Miss Smith walked Jack out to the carpark, with half the class following. Jack and Miss Smith stood by his car, looking at each other, Jack said ""I'll come and visit the class when I'm back from Mars.""Miss Smith said ""I'd, um, that is, we would like that very much. Have a safe trip Jack.""As Jack orbited Mars in the orbiter station, it was with thought of his work on Earth, the young school students and of Miss Smith, that he fell asleep with a smile on his face.References:Climate Change | Department of EnergyChem4Kids.com: Atoms: OrbitalsSpeed of light Facts for Kids (kiddle.co)What Is the Big Bang? | NASA Space Place - NASA Science for Kids",https://miro.medium.com/max/1204/1*m1LBdYdNuTRUSg8Zu2YBcw.png,https://milespeter061.medium.com/the-speed-of-light-electrons-and-the-big-bang-e8c171e79610,fiction,55a6ccbd4a473c6628149a468add1055f87982ff7d88b451cbbf53cb
Understanding the Relational Model of Database Management Systems,"Behind all the hype and glory of Machine Learning in popular media, one extremely crucial component that kinda gets overlooked is the role of Database Management Systems (DBMS). Of course, not everyone really NEEDS to know the ins and outs of how a database is managed. But if you are using Machine Learning in any capacity, there will, to a very high degree of probability, be a time in your professional career where understanding a certain extent of it could help.Around the 60s, developers were still using hardcoded software for managing data. Whenever this data would not fit into very rigid predefined architectures, the software would essentially need to be refactored every time to fit the kinds of data stored and the kinds of methods used to retrieve and manipulate the data. If a developer used hash tables to define the data structure, as the database grew and the needs evolved, the system would need to re-written. And this was a recurring event.A mathematician named Edgar F. Codd working at IBM saw this need for a general-purpose architecture, which could really bypass the hard-coded rigidness to fit the evolving needs. Enter Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). In 1970, he published a paper describing this architecture, in which the system itself could figure out the best possible representation and procedure to store, retrieve and manipulate data.Codd proposed that we use simple, primitive data structures like scalars, integers, floats, and strings to store data. The data would form relations in the form of tuples. Perhaps in simpler and more relatable terms; imagine a data table (also referred to as a relation), where each cell is one of the simple scalar data types, connected in each row as tuples forming relations of their own. Each entity (or row) has a unique ID, called the primary key. Tables can also talk to each other via these keys which are now referred to as foreign keys to form custom relations using the seven fundamental operations. The fundamental operations are listed below along with their corresponding standard SQL syntax:i) Select: Selects and returns a new relation that is a subset of the tuples that meet certain conditional predicates: SELECT * FROM Shop_A WHERE author_id = 102;ii) Projection: Returns a new relation with tuples that contain only the specified attributes, can rearrange attribute ordering, can manipulate the values: SELECT author_id-100, book_id FROM Shop_A WHERE author_id > 102;iii) Union: Returns all the tuples in the two input relations as one new relation but only works if the input data types and attributes are the same in both: (SELECT * FROM Shop_A) UNION ALL (SELECT * FROM Shop_B);iv) Intersection: Returns a new relation of tuples that are in both the input relations but only works if the input data types and attributes are the same in both: (SELECT * FROM Shop_A) INTERSECT (SELECT * FROM Shop_B);v) Difference: Returns a new relation with tuples that are in the first input but not in the second input but only works if the input data types and attributes are the same in both: (SELECT * FROM Shop_A) EXCEPT (SELECT * FROM Shop_B);vi) Product: Returns a new relation that's the dot product of the two inputs, aka. all possible combinations, generally used for testing: SELECT * FROM Shop_A CROSS JOIN Shop_B; or, SELECT * FROM Shop_A, Shop_B;vii) Join: Returns a new relation of tuples that are in both input relations, but unlike Union, the data and attribute types do not need to be the same, as long as there is at least one match within the tuples: SELECT * FROM Shop_A NATURAL JOIN Shop_B;Further advanced operations have since been added like Division, Aggregation, Sorting, and many more.These lower-level operations are used to evaluate relations with a technique called relational-algebra. The RDBMS uses these primitive relational algebraic expressions in order to determine the most efficient how and this is relational calculus. A very complex component of the system called the query optimizer gets this job done.Imagine you want to create a new relation between table A and B, each containing 5 billion rows, where you want all the tuples with a primary key less than 500 that are present in both A and B with some attributes that are the same. One procedure to do it would be to NATURAL JOIN all the 10 billion rows first and then filter SELECT keys less than 500. Another procedure could be to filter SELECT less than 500 keys first from A and B and then NATURAL JOIN the 1000 (at most) entries. Depending on the actual size of the database, the performance factor of the second procedure would be much more efficient than the first one.This is where the Relational Model excels. The user just needs to state what they want to do, and the RDBMS will figure out how to do it in the most efficient way. That's why querying languages like SQL are called ""non-procedural"". The explicit steps (or procedures) are built into the system. Unlike programming languages like Python or C/C++ where the user needs to explicitly state that iterate over this data this many times, look for this characteristic, if n is larger than a certain number choose this other method, yada yada, SQL only needs to be told the desired end result.The RDBMS is based primarily on the three pillars:i) Structure (schema): how relations and their contents, like the attributes, types, relations within and between data.ii) Integrity: insurance that the database's contents satisfy the constraints (aka some predefined native structure like memory allocation) to validate the instance of the database given these constraints, with no redundancy.iii) Manipulation: how the data can be accessed or modified by running queries.Because the system can evolve with evolving data and needs, it's extremely versatile and fits the business needs of most databases. RDBMS is sort of the AI of DBMS by virtue of its intelligent design.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1410/1*RJjepmedVD_5XfDBw6xNcw.jpeg,https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-relational-model-of-database-management-systems-56f17db99f56,data-science,55b863286cab1b1480b8527635d83a8158d12909d859b83b9b1d252d
These Are The 10 Most Dangerous Airports in the World,"My boss looked as pale as a ghost.A tiny drop of sweat started forming on his forehead, and the eyes showed absolute terror, as he saw the end of his life approaching at fast speed.He grabbed the seat until his fingers hurt, waiting for the moment. Waiting for the end of it all. For the plane to crash.But it didn't.That's why, a few months later, he got to tell me his experience landing at Madeira airport, in Portugal, on a day of particularly bad weather.My boss was a businessman. He flew almost every week, short and long haul. He was not afraid of flying, but this experience was one of the scariest of his life. No wonder, he was flying to one of the most dangerous airports in the world.Even though Madeira is a very popular touristic destination, the airport of this Portuguese island is quite a dangerous one. The runway almost doubled in 2000 to 2780m but this expansion was built on a platform supported by 180 columns, which are set on the ocean.Plus, the meteorological conditions are tricky, with regular strong winds that make landing here a task that can only be performed by specially trained pilots.This airport serves as the main landing spot for those visiting Mt. Everest. But if climbing Everest is hard, the arrival at the airport is not much easier. The runway is one of the shortest in the world and lays nestled between the mountains.To make things worse, electricity on-site is poor, making it hard for pilots to contact air controllers and, sometimes, planes have to land even without assistance.This airport gathers a series of conditions that make any successful landing or take-off almost a miracle. The difficulties start even before arriving at the airport, as pilots must fly through a narrow valley in the Alps to prepare for descent.The runway is one of the shortest in the world, at only 525 meters, and it has a downward gradient of 18,5%, making take off even harder than landing. And if the pilot doesn't manage it... well, the airport drops off into a cliff, so there is not really room for unsuccessful maneuvers.This airport, serving the capital of Honduras, is located in a valley 1000 meters above sea level. As with any mountain airport, it is not an easy place neither for landing nor take-off.Pilots must make a sharp 45-degree turn amidst mountains, making sure the underside of the plane doesn't scrape the land below. Passengers experience a quick drop in altitude which can cause eardrums to pop.This airport is probably most famous for having a beach located at the end of the runway, which creates large and loud gusts of wind and sand for the people on the beach.But the real challenge of this airport is not the beach but rather the size of its runway, at 2,179 meters. While this might not seem too short, it is a big challenge for most aircrafts landing here, considering that they need at least 2,500 meters.This is because the airport was built for short airplanes but, due to the growth in tourism in the country, bigger planes started flying there regularly.This airport is so dangerous that only a handful of pilots are qualified to land here. Surrounded by 5,500-meter mountain peaks, the Paro Airport runway is only 1981 meters long and it is completely out of sight to the pilots until the last minute, when they are forced to fly at a 45-degree angle before dropping quickly onto the runway.Because of the extreme conditions, landings are only authorized in daylight hours and under excellent meteorological conditions.To start off, the airport runway is frequently covered in ice, making any landing slick. Then, the strong winds and stormy weather make the job harder. And the nearby volcano erupts quite often, expelling ash that can damage the engines of the aircrafts landing and taking off here.While this airport is not particularly hard to land on, it has a characteristic that makes it unique. The city's main road intersects the airport runway and the traffic has to stop every time a plane lands.There is a stoplight on the road, but a few disasters have been on the cusp of happening already. Plus, the 1676 meters runway has water on both ends.The U.S. Antarctic station makes it to this list mainly due to weather conditions. The airport runway is long enough but always covered in ice, which can cause airplanes to drift if the landing is not perfect.Temperatures are always negative and during many months of the year, it is dark continuously, so pilots are trained to land using night vision goggles.Located on the island of Barra, in Scotland, this airport is only five meters above sea level. This means that, whenever the tide is high, all three runways are underwater. Therefore, flights can only land at certain times.Consider subscribing to my mailing list for more travel content.Sign up for our new newsletter to stay informed with up-to-date curations from our editors:👇",https://miro.medium.com/max/2700/1*u47U9ob7GJqx71PhBClRIQ.png,https://medium.com/world-travelers-blog/these-are-the-10-most-dangerous-airports-in-the-world-a0f1302061e0,travel,56ac2ea29307284c291ceeb804b35d1a25d8f778a8df37526fa1b26c
"After local zoning laws forced them out of their tiny house, a couple spent months sleeping in their truck and an abandoned barn","Hannah Cole and Tom Tarczon had to scramble for places to stay during the winter after a local zoning ordinance meant their tiny house was illegal.By Frank OlitoAfter living at her grandparents' house in Wisconsin for two years and paying off her student loans, Hannah Cole was at a crossroads.She could have bought a house, but that would have given her debt after she just got rid of her student loans. She could have rented a place, but she felt like renting would be like throwing away money.""I didn't want to owe anybody anything, and I didn't want to be tethered to anything,"" Cole said.Eventually, she found the perfect compromise: a tiny house.Cole and her partner, Tom Tarczon, decided to do a ""tiny house test run"" by buying a cheap camper for $5,000 in 2017 to try out tiny living before making the bigger investment of a traditional tiny house.After remodeling the camper in Cole's grandparents' driveway, they posted a listing on Facebook and Craigslist to find a place to park their camper, and they ended up parking on a cornfield in small-town Wisconsin. But when they decided to move across the country, they began to encounter the full force of strict zoning laws, and ended up without anywhere to live.Read more: A woman was forced to live in her tiny house secretly for 2 years after learning her local zoning laws didn't allow itWhen they moved to Colorado in February 2018 with their dogs, Cole and Tarczon parked their camper on a piece of land in a small town called Littleton. They had no issues there until the owner of the property decided to move away and they had to find a new place.They ended up in Evergreen, Colorado, a town near Denver located in the picturesque mountains - but then the problems started.""When we first moved onto the property, we thought it was great,"" Cole said. ""We were exactly where we always pictured we would be. Things started falling apart when we heard from the person we were renting from that neighbors were starting to ask questions. We got the feeling that we weren't wanted there.""Cole said a neighbor reported them for illegally dumping blackwater waste, even though their camper does not have any blackwater. She said an official from the Jefferson County Planning and Zoning Division and two officers came to inspect their home.""It was frustrating,"" Cole said. ""I wanted to live the way we wanted to live. We just wanted to live in our home. It was very disappointing.""The couple also said it was especially frustrating because it seemed the neighbors thought they were taking from the community, even though they both worked in the area.""A large part of our finances were going toward the small town,"" Tarczon said. ""We loved being in the area.""They decided to move their camper to the other side of the property so that they were more hidden. At the same time, they started building a traditional tiny house. However, according to Cole, neighbors were sneaking onto nearby properties and using binoculars to see what was going on.""It was very scary,"" Cole said. ""It got to the point where we would run out for an errand and get nervous about what would happen to our house while we were gone.""Everything hit a fever pitch one day when the couple found out the local zoning board passed a new ordinance: an axle vehicle could only be parked on a property for two weeks out of a year.Cole and Tarczon felt the ""timing was very weird."" They said they attempted to talk to officials at the planning and zoning division, but they had no options. The Jefferson County Planning and Zoning Division has not responded to Insider's request for comment on the couple's account.The couple had no option but to move out of their half-constructed tiny house and camper.This is a fate many tiny-house owners face across the US, as most local zoning codes categorize tiny houses as RVs, and you're not allowed to live in a recreational vehicle full-time, leading to evictions across the tiny-house community.Read more: Tiny-house owners must adhere to strict and often confusing zoning laws - here's what you need to know""It was heartbreaking, to say the least,"" Tarczon said.They were determined to keep building their tiny house on the property, but they had to find another place to sleep because of the new zoning ordinance.""We had to scramble,"" Cole said. ""Finances were very tight. We were putting all of our income into building this house.""They decided to stay in a hotel for two months, but that became expensive quickly. In the first month, for example, they spent $2,800.Eventually, the property owner allowed them to stay in an old barn, and they lived there for a month: They laid out makeshift flooring and tarps, hung up hammocks for their beds, and used camping gear to make the rundown barn as livable as possible.After a while, they realized they couldn't live like that anymore, so they decided to live out of their truck for the next month just as winter hit. Cole slept in the backseat with one dog, Tarczon slept in the driver's seat, and the second dog slept in the passenger seat.""I couldn't wrap my mind around how we got to this point,"" Cole said. ""I went to college, I got a good job, how am I homeless? I couldn't understand. Another difficult part was just going to work in the morning, just knowing what you have come from and being by your co-workers who are in a totally different situation.""Read more: A woman who parked her tiny house on her parents' property in New Hampshire was forced to move out after the local government said it was illegalOnce they completed the construction of their tiny house, they decided the best option for them was to move back to Wisconsin. They spent the next three months looking for property where they could permanently park their tiny house. They started researching zoning laws diligently because they ""didn't want to go through anything like that again,"" Tarczon said.In November 2019, Cole and Tarczon bought a ""dream"" piece of property in Holcombe, Wisconsin, that is properly zoned and away from neighbors - something they both joked about being very important after their ordeal.""I still have to pinch myself that this turned out to be our reality,"" Cole said. ""There were so many times that we felt like the dream was falling apart.""They both agreed that the unnecessary obstacles they faced were due to zoning laws that they felt punished them for living outside the box.""I think it's important for lawmakers and everyone to understand that not everybody wants to live the template that society has handed them,"" Cole said. ""Not everyone wants it. [They need to be] OK with people wanting a different life.""Echoing others in the community, Tarczon added that local zoning boards need to be more open-minded.""[Tiny house owners are] not people moving in to absorb the resources,"" Tarczon said. ""We're people moving in to enjoy the community and to have a happier, healthier lifestyle.""For more great stories, visit Insider's homepage.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*fOiGbHwIJh-TB07e,https://medium.com/insider/zoning-laws-forced-this-couple-out-of-their-tiny-house-5935a4f35fa1,travel,56b0da762423af0ddeb3f38e77ff1f2aa348809a6aa776891e632c7a
Feature Selection With Practical Approach,"Feature Selection is one of the crucial steps of any Data Science project Life Cycle. There are many articles out there that describe the Techniques available for feature selection theoretically but lack a practical approach. Here, we will deal directly with code and see how it actually works. I will try to provide beginner's friendly high-level descriptions of the code snippets.When we train our machine learning model, not all the features contribute equally. Some of the features are significant ones, and some do not even help in training at all. So, we should remove these types of features from our dataset. Hence, Feature Selection is the process of removing or reducing the input features/variables that in turn reduces the complexity, makes the training process faster, and also increases the accuracy of the model.There are many techniques available for feature selection, but we will discuss only the famous and important ones. These techniques are:-NOTE:- In this article, we will only discuss the first two, the remaining two will be covered in the second part.In this tutorial, we have used the "" Santander Customer Satisfaction"" dataset from Kaggle that is also available on GitHub. Along with it, the other datasets used can be obtained directly with described code snippets.I assume that you are familiar with python and already have installed python 3 in your systems. I have used a jupyter notebook for this tutorial. You can use the IDE of your like. All required libraries come inbuilt in anaconda suite.Here, we will discuss two of the techniques, those are Variance threshold and Correlation.The very first features that we should remove from our dataset are constant ones. It might seem easy to perform manually but suppose you have 200-300 features. In that case, using some technique make sense.Firstly, let import all the required libraries. Pandas is used to create and manipulate the dataset. VarianceThreshold is used to remove the features that have low variance. Variance is just a measure of variability. 0 variance implies all values are same/constant. Train_test_split is used for splitting the data for training and testing purposes.Here, we have just created a dummy dataframe to understand this feature selection easily. We can see that columns C and D have constant values hence they should be removed.Now, we have initialized the object var of VarianceThreshold with the threshold as 0(constant). We can vary this according to our needs. Then, we have printed the array of boolean in which true and false represent non-constant and constant features respectively.We have used list comprehension in which we are looping through all the columns and inserting the constant features into the list named constant_features . Finally, we have dropped the constant features from the dataset.The previous example may seem too easy and can be easily detected. But in real-world scenarios, there will be 100's or 1000's of features. This technique will help in those cases. Let us see the same using the bigger and real dataset.Here, we have loaded our dataset that is available on GitHub. The dataset consists of 371 features.Here, X represents input variables and Y represents the target variable. We should always apply any Feature Selection technique to the training set to avoid any kind of overfitting. That's why we are splitting the dataset into training and testing. After that, the process is the same as explained above. Here, 371-332 = 39 features are constant. So, we drop these features from both training and testing sets.Some of the features are very linearly related to each other, i.e. variable1 increases 2 times when variable2 increased 3 times. So both of these features are highly correlated to each other. Hence, we can drop one of these, and still, our model does not lose any important information.Here, we have imported boston dataset for the example. seaborn will be used to plot the interactive graphs. Other libraries are already discussed.Now, we have created the pandas dataframe of the loaded dataset and added the target variable as TARGET column.It is a similar step as the previous technique where we declare input variables as X and target variable as Y. Splitting of data is required as we only perform the feature selection part on the training set to avoid any type of overfitting. The shape of x_train is (404,13) and of x_test is (102,13).Here, we have given a fixed size of the graph and then call the corr() function on x_train , but if we just print correlation variable then it will be difficult to interpret. Hence, with the help of seaborn we have plotted the heatmap that shows the correlation between features clearly.After that, we have declared the function find_correlated_features that takes dataset and threshold as arguments. In the function, we have iterated over every value of the correlation matrix and added the column name to the set named col_corr if correlation value is above the given threshold value.Now, we have just called the above function with x_train as data and threshold = 0.7 to get the correlated features that we can drop. In our case, these features are {AGE,NOX,TAX}. After dropping these features, our dataset features were reduced from 13 to 10.Defining the above function will help us when the number of features is too high that heatmap does not help in interpretation.I hope you understand these two techniques for Feature Selection.

7 Reasons Why Native Speakers Don't Necessarily Make the Best Language Teachers,"This might be a bit controversial and I hope I don't offend anyone but this is my experience when learning languages.I'm not a teacher, I'm a life-long student and so far I've learned English and Japanese.There's an obsession with finding native teachers in order to learn a language 'properly' but I think that can be misguided.Over the years I've learned from several teachers, both native and non, and I had better luck with non-natives.I'm not saying that native teachers are necessarily bad, I'm just saying that there are other factors as important to consider.These are some of them.By speaking to The Queen you won't pick up her accent. That's a common fallacy. If that was the case all Japanese students would have a perfect BBC accent, and they don't.However, this seems to be the argument when going native - ""I don't want to learn with a bad accent"" - and yet, they end up speaking with a strong Spanish, Italian, or French accent anyway.First of all, you should get exposed to as many accents as possible, otherwise, you won't be able to understand people in the real world. If all you hear is your teacher from Wisconsin, you'll be lost when listening to a Scottish guy.Second. For listening, you have plenty of options -movies, podcasts, recorded lessons, etc - so, narrowing down your criteria to one specific accent, you are jeopardizing your chances of understanding millions.Third, you won't pick up the accent from your teacher. If you are Italian, you'll speak like Super Mario all your life. Adult learners find it almost impossible to have a native-like pronunciation no matter who they learn from. And that's not necessarily a bad thing because...Providing it's not too strong and most people can understand you, speaking with a French, German or Russian accent is not necessarily a bad thing.Everybody's got an accent, whether is Scottish, Australian, or Texan. A foreigner will have one too. The purpose of learning a language is to communicate effectively so, even you have a Greek accent, you are probably better understood than a Bostonian.In my travels, I've witnessed many times people with a strong accent, i.e. Northern England, speak like they were in their local pub and no one (including Americans) could understand them.If we are to communicate between cultures everybody should make an effort to speak standard English or French or Spanish. The axiom ""I speak perfect English because I'm from England!"" it's just a fallacy.If you just want to communicate with your fellow villagers, fine, speak your inscrutable dialect, but if you want to connect with the world, make an effort and meet them in the middle.I've got an unmistakable Spanish accent but I'm sure that everyone (American, Japanese, French, or Australian) can understand me better than somebody from, let's say, Belfast.My point is, your English is not necessarily better the closer to the Queen you sound. Your English is better the more people you can communicate with and for that, you don't need a native teacher.I wouldn't be a very good Spanish teacher. I was born with the language, so to speak (pun intended), so I don't get why it's difficult for others to learn it.On the other hand, I would be a much better English teacher because I have learned the grammar, the vocabulary, the rules, and the pronunciation the hard way.You can't teach effectively something you haven't learned, and let's face it, native speakers don't really learn grammar.When I was learning English I had both native and non-native teachers. When I asked questions about why this or that sentence is built this way, the non-native always knew the answer and knew how to explain it while the natives didn't.While learning a language, you also learn how to learn and you can relate to the struggles faced by beginners. When you are born with it, it's not possible to relate.There's an argument in favor of speaking the most popular version of a language so most people can understand it. That's why most people learn American English, after all, there are 400 million Americans vs 60 million Brits.That's all very well and good, but there is an even bigger pool of English speakers:ESL speakersEnglish as a Second Language Speakers is by far the biggest group so it makes sense to understand and be understood by them.With about 2 billion fluent speakers, you don't want to miss out. That's the beauty of English, it opens the entire world to you, and not just the former colonies.A Nigerian or south Indian person doesn't learn English to speak to an Australian, they learn to speak with their fellow countrymen that don't share the same dialect.So if you want your English or Spanish or French to be useful, keep in mind that you won't be necessarily speaking to a native all the time. You will be speaking to a Chinese guy from Alibaba and complaining about why your order didn't arrive on time.My best English teacher was a Spanish lady. She was amazing. Had I been narrow-minded and refuse to learn from a non-native, I would have missed out big time.There are millions of non-native teachers, so you can draw from a bigger pool of talent. Not only they speak good English but they know how to teach.Would you rather learn from a 22-year-old who's taken a gap year in Argentina and is teaching only to support her holiday? Or would you rather be taught by someone who has devoted 10 years to learn every intricacy of the language and plan to make a career out of it?Commitment is important. I just couldn't motivate myself to teach Spanish. How boring that would be! That's the way native teachers feel about the language, not all but most of them.When you love a subject and decide to spend your career teaching it, you are committed and that shows. Never choose a teacher that is not passionate about the subject they impart.When grammar gets really complex, you need somebody who can explain the details in a language you understand. Unfortunately, that guy from Ohio doesn't speak a word of German so, tough luck.Often schools try to turn this flaw into a feature. They sell it with the following argument: 'Because our teachers don't speak your language, you'll be forced to speak English and that will accelerate your learning'I don't buy that. Most of the lesson should be done in English but would the need arise for a deeper explanation, you want the option to communicate in a language you can actually understand.Don't get me wrong, by speaking to a native person, you'll get the nuances, turns of phrase, and idioms that might not be available from a Non-native.I guess a combination would be ideal in order to get the best of both worlds. But I still think the ratio should be 80/20 in favor of the non-native teacher.At the end of the day, you want to communicate with as many people as possible and that means combining native and non-native speakers.Disclaimer: I'm not a teacher and I have no intention of becoming one. I just think that teaching is a profession that should be taken very seriously and teachers should show commitment, empathy, and determination. If you are one of those, congratulations, that's what the world needs. If you are not, please quit and find another profession.Sayonara, baby!",,https://medium.com/change-your-mind/7-reasons-why-native-speakers-dont-necessarily-make-the-best-language-teachers-899416513e6c,education,56e9a6e1105aac3c843bafb7e5a17a71e41dc65453a1596a39cd557a
"Inflation: The Good, The Bad, and The Transitory","By Skanda Amarnath and Alex WilliamsThe Fed's framework review and forward guidance from this past fall showed an encouraging willingness to center labor market outcomes over inflation in evaluating interest rate policy. However, the Fed has only partially clarified how they will evaluate real-time inflationary dynamics within their new flexible average inflation targeting regime. The end of the pandemic, alongside substantial stimulus spending, has created an environment where some commentators and policymakers are preemptively worried about inflation, much as they were in 2009 after the Great Financial Crisis. We present three possible scenarios to consider, when thinking about the path that interest rate policy should take through the end of the pandemic and beginning of the recovery.The most important takeaway is that it is critical to distinguish between transitory and persistent inflation when thinking about interest rate policy, and that it should be the growth in wage incomes that drives the assessment of persistent inflationary dynamics. As the pandemic ends, the shift in consumption baskets is liable to create some one-off inflation, especially as capacity comes back online. If this inflation does not to show up in wage incomes, there would be far less reason for the Fed to respond.The Fed's framework review and forward guidance from this past fall showed an encouraging willingness to focus on labor market outcomes rather than inflation alone. Rather than previous efforts at forward guidance which guaranteed low rates until either inflation or employment rose, the most recent guidance ensures low rates until both inflation and employment rise sufficiently.Chair Jerome Powell took pains at the most recent FOMC press conference to emphasize that this guidance will not be changing anytime soon, indicating that low rates will continue until the labor market improves. Similarly, Lael Brainard's most recent speech makes the case for the Fed to focus on eliminating ""shortfalls from maximum employment,"" rather than minimizing ""deviations from maximum employment in either direction."" Vice Chair Clarida also, in a recent speech, took care to point out that even after the current labor market dislocation has passed, the Fed will not raise rates simply ""because the unemployment rate has fallen below any particular econometric estimate of its long-run natural level."" On the whole, recent Fed communications make clear that the Fed is not interested in raising rates until the labor market broadly returns to pre-pandemic conditions at a minimum.However, the maximum employment emphasis within the Fed's framework review and forward guidance will be tested, both by market participants' anticipations and by dissenting voices within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress has passed two of the largest fiscal packages ever, and looks primed to pass a third. President Biden has promised to issue another round of stimulus checks while also extending enhanced unemployment insurance provisions from prior relief bills.Despite the widespread business closures and the massive hit to GDP and employment, many market participants and political commentators rely on the simple expectation that the increase in government spending will necessarily lead to inflation.While longer run market-implied inflation expectations are indeed rising, market participants see upward price pressures being more frontloaded.Even when the Fed has tried to communicate a dovish path for interest rate policy, markets often misinterpreted the Fed's reaction function and reflected tighter financial conditions as a result.With all of that said, as the pandemic winds down and vaccinations roll out, there are three scenarios which the Fed should consider when thinking about the influence of inflation on interest rate policy. While inflation anxieties have been largely muted by the scale of economic disruption, there remains a nontrivial chance that we see some price acceleration as public health conditions normalize. What will prove critical in the months ahead is the ability to look through transitory inflation to focus on measures of labor market strength.The first scenario is the easiest to understand. It is possible that businesses scale up capacity at the same pace as demand rises once the pandemic ends. In this situation, there is no inflation to worry about, and the Fed remains accommodative while workers return to their jobs. Employment steadily rises as vaccines roll out, and the economy moves smoothly into recovery. There is no pressure from commentators or politicians to hike rates, as there is no inflation to point to. The Fed's goal in this scenario would be straightforward: do everything it can to ensure that the recovery is as fast as possible.However, this may not be the most likely scenario. Social life returning to normal is likely to entail substantial sectoral shifts with long and variable lags throughout the entire economy, and that might be markedly different by geography. These may even have knock-on effects higher up the supply chain, with temporary bottlenecks expressing themselves in ways other than higher prices. Vendor lead times and delivery times might grow longer, and firms may even engage in outright quantity rationing.This brings us to our second scenario, one in which the sectoral rotation accompanying the end of the pandemic brings on a bout of transitory inflation.Early on in the pandemic, optimistic commentators frequently made reference to ""pent-up demand,"" the idea that the pandemic forced a significant increase in aggregate savings rates, and that when it ends, consumers will be looking to spend those unintended savings. Predictions of a ""V-shaped recovery"" were often predicated on this dynamic. While consumer spending did take some hits after CARES Act facilities expired, it has remained reasonably strong throughout the pandemic, especially among higher-income consumers who have seen relatively less employment disruption.What seems much more likely is extreme pent-up demand for certain kinds of services. Many are tired of being locked inside and may take the end of the pandemic as an occasion to spend on leisure and hospitality in ways they were not otherwise able or willing to. This may create inflationary pressures in selected sectors, as a huge number of very small and fine-grained capacity bottlenecks are hit by a sudden and substantial increase in demand for travel, hospitality, and related consumption. If demand increases more quickly than capacity can return, prices may rise, and we may soon see significant one-off increases in PCE components related to this consumption.For policymakers, temporary price increases should not be the dominant factor in how they chart out the course for interest rates. As shown above, sectors vulnerable to substantial post-pandemic consumption shifts represent less than a quarter of the total PCE inflation component weights.It may be good, for example, for hotels to get some pricing power back to make up for margins effectively lost during pandemic. Rotation within supply chains will also take time, as jet fuel prices are now starting to rise again to meet an expected surge in the demand for air travel.These sectors required an ad hoc mix of low-interest loans and grants to make it through the pandemic. If they make up for lost margins by using price rationing as they bring capacity back online, it's hard to see that as an unmanageable inflationary outcome over the longer run.Depending on how far the impacts of this new spending move up the supply chain, we may see price increases in sectors traditionally associated with more persistent inflation. However, this will likely only be for a short period. Inflation from short term capacity constraints is something of a common occurrence, even in the teeth of recessions. It indicates little about the health of the overall economy, and next to nothing about the state of the labor market.To illustrate, consider the one-off inflation in new and used cars following the Great Financial Crisis. The Cash for Clunkers program incentivized the purchase of new cars, while the precipitous fall in interest rates incentivized the purchase of new and used cars alike. After about a year of inflation, prices leveled off as capacity adjusted to a new level of purchasing. At no point did this dynamic have a useful signal to offer about labor markets or future inflation. This is yet another example of why it's useful to break out inflation by component to make sure not to act on transitory, unrelated movements.If, following the end of the pandemic, services come online more slowly than demand increases, there is likely to be some price increase in services and upstream sectors, enough to move the aggregate inflation data.The price of commodities have broadly increased over recent months.We know that increases in the price of basic commodities may lead to inflation in finished goods. Oil, a commodity at the beginning of many supply chains, exhibited this dynamic quite pointedly in the 1970s. Firms facing a sudden increase in intermediate goods passed this price increase on to consumers, and the result was price increases in seemingly unrelated PCE components.However, without an attendant increase in wages, all of this inflation represents a transitory form of price rationing as capacity expands to meet current demand, rather than a persistent, reflexive pattern of price acceleration.Without wages accelerating proportionally, real income actually declines throughout that period of inflation, curtailing purchasing power and slowing real demand for consumer goods and services. It is hard to argue that the economy is in an inflationary feedback loop due to a relative price change that causes real household incomes to fall.Which brings us to our last scenario, one in which the effects of a sharp takeup in labor, coupled with historically strong household balance sheets, pave the way for more persistent inflationary pressures. This situation is the proper object of inflation anxiety: that increased financial well-being will lead to excessive household consumption in a manner that creates a positive feedback loop on wages and unit costs. In the past, this anxiety has been used to justify or suggest preemptive rate hikes shortly after the beginning of an economic recovery. Today's labor markets can't afford any policy missteps. What is most important about this scenario - and which seems highly unlikely given the degree and composition of labor market damage - is how to distinguish persistent inflation from transitory inflation. The ability to do this will be key to preventing Fed policy missteps.In order to bring about maximum employment consistent with the Fed's statutory mandate, it is critical that the Fed be able to discriminate between the second and third scenario above. Prematurely hiking will slow expansion and threaten to create another ""jobless recovery,"" something the country can ill-afford. Luckily, there exist clear indicators that can help differentiate between persistent and transitory inflation.In the benchmark models that the Fed relies on, accelerating inflation comes from labor demand outstripping labor supply such that workers are able to successfully and successively demand wage increases that match or outstrip increases in consumer prices. The central idea behind this model is that tight labor markets are - after some particular threshold for labor market tightness is crossed - inherently inflationary. This dynamic is most succinctly described by the Phillips Curve, which intends to show a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.FRB/US, still the main macroeconomic model in use at the Federal Reserve, utilizes a particular specification of a New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) which relates Core PCE inflation to Employment Cost Index (ECI) hourly compensation. Higher inflation is presumed to be correlated to higher ECI hourly compensation, while compensation is expected to fall with inflation. Though a number of Fed governors - especially Chair Powell - emphasize that the Phillips Curve has become nearly flat of late, and the current specification takes into account expectations and relative price shocks, the mechanism within the model remains fundamentally driven by labor market slack and its effect on wage growth.In this model, when labor markets are slack, there is minimal pressure to increase wages. Bargaining power remains with employers rather than employees. However, if labor markets tighten, employers will have to compete on wages to attract new workers, pushing up compensation and unit labor costs. If employers are unwilling to sacrifice profit margins, they raise prices to match the increase in unit costs, inaugurating an inflationary cycle. Since labor markets remain tight, and this tightness is the source of the bargaining power that led to wage increases, there's supposedly nothing to stop labor from demanding at least equivalent wage increases in subsequent periods and continuing the cycle. This inflation in the production and purchasing of consumer goods then goes on to have negative effects on all kinds of unrelated economic processes that inflation hawks abhor.However, for inflation to be persistent and durable within this model, it is critical for both aspects - increases in wages and prices - to show up in the data. If wages are rising but prices are not, this represents a straightforward increase in real income for labor. Vice Chair Clarida is on record in a number of places commending recent increases in the labor share of output. Keep in mind also that the data we observe for prices often embeds quality improvements. While sticker prices consumers observe may be increasing, the quality-adjusted prices that the BLS publishes tend to show more disinflation. An increase in real income for labor straightforwardly indicates that slack capacity in the economy is finding productive work.If, on the other hand, prices are rising but wages are not, this represents a straightforward decrease in real income for labor. Prices rising without costs rising increases margins somewhere in the economy, and so real wages fall. Inflation accompanied by falling real wages will quickly burn out and resolve to a simple change in relative prices. 2008 provides the prima facie example of how inflation acceleration cannot sustain itself if incomes continue to deteriorate.With all this in mind, it should be uncontroversial to say that the core indicators to look at when deciding if observed inflation is transitory or persistent are mainly wage measurements. Chair Powell made this point quite succinctly during the most recent FOMC press conference, saying that the Fed will wait until changes show up in the ""data, and not just the outlook.""If one sees increases in the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and other measures of wages alongside an increase in inflation, it's more likely to be a situation in which growth rates in spending, wages and prices are more durable and therefore justify some proportional interest rate adjustment from the Fed. To be clear, the ECI has not weakened as much as one would have expected over the course of the pandemic. However, if there's no increase in these measures alongside observed increases in inflation, there is no reason for the Fed to act, especially if labor utilization remains anywhere near as depressed as it has been since the pandemic.To a lesser extent, and for the purpose of model confirmation, it would also be prudent to look at the prime-age employment to population ratio or Ernie Tedeschi's ""NPOP"" as measures of labor market tightness. If your model is that persistent inflation is driven by labor markets that become so tight that workers are able to bargain for wage increases, it helps to make sure that employment levels are high relative to their historical levels.Even if we do see some persistent signs of inflation, it would be wise for the Fed to disentangle short-term and medium-term estimates of what is achievable in terms of labor utilization. International experience shows us that even as economies might see some coincident price acceleration when labor utilization hits new peaks, such acceleration tends to be temporary and does not preclude the achievement of further, higher peaks.If we look closely at the relationship between labor utilization and the more cyclical components of inflation, what should be visible is that it is the change in labor utilization that matters, not the outright level of labor utilization.To prudently navigate the constraints posed by its dual mandate, the Fed should provide more clarity in its communications, especially the Summary of Economic Projections. In the post-pandemic environment, it is critical to ensure that estimates of maximum employment are flexible both in terms of timeline and selection of salient indicators for tracking labor market slack and wage growth. ECI and the prime-age employment-to-population ratios deserve to feature at least as prominently than the unemployment rate. Beyond inclusion, the future trajectory of these variables should be subject to more dynamic and generous revision than are usually provided for unemployment rate projections. Traversing these troubled waters will thus require careful, clarifying communication.The Fed has learned time and again since the Global Financial Crisis that past estimates do not guarantee future levels of full employment. If economic indicators are consistent with transitory rather than persistent inflation, the Fed should shrug off any suggestion that they tighten until labour markets make a full recovery to at least pre-pandemic levels.While it would be trite to say that the Fed should wait until seeing the whites of inflation's eyes to hike rates, we would submit instead that they should wait further to make sure that the white they see is in fact an eye, rather than a flare in their lenses. Hiking rates on evidence of transitory inflation would be a clear policy error that helps to stymie labor market expansion and bring on yet another jobless recovery.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1794/0*4MtRjBgkaMmMAd1I,https://employamerica.medium.com/inflation-the-good-the-bad-and-the-transitory-cc289f524c1c,economy,58f46650d35db86b0c516314cd51ef9834d076a3b51faae7f8fe2bf2
The First Step After Depression Kept Me From Writing for 2 Months,"I'm a writer. I blog on Medium. Today, I opened a new draft to write this story. The last time I did this was two months ago. Yet I know that to be a good, successful writer, I should do this more often.So, what the hell happened?I'll tell you: Seasonal Affective Disorder happened. Bipolar Depression happened. Mental illness that impaired my ability to work, happened.And it's been awful.Don't get me wrong - I did some good things the past few months. I've exercised, looked after my physical and mental health, celebrated the holidays with my family . . . but I barely worked. And I didn't write.But, I'm back at it today. So, how'd I get here?The first thing I did was forgive myself for taking time off. You may be thinking, ""What's to forgive, Amy? You were suffering! It's not your fault!""True.But for this recovering perfectionist, I feel like I need to be forgiven. I feel like I let myself down. I'm ambitious and creative; I'm a writer who wants to help people and create success for myself and others with my craft. And I haven't been doing that lately.Instead, I've been sleeping a lot, during the day. (That's a telltale sign of depression for me.)I knew I was depressed, and I did my best to get through it. And you know what? I did get through it, thankfully. I'm still here. And I'm really happy about that. I get to live another day. I get to try again. I get to live my dream life and spend part of my day writing a story that I hope brings value to myself and others.For me, the purpose of self-forgiveness is to wipe the slate clean of self-judgment.When I feel depressed, I think things like, ""I'll never become a good enough writer if I don't write every day"" or ""I'm so behind on my goals, I may as well give up for the day/week/month/year.""Those are some nasty thoughts. They're what my therapist calls ""stinkin' thinkin'.""Forgiving myself is my way of starting fresh; it gives me a new opportunity to show up as I am, without the need for constant improvement.My strategy is to write in my journal, following these steps:With these three steps, I feel seen, heard, validated, and capable of starting again from where I am instead of being filled with regret about the past.Jenny Capper writes and vlogs for the ""Mental Health for the Digital Generation"" on HealthyPlace.com and she posted a video about the importance of forgiving yourself if you struggle with mental illness.In her video, Capper gives the example of criticizing herself for procrastinating on a project. But this self-criticism leads to a struggle with confidence. So, she practices self-care by remembering that she has a relationship with herself that needs to be nurtured (just like any other relationship).She says she copes with her feelings of self-criticism by changing her self-talk and treating herself the way she'd treat a dear friend. I've done the same thing, and it helps me feel better and be more productive, which is an important value of mine.Capper is right - we each have a relationship with ourselves that is worthy of time, care, and attention. And that relationship can be defined, like any other relationship. Ask yourself the following questions to assess the nature of your relationship with yourself:If these questions bring up difficult feelings or make you cringe, you probably need to develop a more loving relationship with yourself. Remember, the first step is not to feel bad about feeling bad; it's to forgive yourself. From the posture of forgiveness and grace, you can develop healthy habits that support your wellbeing and nurture your self-love.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*8bnRrCWgDh2vBiRF,https://amyhartsough.medium.com/the-first-step-after-depression-kept-me-from-writing-for-2-months-ccf64257785,mental-health,61bad2d06097ffa5adb6f2dc38e950a677732bdbe5190ccd433d8f19
How to be a design ethicist at any company,"It's easy to feel stuck, frozen, and unsupported when trying to get your team or company to take design ethics seriously. But now more than ever, it's so important that designers and product people who care about the ethical implications of their products work at companies who haven't quite figured it out.A design ethicist is someone who evaluates the moral implications of design decisions and takes responsibility for the effect those decisions have on the world at large.I'm not an expert in design ethics. I've been a product designer for 5 years and just starting to figure this stuff out. These are some things that have helped me incorporate design ethics at work.Why: This will force projects to be measured by something other than ""did we release the thing people asked for"". Even if the measures aren't based on any ethical analysis, it will get your team to think about how the product changes human behavior, both good and bad. Outcome vs feature roadmapsWhy: Dark patterns are the most basic offense against ethical design. You can convince other product people or higher ups with the business argument: we need people's trust in order to form an ongoing relationship where they want to give us money.Learn about dark patternsWhy: Your team will naturally build more compassion and understanding for how people are affected by your product, which means they'll be more likely to build products that protect those people.Why: You'll hear perspectives that will help you understand the effects of your product on people who aren't the average user and you'll design with less bias. This takes a concerted effort - you will attract more white male research participants by default because they've been socialized to value their opinions.Why: Humans of all backgrounds have biases against certain groups of people (even groups they are a part of). If you want to design equally and fairly, it's time to unpack some of those biases. I took this Microsoft course, but it would be even better to take one that included interacting with other students.Why: Start introducing this term to team members and make it a regular part of discussion. How can people support something they've never heard of?Why: Even if your entire team isn't on board, you can still leave your projects better for people who need them. I reference this A11y checklist when working on design proposals.Why: Including a diverse range of people in your user research is a great first step, but co-designing with those people will lead to greater understanding of their mental models.Why: Set a tone and expectation that you care for all customers. Even though this doesn't directly affect you product, it can change company culture. (Edit: when sharing this with some friends I trust, I got feedback that inclusive illustrations can feel condescending if your company isn't also taking other action against racism and gender discrimination).Why: Some people on your team may not even realize that you are leaving out this part of the design process. Acknowledging the gap might bring out more energy and motivation to work on it.Why: Fighting for something by yourself is hard. The more voices you have behind this topic, the better.Why: Get people thinking about evaluating their designs with ethical standards, even if they aren't doing it systematically.Why: Including ethical assessments in your design practice is the most influential way to change the impact of your product. I've only ever successfully done this at one company.Resources to get started:Why: What about all the parts of your product that already exist? Unless you're starting from scratch, your past work needs ethical assessment too.Why: This isn't a topic that should stay within the design or product team. Tell a story, if you can, about how you product could hurt somebody and what your team is doing about it.If your company thinks manipulating people with design is the way to a prosperous business then it might be a lost cause. But, if you think the company is open to it, remember that system changes take a lot of time. As you build trust with team members, you'll be more likely to influence practices, and that doesn't happen overnight.It can also be incredibly exhausting to constantly advocate for change, so give yourself a break. If you're struggling to do your job and fight for these changes, maybe it's time to work somewhere that's a little further along in the process. Especially for underrepresented communities, who are often already fighting for equality at work.The tech industry has immense work to do to take design ethics seriously, but you can be a leader at your company. We need you.P.S.

4 Mindfulness Tips to Help Freelance Developers Finally Relax,"The life of a freelance developer is intense - finding new projects, fixing code bugs, dealing with endless emails, and chasing payments on top of creating new stuff.It is depleting. Eventually, your body says ""no more!""You're forced into a period of downtime, which in itself creates more stress as you can't continue to work.I've found myself in this cycle multiple times.There's no quick fix, however, there is a way to help soften its impact.Fans of Medium will probably be no stranger to mindfulness meditation.To my infinite shame, I only started taking mindfulness seriously when it appeared on my FitBit app dashboard. Each time I logged in, there was a little icon that let me track my mindfulness sessions.This gentle reminder to meditate most days has helped to integrate mindfulness more deeply into my daily life. I no longer rely on guided meditations at set times - I find it more effective to use the practice when I feel like I need could benefit from it.This has seriously helped me to deal with some of the more acute aspects of my job, such as anxiety and frustration. More generally, it helps me to feel optimistic.Below are some ways that mindfulness has supported my freelance lifestyle. I hope it can help you too.Prospective client calls in particular can be stressful. All the unknowns.If you're like me, this produces an unwelcome anxiety spike that can impede your ability to think clearly.When I feel especially shaken by an upcoming meeting, it helps to make myself feel grounded. I do this by focusing on the sensations of my feet on the ground. I intentionally relax my shoulders, becoming aware of the downward force of gravity upon them.This sends signals to the brain to assure all is well - there is no need to go nuts on the adrenaline. Amazingly, this simple act of intentionally loosening your physical body can make your mind feel relaxed.Next time you're feeling nervous about an imminent call or meeting, take a moment to feel yourself grounded. A sense of calm will wash over you, empowering you to be more you when it's time to talk.Before I understood that there is a space between stimulus and response, I would hit the roof the moment a bad email came in.A client not happy with a piece of work? How dare they! More delays on an overdue invoice? Grrr! 😤What mindfulness does is enable you to pause for a moment before responding. When I was growing up, to calm down I was told to count to 10. But that never worked for me. Instead, I now focus on the sensations of the breath moving in and out of my body before doing anything else.There is something deeply calming about tuning into this sensation. When I feel my belly rise and fall, the worries melt away. This temporary relief means I can focus on a more rational response rather than an emotional outburst.Taking the time to notice my breathing has worked wonders with my client relations. It's also, rather surprisingly, helped foster a greater sense of empathy toward others as I give myself the space to deeply reflect on their grievances. Try it - the next time a client riles you, breathe.My morning routine used to involve quickly making an instant coffee that I would gulp way too quickly whilst checking emails and burning my mouth.This is ridiculous! Think how far those wonderful beans have travelled, how awesome coffee is. It deserves more than to be washed down without a thought.I now take a few moments in the morning to drink the coffee slowly, mindfully, whilst looking of the window. I can see trees with squirrels bouncing from branch to branch. I notice wispy clouds hanging in the deep blue sky. I can hear my neighbour chainsawing some logs - well mindfulness is all about opening up to everything!Rather than using coffee purely as a tool to energise me, I've seen that there is value in the drinking of it. Doing this mindfully sets my day off to a much steadier start.I've written before about the cognitive benefits of walking, but doing it mindfully only intensifies the effect.As a web developer my work is often quite technically challenging. In my junior days I would sit with a problem for hours, stubbornly refusing to take a break (I still do, sometimes).But when I get outside away from the laptop, great things happen.My mind awakens. By noticing the terrain beneath my feet and the sights and sounds around me, I'm given a short break from the problem at hand.I don't know what sorcery this is, but countless times I have experienced a revelation after returning from these short walks. It's like my brain gets a hard reset, and within minutes I can solve a problem that I had previously fixated on for hours.If your day throws up a tricky problem that is blocking you from moving forward, take a walk and intentionally focus on your immediate surroundings. Let go of the thoughts, the problem, and when you return, you might well find that the answer has magically appeared.We tend to overthink meditation. Thanks largely to how it is portrayed in popular media, we expect to hit upon some deep spiritual state, some otherworldly place.The truth is you don't need a guru or candles or the view of some snow-capped mountain range. All you need to do is be present, to pay attention to your body, your thoughts and the environment around you.Once enchanted by this elusive, peaceful lifestyle, I have come to appreciate meditation for what it really is - a tool to give me a damn break. That's it.Leverage its power to reconnect with yourself, to step beyond your worries, to relax.Stop reading now, and go practice.If you enjoyed this please consider following me for more.

Our Product Design Journey: How We Discovered Air Quality Data Wasn't Enough,"When we founded BreezoMeter, many businesses and governments were not ready to answer the public demand for solutions that protected them from harmful air quality.As data scientists and environmental engineers with our own air quality technology and APIs, we realized we were equipped to answer this demand - and so our B2C product design journey began.Today, our air quality app is used by hundreds of thousands each day by users around the world. It also ranks as one of the highest in the air quality app categories on both the Apple and Google Play stores. So.. how did we do it? I'll explain here some of our insights and product design learnings as we came to realize that data without insights or context is totally meaningless:Establishing our own unique B2C proposition within a B2B DaaS country has been a really interesting journey - we quickly realized that the psychology behind our B2B messaging wouldn't translate for consumer audiences.It's always a good idea to start with the basics - but when you're in the business of improving individual lives for the better, it's essential to understand the personal use cases and motivations that bring people to look for the solutions you provide.I'm not going to explore all the fundamentals of product design research and user personas here, but these are some strategies that particularly worked well for us:One thing that really worked for us at the start was to explore the assets and messaging for companies within our eco-system, such as weather and pollen tracking apps, and work backwards from that: What were their main features? How did they position themselves strategically? Were there any insights we could obtain from their websites and apps and their direction for the future?For example, say a company offered a resource providing informational and educational content - we could deduce that they were targeting educators or those interested in self-learning. If another player provided a considerable amount of governmental and legislative information, this gave us yet further insights into a separate group of potential user group interests. This method helped us to validate some of our own assumptions as a first, basic step in the early days.Especially for an air quality data company like ours, where the public often sets the pace of demand, social media provides an invaluable tool for getting intimately acquainted with our would-be users and the solutions they felt were currently missing in the marketplace.For example, our wildfire alerts and real-time smoke tracking was borne directly from a need to provide individuals with real-time information during a wildfire event - when many other sources of this information go offline due to blackouts or damage.In addition to product development inspiration, social media helps us to identify the gaps in information out there, and a strategic backbone to our content planning. We're lucky to have the full gambit of atmospheric scientists, product experts, marketing and technical specialists at BreezoMeter, meaning we're well equipped to answer the public's burning questions in an informed and thorough way.Raw data, even if it's personalized to the user, gives no value in the long-term, it's the insights and recommendations you provide that do this.Here's an example: Say you just bought a new fitness watch that tracks your sleep. You check the watch and see some numbers that basically tell you slept for 8 hours or 6, or 7.This kind of information can hold interest for a while, but we've found that for prolonged user retention and interest, individuals really want insights into how well they slept and advice for how to improve their sleep over time in light of their personal activities and habits throughout the day.Simply reporting on 'how' or 'task completion' will never fully address your users' needs in the long run.Maslow's hierarchy of psychological needs goes some way to explaining why this is. At the top of the pyramid is the self-actualization so many of us are striving to reach: Much of the drive behind personalization is connected to habit change and optimal living in today's day and age.Consumers today want to feel as though they're improving their lives and solutions that provide raw data without insights don't really help them to do this.The realization that we needed to look beyond the data we provide in order to successfully capture our B2C audience has been an essential point of learning at BreezoMeter.We could have the most reliable air quality information in the world, but we won't achieve our mission or capture the imagination of our users if we don't encourage new habits and help our users with real-life decision-makingWe are big fans of Fogg's behavior model for habit formation at BreezoMeter. The idea behind this approach is that long-term behavior change occurs not by pure motivation or willpower, but rather by making small changes to behavior that evolve over time.For these behavioral changes to begin, there needs to be the initial motivations for doing so, the actual ability to complete a task - (if it's too complicated, people will give up) - and initial trigger for wanting to change a particular behavior.For Breezometer, this model starts with encouraging our app and livemap users to be more air-quality aware - simply checking air pollution levels where they are at any given time - and making small choices as a result such as choosing to walk on the opposite side of the road, heading to a different park or shutting the windows when they receive a low air quality alert.",https://miro.medium.com/max/664/0*zI4g-9vtZ7ca3dtH,https://productcoalition.com/our-product-design-journey-how-we-discovered-air-quality-data-wasnt-enough-4d97c84c179c,design,63d5fd9642c7a2fb40e27fc89b82a41fe5ff22171b14b07111df984b
Kingdom Hearts Finally Hits PC as an Epic Store Exclusive,"An action role-playing game that lets you team up with Disney and Pixar characters? Kingdom Hearts sounds like a dream come true and that's because it is. The holy grail of crossovers was born from a chance meeting between a Square Enix producer and a Disney executive in an elevator. The companies shared a building in Japan at the time and the results were beyond the wildest dreams of Disney and Pixar fans across the globe.In 2021, few games have as much narrative baggage as a series that doesn't hesitate to jump from one world to another. After all, juggling a complex narrative with faithful renditions of the source material is no simple feat. Simply walking around in the game often feels like being on a Disney set, complete with props and characters. And that's why Kingdom Hearts finally showing up on PC is a moment worth celebrating. It's time to duel with keyblades.While it did start as a franchise that married the best elements of the iconic Final Fantasy games and the recognizable Disney roster, Kingdom Hearts soon outgrew its former ambitions. Underneath all the visual spectacle was a rock-solid role-playing game that never ceased to surprise and engage the player. If you're still wondering why Donald Duck is a mage, there's no better time to give Kingdom Hearts a shot. If anything, you'll witness what the hype was all about.While Kingdom Hearts does come with a needlessly complicated mythos for a franchise aimed at a younger audience, the satisfying combat more than makes up for it. Weaving together impressive combos as you face hordes of foes across colorful worlds is a feeling that never really gets old. Some of the Disney-themed regions can seem like retreads of a story that has already been told. But experiencing said world as a living and breathing character has its own sense of charm.Besides short sessions at console booths in malls, I haven't had the opportunity to really dive into Kingdom Hearts' expansive lore and learn how the games connect to each other. But with its arrival on PC, I hope that changes. It's about time I caught up with my Kingdom Hearts homework. Here are the games heading to PC on March 30:Kingdom Hearts 1.5 + 2.5 Remix is available for $49.99 at the Epic Games Store while the other three games are $59.99 each.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*16pzwJDpIhpzc7YWsHStcA.jpeg,https://medium.com/super-jump/kingdom-hearts-finally-hits-pc-as-an-epic-store-exclusive-73fd8b428bc1,gaming,64bdc73485c69b0dccda19a008123036da1643705a659e55c5572c78
Love and Other Punishments,"There comes a point when people simply expect you to get over the death of your wife and children.I can't say I blame them. After all, who wants to be around someone who mopes all the time, blithering on about their dead loved ones? Who wants to hear how every waking moment is agony? I certainly wouldn't.Of course, I never talk about it anymore. What on earth would be the point? I can't bring them back. The subject would only cause embarrassment. Better to cry in the privacy of my own home, away from cold, harsh, judgemental eyes. The eyes have got so very cold. I sometimes wonder if there is any compassion left in this world.I have to believe there is. Otherwise, there would be no point dragging myself out of bed, shaving, showering, putting on that grey work suit, and forcing the stale cereal into my mouth. Even washed down with tea, my throat constricts when I try to swallow. I can't remember when I last enjoyed a meal. My head pounds. The hangover is particularly bad today.I glance outside the window of my 27th story flat. The city is a purgatory of drab grey in the January rain. What happened to colour? Ever since they died, just over three years ago, everything seems desaturated, as though someone dialed down the chroma settings on a television.I finish breakfast, put on my shoes, and head out of my flat to the lift. It's always uncomfortably packed, with a tense air of silent, simmering impatience. After enduring the awkward journey down, I spill into the lobby with my fellow passengers, and head out of Municipal Housing Block AA23, into the rain. Stinging winds lash my face. At the monorail station on the other side of the street, I scan my wrist on the access panel. The turnstile lets me through. I run up the escalator to the platform, just in time to catch the 8:22 train.After boarding, I stare at the grey blur of flats, office blocks, and corporate headquarters, as we head into the city centre. My mind is numb. I wish I could think of something other than the pain, but I can never escape it. At least at the office, I can bury myself in the endless calls, claims, and paperwork of Prometheus Insurance.Twenty minutes later, I arrive at my station. I step into the street, momentarily distracted by the gigantic virtual video display that looms on the side of the office building where I work. A BBC newsreader bellows above the melee of self-driving cars, trains, and busy pedestrians.'Today, the public flogging of Charles Jackson and Irene Watson will take place in Trafalgar Square. A large crowd is expected to turn out to witness the punishment after both were convicted of fraud in a banking scandal that left millions without pensions. Jackson and Watson, who were each sentenced to thirty-six lashes, will also serve fifteen-year prison sentences and have been stripped of their assets to boost the compensation fund for those affected by their crimes.'In a speech to the House of Commons, Prime Minister Jane Young said ""The punishment of Charles Jackson and Irene Watson will serve as an example to others who would try to defraud the British people. You will be found out. You will be severely punished. Justice will be done."" The leader of the opposition, Caroline Adams, condemned the punishment as ""medieval and barbaric"", to jeers from many in the Commons, including members of her own party...'Rolling my eyes, I enter the Prometheus Insurance offices. I am much of the opinion of Caroline Adams, but we seem to be in a minority these days. Jane Young based her last election campaign primarily on eye-for-an-eye justice and won with a massively increased majority. Several radical reforms later, we're living in a country that Daily Mail readers could only dream about a few short decades ago. It isn't just the UK either. All across Europe, there has been a similar swing to the extreme right.A few moments later, I'm sitting at my desk in the vast open-plan office on floor seven. I click through several files on my computer. Claim assessments galore. I check my appointment schedule for today and note with a modicum of dismay that I have meetings with at least two people whose claims will be denied on absurd technicalities.I pause, standing and glancing at the almost endless rows of perfectly symmetrical desk booths stretching ahead; at least a hundred men and women, all following the dreary Prometheus dress code, all processing claims, speaking with clients, or taking calls. A great sea of monochrome misery.The world didn't use to be like this. I can't believe the absence of Katie, Billy, and Tom really makes a difference to anyone but me and perhaps some of my extended family, yet it feels as though their deaths broke the world.My day passes in a haze of indifference. I approve certain pay-outs and deny others. During the afternoon, I am summoned to the office of Eric Stevens, my boss. He's a short, bald, bespectacled man with a goatee, who insists on sitting on an excessively raised chair when behind his desk berating underlings.'I've been looking at your pay-outs old boy,' Eric says, his high, whiny voice annoying me even more than usual. 'You authorised payment on the Walker claim, which frankly I think demonstrates questionable judgement. Are you sure you made the right call?''Someone vandalised their car Eric, and the claim seemed clear enough to me.''They are only covered if the car is on their property, and it wasn't.''It was parked on their driveway.'Eric pressed a button on his computer, bringing up a holographic photograph just above his desk.'Ah! But in the photograph, you can clearly see the car bonnet protruding slightly over the pavement next to the drive.''So you're saying I should have denied the claim based on what, exactly? That an inch of the car was invading public pavement airspace?''You should have argued.''We would have been sued!''Yes, yes we would have been sued. But then we would have settled out of court for a greatly reduced sum. Remember, we can't help those who genuinely need payouts if we pay-out where claims are fraudulent.''The Walker claim wasn't fraudulent.''Look here old boy, you need to look at the bigger picture. Our clients. Our shareholders. Our staff. What would happen if we all lost our jobs in a cost-cutting drive, due to excessive pay-outs? What would happen if you lost your job?'It's difficult to know how to reply to this. I could easily get another job, but I've been with Prometheus Insurance for many years, and the mundane routine keeps my mind busy. The dull, repetitive, familiar nature of what I do actually appeals to me. It numbs the pain.On the other hand, I can't just turn down claims in the morally reprehensible way Eric suggests. Other insurance agents have indeed done this using similar ruses, settling out of court if sued, when their clients have the means to pursue such a course. But I can't do that. My absolute sense of justice will not allow it.'Eric, it's a changed world out there,' I say. 'The laws are severe. If I did what you're suggesting, I could end up being publicly flogged for corruption.''So that's what you're afraid of? Don't worry old boy. I have the legal department all over stuff like this. Believe me, we aren't breaking the law. You could have denied that claim, and you wouldn't have been breaking the law.''I can't do what you're asking. It's immoral.''Immoral perhaps, but not illegal.' Eric sighs. 'Oh for God's sake, stop looking so glum... It's your job. If it depresses you that much, just leave.''I'm not depressed.''Yeah, well you could have fooled me. Look, I'll be honest with you. You need to pull yourself together. I'm sick of this celebrity bereavement routine.''You think I sought out that celebrity?''I don't care. The point is, it was over three years ago. My sympathy for your predicament has officially expired. Time to get over the past, and get on with your job. Here's the bottom line: Either do what you are paid to do, and bury those moral scruples of yours once and for all, or we'll find someone else who can.'Later that day I sit in Murphy's, a spit and sawdust bar that's not too expensive by London standards. I hit the scotch, as usual. The barman knows me well enough to know I don't want company or chit-chat. Numbing the pain is my order of business.I consider how cowardly it is to lean on booze like this. I also consider my cowardice at kowtowing to Eric's bullshit. Should I just leave my job and find a better one? Familiarity with the mundane routine cushions the ongoing churning in my stomach, and I don't want to leave my job for that reason. It's utterly pathetic, and I hate myself for being so wretched.A woman with bleach-blond hair and too much makeup sits on the other end of the bar, staring at me. After I've downed a couple of drinks, she approaches.'Rough day?'I nod.'I'm Sally. I work over at the hairdresser just around the corner from here, and my God, I've had a rough day too... It's just been relentless. Two of my customers had hair dye go wrong, and one of them, she wouldn't shut up about her useless oaf of a husband, who won't get off his arse and get a job since he got made redundant. I reckon she should just leave him, but it's not that simple when there're kids involved. I should know, having been very unappreciated by my ex-husband, and...'Sally's voice is like nails down a blackboard. I can't bear her deluge of incessant banality.'I'm sorry,' I say. 'I know you mean well, but I'd rather be left alone.'The woman frowns. 'Why would you want to be alone?''Some people like to be alone.''Well, that's just weird. You're weird.' She frowns. 'You look familiar too. Don't I know you from somewhere?''I doubt it.''Yeah, well I could have sworn I recognised you. Perhaps we know some of the same people.''We don't.'She glances down, finally noticing the wedding ring. 'Oh... Sorry. Didn't see that. Didn't know you were married.''I'm not. She's dead.''Awww... Dead. Hang on! That's where I know you from! You were on the telly!'I groan inwardly. The horrible media frenzy that accompanied the murder, the investigation, and the trial died down ages ago. Except now this woman has recognised me. There's no point denying it.'Yes, yes, I did appear on television a couple of times.''A couple of times? That Christopher Chapman case was plastered everywhere! I feel so sorry for you, having your wife and kids murdered like that. I hope you're feeling better now, at least.'This woman is setting my teeth on edge. I hardly ever get stopped by random strangers anymore, so this whole encounter is a particularly unwelcome reminder of the recent past. People used to grab me in the street, wide-eyed and tearful as if they actually knew me. I would be offered random sympathies, usually of the thoughts-and-prayers variety. But one or two of them were stalkers, and in the end, I had to file a number of restraining orders.'Listen, I really would rather just be left alone...''I bet you're thankful for what they did to Christopher Chapman. Making him experience being stabbed to death over and over again, in that virtual reality machine of theirs... What's it called? The Justice Machine. Anyway, the punishment fits the crime and no mistake. He stabs your wife and kids. He gets to experience the same. I hope he rots in hell too...''Yes, well I don't really approve of what they did to him.'The woman stares at me like I'm mad. 'Seriously? The man murdered your family for drug money!''Look, I don't want to talk about...''Are you one of those liberal do-gooders, like Caroline Adams? They had their chance to tackle crime with their namby-pamby, touchy-feely rehabilitation crap, and it proved useless. Crime rates are way down since Jane Young took over.''I think you'll find that's debatable. Anyway, I'm going now...'The woman looks mortally offended, muttering something inaudible and doubtless insulting as I get up and leave the bar. I can't stand people who won't take the hint that I want to be left alone.Outside, the streets are cold and rainy. I decide to get drunk at home tonight, so head back to my flat. Once there, I break out the whisky and watch old home movies of Katie and the boys. It's great to remember the good times, before that bastard Christopher Chapman got to them.What I said about the killer of my family to Sally was true. I hate him with every fibre of my being, but that doesn't mean I approve of what they did to him. This new variation of the death penalty - making someone endure the same terror and agonies as the victim in a virtual reality world for the rest of their lives - is simply horrible. Christopher Chapman will experience being stabbed to death over and over and over again, until his body finally gives out, decades from now. Of course, he'll probably go insane long before then. Everyone tells me I ought to feel happy about this, but it just makes me feel worse.I sit on my sofa with tears in my eyes, watching old footage of the family at Tom's third birthday. Katie, Billy, and I all sing happy birthday. He tries to blow out the candles and makes a funny whistle. Then he grins.My son smiling.It breaks my heart every time.The video jumps to me on the sofa with Katie. I remember it was later that evening, after the children had gone to bed. She's just sitting there in jeans and crop top, looking tired but happy. After she notices I'm filming, she gives me a look that led to a wonderful moment when I turned off the camera. A sob rises in my throat, but I force myself to keep watching. The pain is all but unbearable, but in these moments, I'd rather suffer. What's the alternative? To never look at her face again?I wake up the next morning, less hungover than expected. The usual misery hits, and I force myself out of bed, through the shower, and into my work clothes. After an indifferent breakfast, I make my way to the monorail station, sit on the train to work, and yet again wonder if anything will ever change in my life. So many times I've wanted to end it all, but... Well, being brought up Catholic made me scared of hell, so I won't ever commit suicide. But I won't lie. In my darkest moments, I have fantasised about dying in an accident or being attacked and killed.There's no one I can talk to about any of this. My parents are dead. I'm an only child, and I don't really have any close friends anymore. There are a few people I could socialise with, but since Katie and the boys died, I can't bring myself to do it. Besides, all that interminable small talk would drive me mad, being asked how I'm doing, and so on. Over three years on, no-one wants to hear how badly I'm doing. I'm expected to just carry on as normal, even though my wife and children were murdered.I arrive at Prometheus Insurance, oddly relieved at how much the dull work will distract me over the next several hours. Despite Eric's reprimand yesterday, I don't fear for my job. However, it is very unlikely I will ever be promoted, given my stance on claims and pay-outs. As I sit at my desk, I let out a deep sigh.This is my life.Nothing will ever change.Miserably, I set to work.Ten minutes pass.'Excuse me...'I glance up from my desk. Standing at the entrance of my booth is a smiling young woman with sparkling green eyes. She is casually dressed in jeans and a black leather jacket. Something about the awkward way she fiddles with her long dark hair gives me a curious sense of déjà vu. But I've never met her before, so I'm obviously imagining things.'Good morning,' I say, suddenly aware of how absurdly stiff and formal I'm trained to be with our clients. I glance down at my appointment schedule, but my first client, a Mr Herbert Kemp, isn't due until 10 am. Besides, I seriously doubt a woman as beautiful as the one in front of me would be named Herbert.'I'm Lara,' the woman continues. 'Lara Taylor. I was sent to your desk by the receptionist. I've got a meeting to discuss an insurance claim.'I feel a little flustered. 'Yes, it's just... You're not on my list. Perhaps you were sent to my desk by mistake.''Oh no, this definitely isn't a mistake.'Our eyes meet. A curious silence falls. For some reason, I picture myself on a remote sandy beach in the west country; with great sea cliffs at either hand, the ocean lapping the shores from beneath a bright, sunlit sky... Why do her eyes make me think of the sea? For a moment, I even think I'm hearing seagulls.The vision fades.'Er... So you think this isn't a mistake?' I mutter, glancing at my appointment schedule again.'Well, you are Shaun Harrison,' Lara says.There is something very deliberate about the way she speaks my name. Hardly anyone seems to use it anymore, but when she speaks, I once again experience an inexplicable vision of the beach in my mind's eye.'Yes, yes, I am Shaun Harrison,' I reply, 'but I think you've been sent to the wrong person. Mila at reception obviously has the lists mixed up. Perhaps if you go back and see her, she'll tell you which claims agent you're supposed to be meeting.''I see,' Lara says, suddenly business-like. 'Well, I'm sorry to have bothered you, Shaun. I'll go back to reception, and try to figure out how we got our wires crossed.''It's easy enough to do,' I say. 'Get wires crossed, I mean...'It's a stupid, superfluous comment, but for some reason, I don't want Lara to simply walk away.'Look, I'll tell you what. I'll come with you to the reception. I'm curious to see what caused this mix-up.''I think that's a good idea,' said Lara. 'It's easy to get lost in a place like this.''Yes, it is easy to get lost.'Another strange pregnant silence fills the air, amid the same extraordinary feeling that I've met Lara Taylor somewhere before. But I can hardly ask her that question. It sounds like an obvious pick-up line, and I wouldn't want her to get the wrong idea.Realising I'm staring, I get up from my desk and indicate a path through the maze of open-plan booths. We make our way through the room, quietly speaking amid the low-level hum of people talking quietly on phones, or to clients who have turned up to discuss claims.'Might I ask what your claim is about?''Oh... Something was stolen. Something extremely valuable.''I'm sorry to hear that. What was it?'Lara looks away. 'It's better if I discuss that privately.''Of course.' I feel stupid. It's none of my business.'Not that I mind you asking,' Lara continues. 'It's just if we were to talk about what was stolen from me, I'd rather discuss it alone.''Yes, I quite understand.'Lara smiles. 'So how long have you worked here, if you don't mind me asking you a personal question?''Not at all... It's been... You know what? I'm actually struggling to remember exactly how long, but at least twenty years.''Do you enjoy your job here?''Oh... Some days are better than others. Actually, most days are pretty much the same. They all blend into one another after a while. My entire life feels like a big long blur, to be honest.''That always upsets me to hear,' Lara says. 'For a life to be simply a blur. Don't you long for just one day to come into sharp focus?'She halts and gazes into my eyes again. What is it with this woman? This is the third time I've felt convinced I recognise her.'Look, I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but do I know you?''How could you know me? You say your whole life is a blur.'I don't know how to respond. Lara smiles and resumes walking.The next few minutes pass as I act with a kind of numb stupidity. I can't understand my connection to Lara Taylor, and yet here I am muttering to Mila the receptionist about mix-ups with client appointment lists. It turns out Lara Taylor was supposed to have an appointment with Sean Harris on floor 9, not Shaun Harrison on floor 7. Mila acknowledges the error and sends Lara to a different floor. She walks away from the reception desk, towards the lift that will take her away from this floor and out of my life.My life might be a blur, but today is the first day I can remember since the death of my wife and children where events were in sharp focus. I want to stop Lara in her tracks, but can't think what to say, or what reason I would give, without compromising my professional boundaries.Lara presses the button to summon the lift. I should have said goodbye and left her to it by now. Mila stares at me, curiosity building in her eyes. She's probably wondering why I haven't gone back to my desk.'I'm sorry about the mix-up,' I mutter.Lara smiles. The lift arrives, and she steps in.'See you later.'The doors close.I feel a quiet devastation I can't explain, yet her final words felt deliberate, not simply a farewell. Will I see her again?The notion is idiotic. I come to my senses and stride back to my desk.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*e_Xeo9tu-cMVICEaMQP8ww.jpeg,https://medium.com/illumination/love-and-other-punishments-part-1-of-4-894491f4abd4,fiction,64f93247dc41e852207a1bf625b10cd31dd5c6c83e24130f5e9caa52
How a Basic Income Begins to Heal Social Division,"As our country navigates the transition in national leadership, one of the most pressing problems for the incoming administration - and the country at large - is how to heal the deep sociopolitical divisions that have become apparent. Until this is addressed, progress on most other issues will be impeded.These divides manifest in multiple forms: racism, sexism, classism, xenophobia, religious intolerance, growing inequality and economic desperation. All of this is further amplified by existential threats like COVID and climate change. At the core, these challenges all revolve around a fundamental fear - a primal fear for one's survival.Yet whereas diseases and natural disasters threaten everyone equally, social and economic threats have a unique dimension - a threat to one's survival advantage. This might be simply articulated as: ""Others not like me are coming to usurp my position and take my resources.""For much of human history, our species had to contend with a range of threats such as drought, flood, famine, war, and pestilence. These frequently resulted in long periods of scarcity of basic resources needed for survival - putting humans under conditions where ""more"" for some meant ""less"" for others. It is not surprising then, that the perception of life as a zero-sum game in a world of perpetual scarcity would become deeply wired into the human psyche.It is also not surprising that under such conditions the ability to excel at playing this zero-sum game would be desirable and lauded - and that many would see the respect and rewards that come with such success as a primary life-goal. Accordingly, and especially in the West, competition, winning, dominance and control have become enshrined as a virtual religion - something that shapes and propels many of the dominant institutions of society.Given the perception of society as a pyramid of wealth in a world of scarcity, those privileged to be at the top would like to believe this is the rightful, natural order of things. It is understandable that such people might then feel threatened when anyone ""not like me"" (women, people of color, homosexuals) aspires to achieve equal status. Firstly, if there is a limited supply of wealth, ""more for you"" truly will be ""less for me"". Moreover, if an ""other"" achieves parity - or even exceeds me in some way - that suggests my superiority and privileged status may have been a sham all along. Now I don't know who I am, and am not sure where I fit in the world.It is also understandable that under such conditions, out of panic and desperation, one might turn to violence in an attempt to preserve or recapture the Old Order. This is likely a key factor in the Conservative preoccupation with gun ownership, the military and citizen militias. These function somewhat like a security blanket, comforting proponents with the sense that ultimately, ""things will be OK"".So consider for a moment the perspective of the average Trumpian (or for that matter anyone in the Middle Class), For the past few decades, the dance of wealth-and-power spirals ever upward for those at the top - wealthy individuals and corporate ""persons"", and the political figures who are increasingly dependent on them.At the same time (at least when politics leans liberal) a few programs are instituted for those at the very bottom - welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, immigration services, and the like. John or Joan Average-citizen might be led to believe that their needs and interests are being ignored, while at the same time they are taxed to fund either extreme. In addition, their reward is to have ""freedoms"" limited by laws and other regulation (not being cognizant of the benefits we all enjoy by living in a civil society.)Amplify this by the ever-increasing cost of living; trends that put adequate education and healthcare out of reach, trends in industry that make labor less necessary or well paid. There is a legitimate sense that whatever existential privilege some citizens have enjoyed in the past century, it may now be slipping away.Up to and following the recent national election, a host of interest groups, politicians, and pundits have been calling for policy changes and actions on a broad range of fronts. Righteous and necessary as many of these initiatives may be, it runs the danger of further exacerbating the above sense that ""The Government"" takes care of special interest groups while disregarding the needs of mainstream America.A recent OpEd offered a simple suggestion for quelling the rage and hate and beginning to heal societal division: ""Just DO something for these people!"" Do something that directly, immediately makes the lives of Middle America better. Demonstrate that The Government cares about their lives and supports their efforts to be productive citizens.Crass as it may seem, the way society is presently structured, money is the most immediate and ubiquitous solution to most social problems. If all citizens had a basic floor of economic security, much of the fuel for other social problems would likely be removed. One would be less inclined to feel threatened by an ""other"" if one's own survival and comfort were assured.Even those who support robust social welfare programs might spend months or years wrangling over the priorities and which interest groups should be funded. For example, the single-payer healthcare movement has been active for several decades and has seen little progress. In contrast, no one but the hardcore survivalist will argue about the utility of money.Conservatives who object to a ""nanny"" state which decides what the individual's needs are and how they should be met, ought to welcome the concept of a universal basic income (""UBI"") that puts personal responsibility squarely with the individual. Let people decide which of their needs are most pressing. Yes, some will misuse the funds - we are a human species - but early studies like Canada's ""Mincome"" experiment suggest that the majority of recipients use such funds constructively.The case for a UBI is increasingly being made by range of political leaders, academicians, and industry leaders. Ongoing trials around the world are demonstrating its utility and benefit.Basic income detractors generally default to several reflexive objections: ""we can't afford it"", ""it's paying people not to work"", ""it's free money for nothing"", ""why give Bill Gates $1000?"".Rather than a handout or welfare, a shift in perspective might consider UBI as a venture investment or a social dividend. In the venture capital world, funds are provided in hopes of launching a new productive enterprise. It is expected that most efforts will fail after the first few years, yet in the larger picture, such investments are still worth making. Moreover, when an enterprise succeeds. all stakeholders share in some manner of dividend or benefit. The premise of UBI is that we are all stakeholders in society at large - ""we all do better when we all do better"".Those who worry that creating additional money will inevitably lead to inflation misunderstand the principles by which debt-based currency works at the national level. Today's money supply is designed to fluctuate based on the needs of the economy. The nation currently has vast needs: healthcare, education, infrastructure repair, crumbling public services, energy transition, climate mitigation, and a host of others. Yet all of these suffer from a central causative factor: not enough money! So long as additionally created funds are applied toward producing new value (rather than squandered in financial gamesmanship) the economy remains robust and noninflationary. - - - - - - - - - - - The experiment in freedom and democracy that created the potential embodied in our United States is one of the grandest of human enterprises. In this national venture are all stakeholders, and there is benefit enough for all to be included.",https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*fTHTMFi4uuqI-OJ9ZT97lg.jpeg,https://billmiller-56030.medium.com/how-a-basic-income-begins-to-heal-social-division-a6b5fb5c3b8e,economy,66ce4d7ea6ddcf5342ea3635c60aa390d281e394bada4d1047521b9a
Why You Shouldn't Take a Break From Meditation,"Meditation can have you feeling depleted after a while, especially when not seeing any results. Results are what keep us motivated to continue on with a ""good habit."" It's important we understand delayed gratification and what it can do for us in the future.When it comes to mediation, you may have heard how it has changed people's lives and how people are always glorifying it. What people seem to neglect are the tougher days of meditation. These are the days that aren't advertised and nobody wants to experience them time and time again.If you're meditating regularly then you most likely have experienced a few days or weeks in a row where you felt like your meditation sessions weren't helping. This happens with other healthy habits as well that we tend to pick up in our lives.An example of one of these habits is exercise, people talk about how exercise benefits their body but they don't talk about the effect it has on the mind. When constantly trying to lose weight and you're exercising for a long period of time and see no weight loss it can be depressing. You may even feel like you're wasting your time.This is what meditation can feel like at times but we need to remember to stick with it for as long as we can. Sometimes we may need to switch up our routine or observe other areas in our life that may be affecting us when we're meditating. If you're feeling exhausted before or during your meditation, then it can be due to a lack of exercise or even something going wrong in your diet.Don't be so quick to blame the practice itself for all of the wrongdoings it gives you. Instead, analyze yourself and see what you can do to start having better mediation sessions. It's not that you need to take a break, you just need a little more motivation to continue with the practice.Have you forgotten about the good days you've had with meditation? Think about the benefits that it has given you over time, even if it doesn't amount to the number of negatives. Reminding ourselves of the positives in any situation can help us to have a more optimistic attitude towards the practice or in life as a whole.Meditation provides us with peace and positivity, people meditate for different reasons but these are two main ones to keep in mind when feeling stuck.Who doesn't like a moment of silence during their busy day? You should be looking forward to your meditation session each day because it's one of the only times where you will experience true quietness within and outside of yourself.In case you forgot, you should be trying to mediate in a quiet place, this helps the mind focus more on itself and more on the present moment. We all need at least a little bit of peace to get through work, school, and our home life.This peace can be found through meditation at it takes time to realize that, so as you continue to struggle with your mediation process, remember that it's benefiting you in ways that are hard to see at the moment.Even if you don't consider yourself to be an optimistic person, you still find positivity to be attractive. Being positive makes you feel good and can determine the type of day you're going to have. An easy way to gain more positivity in your life is through meditation where you can tell yourself positive affirmations.Think about it, how many times during the day do you doubt yourself or you tell yourself negative things? This is one of the bad habits that has become part of our lives but we can slowly break this habit by using positive affirmations to our advantage.Whenever you're beating yourself up because of a mistake you made or because you're lacking confidence, sit down and focus on your breath for 10 to 15 minutes while the positive affirmations begin to come to you gradually.You may not see the true benefits of meditation right away in your life. It's because the practice takes some getting used to. It's a pretty simple process, but when we're constantly filling our minds with distractions and negativity, it can be hard to only focus on our breath.Once you do get used to the practice, you will start to see the benefits slowly, they're not as noticeable as weight lost or gained muscle but they will make themselves evident when the time is right.When it comes to mediation, you may not see the results you were initially looking for until a year later, remember meditation is a practice. This is not one of those easy fixes that can be applied to your life right away, you need to be consistent with it and stick through the hard days.Be patient with the processes of mediation, this is an art that has been passed down from generation to generation. It has worked on many other people and it has given trouble to many people before you, but the reason why people were able to stick with it for as long they lived was because they stuck with it.Even on the days where they felt like they were going to have an anxiety attack during their session, they still stuck with it. Sounds pretty tough right? Well, you have to understand that nothing comes easy and that's including a clear mind.Mediation makes you peaceful over time, on the first day you meditate, do you expect to be less reactive to every bad event that happens to you? No, you've only done it for one day, you have to keep doing it for years to become less reactive in intense situations.Have some empathy for yourself during this process but at the same time remember to push through and to stay consistent. It will pay off in the long run, you just have to believe it will.Mediation can help you in many aspects of your life but it has helped many people to remain focused as well. When you're meditating, you're essentially focusing on one thing which is your breath. As you may know by now, you do lose thought of your breath at a certain point of the meditation but you're able to come back to it faster the more times you do it.This transfers over into your work life as well, when you're doing a task, you may get distracted by a notification on your phone or somebody trying to start a conversation with you at work. Even though you may get distracted the moment it happens, you will remember your meditation session and you will have the strength to get back to work at a faster and more efficient rate.Even when it comes to having peaceful moments throughout your day when you're stressed, you can use mediation as a reference point to remind yourself to take a breath and focus on the present moment.Meditation is what you make out of it so give it your best shot and allow yourself to be honest with how you feel. Even though you may not feel like meditating during the day, remember the benefits that it will give you in the future. I'll leave you with a quote from Sharon Salzberg that says",https://miro.medium.com/max/6510/0*eL2cyD00BAXRUJgG,https://bell-brandon0.medium.com/why-you-shouldnt-take-a-break-from-meditation-23dadd2cb6de,mindfulness,68a06cabf3bd12947e51b62d4f6dd12398141ba91d16b6e0535eb63c
"When hiring a CTO, what qualities should you look for?","A conversation with Project A CTO Stephan Schulze about what he looks for when interviewing CTOs for portfolio companies (Hint: it depends...)Within our Project A family, we have this video series called ""CTO Thoughts"". I talk to our CTO for about 10mins about themes that might be interesting to the tech teams at our portfolio companies.We post it every week to a Slack channel that we use to share knowledge across our portfolio. Because it's a bit rough around the edges, we initially kept it to this smaller audience. But then we thought ""why not share it more widely ?""So, for our first public edition, we decided to release an interview we did on the qualities you should look for in a CTO. Here's a summary of the main points that came up:You can watch the full interview on our Youtube channel. Since some people prefer to read, I've created the following transcript of the interview. It's not a word-for-word rendition (I've cleaned up some of the language for clarity) but it's an accurate record of our conversation.I hope you enjoy it:MERLIN: Can you provide a general overview of what you're looking for in a CTO or is it something that you decide on a case-by-case basis?STEPHAN: I think I don't have a clear answer yet because it highly depends on the stage of the company.For a very early-stage startup obviously, it's a completely different kind of CTO compared to a company that already has 500 employees (which is hopefully working at a faster pace) - they would have a completely different tech organization.I think for me, I would always look on one hand that the person (again depending on the stage of the startup) has the necessary technical skillset.So in a very early stage startup, the CTO would probably develop him or herself by coding - maybe on a daily basis - because that team is relatively small.We would probably look more for somebody who ideally has some full stack experience, who knows the whole stack from the front end to the back-end infrastructure and who is able to contribute to these stacks. So, not a ""strategic"" CTO who's a super high-flyer.And we'd look especially for a person who's also able to build a team because that's normally what happens. Building the right team and finding the right talent.... this is more for a CTO at a startup - a really early-stage startup.If you look at more major companies or companies that are at a specific stage, then you would probably look for somebody who's also able to drive the strategic part and become like a counterpart for the board. So they would ideally participate in board meetings and can shape the whole tech and engineering organization by setting goals.But they would still need to have a strong tech understanding - that's definitely helpful to be able to have discussions with developers and managers on the same level.But if the change is going towards building the tech organization, introducing the right processes and tools, making sure that measurability is there, that you have SLAs in place and so on - that's typically a different kind of person who you're then looking for.M: So would you say there's a typology of CTO? I've seen articles talking about different personas like ""the technical CTO"", the ""entrepreneurial CTO"" and so on....is there like a standard set of personas or profiles that you have in mind when looking for someone?S: I would say there is not [a standard set of personas]. I mean, there are these personas and I think they're helpful for giving you an idea....if you like to put people into buckets, it gives you some kind of indication.But again, it highly depends on the company, on the role of the CTO, on what is actually expected. I would try to make clear what kind of expectations the CTO needs to fulfil for the current state of the company......and put a checkmark against that and also look at where they are strong...to say ""okay, yes, this is a strength and that is a strength"" rather than looking at where they have the ""least weakness"" or putting somebody into one of these personas.Also, we need to speak about what kind of business a company is doing - so if you speak about a heavy AI or research development-driven company then you will probably have a highly technical CTO who's driving a topic by him or herself.Let's say you're running something like a software as a service business or a platform business that is more a commodity approach. The CTO here would probably not be like the researcher...investing his or her time into AI and really doing research...but they would more likely bring the team on board at a fast pace...and build the [product] right.I think we see all of the different types of these CTO in our portfolio and the really technical ones, the research-oriented ones, they often have somebody in a kind of VP position or some kind of tech lead who then is taking over the part of rebuilding the organization, establishing the processes and stuff like that.M: What about the cases where we have a private equity investment? These are more traditional businesses that have recently digitized. Would you say that these businesses need another different type of CTO altogether?S: Yes sure...I think what we see, at least in our portfolio, is often those companies do not really have a CTO at all. So if I think back to our portfolio, then I have just two companies in mind who from the start (or since we invested) had a CTO on board.The rest were mainly running without one and had somebody more responsible for ""tech"" overall (whatever that means in that specific context) but not somebody who is responsible for technology on the C-level.And I think that's a bit of the mindset...because these private equity companies often come from a direction where technology is more seen as something that is ...let's say... enabling the business but not necessarily driving it forward by improving stuff. So technology has more of a ""helper"" function and so there is no need to have somebody that represents the tech perspective on the C-level.This typically changes over time as, nowadays, I would say more or less every company is seeing tech as functionality...and as a product...that really drives the business forward and enables different business models and opens opportunities.So the importance of that C-level role is increasing quite a lot...also in the private equity context and yes there you definitely need a different kind of person because that person must definitely be able to fight through more corporate structures (depending on the size) and must feel comfortable really dealing with the board...which is normally a different kind of board compared to a VC board...because you normally have bigger funds which are maybe not that tech [oriented]. So you need a different kind of skill set here as well.M: When you're looking for a CTO do you immediately start looking externally or perhaps you can find someone within the company that you can promote?S: Typically, when somebody from inside the company is going to be promoted that is nothing, at least, where I'm involved.So we had cases like that...and then it's more like...that person actually grew over time and stepped up their career, and then became the CTO of the company.Which definitely can be a very good idea for a company that already exists quite a while in the market. Because that person knows all the insights, knows all of the relationships within the company and so it's much easier for the person to start in that role and they're normally also already seen as some kind of natural leader who then gets the CTO title.If you look outside, then I would say...you typically look for a CTO externally more if you're in a stage where you, either just started or where your stage of the company changes.... and then it can be helpful to bring somebody from the outside...who also brings a fresh mindset but who also brings experience.The question is ""would you always prioritize hiring somebody internally over hiring externally?"" and again the answer is, unfortunately ""it depends"". So both cases are definitely doable and we see that happening in both directions...at least in our portfolio and also in other companies that we speak to.M: That leads to my last question: how did you become the CTO of Project A?S: That's a very good question...so when I look back on my career ...I actually started as a developer, then I was a team lead, and then I grew to become the head of IT.And then at one point, I was looking for a new job and was also talking to recruiters and actually got offers for CTO positions...and I applied for them.But what happened then...and I'm not sure whether it was related to me or whether it's a general thing...I was not the only candidate...but I was a candidate who'd never been a CTO before. And so there was always another candidate in the game as well, who had held that role already...and so that was done - they were the preferred person.They said ""okay...look, that person did it already"" so they felt much more comfortable in taking that person. And for me, at Project A at this time, there was a CTO training program that we did in the past....when we did more incubations...we had the idea of ""baking"" our CTOs ourselves.So doing a half-year project... more like incubation and then the person is actually going over into the portfolio company....that was the plan for me as well. So I did my project..or my incubation...everything was not yet finished but close before...and then Project A came around and said: ""Hey Stephan, we really like what you're doing here at Project A, would you like to stay?""And then for me, it was an easy decision at that point in time to say ""sure!"" - and now I've been here for five years at Project A. They were super happy and excited about that role... also for me it was definitely the right decision.M: Yes, I like the idea of a CTO incubation program.S: Yeah, it really was a great idea at the time....we're not doing that many incubations at the moment so there's not that need...let's say...but maybe we'll have the chance again one day - I'm definitely up for doing something like that again.M: Thanks a lot Stephan!",https://miro.medium.com/max/1416/1*eulwozkmEN5pJ4BMPIsPYw.png,https://insights.project-a.com/when-hiring-a-cto-what-qualities-should-you-look-for-27b369c2c714,startups,68cf5639ab0e36209a8303ffbed23b25a03fd5b821d3a23761312767

"...""Your Camera Is Off""","Do you own your home? Live with your partner, children, pets, family?Sunny days are spent in the garden with the smell of barbequed meat making all of your neighbours jealous. Rainy days are cosy, spent hot chocolate in hand watching the rain with the heating on, or in my case log burner! A knock at the door usually means your daily amazon packages or maybe your food shop delivery.What about your new workspace? Feeling as though you're enjoying your conservatory for the first time? Or have you claimed the spare room as your own domain and decorated your make-shift office with a plant or your favourite marvel figure?The reality is, you could be sat in your lovely open conservatory while someone else is forced to work remotely from their bed or kitchen with no end in sight. Schools are closed - your colleagues could have children at home, screaming the house down while that cheerful teams ringtone sounds.That's not to say that if you have a good home life that you will be unaffected by remote working. As time goes on, we have surpassed our initial expectations of what COVID would mean for our lives. We have gone through the phases of motivation, depression, anxiety and ended up somewhere around complete exhaustion and subduedness.Mental Health Deterioration During COVIDA KFF Health Tracking Poll from July 2020 found that many adults are reporting specific negative impacts on their mental health and well-being, such as difficulty sleeping (36%) or eating (32%), increases in alcohol consumption or substance use (12%), and worsening chronic conditions (12%), due to worry and stress over the coronavirus. (1)Abuse During COVIDLooking specifically at the period affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the police recorded 259,324 offences (excluding fraud) flagged as domestic abuse-related in the period March to June 2020. This represents a 7% increase from 242,413 in the same period in 2019 and an 18% increase from 218,968 in 2018. (2)There is much more struggle than we see in peoples lives at this point, now a year into this new world. These are just some of the startling statistics we are seeing with an unknown timeframe still left until the world returns to some kind of normal.For a lot of us, the lack of something to look forward to is a standout feature in the day to day struggle. I recommend planning something, whether it's a movie night, a date night, a zoom call. Whatever your relax and recharge rituals may be, having anything to look forward to can really help change your mindset and reduce the small stresses each day that build up.It's clear in the data shown above that there is a huge uplift in adults reporting the symptoms of anxiety and depression disorders. If you couple that with the knowledge that most people who suffer from anxiety and depression find it too difficult to seek help, you can really start to understand how the pandemic is affecting the mental health of our nation.I know this all too well as I do suffer from an anxiety disorder myself, it's not something I share with many people and it's not something that, for me, happened for the first time during COVID. I cannot even begin to imagine how people that are experiencing this for the first time due to this pandemic are feeling but I do know, most people will likely pass it off as stress and not seek help.How often have you turned up at a colleagues house unannounced? How often have you integrated yourself into a colleagues personal life? My guess is never. Yet, we expect our colleagues to virtually open up their home life to us, without question - ""Your camera is off"".There are endless potential reasons that people don't want you to see them and/or their home situation on any given day. During Covid, people are suffering and it's on show. Mental and physical suffering that you may have not seen before, suddenly there is no way to hide.The list goes on and on...Not being able to separate my work self from my home self has been an intense struggle at times. I tend to compartmentalise my life well, work stays at work and home stays at home - that was before Covid.In the past 12 months I have had mental health issues, physical health issues, I have moved house and technically a country, I have had heartbreaking news about my loved ones, I have been completely overwhelmed. There are times when I have had my camera off due to the completely obvious fact that I had spent the morning in tears. And in one of the most difficult years of my life, all of my helpful coping strategies have been taken away from me. My support system, the gym, seeing my family, working... my life merged into one house, one room.So what's the big difference? We would see each other in an office anyway, how is a video call different?A video call for a lot of people is intimidating, it feels like being on stage, being the centre of attention for however many people are attending the meeting. It sparks the feeling of being watched without knowing who is watching you. Working from home can mean several video calls a day, which realistically would never normally happen in an office setting of 10-50 (or even more) people.When you speak to someone in person, you can gauge how they are feeling about what you're saying, if they are listening, if they are wanting to leave, if they are wanting more information... you're connected. Without this what are we left with? We are left with openly expressing ourselves with no emotional or physical feedback - and it's terrifying. It's not just getting up on stage, it's getting up on someone else's stage. Someone else called the meeting and you weren't expecting to be talking about your project including other peoples work, but here we are - stand on this stage in front of 50 people and present, now!And after a few months of this happening, you develop a sense of dread. A meeting request comes in with no agenda and you don't know what is going to happen. This feeling of dread and uncertainty can easily start to trigger social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety disorder, which has been called 'social phobia' in the past, is one of the most common of the anxiety disorders, affecting around one in ten people.I've noticed two things that can happen after a video call/meeting. The first is feeling relieved - they can be quite intense and situations form that would never happen in the real world (inside an office). Or, after a good meeting, you can come out of it feeling as though you have a sudden drop in mood, a sudden silence that hits you in the face like the happiness you felt only 2 minutes ago has been ripped away from you.For me it's usually the latter, after the high of a morning team call, speaking to your colleagues, laughing, interacting - sudden silence. There is a belief that a morning call can help people feel connected, however, from my experience it seems as though it has the opposite effect. The contrast of a morning call with people I actually miss followed by hours of stress or silence makes the silence more deafening.My team are a part of my support system now, as is the case for most people. They recharge me, they help me through stressful times, they are there for me emotionally - they understand. I feel much more connected and refuelled when I meet with my team at the end of the day, where we can all wind down a little together.Well, let's start with, stop telling people ""your camera is off"". We know.Make it clear to your employees why you would like to have their cameras on - a sense of community and connection. But also make it clear that when talking to a team of people, if having your camera on is going to trigger anxiety or stress, it's simply not mandatory. Setting these boundaries is one of 4 simple steps you can take to combat this anxiety, according to Dr Yin, Wisconsin-based psychiatrist at New Frontiers Psychiatric & TMS. In an interview with The Checkup, she states that scheduling breaks, sharing your worries, getting training and setting boundaries are all simple things you can do to help ease the anxiety in this new video conferencing world.In an interview with Discover magazine, this is what Alison Papadakis, director of clinical psychological studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore had to say to people experiencing difficulties transitioning to a world where video calls have become the new normal:(1) https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/#:~:text=A%20KFF%20Health%20Tracking%20Poll,due%20to%20worry%20and%20stress(2) https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/domesticabuseduringthecoronaviruscovid19pandemicenglandandwales/november2020#:~:text=This%20represents%20a%207%25%20increase,on%20the%20increases%20in%202020.",https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*MstGHZCAA5iZp-St2TEyBg.jpeg,https://medium.com/curious/your-camera-is-off-9b6813ebfeb2,mental-health,69a846e93618ac82b85a3952251126058d559d41c49148d006e8e79e
8 Free Tools That Boosted My Business on the Internet,"It's not easy to start and manage a business. Sailing the sea of bureaucracy, handling recruitment and training, calls with accounting and suppliers, and all the other necessary tasks are quite time-consuming.While most entrepreneurs spend enough time to secure funding for their enterprises, they often neglect that money isn't the only essential resource needed. In fact, in an era where crowdfunding and seed capital are increasingly accessible, the scarcest resource may not even be money, but time.Some founders think spending more money will save time. This is often a mistake that results in losing both time and money. It's something I learned the hard way when I opened my first business. Nowadays, I use all the free solutions listed below for both my enterprises. Some of them have paid versions, which you can purchase once you see the results pumping in your company balance.This article's title is not a mistake. These tools are not only useful for an internet business, but for any brick and mortar business - like my hostel, for example - which has a website or any online presence.Around one year ago, I had trouble scheduling times for customer meetings and video-conferences. I tried various methods, like offering a few different time slots and letting the customers choose. But all had suboptimal results.Then I discovered Calendly, which solved the problem once and for all. Calendly integrates with different calendar providers, like Outlook, Google Calendar, or Apple iCloud. If you use Outlook to organize everyday tasks, once you connect it to Calendly, your clients will see which time slots you have available and can send you meeting requests for when you're available. You can also program the app to block inconvenient periods, like nights, early mornings, or lunchtimes, so nobody disturbs your siesta.Calendly stops the annoying back-and-forth of proposing meeting and call times. Instead of long email chains, it is enough to send your availability to the customer or work team with a simple link generated by the app. The best thing is that it will work even if the other side does not use Calendly. You will make it easier for your customers to find you, and that's part of the principles of service excellence.The paid versions allow you to connect more than one calendar (eg: Google Calendar and iCloud at the same time), remove the app branding, receive SMS notifications, etc. I am using the free version and it is all fine for now.One of the first concerns for a business creating an online presence is gaining visibility. It is a waste to have a wonderful website for your fashion store or tech startup if nobody visits itFor any firm looking for visibility, keyword is an ingrained term. They are the words or phrases we type into search engines when trying to find something. For example, if you are searching for a lawyer in London, you might type something like ""lawyer London area"" into Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Google. This is a keyword.The problem is that, with no help, we do not know what people are typing into Google. If your business is a marketing agency in Miami, people may look for ""agency marketing Miami"" or ""marketing specialists in south Florida"" and so on. It is essential to know what your customers are looking for, so you can target these terms (either by paid ads or by creating content) and put your website in front of their eyes.The Ahrefs Keyword Generator Tool will do this job. Ahrefs is a well-known toolbox for SEO (Search engine optimization). While their products usually have a price tag, this one does not cost a penny. To use it, you need to type one broad keyword, and the tool will give you suggestions based on it. Eg: I have a consulting company for expatriates. So when I type ""expat"" it suggests terms like what is an expat, best countries for expats, and so on.This means that users are actively searching for these things on Google. The next step is to either create an ad campaign using these terms or write a blog post or any other content with them. That is why I wrote an article about what is an expat on our website.Once you created content targeting a certain keyword to give visibility to your business, the effect will not be immediate. It can take weeks, maybe months, for your posts to appear on the first pages of google and you have more visitors. All that depends on your SEO efforts (and below I will tell you a splendid solution to have amazing SEO results).To check how my page ranks in Google, I use the Small Seo Tools Keyword Rank Checker. Different from other websites, it allows me to check up to 10 different keywords at the same time. This saves a tremendous amount of time and helps me monitor how good my websites rank on search engines.Mailing lists are important for a myriad of industries. They help you stay connected to your customer base, inform them of freebies, promotions, or updates, and have the greatest return on investment of any online marketing effort.Building a mailing list from your customer database, however, is a delicate matter. In places like Europe, privacy laws limit the situations where one can collect a customer's e-mail.Hustle is a plugin for WordPress websites developed by WPMU DEV, the developers of few other acclaimed solutions for business websites like Smush (which I also use). It easily grows your mailing list by placing popups, opt-ins, slide-ins, widgets, and shortcodes across your site. You decide where and how frequently to show them, so it will not bother your clients. This plugin is straightforward to handle and you do not need any coding knowledge (something that I also don't have).If your business relies on web traffic and ad-revenue, you will probably use AdSense. To improve your website visibility, you may use PageSpeed Insights. And, to discover how the visitors arrived at your website, SearchConsole provides a good solution.These three tools were developed by Google and work independently.It takes some time to check and configure all of them. And time, as I wrote before, can be as scarce as money for an entrepreneur.Site Kit by Google put together all of them, AdSense, PageSpeed Insights, and Search Console, in a single dashboard. This will save you precious minutes, and, in the long term, many hours.Quizzes are not only entertaining, but they can also deliver important information and serve as a brief about your customers. The best thing about quizzes is that customers complete them voluntarily, and when people start a quiz, they usually finish because they're curious to know the result.The second best thing about them is that they're useful for generating leads. Leads are, in this case, emails from prospects that already invested time in your website completing the quiz.The bad thing, however, is that they are not always useful to configure, and when they are, they just look childish or amateur. But this isn't the case for the quizzes you can build using Interact Quiz Maker, a tool for creating online tests that generate leads, segment your audience, and drive traffic to your website.There you can create quizzes according to the subject of your business. Eg: for my consulting firm aimed at expatriates, I designed the quiz ""Which country is better for you to move to?"". At the end, when the visitor receives the result, there is the option to add the e-mail to your list, and many do. According to Interact, sometimes, 78% of the answers result in a lead.If your business is offering services to a global market, or a premium audience, grammatical mistakes on the company website can erode prospect confidence. Grammar is relatively easy to correct, even a text editor like Word can do it. But there are other deeper, harder problems to solve when writing your promotional material.Truncated texts, bad writing style, word repetition. These little monsters will haunt your copyrighting, especially if English is not your native language. ProWritingAid has the key to avoiding nearly all situations where we make these writing mistakes. I say 'nearly' because there are still things that are missed, but the software uses artificial intelligence to improve its accuracy and help any writer improve his craft. It will make your texts look much more professional.ProWritingAid has more features than any other manuscript editing software I've seen. I use it both for my business, for writing things like a proper business plan, and to edit my books. I also use it for my articles on Medium, like this one you are reading now.Two years ago, I took over a business that was in a critical situation. One problem was the high supplier expenses, especially with an SEO agency that charged stratospheric prices to take care of the two company websites.My first action was to end the contract with this agency and look for new providers. I read somewhere that Freelancer was a website that could connect me with remote workers all over the world, and I was not disappointed.It is very similar to Fiverr, with the difference that at Freelancer you can create projects, define your budget and let the freelancers bid on your project. Of course, I am not saying that all service providers on there are excellent, but the reputation system the website uses helps separate the bad apples from the good ones.Posting a project and receiving bids is completely free. When I posted that I was looking for SEO experts for two websites, I received over 30 offers in less than one hour, which I later sorted by reputation and price, and selected two of them.Levi Borba is CEO of expatriateconsultancy.com and a best-selling author.

Intelligence without Language: Centralized and Distributed Neural Architectures,"Language represents the sharpest divide between humans and animals. With it, we can produce an infinite variety of sound combinations from which we express and communicate our thoughts. No other species has anything remotely similar to this faculty. As far as we know, animal calls are limited and always referring to external events. A monkey's particular cry can only signify a handful of things: a potential threat, hunger, a challenge to the hierarchy.At some point in our evolutionary history, possibly even before we could speak, language was internalized. This gave us the capacity to better organize our thoughts and to create complex mental constructs. The silent speech in our brain has helped us make logical arguments, inquire about the natural world and its laws, and build edifices that do not fall apart. All evidence points to the fact that language-both inner and oral- is human and only human.Historically, a prevalent view, running through philosophy and psychology, held that there exists an unbroken link between language and thought. The claim was that an organism with no capacity for language is also devoid of thought. At the height of the modern scientific revolution Rene Descartes (1596-1650) argued that animals solely operate on instinct and John Locke (1632-1704) proclaimed that 'Beasts abstract not'. But in recent years, closer and more systematic observations have indicated that animals are more than just instinctual automatons. They possess complex thought; they can learn and acquire new behavioral patterns if there is a need for them.An understanding of animal thought, its scope and its limits, can clear the view from which to peek the evolution of human thought. But having traced the steps on the evolutionary ladder leading to human thought, does not mean that we have also discovered all there is about intelligence; far from it. Human intelligence offers one of infinite possibilities. In the organic world, some of these possibilities have manifested themselves.Here, I discuss complex behavior emerging out of two fundamentally different biological constructs: centralized brains and distributed neural architectures. Nature has created two disparate neural structures, with their own rules and protocols, from which intelligence develops. In both examples, thought is inarticulate, but surprisingly intricate, for it results in complex behavior.We still do not understand the inner workings of thought in animals, but we can glean from their behavior some aspects of it. By observing how animals adapt and overcome hurdles, we can also evaluate their intelligence. An intelligent entity can solve problems and learn either by observation or instruction. Take for instance our close relative, the macaque monkey. A macaque, like the rest of the non-human primates, has a similar brain organization to ours; a centralized computing unit in its head acting as a master to all other peripheral modules. But despite its similarities to us, a macaque has limited means of communication. Yet, it has a knack for problem solving and learning.On Koshima, an island off the southwest coast of Japan, scientists have been studying the behavior of a troop of wild macaques. In 1953, they observed a one and a half years old female macaque, Imo, acting out of the norm: she was dipping a sweet potato in the water, scrubbing off the sand of the submerged part before eating it.Monkeys do not have a particular affinity for water, but this youngster somehow figured out a way to exploit this element to clean her food. The technique was evaluated and picked first by her immediate kinship, later by other members of the troop. Other behaviors, such as separating wheat from sand by flinging the mixtures into the water, or bathing, followed the same trajectory: after several fruitless attempts, one monkey had an eureka moment discovering a beneficial novel behavior which the rest of the group gradually adopted. During learning there was no teacher communicating the knowledge, neither verbal nor sign instruction whatsoever; the monkeys picked up the behavior by observing and imitating it.These behaviors are not instinctual, but they are acquired after some sort of deliberation and practice. Groups of macaques in other regions have found and adopted other solutions for the same problems. Variability in behavior that bears no ecological explanation resembles at a more primitive level the cultural differences between human groups. Monkeys can't read, write, or create art, but they can develop complicated behaviors that are regional and propagate through a non-genetic channel. Namely, Imo and the rest of the monkeys of that generation are now dead, but their acquired behaviors live on; their descendants still wash sweet potatoes, throw sandy wheat on water, and bath. This also constitutes culture.Our closest evolutionary relatives, chimpanzees, have developed even more intricate behavioral patterns: toolmaking, social relations, diet, and leisure habits all varying from region to region. This variability is not caused only from the opportunities offered by their habitat, since often enough chimps from identical environments do not show the same behavioral patterns, but from the different turns of their complex and capacious reasoning.Humans, chimps and macaques diverged from a common ancestor relatively recently in terms of evolutionary time. For that matter, we share a number of common structures. This proximity hints at a natural progression of thought and intelligence; a progression that modifies and adds upon a common neural template as we reach closer to the human brain. To discover general traits of intelligence, we also need to peek at phylogenetically distant organisms endowed with a completely different set of structures and functionalities.On the inside and on the outside, the octopus looks eerie. With three hearts, blue-green blood, a protean soft body changing continuously color, texture, and shape, and eight sucker-studded tentacles spiraling, stretching, treading, smelling, tasting, and probing, the octopus could have arrived from a different planet. At least this is our impression. Evolutionary history explains in part our amazement.At a point during the Ediacaran period, about six hundred million years ago, and long before the appearance of complex organisms such as fish, dinosaurs, and mammals, a miniscule aquatic flatworm with a rudimentary sensory apparatus, and simple automatic responses managed to survive a mutation in its genome and pass it to its progenitors. From this rift, the flatworm became the starting point from which two independent experiments on biological construction were carried out, one leading to all vertebrates, including humans, the other to mollusks and arthropods, the two largest invertebrate phyla. The invertebrate branch reached its apex in terms of intelligence with the octopus.Our common ancestor with the octopus, the flatworm, did not have much of an intelligence, or a communication system. This suggests that the communication capacities of some invertebrates are of a different kind from our evolutionary line. The octopus itself is a solitary animal; it can generate a plethora of patterns and textures with its skin, but these are not usually relayed to a receiver; rather, they are meant for the deception of preys and predators.Vertebrates have a centralized brain in their head; an all-too powerful unit that gives precise top-down instructions to the rest of the body. We can relate to this form of intelligence, understand it to some extent and build intelligent machines based on it. Macaques, chimps, even rodents and birds share a similar brain organization and homologous neural structures with us. This is scientifically helpful, because findings about the brain of a mouse, for example, could shed light on mechanisms or organizational principles in the human brain. But the octopus cannot take part in these comparisons, for it has an altogether different neural layout. About two-thirds of its 500 million neurons are contained in its appendages, a ten percent envelops its esophagus acting as its brain, and the rest, two lobes of neurons, is behind its eyes. In a way, nature was pushed to reinvent intelligence, creating a distributed neural pattern instead of a centralized one, because if the central brain of the octopus were to grow, its alimentary canal would also constrict, limiting the animal's capacity to take in food.With the octopus we are faced with an intelligence that is shared throughout the body and doesn't always follow a hierarchical pattern. Its arms operate semi-autonomously; receiving a rough outline on what needs to be done from the brain, but then dealing with the nuts and bolts of the action by themselves. Despite prioritizing local over centralized control of body parts, the octopus is not disjointed, but coordinated in its movement, as if it were a graceful eight-limbed dancer. This coordination emerges from an efficient and swift relaying of information directly from arm to arm and indirectly via the brain.This kind of neural distribution and messaging does not only benefit movement or motor dexterity. Octopuses are highly intelligent. They are curious and exploratory, oftentimes appearing to manipulate objects with no particular purpose, just for the sake of it, as if engaging in play. They solve problems that are far from obvious even for human adults, like figuring out the push and twist movement to open childproof bottles. They also make tools. Researchers have observed octopuses off the coast of Indonesia carrying with them two coconut shell halves as they roam the seafloor. Once they find a convenient spot, they create a shelter by bringing the two coconut halves together and squeezing their body within the enclosure. This behavior shows ingenuity and foresight: an ability to estimate future needs and to come up with appropriate actions.The octopus and the non-human primate offer two contrasting non-verbal structures of cognition: the former with an embodied, distributed neural layout and the latter with a centralized, top-down one. But despite their differences, both of them share some general traits in the way they are dealing with the world. They experiment and explore different possibilities when solving a problem, they estimate what they will encounter and find solutions accommodating their internal model of the future; when relaxed they engage in play and exploration.Apparently, a pallet of complex behaviors is possible without language. What's more, different structures with different protocols could yield similar intelligence. Centralized or distributed structures, top-down or egalitarian signaling schemes, could solve complicated problems. Nature has built intelligence many times over. Perhaps, with the help of our language capacity and powers of abstraction, we will manage to build energy-efficient intelligent machines reflecting nature's variability. Or maybe, in a few million years, a talking octopus will figure this out.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10050/1*BqPeq75PcohfmEJORbT2yQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/metamorphosis-appearances-and-reality/intelligence-without-language-centralized-and-distributed-neural-architectures-dad6be07e44d,neuroscience,71aa22119e54d6d003881e8b540c3ae87415f501529c47aec1701164

Robin Hood Society - How to Capitalize on Your 15 minutes of Internet Fame,"There you are an organization toiling away in relative obscurity when a big story breaks about another organization with a similar name. Suddenly your Twitter account is blowing up. Are you prepared to handle it?This is where the World Wide Robin Hood Society found itself this week after the Robin Hood App catapulted into notoriety for its role in the GameStop/Redditt story. For more about Robin Hood's role check out Steve LeVine's How Robinhood Went From Hero to Villain in 48 Hours.Many people turned to @robinhood on Twitter to air their strong feelings. The only problem is the @robinhood account is run by the Robin Hood Society not the Robin Hood App whose handle is @robinhoodapp.What happens next is a master class in how to handle sudden unexpected attention and harness it to grow your brand awareness and reach. There are many lessons about what to do when you find yourself in the spotlight and how to position yourself to be ready to catch a wave and ride it for all its worth.The Robin Hood Society was well-positioned because it owned the @robinhood handle. Never underestimate the value of the right name at the right time.The Robin Hood Twitter account began the day on Thursday, Feb. 28 with under 400 followers. By Friday morning they had over 40,000.Their first tweet after realizing what was happening set the tone for all the tweets that followed. ""Lovely to have all these new followers .. can we just check that you know that you're following The World Wide Robin Hood Society in Nottingham and not the Robin Hood App .. if so .. a big welcome from Sherwood""There is not a hint of anger, frustration, or being overwhelmed. Even more importantly those who made a mistake are welcomed and not ridiculed in any way.The wording of the tweet is also subtly and charmingly British in a way that is catnip to Americans.The next direct tweet maintains the same upbeat tone. People are redirected gently in a way likely to cause a smile rather than frustration.In all subsequent tweets and replies, the account remains in character and on brand.According to their website, ""The World Wide Robin Hood Society is an internet-based organisation that globally promotes the Robin Hood legend and its associations with Nottingham and Sherwood Forest."" The viral story in this case with its elements of pitting the rich again the common person ties directly to the original Robin Hood story.While the follower count continued to shoot up, Robin Hood kept responding to the various comments.For the World Wide Robin Hood Society, this was the perfect scenario. A major news story and a mistaken name drove people to their twitter account. They responded so perfectly to this initial surge that their follower base skyrocketed.It is hard to predict when and where internet lightning will strike for any individual, company, or organization. But there are steps you can take to be prepared.How far will this attention take the Robin Hood Society?

Experience. You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.,"How was your experience? Well, it was okay but the overall customer service wasn't that flash. The, ah, experience, was a bit lumpy. New car? Yep, and I love the driving experience! Hey, how was that session today? Well, I liked their presentation, but experientially, I thought it was flat. By the way, I totes loved Spain last year. Now, that was an experience! And did you buy any more of those gadgets? Yep, but I nearly didn't. The payment experience was horrible!Ever notice that the word ""experience"" is everywhere?Especially in customer operations: marketing, sales, service, and commerce. Go to a marketing event, read through a CMO forum, listen to a CX podcast. And there it is, that word, on a loop.We hijack it into sentences like the kids from the Valley did with, ""like"", in the early 2000s.You know, like, when I said like, that time.Experience!But, we've all gotten hopelessly lost.For example, just think about the whole Customer Experience profession. Whilst it is true that the experience layer is critical (critical!) to a customer's propensity to feel connected, it is often the entirely forgettable services layer, built on the core product layer, that actually earns their trust.If you want to deep dive into why I say that, read: ""How to Inspire Brand Trust"".Now, product reliability and the services layer aren't ""experiences"", not technically, but they are just as essential to overall customer outcomes and yes, their spend.And yet, experience has become the default and sole catchcry. I guess this is fine, so long as we accept that we are missing major pillars of the strategic imperative.Leaning in he whispers intensely: ""It's not really fine"".***I have written in the past about industrial Tourettes. The super obvious example, ""Innovation"", is pretty much the word of our time.Change the color of your logo, and you'll probably call it ""brand-innovation"". Decide to vary your route to work, and it's ""commute-innovation"". Drag your laggard company, finally, into online commerce, and it's (listen for the singing angels), ""business model innovation"".What a joke. And besides, the whole notion is patently misguided.The idea that innovation is the holy grail for some kind of digital re-invention, is a touch uninformed when you learn that it only occupies only the first level of human cognition. In other words, even on its very best day at the office, innovation results in nothing more than a cycle of iteration.You can learn more about Innovation by studying ""Causal Layered Analysis"" (Professor Sohail Inayatullah), or reading the report ""Causal layered analysis enriching the innovation process"" by H A Kotze at Stellenbosch University, 2010.Yet we have adopted the word into the popular business lexicon, without any widespread understanding of it. Well, there is now another word suffering that same fate, this time at the hands of marketing and CX professionals.That word is, of course, experience.In truth, experience has specific attributes that one can both design for and harness. But it also has boundaries, where it bumps up against other defined things that you can also design for and harness.Thus, if you are in the marketing, sales, service, or commerce worlds (or any other related customer field), you should know that experience, is a means to the end, but is not the end itself.And more importantly, you should know what is.***So if you can't use the word, experience, what do you say when you want a catchall term for any touchpoint with a customer?I give you, ""Interactions"".It's not so much that there is a hefty and insightful definition for the word. It is more so, that the other words, like experience, that we keep substituting do have critical distinctions that should be affecting your strategy, and are therefore important to preserve.So, an interaction is any touchpoint with a customer. Easy. And interactions are broadly found in two categories.This means all service attributes, e.g. ""frictionless"" interactions, with your customer. In other words, the stuff that you have to do with each other, that is not defining for either of you. Unless you get it badly wrong.Making payment in the checkout cart is a prime example. You need them to pay you. They need to pay you. It's utility, nothing more.No one wants to remember it.But when we elevate an interaction to the state of being memorable, we have created an experience. If we have done it on purpose, we will have (usually) created a very positive outcome for both customer and brand.If we have done it by accident, it usually means we inserted friction in ways that the customer doesn't like. This too is memorable, for all the wrong reasons.So interactions come in these two forms. Now, let's talk more about experiences.***The key thing to understand is that there is no such thing as a human experience, without the presence of emotion, which is the trigger for long term memory. In fact, you can tell if something was an experience or not, simply by whether you remember it or not.With me?It works like this. When something connects with our emotions we store it in our long-term memory. That's how humans work. If you want the science on it, read about the limbic system.By definition, when this happens, we have had, an experience.Now, as a brand, we absolutely do not want people to remember everything they do with us. For instance, if someone specifically remembers your online checkout process, it is because you forced them to, negatively. That stuff should be about as memorable as paint drying.But you do want them to remember certain targeted interactions with you. Like a brand activation, or a thank you gift, or a particular interaction that is designed to be ""feel good"". In that case, you are actually designing a memory.That's the purpose of experience. It's awesome, but by itself, it's not enough.***Your headline ambition must always be, ""Engagement"".Great experiences are, well, great. People actually pay more for them or the things they are attached to. By contrast, bad experiences have the opposite effect. And simple services (like payment), are neutral. Which is how they should be.But all of them are interactions, and the sum of these, collectively, is Engagement.So it is engagement, not experience, that is your end goal.Everything we do today must be measured in terms of engagement. But be careful here. Engagement is not the same thing as involvement. Just because someone was involved in a process with your brand, does not mean that you engaged them. This distinction is crucial to understand.Thunderhead's Engagement 3.0 model calls out that:Without that state of motivation, you just have either a simple service transaction, which is fine, or you have a negative experience, which is not.So, we want engagement, not involvement, and these are consumed over time. Yes, over time, which is the other key thing to understand.Engagement is not a one-off event. Just like in any relationship, it is a series of interactions, over the long run, that eventually defines how we feel about each other, the depth of our connection, and our level of commitment.For these reasons, time-limited marketing campaigns or offers, do not trigger engagement in and of themselves. They can contribute, so long as the other correct interactions are present, but that's as far as they can go.And yet so many marketing departments are nothing more than a 1920's paperboy, yelling in the street. And no amount of data analytics to better target all that yelling, changes that fact at all.***Now, some folk will say that we are all just getting caught up in jargon and semantics. Well, the specificity of language, and clarity of definition, is one of the key hallmarks of professional maturity.You won't find engineers or doctors, lawyers or accountants, electricians or plumbers, or architects and educators getting confused with the core terminology of their industry.They don't do buzzwords. They do accuracy. They are, professionals.And in a time when both technological and societal conditions are moving quickly, there is an even greater need for professional maturity and collective standards within customer operations.Many of the performance and transactional focussed practices that still dominate in much of the marketing, CX, (et al) industry today, might have new technologies and data science at their disposal, but the mindset is redundant.The paperboy has passed into history. For a reason.My call to the industry is to move on. To mature! To grow up a little. To do that, we need to understand and normalize these essential definitions in our profession.Those that do so, and apply the execution disciplines that they imply, know that whilst critical, ""experience"" isn't everything. Not even close.But engagement, true engagement, is.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/1*LxGglDEBVdDAYYm2rJuS_A.jpeg,https://medium.com/the-innovation/experience-you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means-d87e38365314,marketing,75b2edb2ce378fcc66400744816fd2f5330c701a62385d93fe25337b
"Peek like a Geek, steal like the greatest","Schumpeter knew it already decades ago: ""innovation is an invention put to work"". The underlying idea of his statement is as apparent as it can be. However, it is often hard for companies to come to this conclusion. The reason is an unequal focus on research and development compared to the emphasis on design. Usually, we allocate all attention to core-competences and technology. However, when innovation is an invention put to work, the magic happens where the customer interacts with the offering.To make the invention work and thus truly innovate, we must understand our customers' mental model. We have to understand what they expect from our service, how they will want to use it, and the context in which they use it.In our businesses, we are used to filling out a business model canvas. Such a canvas helps us to get a clear view of who our customers will be, what value we create for them, what activities we will deploy to create that value or offer, and who the partners will be that help us doing so. What the cost will be to make that value and how we will be profitable. When we are good at it and have done our research in the best of manners, we can define our value proposition. We understand the possible relationships we have with our different groups of customers and have a good view of our disposal channels to interact with these customers.We usually have an excellent idea of the key activities we have to execute and the critical resources we need. The key partners that provide us with the necessary resources are also somewhat easy to map.So we have our business model in place and have some ideas about the needs of our customers. We seldom have the slightest clue of the mental model (a concept first mentioned in Kenneth Craiks 1943 book 'The Nature of Explanation') of our customers. The reason for that is that our customers' mental model is beyond our control and often beyond our understanding.That understanding is, due to digitisation and an ever more rapidly changing environment, today even more difficult to gain than it was decades ago. But that understanding is due to that same digitisation often much more important to acquire. In this digitised world, we do not interact in person with our customers, in many cases.Gaining an understanding of the mental model of your customers has four significant advantages:For example, most real estate agents hold on to their reactive business model, in which they sell a house when someone wants to sell and try to find a house when someone wants to buy one. But what happens when a real estate agent acts like a curator, who selects and presents, based on whatever criteria are relevant?When designing appropriate solutions for real problems, we need to gain an understanding of our customers mental-model to comprehend:Metaphors really help look outside in and get focused on the crucial factor or the real need.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*HVtZ_CGCalSMyx3d9B2Elg.png,https://uxdesign.cc/peek-like-a-geek-steal-like-the-greatest-bfe930601ded,design,78aeba51f5ab13fcd36c8b4d8288b3d8afc17e9342dfca0ba8c895aa
City 17: A Breakdown of Gaming's Most Iconic Prologue,"The original 1998 shooter Half-Life begins with the infamous tram ride. For the first five minutes of the game, you're restricted to the inside of a tram carriage, given a guided tour of the expansive Black Mesa research complex. The ride gives you a peek at the enemies, hazards, and landscapes that await you.This tram ride gives players a sense of place within Black Mesa's cavernous tunnels and corridors, but it's also been a sore point for fans. Why? Because during that long tram ride, there is little to do.Half-Life stood apart from other games, thanks to the strength of its interactive storytelling. The gameplay never pauses for the story. The player is an active part of every cutscene and is free to move around the world as events unfold.This creates an unprecedented connection with the game world in iconic moments. For example, there is the scene where the Resonance Cascade (a cataclysmic quantum event) tears through Black Mesa and kills everyone except you. You could stare unblinkingly at the beautiful, but terrifying light-show before you. But in most first playthroughs, you're trying to find the exit before this rip in the time-space takes you for a ride. That's great because that is your reaction to the world manifesting itself in the game thanks to the openness of the mechanics.This is why the tram ride doesn't align with Half-Life's philosophy. The first five minutes of the game doesn't give players the freedom that Half-Life provides throughout the rest of the game. Thankfully, the next five minutes of the game make up for this. You can ruin microwave meals, rummage through colleague's lockers, eavesdrop on conversations, and leave workplace destruction in your wake.The criticism of this introductory sequence reached Valve, and they changed their approach in the next installment. In the opening segment of Half-Life 2, interactive storytelling is present from the very start. Players get a guided tour through City 17, except this time with your feet firmly planted on the streets where you can freely move around.Valve takes storytelling even further in Half-Life 2. Not only can you interact with the world they have tossed you in if you take a step back and take in its cold, concrete sights, the world tells its own story. From the Breencasts echoing throughout the streets, the rotting buildings, and the empty playgrounds, City 17 refuses to let you get comfortable. That's what makes Half-Life 2 an environmental storytelling wonder.Here are some of the landmarks and locations that bring you deeper into the gangrenous heart of City 17.Half-Life 2 begins on a train, an homage to the original game. This time it's a quick trip, Valve providing players with the chance to interact with other characters instead of staring aimlessly out the window. As the elusive G-Man's words rattle in our head - wake up and smell the ashes - the sound of a train sounds off. We're not alone. There are two men in the carriage with you.The first man gives you a quizzical look, ""I didn't see you get on..."" It is becoming clear to us we've just been plopped onto this train by G-Man. Before we can truly explore City 17, it's established that we're in a world completely alien to us. It's a simple move, but putting everyone into the same boat of being clueless to the new surroundings is a friendly way of bringing new players unfamiliar with Half-Life into the series. For veterans of the first game, this piques our curiosity. What mysteries lay before us in City 17?There is another man on the train with a simple purpose: to let you know that something is very wrong with this world. Nervously clutching a briefcase, he'll only interact with you when prompted. ""No matter how many times I get relocated, I never get used to this,"" he despairs. As the train jostles you about, it's hard to miss the graffiti, the filthy floors, the litter...Throughout Half-Life 2 it becomes apparent that City 17's design found inspiration from the concrete jungles of Soviet bloc countries. The Eastern European architecture, the barbed wires - a world forever grey. That inspiration becomes more visible as the train pulls into a concrete station.Welcome to City 17.With just enough time to speak to the passengers and recoil at the urine-stained train benches, you arrive at the train platform. From a giant TV screen, you're greeted with a 1984-inspired supreme leader. If there were any doubts the game tossed you into a dystopian world, it ends the moment the man on the screen begins his iconic speech:The Breencasts are no doubt iconic, but the delivery of Dr. Breen's speeches dragged on. They are likely to be ignored by players. If you decide to sit a spell and listen, the exposition comes across as clunky. Even the line about Breen establishing City 17 as the capital feels out of place in his welcome speech. It felt like a half-hearted excuse to wedge in ""our benefactors"" line into the player's first glimpse of the city.Yet the mystery grows thanks to the dichotomy in Breen's speech. ""One of our finest remaining urban centers"" suggests that most of the world is a dangerous wilderness. ""It's safer here."" He never claims that City 17 is safe, but it's safer than the other sorry options out there.As Breen's words fill the space, underneath the watchful eye of the TV screen, a man begs to keep a hold of his luggage - ""it's all I have left!"" We watch a guard shove him into his own suitcases before being roughly directed to move elsewhere. It's a small moment, but it's a moment that contrasts against the propaganda coming from the screen.As you step outside of the train station, a chilling sight greets you. Jutting out from the ground, disappearing into the clouds, is an imposing monolith - The Citadel. The plaza gives players their first glimpse of this structure that towers over the relatively tiny city square. It is at the plaza that we see the influence of the Combine's architecture. Hi-tech, sci-fi equipment covers the tops of City 17's rotting buildings. But it's hard to be impressed by these glimpses of equipment and wiring. Why? Because even the technology looks like they bought it on a budget.This can be clearly seen on the Breencast screen attached to the obelisk in the middle of the plaza. Rubber-coated wires droop down from a nearby building and into the square. It brought to mind cost-cutting solutions for urban electric wiring that's often seen in slums.Every time I play this opening, I obsess over this obelisk. Once, it would have been the eye-catching centrepiece of this plaza, a beautiful monument to greet you as you exit the train station. Now, with the Citadel looming behind it, the obelisk shrinks underneath it. It has no hope of achieving its former glory. To add insult to injury, it now acts as a stand to hoist up screens to push out propaganda to the public.One can't help wonder what was City 17 before all of this. We build monuments to remember the past, but there are no plaques on this obelisk. The human history that once sat in this obelisk has been chipped away by the Combine, a fitting description of the state of the people who live in this city.The hotel is likely to be the next building to catch the player's attention - if only because it has an enormous sign that says ""HOTEL"". I appreciate the developers for drawing attention to this building. At first it seems just as nondescript as the other buildings in the plaza. It is just as quiet and abandoned as every other commercial building around this train station. There is no use for a hotel in a world where no one travels unless they have been ""relocated"". There is no tourism in City 17, so this huge building stands empty and rotting - or, at least, that's how it seems.Exploring further down the road past the hotel will show a small side door standing ajar. The door shut by a Combine officer as you approach, but there is just enough time to see a civilian being brutally beaten. This hotel, once the home to travel and freedom, now stands in the centre of town as a constant reminder of what the citizens have lost. But, even worse than that, it has become a rat's nest, hiding the worst attributes of the very regime that stole their freedom from them.So much of City 17's history and the loss of it can be found by walking around the plaza and its surrounding landmarks. Once upon a time it served as a hub for travellers and citizens - a place of movement and freedom. Now it sits quietly, save for when the screen pushes out another message from the regime.There is so much to explore and dissect in your first moments in City 17. However, I'll wrap it up with one final, iconic image: the empty playground.Pay attention to Breen's droning monologues as you explore the city and you may have heard him defending his use of a ""suppression field"" which inhibits breeding. It's easy to think nothing of it until you come across a rusted playground roundabout and a slide. There is a distinct lack of children in City 17. The simple image of playground equipment turning brown and red from rust leaves players with an unsettled feeling.With Valve taking inspiration from Eastern European architecture, I suspect the playground may have been a nod to the abandoned leisure parks in Chernobyl. Valve shows mastery in drawing influence of liminal space: the unsettling effect of seeing a building or room ripped from its context and presented as deserted. This empty playground surrounded by square, blocky apartments, followed by the eerie silence sends an uncomfortable chill down my spine.Valve shows mastery in creating a story through its different landmarks and the small interactions you glimpse as you move closer. These simple techniques paint a clear image of what City 17 is truly like and what to expect in your time here.City 17 oozes with unspoken stories and horrors. There is more to share, this piece only analyzing the first ten minutes of gameplay. But City 17 is a world that is best experienced yourself. Each cold street, each concrete building sagging under its own weight, every dark corner, all deserve a visit if only to see the oppressive environment Valve put together.If you haven't had the pleasure of playing Half-Life 2, grab it now. The first chapter alone is an incredible display of environmental storytelling and the small ways developers can world build without dialogue. Half-Life 2's strength is, also, in its game design and writing. So if you're ready to step into City 17, don't forget to look over your shoulder once in a while. This is a city where you need to be on your toes at all times.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*c1MG8Q5Lzxc5NT118nYMtA.jpeg,https://medium.com/super-jump/city-17-a-breakdown-of-gamings-most-iconic-prologue-3615382ca934,gaming,79a5cb70554c48d18be7ce3348eb2876f7ac95435fcfcc8d2461d513
Recidivism Risk and the Impacts of Algorithmic Prediction on Judges' Discretion,"The risk assessment tools, mainly 'COMPUS' in the USA, predict the recidivism of an offender with machine-learning algorithms by analyzing an enormous amount of 'data'. These statistical tech-solutions are chosen for informing judges of an offender's likelihood of recidivism, calculating an overall score that classifies an offender as low, medium or high risk, while making parole, probation, bail, and sentencing decisions. Such a shift in the criminal justice settings are named as predictive justice, and such predictive algorithms are as 'risk assessments tools' or 'evidenced-based methods'.2. Apart from the USA, an Asian country - Malaysia - adopted a predictive sentencing system to determine the fates of accused drug users and rapists; and has already passed sentences for the first time on Feb 19 in 2020 in a magistrate court. However, although the recidivism risk scale produces powerful outcomes, there is also simmmering debates already underway for long relating to its' adverse impacts on bias data inputs (ProPublica, 2016; black box effects (Blacklaws, 2018), lack of oversight (Dressel & Farid), legitimacy and inaccuracy (however, a recent study tells a different story), judicial integrity as well as judges' discretion.3. Obviously, such 'datafication' in the criminal courts is also evidently impactful as having the force to outs or limits the scope for exercising judges' discretion in the decision-making process. Judges' discretion in judicial settings is ideally important as it can help best in promoting individualized bail and sentencing practices. Judges are committed, responsible professionals, who are institutionally trained and empirically experienced. So, the outputs of data explosion in the courtroom make a major shift from the individualized decision-making process.4. On the other hand, it is now buzzwords that algorithms work with biased data and controversial variables; and statistical algorithms are as accurate as laypeople are in measuring and predicting normalcy and deviancy - predicting whether a defendant would re-offend at some points in the future. Likewise, it is aptly argued that ""a new type of law came into being, analogous to the laws of nature, but pertaining to people"" (Lynch, 2019). However, it is also recently shown that ""algorithms can outperform human predictions of recidivism in ecologically valid settings"". it is therefore that such a debate is an ongoing subject that always attracts study after study to date.5. So far as our context relates to, it is contextually pertinent to point out that although the Loomis's court simply did not base the sentence on COMPAS risk-score (Schimel & Tseytlin, 2016), Justice Bradley nevertheless added that 'judges must proceed with caution' while using such risk assessments. Interestingly, the Loomis court itself also admonished that the predictive risk-score may disproportionately classify minority offenders as having a higher risk of recidivism.6. But this warning seems likely to be 'ineffectual' in changing the way judges think about risk predictions. In other words, a high-tech tool's recommendations pose as 'burdensome' and 'compelling' for human judges to ignore them although they are aware of algorithmic bias, inaccuracy, incomprehensibility, or even when they come to know about wrong or unfair outcomes. In practice, it is really challenging and unusual for a judge to defy algorithmic recommendations. So, quantification in the court has the transformative effects which ""eclipse individualized, morally infused modes of judgment and intervention in the criminal justice field""(Lynch, 2019).7. The reasons are not hard to comprehend. Firstly, it is more likely that a 'high estimate of risk' may play an 'anchoring role' in the process of decision-making by judges; which have the potential to make change their sentencing practices in order to match the predictions of the algorithms. Secondly, a quantitative risk-assessment by computer software, by and large, seems more reliable, scientific, and legitimate than other sources of information, including judges' sense of individualization and intuition about a defendant.8. This is the case not only for judges, but it also true for the technically-trained-professional. Moreover, beyond this external pressure, psychological biases also reign and encourage the use of algorithmic tools. As aforesaid, any risk scores suggestion may influence a judicial mind with powerful AI-driven outputs, which itself is a product of the pre-designed tools developed by the non-judicial bodies only who has if any at least the ability to explain their decision-making process.9. Even it is the fact that many states across the US are seriously considering the use of the predictive algorithm in sentencing by use criminal history as a predictor of future risk, which would constrain individualized discretion; and some already require the same to be used even in sentencing proceedings, and in effects, such widespread endorsement of these sentencing tools eventually tends to communicate to judges that the tools are efficient and reliable too. Ultimately, it would be easier for judges to place such tools in a focal point - in effect anchoring the final determination - as is always the starting point in sentencing (Bennett, 2014). Should we let them be that?That's why, although such 'warnings may alert judges to the shortcomings of these tools, the advisement may still fail to negate the considerable external and internal pressures of a system urging the use of quantitative assessments'. In such a condition, it is not unusual that the existence of the pressure within the judicial system to use these assessments and the cognitive biases supporting data reliance, may make judges misstep, or ignore the notions of fairness and individualized adjudication. Hence, now is a big question again: isn't it an intricate problem anymore?",https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*c6H-UYcE4bXfrdJXu78Cow.jpeg,https://abmalek46.medium.com/recidivism-risk-and-the-impacts-of-algorithmic-prediction-on-judges-discretion-25a05b32cf9d,artificial-intelligence,82bd86bd65c0d1e68baaaf0d0aea784252737e8086e37fa67d9aee8d
How To Find Hidden Opportunities With Customer Journey Maps,"Watching a movie on the release date is a prestigious thing in Asia. The hard part is getting tickets.People talk about movies months before their release date. Yet, on the release date, they bump into the cinemas. At that time, we didn't have the luxury of booking tickets online and watch movies.A few other folks and I sensed a different thing.We talked to theatre owners and booked a few first-day shows. We knew how to access fans outside the theatres because we were part of them. We sold the tickets for a premium and paid the tax. We got a profit, and fans got a hassle-free first-day show.The idea worked. For more than a year, it was fun making profits.At that time, I didn't know what customer journey maps are. We created a touchpoint that didn't exist on a fan's journey to watch a new movie.Little things could mean a lot if we pay attention to them. Through the user's journey, it could reveal hidden opportunities. A customer journey map is a simple tool to do it - thinking through the total customer experience.You don't have to be an MBA to do journey mapping. Your kindergarten kid may do it better than most executives in boardrooms.We use customer journey maps in Design Thinking. Many successful firms use them to empathize with users and develop revolutionary ideas.They are a visual representation of how a customer's journey - how they perform tasks, such as buying a movie ticket or ordering a cake online.Journey maps, as well as Design Thinking, are human-centric ways for problem-solving. In real life, we can use these techniques to build new products or to resolve social issues.Some people call it a customer journey map, and others call it a user journey map. But they are the same - visual storytelling tool to narrate how a person accomplishes a task.Journey maps have several benefits:All journey maps have five underlying components. But, some may use a different flavor for their specific needs.Here is a simplified, hypothetical customer journey map for an online cake merchant. It's about a romantic birthday celebration.Here is how we come up with the five components of the journey map.An actor is a depiction of a real person (an existing or a potential customer) trying to accomplish a goal. In our example, it's Sarah.Define the characteristics of your personas. Like their demographics, what they like, what they do. Subtle things sometimes have a significant impact on your thought process. So try to be as detail as possible.Scenarios are the task to accomplish. Each journey map will describe one.For an online cake shop, ordering cake is one scenario. The one we are looking at in this example. Handling customers' complaints could be another one. We can even zoom in and call it a particular scenario. Handling same-day delivery, for example.These are high-level actions or the breakdown of the main task. Often, they are laid out on a timeline.Firstly, Sarah decides to order a cake to surprise Kevin. Then she looks for cake shops near her. She selects a few cakes in some shops and finally purchases one of the cakes chosen. The purchasing happens only before a couple of days, yet the process started at least before a week.At each journey phase, the actor does many things. And her expectations and emotion are different in each activity.In this part of journey mapping, we list out what they do, with what expectations, and their emotional state at every step. It's also the most detailed part as well.Sarah, when deciding to order a cake, does the followings:To find cake shops, Sarah does the followings:In the third phase, Sarah finds products in a few selected shops.She purchases the cake on the final stage.The insights stage is the most creative part of a customer journey mapping exercise.Once you have the journey map, you can ask yourself or brainstorm with your team how you might cost-effectively innovate and create an extraordinary user experience.Think through different touchpoints your customers will interact with your system - make new ones, improve existing ones, and dump some if needed.Here are a few insights and opportunity we Identified:You may have noticed. It's an easy and fun way to structure your thinking process. And that's what journey maps are.As I said, this is a simplified map. A real one could have more phases and activities - it should.Are you mapping the user experience as it is now? - It's current-state maps. Current state maps are useful to identify and document problems as they are now. It helps learn what user needs are, what gaps exist, and how they feel about their experience at the mom.A future-state journey map is useful to envision the ideal user experience. It helps to look at the problem from new angles and brainstorm.Customer journey mapping approaches can be one of two - hypothesis-first and research-first.In the hypothesis-first approach, you can start creating a customer journey map right away with your past experiences. It's quick but inaccurate. Use it if you want to get your stakeholders familiar with journey maps. Also, it's excellent for brainstorming.Alternatively, you can do customer research first. The research-first approach is costly and time-consuming. However, they are accurate and dependable. For the study, you can do interviews or observations of how customers accomplish their goals.A hybrid approach is useful in most cases. Start with a hypothesis-first way to quickly sketch the current-state and a future-state of a problem. Use it to pitch to stakeholders. Then you can follow up with customer research and create a more dependable journey map.Journey maps are a powerful tool to aid innovation. Many had success using it to empathize with users.Simplicity is its strength. The visual storytelling tool is simple enough for even kids to make one.They help us structure our thoughts. And we can use our brains to think out of the box without circling in a narrow frame.It could be a back of the envelope thing or a team activity that spans over many weeks. In the latter case, you'd do it with large discussion walls and post-it notes. In both ways, we draw simple pictures because text demands more brainpower. We need it for more creative work, don't we?Further Reading",https://miro.medium.com/max/2520/1*I4KokP-T5lILE-U-mfgSlQ.png,https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/turning-pain-into-profits-with-customer-journey-maps-578ba97157c3,design,85b21d2982cfbcbf329fcdaddb1c5bb99d1790569471f587f41839aa
Gaming's Most Spectacular Sequences,"These are some of the most explosive or emotionally heavy moments seen in video games that are closely reminiscent of what we might come across at a movie theater.Thanks to advancements in technology and the leaps and bounds video game developers have made in recent years, there are times during our playthroughs of many popular titles when things begin to move so quickly around the characters or that the plot gets so deep that we find ourselves lost within it.It's during these times that it's easy to forget that we're still playing a video game and not watching some action or drama film. It's a credit to the incredible work done by the motion and voice actors who pull off these captivating and award-worthy performances, but also to everyone else that works within the industry and has helped push it forward so far in such a short amount of time.Here we'll be taking a look at some of those times when we were forced to put down the controller and watch in awe as our favorite characters were brought to life in what can only be described as the industry's greatest moments.You can literally pick any moment from this Naughty Dog masterpiece or even its prequel and you'll be left picking up your jaw from the floor. The characters are like real-life people, they all have their struggles, they all deal with their insecurities even though they're living in a post-apocalyptic world that's been decimated by an incurable disease (yeah, let's not go there). But through all of that, this was the one moment that fans had been waiting for - or even fearing - ever since the end of the first game. Ellie asks Joel to tell him the truth about what happened when he took her from the Fireflies (the events that play out in the final hours of the first game). Having no other choice, he tells her everything and she is left crushed. It creates a deep wound in their father-daughter relationship that is never truly mended, at least not until the moment of Joel's gruesome death.A game filled with award-winning performances by Hollywood actors, the one to truly stand out was Mads Mikkelsen who was able to fulfill both the role of the terrifying war veteran and the loving father with equal success. When Sam Bridges experiences the memories of the BB that he is transporting, he discovers that Clifford Unger (Mads Mikkelsen), the man he's been running away from, was actually nothing more than a worried father doing his best to save his wife and newborn child. The two of them were placed under the care of the UCA, but when Clifford is told that they plan to take his child away from him, he attempts to escape the medical facility that they're being kept in. His escape is unsuccessful however and he is gunned down by President Bridget herself. With his final breath, he bids farewell to his son, BB, who turns out to be a younger version of Sam.This scene was already quite emotionally charged in the original game, but thanks to all the upgrades in graphics and audio, it hits a lot harder this time around. Tifa, Aerith, and Cloud have gained inside knowledge by underground gangster Don Corneo (don't ask how!) that Shinra are planning to drop the top part of the Sector Seven platform onto the slums, in order to crush the AVALANCHE members and their hideout in one fell swoop. The thousands of people and businesses that will also be lost along with Sector Seven mean less than nothing to the Shinra bigwigs, who are determined to move ahead with the plan.Despite the party's best efforts and the - apparent - death of Jessie and Biggs, they are unable to stop the Turks (Shinra's agents) from activating the bomb that destroys the platform. In a last-ditch effort, Cloud, Tifa, and Barret escape through the skin of their teeth as everything around them is blown to bits. In the aftermath of the explosion, Barret and Tifa's sadness, desperation, and rage can barely be contained. The only glimmer of hope is that Barret's daughter, Marlene, had been spared, as Cloud informs the AVALANCHE leader that Aerith took her to her house. The sound as Barret's voice suddenly goes lighter after hearing this little bit of news is a testament to John Eric Bentley's acting skills.This scene, which goes on for almost 10 minutes, is one of the most impressive achievements in modern gaming. After being convinced by his brother, Sam, the game and franchise's main protagonist Nathan Drake goes searching for clues to a hidden pirate treasure in Madagascar. The problem is, there's someone else who's also after the very same treasure: notorious businessman Rafe Adler. Once he discovers that the Drake brothers have got their eyes on the bounty, Adler sends a small army to put a stop to their attempts, an army that finds Nathan and his partner Sully at one of the run-down Madagascar villages and immediately puts them on the run. What follows is a scene that has everything: a car chase, many explosions, gunfights, quick-time actions, punch brawls, desperate climbs, and everything happening while on moving vehicles! It's incredible to think how Naughty Dog managed to pull all of this together and create such an action-packed sequence. Even now, almost five years after the game's initial release, it can easily be compared to some of the best moments we've had in the previous generation.As Kratos and his son Atreus continue their journey to reach the highest peak of the nine realms, they find themselves at the Lake Of Nine, where they meet with Jormungandr, also known as the Earth Wyrm. And there's a reason why he's known by that name. His size is literally immense, enough to cover up the entire continent - if not the planet itself - with its full body. This scene is particularly awe-inspiring, mainly because of how impressive Jormungandr is, not only in stature but also in its visual design. It's a good thing this is a friendly creature because Kratos may have felled his fair share of giants in the past but not even he would know where to begin with this one! Truly an impressive display by the Santa Monica Studios team.The reboot of the Tomb Raider series has offered us some pretty spectacular moments, but few could live up to the opening act of the second game. It's during this scene that main character Lara Croft, along with her associate and friend Jonah, is seen climbing a snowy mountain in search of a long lost treasure known as the ""divine source."" At the start, despite the bad weather, the climb seems to be going rather well. But eventually, as is to be expected by the Tomb Raider franchise, everything goes wrong as the storm begins to get a lot worse and Lara gets separated from Jonah. Eventually, she begins to fall down while trying her best to fight off the oncoming avalanche. It's a thrilling sequence that could see poor Lara getting impaled or falling to her untimely demise unless the player is quick to take the actions necessary to keep her going.New Donk City is a very unique part of Mario's latest adventure, Super Mario Odyssey. And that's because it looks and feels, well, more like an actual city. Like something you'd see in Grand Theft Auto or Watch Dogs. It's in this world that you meet Pauline, the mayor of this rather modern new area. She asks for your help to bring the power back to the city. Once you collect all of the moons requested by Pauline, however, something even more unexpected takes place. The whole town changes and throws a festival for its savior, while Mario himself goes through a series of levels that serve as a throwback to his earlier, 2D days. The entire sequence is like a musical and puts the player in a very cheery mood and even Mario himself joins the festivities and busts a move towards the end! It's a great way to celebrate the little plumber's great legacy towards the gaming industry and whoever thought of adding that into the game is a genius!Final Fantasy XV has received mixed reviews by players for being an incomplete game, yet one thing it didn't lack was visually impressive scenes. One of the greatest among them was when the party is lead by Ardyn to meet with one of the Astrals (summon monsters), Titan at the Disc of Cauthess. The Archaean attempts to communicate with the main character Noctis, who is plagued by headaches, as the enemy forces of Nifleheim invade and begin to attack everything in sight. Titan then responds in anger, forcing a three-way battle between Noctis and his friends, Titan, and the Nifleheim army. The chaos that ensues sets up an action-packed battle, with the beast destroying everything in sight and attempting to squash you like a bug as you use your Crystal powers to keep him at bay. FFXV could've been better as a game, but it really had its moments!During his final battle with Ganon, Link gets the assistance of the four divine beasts Vah Rudania, Vah Ruta, Vah Medoh, and Vah Neboris, who fire their beams towards the monster from the four corners of the horizon. These beasts are controlled by the spirits of the heroes (Daruk, Mipha, Revali, and Urbosa, respectively) who gave their lives 100 years ago in the first battle against the calamity. As the beasts send their blasts towards Ganon, the spirits can be seen atop each one, claiming their vengeance for the horrific events that transpired on that day. As if that wasn't enough, Princess Zelda herself can be heard throughout the battle pushing Link forward toward victory. A truly heart-warming moment that inspires players to succeed in a difficult challenge.A game that is full of breathtaking cinematic visuals, this one stands out as the most gut-wrenching. When the main character Jin Sakai attempts to locate and confront his old friend Ryuzo for betraying him and siding with the Mongols, he and his comrade Taka invade a nearby encampment to find clues about his whereabouts. But they fall into a trap and are captured by the enemy. The Mongolian general Khotun Khan then faces Jin and demands that the remaining Japanese forces still resisting on the isle of Tsushima stand down. When Jin denies his request, the heartless general ruthlessly takes the head of Taka, one of the protagonist's dearest friends. All Jin can do is watch on and scream in agony at his friend's loss, but that's not the worst of it. After a while, the Khan departs and Jin's friend Yuna - Taka's sister - finds the two after picking up their trail. Her reaction, after finding the beheaded corpse of her brother, is enough to bring tears to the eyes.And that's it! This list could go on for hours but those are just a few great examples of when video games truly blurred the line between playing and watching a great movie. If you think we've left something out or you have your own emotionally-charged or action-packed gaming sequence, feel free to let us know in the comments or on our social media profiles! And let's hope that games continue to bless us with awe-inspiring moments like these in the future!",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*tcmOGn_CZmIIvSCAs1cbmA.jpeg,https://medium.com/super-jump/gamings-most-spectacular-sequences-db20f1209dcf,gaming,85d550dc50a433ac4873df8e50f43f30a76043f3b62feb276327799b
A Radical (But Doable) Plan for Breaking Your Phone Addiction,"My hands hurt. They're sore and stiff, and on bad days I can feel a dull ache from my wrist all the way up to the base of my skull. I know what the problem is: Even though I've tried to be on my phone less, it's clearly still too much.The pandemic has thrown us into a tizzy of endless news-reading, doomscrolling, and social media escapism, without the in-person social norms that used to help regulate our behavior, and the tumult of the election year didn't help. I also added five months of maternity leave and a texting-while-nursing habit to the mix, which meant that the good phone hygiene I had once developed - the ritual of picking a new library book for my commute each week, limiting my work email and Slack habits to business hours, plunking my phone into an off-limits phone jar after work - quickly disappeared.I've always had a complicated relationship to technology. I work in tech and I'm endlessly fascinated by it, yet I, like so many people, long for the days when conversations were not interrupted by a Google search and there was no pressure to turn intimate moments into Instagram posts. Recently, that tension has mounted, as I've realized just how hard it is for me to rest, relax, and recharge when my phone is by my side. So I decided to do something about it: I created an exercise to help me deconstruct my phone and use it more intentionally.In the past month, my phone usage has dropped to 60-90 minutes a day, from a pandemic high of three hours. To date, no one has reprimanded me for delays in my email responses, and I haven't noticed a drop in productivity, either. My hands are even beginning to feel a teeny bit better.To give yourself a break from your device, you'll need to first understand its hold on you, and then rebuild your relationship with it according to your needs. The idea is not to abandon it, but to make it work better for you. Here's how:The first step is to take apart your phone as you know it (metaphorically, that is). Study it as an archaeologist might. What are you asking of it? In research parlance, what ""jobs"" have you hired it to do for you?To answer these questions, identify the apps you use the most - most devices have a time-tracking feature to measure screen time and app usage, but you probably already know what the primary culprits are. In my case, on any given day, I was asking my phone to be a productivity and scheduling tool (Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Meet, etc.), a source of entertainment (Netflix, podcasts), a communication hub (iMessage, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.), and a watch. Too much, really.Long ago, a phone held a single purpose: communication. The beauty of the smartphone today is its ability to do so many different things for us - but that is also the problem. Why? Because 1) we don't always make the best decisions for ourselves (just look back at your teenage years), and 2) choice can be overwhelming. By limiting the number of things we ask our phones to do, we can give them a clearer purpose.Choose your top one to three ""jobs"" and move on. I determined that my phone was meant to be a source of communication above all, and secondarily, a tool to provide calm (with my podcasts, music, and plant identifier app), but not a place of productivity or distraction. This meant I definitely needed to make some changes.With your phone's purpose now identified, it's time for spring cleaning: Anything that doesn't support its purpose should be removed. Some pieces you will discard entirely, while others you will displace and move somewhere else (like to your laptop or physical planner).Strip away anything at odds with your phone's new purpose. If you find this process to be painful, that is a good sign that you're doing it right. Your phone is getting a new life, more aligned with yours.For me, this meant deleting apps I won't be needing for the foreseeable future, like SF Next Bus (given I've moved out of San Francisco) and Fandango (RIP movie theaters), along with those I never found terribly useful but still felt myself instinctively browsing in my downtime. I also removed apps that could better serve me in an alternate format, like Gmail, Twitter, and Slack (in the WFH era, what do we need those on our phones for - trips to the bathroom?).I painfully removed Google Calendar, an app I rely on multiple times a day, and replaced it with an analog weekly planner that provides the real-world satisfaction of crossing things off my list. I replaced my Notes app with - wait for it - a physical notepad. Now, every time I need to update my calendar or jot down an idea in passing, I don't risk getting sucked into the internet void like I used to. I found the process of ""displacing"" apps back into my real-world experience empowering.Many mobile apps today are carefully and beautifully designed. Mobile websites? For many technology companies, ""mweb"" is an afterthought - an if we must. Just look at your favorite native mobile app next to its mobile web counterpart and you'll see what I mean. Sometimes features are missing (you can't post a photo on Instagram without using the native app). Sometimes a feature exists but is harder to use (composing a message on Gmail is possible on mobile web, but not nearly as quick or easy as it is in-app).But technology companies' disdain for (or at least neglect of) the mobile web experience can work to your advantage if you're trying to reduce screen time: Simply switch from native apps to mobile websites and watch your frustration mount, and your phone time drop. You can even increase your difficulty level by moving your browser app off your home screen. The added friction it takes to complete a task on mobile web is often just enough to create space for you to pause and ask yourself, ""Do I need to do X right now, or is this a reflex that isn't serving me?"" For me, Gmail is ugly and awkward on mobile web and I am delighted by it.Of course, this exercise shouldn't be so difficult that in a week, you rebel by reverting to your previous app experience. To prevent a future relapse, I recommend holding onto one or two guilty pleasures. This step is counterintuitive, but important: Unless you are ready to chuck your smartphone and commit to a dumbphone (hardly practical or even possible for many of us), plan on incremental wins and allow yourself a guilty pleasure in moderation.Incremental progress is more realistic and easier to stick to than throwing it all away. That's why, though I felt torn about my camera app, I ultimately decided to keep it. It brings me great joy and yes, sometimes distraction, but by removing other distractions, I am reminded to be more intentional than impulsive with what's left.Children look to the adults in their lives for cues on how to relate to the world around them, including how to use technology. The same can be said of students, direct reports, and more junior colleagues. Remembering that others are learning from our behaviors can be just the nudge we need to set our phones aside. Personally, I want my kid to have a better grip on technology than I feel I do sometimes - including the ability to step away from it as needed. This has turned out to be one of my strongest motivators to spend less time on my phone.Despite the work you've put into deconstructing your phone and using it with more intention, some days will be harder than others. The news will be more than you can bear, work will be too much, and depending on how you manage these kinds of stressful moments, you may find yourself seeking more chaos, comfort, or distraction from your phone. When this happens, simply notice what is happening - the emotions you are feeling, the cause of them, and the ways in which you seek relief from them - and move on. Remember what you asked your phone to do for you, and step back if it's not providing that. But skip the self-judgment. Instead, be kind to yourself in the process.If we can deconstruct our phones and reorient them to work better for us, we can take advantage of the small moments of reprieve that come our way, fleeting as they may be. We might read a book for a few minutes instead of disappearing into Twitter, or do a crossword puzzle at our kitchen table instead of playing a game on our phones. We might enjoy a moment of quiet instead of blasting our brains with another podcast or Netflix trailer, and give our hands a break from reflexively pulling to refresh our email, social media, or the news. We might get a break to hear ourselves think for a moment, or just breathe.",https://miro.medium.com/max/4242/1*4zXq47-vK8p1jnLHbmJNNA.jpeg,https://forge.medium.com/a-radical-but-doable-plan-for-breaking-your-phone-addiction-d5a9a368030,social-media,87c97760cc24a2afcc5b907f1c48f496551783b688874514913434a8
How to Love Yourself Better and Be Happier,"Today is self-love day. Admittedly, I have not loved myself to the best of my ability recently. Instead, I am in a mental clinic to get myself back on track.Being diagnosed with starters schizophrenia and depression was a big wake up for me. I had been isolating myself and not taking care for a few months. Now I'm landed in a clinic; I am learning to love myself again and show others how to.Here's how to love yourself and be happier because it's the most important journey you can be on.What are the small things that help you be you? Well, they can be from brushing your teeth to taking a bath. I know that when I was at my lowest, taking a shower was one of the hardest things I could bring myself to do.Sleeping in bed all day didn't make me feel okay, but then eventually, when I decided to get up and shower, I would feel 100% better. Showers are little miracles. Other small gifts to do so you can love yourself and be happier are:So there are a few of the small things that end up being the big things because:Secondly, how to love yourself and be happier includes:As I've said before, learning to love yourself is a journey, and you must take it step by step. This means to stop comparing yourself to others. This is the most significant setback you can do in your journey of self-love. Simply put: It steals your ability to be happy.Here's how to breathe love into your body:I remember when I was going through a rough patch of comparing myself to every.single.person. Being in a mental clinic, there is a cleaner who comes around every morning. I would end up comparing myself to her (not to say she is any less than me as she isn't) and thinking that if she is working then why aren't I? I am useless, worthless, etc. All of these terrible things I was telling myself was taking a massive hold on my self-confidence. Instead, I decided to tell myself ""I am worthy"" or ""I am enough"".Here's the power of affirmations:Last but not least, how to love yourself and be happier means to:Forgiveness is key in the concoction of loving yourself wholly. To love yourself every day, you need to forgive yourself and feel okay. The reason is that we beat ourselves up a lot about not being perfect or productive. So what?! We must stop this torturing talk to ourselves. I've had enough of it, haven't you?! Let's stop together and start finding forgiveness in our hearts to heal.Here's an excellent task to do that I mentioned at the end of my self-help book:Put your hand on your heart and look in the mirror every morning saying ""I forgive myself and love myself"". Feel the serotonin rise up and around your body and mind.So there you have how to love yourself and be happier - participate in the small acts of love, then remember to stop comparing yourself to others, and lastly forgive yourself.Thanks for being here.I help people go from a human doing to a human being.

How I Landed My Own Podcast,"Back in my corporate days, I used to cling to podcasts as a lifeline. When I first started my job, my work was pretty easy. Unfortunately, that also meant that it was pretty boring too. As an understimulated twenty-two-year-old, I discovered the world of podcasts and everything changed. Suddenly, my job was easier than ever - because my real job became listening to popular shows with incredible hosts.Like most, I enjoyed a wide range of podcasts. I would listen to shows like How I Built This to learn how all of the greats got their start (information that no doubt made me a successful business owner myself a few years down the line), or Invisibilia to explore the interesting depths of the human mind. But like everyone else in my office, I had one podcast genre that snatched up most of my time: true crime.At work, I used to always joke about starting my own true crime podcast. I loved everything about them. The writing, the stories, the mysteries. They are somehow incredibly disturbing and deeply human in interesting ways. I would marvel over these shows and imagine sharing my own - and hey, at one point my best friend and I wrote some compelling scripts for an audio drama too. But, I left corporate life and I let that dream die until it was nothing more than a running joke I used to make.At least I did until an opportunity came knocking on my door.About a year into my full-time writing journey, I connected with a new client. He was a podcaster, which I thought was interesting. I had worked with other podcasters before and found the work to be fun and engaging. When he mentioned that he had a true crime podcast, I would be lying if I didn't say that my ears perked up. It sounded like an amazing gig - and it was - and is. He wanted me to write blog posts on true crime cases for his website.So, after excitedly accepting, I automatically reached out to all of my friends to tell them that I had just landed the best job ever.The more I worked with him, the more fun that I had. Every new case was an opportunity to learn and explore something that genuinely interested me. The content took longer to write just because I was having so much fun researching it. It hardly felt like work, and I was really enjoying spinning tales of tragedy and intrigue.Then, one day, he asked if we could arrange a call.We arranged a meeting, and he dropped the bomb. He wanted to know if I would be interested in hosting my own true crime show.Apparently, the blog posts that I was writing were quite a hit. People really seemed to be enjoying them and they were getting a lot of attention. They liked my storytelling style, and he wanted to know if I would do it for a show.It's a cliche, but surreal is the only word that comes to mind. After all the time spent joking about making a true crime podcast, this client actually wanted to add me to his network. At the time, I didn't even know he had a network.We agreed that I would think about it. I mean, the answer had to be yes, right? But, I honestly wasn't sure that I could do it. It was completely new for me, and I wanted to do it well.The second I mentioned the opportunity to friends and family, they nearly murdered me for not saying 'yes' right there on the spot. Everyone around me was so beautifully supportive - and this support honestly gave me the strength to just jump into the unknown and give it a try.After all, what did I really have to lose? Hadn't I wanted this all along?I contacted my client-turned-producer and we began to discuss the details. There were contracts to arrange and income discussions to have. Honestly, I expected to meet some degree of pushback, but I met absolutely zero resistance with my requests.They offered me complete creative control.The show and everything on it is all mine. The social media accounts, marketing efforts, and listener perks are all in my control. They are handling the technical side for me. The posting and production. Their professional expertise is being leveraged for the benefit of my show, and I can't tell you how grateful I am for that.The network provided me with my podcasting setup and is handling all of the costs for production and advertising. I was given an unbelievably generous amount of ad revenue that goes well beyond any contract I've ever heard of - and everything that comes through Patreon is all mine. They are even promoting my show on their other shows so I have a great launch.It's the creative dream, the one that every baby creative is promised will come if they just work hard enough. And hey, maybe those stories are right to some extent - or maybe I'm just lucky. Maybe it's just hard work and timing coming together in the best possible way.I've worked in a creative field long enough to know that contracts generally lean in favor of the company, but that just isn't the case here. They are just great people looking to grow their network, and they want to help me be successful. At the end of the day, I've been given a professional opportunity that might very well change the future of my career.So, what does it all mean?When I really leaned into freelance writing, my biggest goal was to network with clients that I wanted to support. I really just wanted consistent work and the opportunity to work with people who were working on cool projects - but now, everything is changing.So far, by just creating blogs and marketing content, I have connected with a wide range of incredibly talented people in creative fields. Opportunities that I once dreamt of are now coming my way simply because my clients know that I work hard and trust in the quality of my work. I take an interest in them and their projects, and new opportunities are coming because of it.One client gave me a podcast with free access to an existing audience. Another client has me writing a full-length feature film this year just because he liked my short story. And this week, a client that I have been writing investment articles for just hired me to write the story for a video game that he is working on.When you work in creative fields, people know you by your quality and your commitment - and there is really just no way to know what that will turn into.If you are a content creator, make sure that every person you work with enjoys working with you. It really can change everything.For more information on freelance writing or how to be a full-time creative professional, feel free to connect with me on Twitter or Instagram.If you are a true crime lover (or just curious to see what this opportunity turned into), feel free to check out my new show, Among the Dirt and Trees, on Spotify or Apple Podcasts.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/1*RrTTlrgBoSdLtzvSen4QRA.jpeg,https://medium.com/blankpage/how-i-landed-my-own-podcast-49c45d48d869,freelancing,88f663964bb2a4d2f007f08861e781f42efa29b26367381e894860a1
The Success-Seeking Satnav Embedded in Your Brain...,"What's this got to do with success?Be patient, we'll get there - and just to make it more fun, we'll take in nightclub bouncers, the Law of Attraction, itchy jumpers, barking dogs, four-leaf clovers, posing gorillas... and a really creepy little experiment on the way.Go on then, what's happening?You live in the middle of a colossal blizzard of information. Masses of it. Incomprehensible amounts of it. Completely mind-blowing quantities of it. Just think about it - your skin has around a million nerve-endings constantly detecting miniscule changes in pressure and temperature. Your eyes capture more than 300 megapixels of visual information - every second.In order to stop your brain frying from sheer overload, you have to have some way of ignoring the tsunami of information that comes into your head every second of every day. And at any given moment, your conscious mind is busy ignoring nearly all of it.You can thank your reticular activating system - RAS - for the fact that your brain hasn't melted yet. Okay, it's not the whole story, but for the most part it's this little tangle of neurons that acts as the gatekeeper between your unconscious and your conscious mind, and stops you having to deal with way more information than you can handle.About the size of your little finger, all your senses - except smell, which is linked directly to the emotional centre - are wired straight into it, and it acts as a sort of nightclub bouncer between what comes in and what gets through the velvet rope into the VIP area of your consciousness. It selects what you get to pay attention to.Hang on... it selects?Oh, you thought you were in charge? Just wait until we get to that creepy experiment, you're going to love it...There's a huge amount of whittling down that has to take place between all that information coming in, and what's actually passed on to your conscious mind. You can juggle around five to seven things in your conscious mind at any one time and everything else is dealt with by the parts of your mind that are outside your conscious awareness. So it's your RAS that gets to decide what's relevant and important, and what isn't.Some things always get throughThere are some things that this nightclub bouncer always lets through - the sound of your name is one of them. You can be in the middle of a party and straining to hear what the person next to you is saying, but you will hear someone mention your name several feet away. The sound of your name is always important to you. In the same way, anything that threatens danger or promises sex always gets through, too.What else gets through? Well, it depends... and it changes, too. You know when you first put on an itchy jumper how you feel every prickle? That's your RAS deciding this new, uncomfortable sensation is something you need to be aware of. Leave it five minutes though, and your RAS gets bored and stops letting that information through. And the jumper stops itching. After ten minutes, you'll probably forget that it ever did.The opposite happens with that barking dog that's annoying you. The dog has actually been barking for some time only you didn't notice it at first because your RAS didn't think it was important. Now, for some reason it does and suddenly the noise is irritating the hell out of you. It's become important - your RAS thinks you should do something about it.It's the gorilla in the roomIf you think forgetting about an itchy jumper is a good trick, you'd be astonished what your unconscious mind manages to screen out for you.In a Harvard University experiment, participants were asked to watch a video of a basketball game and told to keep count of the number of passes made by the team in the white shirts.They all did so with remarkable accuracy. However, more them half of them failed to notice the man in a gorilla suit who strolled in, thumped his chest in full view of the camera, and strolled out again.Without a doubt, their unconscious mind saw the gorilla - it just didn't think it was important enough to mention to the conscious mind. 'Nope, white shirts and passes only - gorillas aren't on my list, sorry.'You have to wonder what else we're missing with absolutely no idea that we're missing it.The VIP passSo, you only know what your RAS lets you know, and your unconscious filters out everything else it believes is unimportant - even a gorilla on the basketball court.The information that it does let through into your awareness tends to be what it's let through before - the nightclub bouncer always gives a VIP pass to the faces it recognises. One result of this is that we all suffer from something called confirmation bias. We get to see only the information that supports our existing beliefs - especially when those beliefs are ideologically or emotionally charged.In one Stamford University study, participants were given a report on capital punishment to read. The students who approved of capital punishment believed they had read a report that supported it. The students who were against the death penalty believed that they had read a report condemned it. In fact, both groups had been given exactly the same report. Each group saw only the evidence that supported their views.Their RAS saw all the information but held back the parts that didn't support their beliefs, filtered it out. It wasn't important. The information that supported their views was important, so it passed it through into their awareness.And the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon?It's this combination of selective attention and confirmation bias that fools you into thinking that something strange is happening - that because you've bought a red car, so has everyone else all of a sudden. They haven't of course. There were always lots of red cars on the road, it's just that now you notice them.Before, your RAS was seeing them but holding them back, filtering them out. Now that you have a red car, red cars are important so it's passing them through to your awareness - and suddenly you see red cars everywhere!Ahh... are we getting to the success bit yet?Well, here's where it gets interesting. Suppose you could give your nightclub bouncer a guest-list?What if you could train your RAS to pick out the information you wanted? What if you could programme it to pass exactly the right information on to you? It would be like programming a satnav to lead you exactly where you wanted to go. Even better, it would actually take you there - like being on autopilot. Unprogrammed, your RAS is like a nightclub bouncer screening out what it considers to be the undesirables. Programmed, your RAS is like a satnav giving you directions directly to your goals.Except that you can't do that - can you?Let's talk about four-leaf cloversFour-leaf clovers are very lucky, but very rare. So a few years ago, the newspapers were intrigued when a young girl appeared to have a magical gift for finding them. Thousands of them. She had stacks of them.After examining them carefully to make sure they weren't fakes, a reporter asked if she could find one for him, right then and there? Of course she could - and after staring at a patch of clover for a couple of minutes, she picked one. Then another one. Then another one. Was it magic, wrote the reporter, or merely a skilful conjuring trick?Neither. It was her RAS, of course. Four-leaf clovers are rare - roughly one in ten thousand. But clovers are also very small - ten thousand covers an area about the size of a desk-top. By scanning an area that size, you will almost definitely see a four-leaf clover - but you'll only find it if you've programmed your RAS to pass that information on to you.Which is what she'd done - and she trained the reporter to do it too. By the end of the afternoon, he'd found all the lucky clover he'd ever need.Still waiting for the success bit...This girl created a filter for her RAS which then did what it does best. It sifted through 300 megapixels per second of visual data to present the one piece of information she wanted - the image of a four-leaf clover.Okay, you could take a magnifying glass and laboriously inspect 10,000 clover plants to find the one lucky one. That would work, and it's the way most of us would do it. But you can also do it automatically, rapidly and unconsciously the way this girl did it - the way your RAS does it.And that could make your life pretty... interesting.What if, instead of four-leaf clovers, you programmed your RAS to look for opportunities? Trained it to sift through billions of pieces of data to present you with exactly what you needed to know. Maybe that sounds like some kind of superpower, but suddenly the whole Law of Attraction thing begins to look a lot less magical and a lot more plausible, doesn't it?There are always lots of red carsThe Law of Attraction is the belief that positive thoughts bring positive experiences into your life, changing your health, wealth and personal relationships for the better.Of the people who have tried it, some find it works really well for them. Others... not so much. But reframed as a task for your RAS, it possibly starts to make more sense.Remember the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon? Just as there are always lots of red cars, there are always plenty of opportunities to achieve your goals. Your RAS is seeing them but holding them back, filtering them out, doesn't think they're important - a nightclub bouncer screening out undesirables. Make them important and your RAS becomes a fully programmed satnav. It will pass them through to your awareness so you notice them - suddenly you'll see opportunities everywhere.And if you don't think your RAS is that powerful, you haven't been paying attention - it can hide a gorilla from you, for heaven's sake...So, how do you programme your RAS for success?Well, that's where it gets more difficult, because there's currently no research that's been done into any of this - it's all a bit new.What we do have though, is plenty of experience from therapists who have helped people achieve the results they want, and we can see how this could be used to train your RAS.This is one way...As we saw in the Stamford University capital punishment study, we get the information that supports our beliefs, especially when those beliefs are emotionally charged. So it seems reasonable to expect that you could programme your RAS by believing in your goals passionately and enthusiastically.Believe in them, commit to them, get excited about them and make them the centre of your attention and you could get your RAS interested in them too.Think about them, talk about them, write about them intensively. Put time and energy into them - make them your number one priority and put them at the top of your agenda. Putting a high value on your goals in this way, communicates to your RAS that this is something important and meaningful that it needs to take notice of.Hammer the significance home - dream about your goals, use affirmations, make vision boards. Do everything you can to impress upon your RAS that this is really important.Try these as well...And as we saw with finding four-leaf clovers, your RAS can give you laser-sharp focus once it knows exactly what you're looking for. So concentrate on getting a clear, focused image of what you want to achieve - visualise what you want, clarify it and get rid of any unnecessary clutter around it.Of course, you could also get a trained brain-hacker - otherwise known as a therapist - who really understands the unconscious to programme your satnav properly and maybe have a word with your internal nightclub bouncer to get them to update their VIP list.Because, just in case you still hadn't realised it, it's your unconscious mind that's in charge of all this. That's the one you have to convince. Making up your conscious mind to do anything is of no use at all unless your unconscious mind agrees to it. Because it's your unconscious mind that makes the decisions - not your conscious one.Not convinced? Here's the creepy little experiment I promised you.The mystery of the moving fingerIn a series of tests in California, Benjamin Libet monitored finger movements while recording brain activity at the same time. Participants were asked to make a spontaneous, voluntary movement at a time of their choosing, the only thing was that they had to take note of the time they decided to make it.As expected, participants made the decision to move about half a second before the movement was actually made.What was not expected, however, was the recording that showed a clear signal to move significantly before the participant consciously made that decision. It looked exactly as if it was the unconscious mind that decided when to move the finger - and it then told the conscious mind, which just went along with it.Participants were adamant that it was their conscious choice, made of their own free-will, about when to move. The EEG recording showed otherwise.More mysterious fingersIn a similar experiment at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, participants could choose to use either their left hand or their right to press a button. Their choice - no pressure. They just had to indicate when they made the decision.This time, using more sensitive fMRI, researchers could predict a full seven seconds before the subjects decided, which hand they would use. By the time they made their choice, their unconscious had already decided - there was no actual decision left for the participants to make. Their impression that they had made a conscious choice of their own free will was pure illusion.So there you have it - sorry. It really looks as if it's your unconscious mind that's calling the shots - and hiding the gorillas. But you can do a lot to influence the decisions it makes. Hack into your RAS and programme your internal satnav. Put your success on autopilot and get all that fabulous decision-making power working for you rapidly, automatically, effortlessly and above all, unconsciously.And finally, here's an interesting thought to leave you with - was it you who made the decision to read this, or are you just going along with something your unconscious mind had already decided to do...",https://miro.medium.com/max/2720/1*eThB7us0mNqkQ2PSu6lyWg.png,https://ssoh-info.medium.com/the-success-seeking-satnav-embedded-in-your-brain-88ad8280b55e,neuroscience,089ca410570f1396ab19b1f994795a90363eff4c5c707245242511eb
OCR 101: All you need to know,"I Love OCR (Optical Character Recognition). To me, it represents the real challenge in data science, and specifically in computer vision. It's a real world problem, it has many approaches, it involves computer vision, pipeline tweaking, and even some NLP. It also requires a lot of engineering. It encapsulates many of the problems in data science: undermining a robust benchmark, over-emphasis on complication and ""novelty"" of approaches instead for real world progress.Two years ago, I've published an article about OCR. Like most of my articles, it was intended to Review the field - Research and practice, Shed light on what you can and can't do, how and why and Provide practical examples.Its essence was - back then deep learning OCR was good, but not good enough. Nowadays later, OCR is much better. But still not great.However, considering the vibrancy of the deep learning field, it requires in my opinion an update, or perhaps even a full rewrite. So here it is. If you got here, you're probably interested in OCR in some way. Either you are a student or a researcher who wants to study this field, or you have a business interest. Either way, this article should get you up to speed.First, let's set our concepts straight:As said, OCR depicts many of the achievements but also the challenges in deep learning and data science in general. On one hand, a tremendous advancement to what we had before. Also an impressive year on year improvement. However, OCR is still not solved.There are still some very annoying failure cases that are accounted for different reasons, most of them stem from the standard deep learning root cause - lack of generalization, susceptibility to noise, and so on. Therefore, even though models can handle many cases (different fonts, orientations, angles, curves, backgrounds) there are some deviations that just won't work (as long as they weren't introduced manually into the training set): not popular fonts, symbols, backgrounds and so on.Additionally, a great and useful library has emerged - Easy OCR, which set a goal to make the state of the art OCR approach(s) accessible and easy to use in open source. As an extra treat, this library also tackles the multi language problem in OCR (currently includes ~80 languages and more to come) and the speed of models (still in early stages). This library is not perfect, but it's really a great solution to have. More on this later.So without further ado, let's examine the state of OCR.As always, data science tasks boundaries are extended by research, while practice lags behind in innovation, but leads in robustness.In my previous post, I've reviewed 3 approaches:In this post, we may say that the Specific deep learning approaches have ripened, and became the dominant one both in research and in practice.In the previous post, we've used a few examples, that might look simple in the current state: license plates recognition, captcha recognition and so on. Today's models are more potent and we can discuss much harder tasks, such as:After applying standard object detection and segmentation methods on OCR, approaches started to become more specific, and tailored to text attributes:Therefore, modern OCR approaches ""isolate"" specific text characteristics, and use a pipeline of different models to address them.Here, we are going to focus on a certain setting, actually a pipeline of models which apart from the vision model (feature extractor) there are a few more helpful components :This pipeline, except the detection part is mostly trained end to end, to reduce complexity.Having a pipeline of different components is a good idea, however it has some drawbacks. Each component has it own set of biases and hyper parameters, and it induces another level of complexity in the pipeline.It is known that the base of all good data science work is datasets, and in OCR the are crucial: Results were critically influenced by the train and test datasets of choice. Throughout the years, the OCR task honed in around a dozen different datasets. However, most of them didn't include more than a few thousands of annotated images, which didn't seem enough for scale-up. On the other hand, OCR task is one of the easiest to use synthetic data.Lets see what are the prominent datasets available:""Real"" DatasetsA few datasets exploited the massive coverage of google street view. These datasets can be divided by their focus on regular or irregular (distorted, angled, rounded) texts.SVHN - street view numbers, which we used for the example in the previous post.SVT - street view text - text images from google street viewICDAR (2003, 2013,2015, 2019) - some datasets that were created for the ICDAR convention and competition, with different emphasis. E.g, 2019 datasets is called ""arbitrary shaped text"", which mean, as irregular as it gets.Synthetic datasetsThere are 2 popular synthetic datasets, which were used in most OCR works. Inconsistent use of them makes the comparison between works challenging.MJ Synth - includes relatively simple compositions of words. Datasets itself includes ~9M images.Synth text - a more elaborate mechanism, which applies segmentation and depth estimation of images in the first stage, and then ""plants"" text on inferred surfaces. The dataset itself includes ~5.5M images.DALL-E - a bit of a wild card, but the future of text image generation (and perhaps OCR) seems far more unsupervised.The synthetic datasets also excel in their ability to generate different languages, even difficult ones, such as Chinese, Hebrew and Arabic.Before addressing specific research papers, we need to determine metrics for success. There is clearly more than one option.First, lets get the text detection out of the way: it can use the standard metrics of object detection such as mean average precision, and even standard precision and recall.Now for the interesting part - the recognition. There are two main metrics: word level accuracy and character level accuracy. Specific tasks may use even higher levels of accuracy (e.g text chunk accuracy). The current state of the art methods present >80% accuracy on challenging datasets (we'll discuss this later).The character level itself is wrapped with ""Normalized Edit distance"" which measures the ratio of similar characters between words.In this post, we are focused here on best practices than on laying out ideas. For ideas, I suggest you go to one of these two surveys, where you'll find out there are many methods that make it really hard to choose from.What Is Wrong With Scene Text Recognition?This very interesting work has a somewhat unusual name, and the work itself is also outstanding. it's a kind of a proactive survey, which:So the key points from this paper are:In most of this post we discuss text recognition, but as you may recall, first part of the pipeline is text detection. Reaching the current generation of text detection model was a bit tricky. Previously, text detection was intuitively subdued as a sub-branch of object detection. However, object detection has some settings that are general for objects such as cars, faces and so on. which were required some significant updates when induces to text-detection.The essence of this is that text is both homogeneous and characterized by its locality. which means that on one hand, every part of the text is text by itself, and on the other hand, text sub-items should be unified into bigger items (e.g characters into words). Therefore, segmentation based methods would be a better fit for text detection than object segmentation.CRAFTOur favorite object detection method, which is also integrated into easy OCR is called CRAFT - Character Region Awareness for Text Detection. This method applies a simple segmentation network, and nicely uses both real and synthetic images, and both character and word level annotations.This model resulted in ~80% H-mean (on P and R) and most datasets, and also does very good work on word separation, to make life easier for recognition models.We've reached the practical stage. What should you use? So we've mostly answered this question earlier (Easy OCR...) but lets examine a few of the popular solutionsOne very important thing to notice is that while OCR suffers from academy lack of robustness, it enjoys the flourishing of open source software, which allows researchers and practitioners to build upon the work of each other. Previous open source tools (e.g Tesseract, see below) were struggling with data collection and development from scratch. Recent packages, such as easy OCR, enjoy a set of building blocks, from data generation, through all pipeline models and more tweaks.TesseractFor a long time, Tesseract OCR was the leading open source OCR tool (not considering occasional paper related repositories ). However, this tool was built as a classic computer vision tool and didn't undergo the transition to deep learning well.APIsThe OCR were some of the early computer vision APIs of the big cloud providers - Google, Amazon and Microsoft. These API's don't share any benchmark of their abilities, so it becomes our responsibility to testEasy OCRIn some way, the Easy OCR package is the driver of this post. The ability to build an open source, state of the art tool from different building blocks is fascinating.Here is how it works:The last piece in the puzzle, which makes it the ""go to OCR tech"" at this stage, is the performance. You can see below, that they are even better than the paid API results.One thing to improve in Easy OCR, is the tweaking ability: although language selection is easy, changing models and retraining for different purposes. In our next post, we'll show how to do some of it.It should not come as a surprise that inference of OCR might be slow. Detection models is a standard deep learning model that runs in ~1 second on GPU (per image), while recognition models run again and again on the detections. An image with many items may take a few dozens of seconds on a GPU, not mentioning CPU. What if you'd like to run OCR on your mobile or PC app, using weaker hardware?Easy OCR can get you covered: first, the library induces some tricks to make inference faster (e.g tighter shape of image slices for object recognition). Additionally, being modular, it is possible (currently with some code tweaking) to integrate your own models, which can be smaller and faster.So after discussing different packages and models, it's time to witness the actual results. Go to this colab notebook to try Easy OCR vs Google OCR vs Tesseract. I've chosen two images:One is the common OCR case, and the second one is a challenging book cover collection: many fonts, backgrounds, orientations (not so many) and so on.We'll try three variants: Easy OCR, Google OCR API (which is considered best among big tech cloud APIs) and the good old Tesseract.Somehow surprisingly, the best performer on PDF is the good ole' Tesseract. Google OCR on the other hand really blunders. Easy OCR is around 95% accurate.In general, Easy OCR results were the best. specifically, the detection component caught around 80% of items, including very challenging diagonal ones.Google OCR was somehow worse, around 60%.In recognition, they were about on par - about 70% on character level, which made them not so good on word or book level. It seems that Google OCR wasn't 100% correct on a single book, while Easy OCR had a few.One more thing I've noticed is that while Easy OCR was better on characters, google OCR was good on words - which makes me think it may be using s dictionary behind the scenes.I hope you enjoyed this post.We've seen that although a lot of work had been done, OCR suffered from the same generalization issues of deep learning, and probably will continue suffering until some paradigm change.Recent Open-AI models - Clip and Dall-e, have shown some ""unsupervised"" OCR understandingIn the next posts, we'll roll up our sleeves and:Stay tuned!",https://miro.medium.com/max/2182/0*OWUv5HUNl6qVTmJx,https://gidishperber.medium.com/ocr-101-all-you-need-to-know-e6a5c5d5875b,data-science,90f50c65f82e482eed75a738dca94ba2a1761811f00e27458553c253
How To Find Time To Start A Business When Working Full-Time,"There are so many people that are working a 9-5 job that would want to start their own business but there are 2 main things holding them back, money and time.Money can be solved because most of the time you can start a business for free and use that money to make your dream business. The main problem that you have is finding the time to start a business. You are working so hard every day for a long time and then you have to make meals and care for your family.In this article, I am going to show you a few ways to utilize your time better so that you can start your business and change your life for the better!When choosing your business you need to factor in the time that it will take to get started. You may already know exactly what you want to create and what you want to achieve but if you don't, here are a few that you can consider.I have already made quite a few articles on print on demand so I will keep this short.Print on demand is when you create designs and uploaded them to a POD provider like Printful. You then create a store with something like Shopify and when someone buys something from your store, your provider will print, package and ship your order without you having to do anything.This can be great if you want to start making passive income but you will need either a lot of money to get started or a lot of time. You will most likely want to go for a lot of time because it does cost a lot.A lot of people will say that blogging is dead and that you can't become successful with it unless you do it full time. However, this is just not true and I personally think it is great for a lot of people.You create a website around something that you enjoy talking about and start writing an article when you have the time. You can span the writing over multiple days so that you don't have to write rubbish content.This can be great if you are working a full-time job because you can work when you want to. It can also become a passive income source from the google search traffic.Writing on Medium is very similar to starting a blog because you are writing articles for paying members to read. The best thing about Medium is that it is all done for you so that you don't have to create a website.You can create articles on whatever you want and you can write as much or as little as possible. This is great if you are working full-time because you won't have to stick to a strict schedule.I have been writing on Medium for a few months now and I am at school full time so this has been a great way to make extra money.Now that you know what you want your business to be about you need to organize your life so that you can find more time. You are going to do this by using a calendar. This can be a physical paper one or a digital one Google Calendar.You want to start by creating a list of all the things that you need to do in life that is regular occurrences. These are things like work, prepping meals, eating, sleeping, or shopping, there are many other things that you may have going on as well that you should write down.Now that you have a list of the thing that you have to do, you need to decide who long each thing will take you to do. This is so that you can add it to your calendar and see when you have time that you can just sit down and start your business.Now that you know this, go to your calendar and start to schedule the things that you have to do. You may start seeing the time that is blank that you can use to start your business.If you see things that you think you could cut down the time that it takes to complete, try and shorten it because the more time you can get the more time that you get to start and run your business.The average adult needs 7-9 hours of sleep a day but you may be sleeping longer than that. You want to change up your sleep schedule so that you can go to bed later and wake up earlier.You want to make it so that you can get extra work is done at night and extra work in the morning.This is not a permanent change and it will just be until your business is up and running.I tried this by going to be an hour later and getting up an hour earlier, I was slightly more tired but it was totally worth it because now I run a profitable business.while you are at work you will most likely get a break and a lunch which is extra time that you could be using to start your business. This might be a bit more difficult because you won't have all the things you need and you will be more distracted but any time you can get is worth it.If your lunch break is an hour-long you can eat your lunch and then get a decent amount of work done.if you are writing an article for a blog or Medium, You could get quite a few paragraphs done which means that you will have less work to do when you get home.You may want to hang out and talk to your colleagues but if this is truly your dream then this is what you have to focus on.You can use your weekends as a great time to get a lot of work done. You have 48 hours at the weekend and in that time you have to sleep and eat but you should also fit in as much work as possibleYou may want to hang out with your family and chill but they will understand that you want to follow your dream and that it will all be worth it in the end.I'm not saying that you can't interact with your family at all, I am just saying that you need to focus on your business and try to ignore other distractions.This is going to be my last tip but I think this could be the best because if you have gone out your way to finding extra time to work on your business but you keep getting distracted, you have wasted your time.I have already written an article all about this but I want to explain a few things here so that you can get started straight away.When you are working you should have your phone out of the room because it is so easy to get distracted by it. One notification and you can be on your phone for hours.You should also switch on do not disturb on your computer to eliminate all distractions possible.You should be working in a room where no one else is because that is yet another distraction. The same goes with devices in the room because if you have a tv on then you could become distracted from that.You should have an organized computer so everything is very easy to get to because you don't want to waste your time looking for files.When you want to start your dream business to change your life for the better you need to find the time. This can be really difficult but I believe that if you use every tip that I have given you here, you can find all the time that you need and get your business up and running in no time!",https://miro.medium.com/max/11520/0*f2B9L1WDL7VWhrp2,https://medium.com/illumination/how-to-find-time-to-start-a-business-when-working-full-time-9a70899d763,startups,91a14e9e3649166d27faa3357253dd9bb5a13abcd4685d8ada150b16
"Does Money Really ""Not Buy Happiness""?","And if the US is so rich, why aren't more people happy? (Hint: most things you know are probably wrong)You've probably heard plenty of people tell you that money doesn't buy happiness: a quick search for the terms ""money"" and ""happiness"" brings up a ton of upbeat articles and videos entitled things like Here's Why Money Doesn't Buy Happiness, mostly written by white privileged academics who were somehow able to afford their Psychology degrees without delving into debt.Most likely, you've met at least one person who has visited a poor country and remarked that ""everyone seemed so happy"", seen celebrities and billionaires who seem thoroughly depressed, and if you've dug a little deeper, you may have heard that money can only increase happiness up to a certain point before it plateaus.But is it really true that money doesn't buy happiness, or is it all based on weak science and peddled by privileged, already rich people who fail to consider other variables? Let's take a little journey.Supposedly, even though average income has increased over the last few decades, people are no less happy than they were in the 1950s. This finding - named ""the Easterlin Paradox"" after the man who discovered it - baffled social scientists and led to a slew of research into the links between money and happiness.So average real income has been rising since 1950? Well, perhaps in actual numbers of dollars. However, it isn't clear whether these findings take inflation into account. And, what's more, further digging led me to this...What we see here is that while wages may have appeared to increase, as an actual percentage of GDP, they massively dropped (while profits rose). According to the paper Income Inequality in the US from 1950 to 2010, policies have had a massive effect on income inequality - mostly anti-labour policies that undermine collective bargaining and tax cuts for the rich meaning that the wealth has become more and more concentrated at the top of the pyramid.The other thing I find weird is that the ""Easterlin Paradox"" takes an average of people's happiness and compares it to average income. In a country with massive gaps between the rich and the poor, this is a pretty weird way to look at things.The US has much higher levels of income inequality than a lot of other countries (it ranks 7th in terms of income inequality among OECD countries). And while back in the early 1950's things weren't so bad, around 1979 income inequality started to rapidly increase:According to the research, 77% of US Americans are stressed about money - even though the US is the richest country in the world. Most people have their basic needs met, can snap their fingers and get food delivered at the push of a button(out of season and from around the world), and live lives that kings wouldn't have dreamed of a few decades ago - so what's going on?Well, off the top of my head: could it be the burning climate? The horrendous racism and police brutality? The fact that the country was built on genocide and slavery? The rise of social media, commercialism and materialism? The fact that while the world may technically be a safer place than it once was, we hear about every single crime around the clock? Or is it connected to the fact that people are terrified of going to the doctor due to obscene healthcare costs, massive university loans that are almost impossible to pay off, and on top of that most people don't get sick pay, holiday or maternity leave - things that are taken for granted in Europe.It seems logical that there would be huge levels of financial anxiety among the less wealthy in the US - but for those who have the money, the world is their oyster. Right? But there's another surprise: only 13% of American millionaires consider themselves to be wealthy. So then we have to ask - is this a question of people worrying over their basic survival needs, or of unreasonably high standards over what constitutes ""enough""?We've looked at average levels of happiness and income, but what about when you zoom in and compare individual people? That seems like it might make more sense.Here's the general consensus in the world of psychology and economics: the correlation between money and life satisfaction follows a curve of diminishing returns. Generally, satisfaction rises along with income - until around $75,000 a year - after that, any extra money is only going to increase your happiness so much.In other words, if the difference between making $200 and $300 a week is that you can now afford to eat, then of course that extra $100 is going to make you really happy. But if you're already bringing in, say, $1000 a week, then an extra $100 isn't going to make as much difference. If you're a multi-millionaire, even an extra million in your account isn't going to have much impact on your overall feeling of wealth.However, here's the thing about that study: firstly, it was done on people in the US. I don't know about those of you reading from outside the US, but frankly I find it weird that I spend about 80% of my time reading about the experiences and opinions of only 4% of the global population. And it turns out that this US-bias has massively skewed what we think we know about human behaviour: a 2008 study of the top six psychology journals showed that more than 96% of the participants tested in psychology studies between 2003-2007 were Westerners (70% from the US alone).What's more - it turns out that people from the US are kind of... weird. When studies that yielding findings considered universal human truths were replicated across other nations, completely different findings were observed. It turns out that motivation, self-esteem, feelings over personal choice, moral reasoning and even perception are massively shaped by our cultures.According to the study, published under the title The Weirdest People in the World (note also that WEIRD stands for Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) Joseph Henrich states:Trying to generalise findings from the US about money doesn't make any sense: As someone living in Europe, I am privileged enough to have grown up with free healthcare (in the UK), and here in the Czech Republic people are used to being able to study up to their PhD level for free, as well as getting up to 3 years of maternity leave (per child), sick pay and 20-30 days of paid holiday per year. So while the average Czech makes around $18,000 a year, they don't have to calculate for all these other expenses: I can only imagine that if I were in the US, I would feel like I needed to be making a TON of money just so I could feel reassured that I would be able to visit the doctor if I got sick.Secondly, the famous ""$75,000 a year"" study is a short paper that doesn't say much about its methods, but Medium writer Alan Trapulionis did a pretty good job of tearing its methods and interpretations apart in his article ""Money Buys Happiness Up to $75k is a Bad Joke"". This is often the problem with scientific journal articles - the media will pick up on them, take a headline-worthy caption without understanding what they are reading, and people will run with it because it makes us feel good or sells papers.What Alan points out in his analysis is that the study clumped together everyone who earned over $120,000 a year - even though living on $120k and $400k a year would bring vastly different experiences. They also found that when they measured overall satisfaction with life, the relationship between satisfaction and income was constant - in other words, more money DID bring more satisfaction. It was only when they asked some pretty strange questions about how frequently people had smiled or laughed that they started to find that there was a certain cut-off point.I have so many unanswered questions: how much CAN one smile or laugh within a day, anyway? Were they expecting rich people to be sitting around all day in their mansions, cackling maniacally over their piles of cash? Did they look at how people were bringing in that money? Perhaps those who surpassed a certain amount started to be too consumed with fear that their would lose their money again, or were too busy working multiple income streams to feel like they could enjoy their lives - there's no way to know for sure.Further studies have suggested that it is not the amount of money we have or make that influences our happiness, but how we feel we compare to others in terms of income. This may hardly be surprising - if you're making $20,000 a year and you're surrounded by millionaires, you're probably not going to feel as good about yourself as if you were living in a country where the national average was half of what you were making.Comparing ourselves to others is rarely good for our mental health - if we find ourselves lacking in comparison, it can fuel depression and anxiety. On the other hand, deriving your happiness from feeling that you are better than people around you sounds like some grade-A narcissism to me; it also makes your sense of wellbeing dependent on external sources, leaving you highly vulnerable to economic shocks.And it's no secret in Psychology that focusing on extrinsic goals - such as your looks, social status and financial wealth - is more likely to lead to unhappiness: specifically, in a 2001 study, focusing on external goals was tied to higher levels of drug use, television consumption, lower self-esteem and lower quality of romantic relationships; meanwhile, focusing on intrinsic goals such as self-acceptance was correlated with greater wellbeing.But again, this may largely be down to where you're living. As I mentioned before, the US and the UK are pretty bad when it comes to income inequality - while certainly not the most unequal in the world, they are doing pretty badly when it comes to comparing with other OECD countries.And, as you may suspect, countries with higher levels of income inequality also have higher levels of status anxiety. In a 47-page GINI study into this relationship, the authors discuss how the stresses of income inequality weigh heavily on both rich and poor groups - which explains why so many US-based millionaires don't feel that they have enough money. As the paper explains:It makes sense: the more you see people of high status being respected and adored (think celebrity culture), the more the emotional part of your brain is going to put two and two together: if I want to be respected and adored (aka safe, secure and with a sense of belonging), I need to acquire high status, too. And if you weigh up where you are with your life and find yourself far behind, you're less likely to be happy.You have probably heard by now that Lottery winners are likely to experience overwhelming happiness at first, but to return to a similar mood to before their win a few months later.But is this really true? This oft-stated fact revolves around one study into Lottery winners and accident victims from way back in 1978, where they found that Lottery winners were likely to return to their ""baseline"" level of happiness a year or so after their win. But the methodology of this study has been criticised, and later studies have actually shown that Lottery winners are overall more satisfied with life; just like with the $75k a year study, it depends on whether you're asking about satisfaction with life or the daily number of laughs and smiles.The stereotype of the new-found Lottery winner who blows all their cash on drugs, hookers and gambling is often repeated, and yet studies show that the majority of Lottery winners are able to hold onto their wealth (or invest it and make even more) after winning. I have to question whether the idea of a person of low socioeconomic status suddenly becoming wealthy is so threatening or distasteful to the upper classes that they push their disdain over what they call ""New Money"" onto us through these stories and images.But if sudden increases in wealth don't make you happier, it may be due to the hedonic treadmill effect. According to this theory, we will always return to our baseline level of happiness, regardless of what happens to us. That's why you may be excited about your new phone for a few days, but the novelty quickly wears off and it becomes ""normal"" for you.The hedonic treadmill effect is tragic, in a way, because it means that we are doomed to forever chase the dopamine high of obtaining a reward - whether that's a pay rise, a new ""thing"" we can afford, or a win that we obtain through gambling.And according to an article in The Atlantic, it doesn't matter how rich we get - as well as comparing ourselves to other people, our frame of reference shifts to comparing our current wealth to our previous wealth. So instead of asking ourselves whether we are able to meet our basic needs and have time for holidays and hobbies, we are instead locked into asking questions such as ""do I have more houses than I used to?"".Again, I have to wonder whether these findings would apply across the world, or whether it is just in the consumerist orgy that is the West that people become so attached to these external markers of success.The usual ""money doesn't buy happiness"" argument comes with a simple, Hallmark conclusion - we should focus on experiences, not possessions, we should not strive to achieve more material wealth because it ultimately won't make us happy, and we are such fickle creatures that earning more money will only send us into a warped reality where our sense of worth comes from how many mansions we own. The message behind all of this, in a way, is ""be happy with what you have"" - a message that can sound peaceful and reassuring, but which may also be laced with sinister undertones (aka ""stay away from our money, peasants"").And yet, at the same time, we are bombarded with messages that tell us NOT to be happy with what we have. Adverts remind us that we are not quite thin or beautiful enough, that we don't have the right clothes or the nicest house, and an increasingly competitive job market reminds us that we may never be quite qualified enough. It is difficult not to completely lose the plot under these conflicting messages.It feels as if those with money and power want to keep us reaching and fighting among ourselves just enough to keep fuelling their profits, yet if we reach high enough to actually threaten what they have, they panic.The idea of being happy with what we have, also packaged under mindfulness, gratitude, and connection, are generally things that I like to promote as a coach and facilitator. After all, attaching your sense of wellbeing to external rewards is only going to lead to despair and anxiety.And yet, what a lot of the messages we hear about money forget is that we are living in an increasingly unequal, competitive, and anxiety-inducing world. We are reminded by the news, day after day, how unsafe we are - whether from COVID, from extremists, or from climate collapse. Money has often given people a sense of security and safety, and in the absence of anything else to cling to, it is likely that our survival instincts will tell us that we need to accumulate more and more money in order to survive the shocks of this increasingly unstable world.So, when people churn out clichés like ""money doesn't buy happiness"" or ""we're no happier, despite being richer"", you can now talk their ears off with these corrections!",https://miro.medium.com/max/984/1*a8dbTDEj1ZcuYh8A6RYLBA.jpeg,https://medium.com/the-shadow/does-money-really-not-buy-happiness-87664cf828e6,economy,91f7c3e3fee4dc16a5422dc9de22ce30f85d88028045a0ede5a61514
5 Marketing Lessons From Disruptive Valentine's Day Campaigns,"Marketers will plan their Christmas campaigns months and months in advance, frantically working on stunts a few weeks after the rush of Black Friday.Yet, there is no rest for the wicked (as they say) are they have to fully immerse themselves in subsequent New Years' campaigns.Just like that, January is over, and most marketers make a staggering realisation: Valentine's Day is around the corner and a few heart-shaped graphics are not going to cut it.According to Snapchat, nearly 7 in 10 Snapchatters around the world plan to celebrate Valentine's Day this year, and 63% plan on making Snapchat a part of the celebration.For those celebrating, 82% will spend the day connecting with the most important people in their lives: their current partner (40% in the US and 38% in the UK and Norway), family (24% in Mexico and 20% in the US and Germany), and best friends (32% in Indonesia and 23% in Mexico).How can you then make your brand part of the conversation? This year, more than ever, consumers are not looking to be patronized.Bloom & Wild's customers don't buy into cliches, so this year it isn't selling them. The brand collated data from real customers and amplified their point through an impactful campaign.Based on a Bloom & Wild survey of 1,000 nationally representative UK men and women between the ages 18-64 January 2021. The brand uncovered a variety of valuable stats, including the fact that 70% of women would prefer something other than red roses on Valentine's Day.This is, once again, proof that customer insights can be your best alley when shaping up a campaign.Don't be afraid to shape your campaign around hidden customer truths.Just like Apple learned that iPhoneowners prefer to show (and take pride in) the output of their device rather than talking about the camera technology, pixels, and framerates, this year Bloom & Wild is disrupting the norm by listening to what the customers had to say.Deliveroo, Tinder and Wingstop partnered to launch a new 'DeliverDate' service just in time for Valentine's. 'DeliverDate' sees Tinder profiles of 30 local singletons printed on Wingstopchicken wing boxes, available nationwide through Deliveroo.Laura Wilkinson-Rea, Director of Communications UK From Tinder says:Tinder profiles of 30 local singletons will be printed on 1,000 Wingstop chicken wing boxes, available nationwide through DeliverooThe brand used customer insights to shape the partnership, as Tinder saw an 84% increase year-on-year in Tinder Bios featuring the word ""takeaway"".Look at consumer insight as a surprising or new way to look at the problem that unlocks a creative opportunity for your marketing and message.By turning what would be a simple campaign into a national stunt, the brands are partnering in a unique way by creating a compelling story to engage all customers, not just the 30 people who'll be the 'faces' of the campaign. Working on creative partnerships with unexpected matches can open upa whole new audience in unexpected ways.UK nut butter brand Pip &Nut hosted a three-day pop-up in London's Shoreditch, where it ran a series of hour-long workshops.People were encouraged to blend their own bespoke 'Love Lab' nut butter with a helping hand from a resident Pip & Nut 'Squirrelogist'. They could personalise their jar with a calligrapher and send a love note with Valentine's cards (free postage), the poetry wall, and optional donations to charity.The campaign tapped into UGC (user-generated content) as well as getting products in the hands of the customers.Experiences really drive marketing, even right now, with Covid putting the brakes on experiential events. Online events and experiences can provide your audience with fun activities to do with loved ones and friends and can be a great way to send special kits to attendees to create an inclusive experience.In 2020, Twitter took over London by challenging the norm and going against Valentine's cliche with relatable tweets from real people. The tweets took over the tube by going against the traditional Valentine's messages.explained David Wilding, director of planning at Twitter UK on Valentine's campaign.What I loved about this campaign is that reminds us of the power of disrupting the norm and not underestimating the importance of understanding your consumers' needs.As David Ogilvy once said, ""the consumer isn't a moron. She is your wife.""Honest and unfiltered marketing will stand out from the crowd. Think about ways you can change the conversation and go where other people may not feel comfortable heading with their message.Customer-driven marketing can still be a great resource for last-minute marketing ideas on social media. Competitions, when well thought-out, can be a powerful driver (with very little setup).The Body Shop's #SendingAKiss contest used Galentine's Day as a hook by asking their Instagram followers to send in photos of themselves blowing a kiss to a friend. Every Instagram account that used the hashtag was entered into a prize draw to win the company's new range of lip balms, both for themselves and their 'Galentine'.The twist here is to look at a different angle (friendship, positivity) and truly encourage users to produce most of the content.Word of mouth campaigns can be a real winner on social media, as they are easy to set up and execute. Altruistic competitions can be a great alternative for important dates and occasions like Valentine's and Galentine's day.In 2020, the campaigns that stood out provided much-needed moments of levity and fun - aligning with why people turn to social media in the first place.Data from Morning Consult shows that useful and entertaining ads are most likely to drive purchases, as consumers increasingly crave a return to normalcy.In order to truly stand out with your message, this Valentine's Day, you do not necessarily need a big stunt - overall, you need to be smart and tap into your audience's needs. May these lessons be the ones you can take with you beyond Valentine's Day and into your overall strategy.",https://miro.medium.com/max/4416/1*h7aDGztMHGDJcC2UTR-8BA.png,https://medium.com/better-marketing/5-marketing-lessons-from-disruptive-valentines-day-campaigns-f4bec6a49c2,marketing,92e44b7d8d048de8ddae7216969885b8895aec699c6a6608ab46ddce
I'm a tech CEO based in Denver. Here's why I think my city will be the next big hub for tech workers.,"James Eberhard, founder of Fluid Truck, says Denver's affordable cost of living and tech-friendly government is attracting more industry talent.By James EberhardDenver has always been my home, even when I wasn't technically a city resident. After living in places like London and Washington, DC, when it came time to decide where I wanted to launch and build my business, Denver was the only option for me. The Mile High City offers so much, including a diverse talent pool, natural beauty and inspiration, and affordability.Denver also offers a chance to build sustainably successful businesses outside the confines of Silicon Valley or New York City. In fact, analytics company Palantir is one of the latest tech firms to leave Silicon Valley for a new headquarters in Denver, citing the Denver area as a better cultural fit.This move reflects a broader trend: According to LinkedIn's recent Workforce Report, Denver is up +1% in employment and hiring compared to last year, while San Francisco, Washington, DC, and New York are all down, -13%, -11% and -9.4%, respectively.If you're looking for somewhere with a strong tech culture, but also the benefits of a lower cost of living, a higher quality of life, and a less competitive job market, Denver might be the place for you. The Mile High City is on the fast track to becoming a new micro-tech hub as its own right.While still an up-and-coming city in the tech industry, it's clear to see that Denver is an ideal place for the long-term development of sustainable businesses. The city has a strong infrastructure between the international airport and a transportation system that ranks №12 in the country.The local government has been committed to investing in transforming the city into a tech hub, and it shows. There's an entire ecosystem that supports entrepreneurs, and the business scene also feels more diverse because tech isn't the only booming industry. In fact, Colorado is the sixth state in the country with the highest concentration of creatives, giving startups and major companies access to a diverse talent pool. A 2019 PowderKeg survey found that 80% of tech founders in the Denver area felt there was sufficient access to talent.Most importantly, there's incredible variety in terms of company size. Denver's businesses don't necessarily subscribe to the approach of growing as large and as quickly as possible; they prefer a more sustainable trajectory that mitigates the possibility of flopping. And while giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon all have offices in Denver, the city is also home to startups and smaller tech firms in varying stages of development. New businesses benefit from mentorship opportunities, community organizations, and local sales opportunities.Read more: I run my company by a Canary Islands beach. Here are my 5 best tips to work remotely anywhere.As companies recover from the pandemic, cost savings have become a major point of focus in the tech industry, especially concerning office space as companies transition to more hybrid working models. Denver offers affordable office locations for these tech firms with flexible options that are easy to scale, and modern office spaces designed to accommodate flexible hours.On average, office space costs around $30 per square foot, and can go as high as $37 in the Central Business District while dropping in the city's suburbs. Compared to office space exceeding $70 per square foot on average in San Francisco, Denver is significantly more affordable.Additionally, while rental prices are slightly above the national average, Denver remains a very affordable city. The average apartment rental costs $1,674 a month for 848 square feet. For a ""fly-over"" city, Denver certainly offers east and west coasters much more space for their money.Denver is a business-friendly city with its 4.63% corporate income tax rate, but the city as a whole is also a lifestyle. Known as the city with the most microbreweries per capita and a mecca for outdoor enthusiasts, it's no wonder that the top two best places to live in the US in 2020 were both in the Denver Metro area.This quality of life has attracted a workforce that displays the palpable intention to successfully build their individual company and created a collaborative culture that nurtures the growth of other burgeoning startups and ambitious talent within the community. This friendly work culture makes create a tech community that is inclusive, opportunistic, and innovative.Denver is an overall great fit for people seeking a higher quality of life, with outdoor activities, a unique dining scene, and thriving nightlife. It's west coast culture without the steep price tag.Read more: I moved my family from California to Austin, Texas, and regretted it. Here are 10 key points every person should consider before relocating.The innovative culture of the Mile-High City has the potential to be the home of the next unicorn startup. As the impact of the pandemic becomes larger on the tech industry, it's likely that more small and mid-size companies will renounce their Silicon Valley or New York City headquarters and adjust to the mountain life.One thing is certain: The dynamic and culture that Denver offers will continue to attract tech workers looking for an affordable city that offers unique opportunities in their field, as well as a better quality of life.Denver is cementing itself as a leader for a new generation of resilient founders challenging that status quo. And the city's culture is evolving to ensure this momentum isn't lost.James Eberhard is the CEO and Founder of Fluid Truck, a technology-based truck rental platform enabling small and mid-sized businesses, as well as consumers, to rent commercial vehicles in only a few minutes with their mobile device - 24/7, 365 days a year.This is an opinion column.

How a Sleep Meditation Based on Military Training Can Help You Fall Asleep Naturally,"Sleep is a basic human need. It's as important as eating, drinking, and breathing. When you don't get enough sleep you damage your body and impair your mind. So what can you do if you have a hard time drifting off?Sleep deprivation is common in modern life. Most of us feel like it's hopeless to fit enough of it into our schedule between all of our daily problems. Add to that the distractions of social media and devices that keep you up later than you planned. There's a good chance you're cutting sleep short.So when you finally do lie down and try to grab some rest, it has to happen right away. But you might not be able to drift off when you want to. How can you find the off switch and power down your body?If you were like your smartphone or other devices, then all you would need to do at the end of the day is plug in your charger or drop down on the wireless charging pad and hit ""do not disturb.""Unfortunately, it isn't that simple for human beings. Or is it?Falling asleep is a skill that you can practice. Even if that sounds wrong, the U.S. Navy Pre-Flight School has shown us how it can be done. Almost everyone can learn to fall asleep easily.Don't waste time and get frustrated because you're flipping and flopping and unable to sleep. Try to relax and be proactive, instead of rehashing endless thoughts that lead to nowhere but exhaustion.A common complaint I hear as a meditation instructor is students falling asleep when they try to learn to meditate. This is because they're almost always sleep-deprived.It frustrates them and makes them want to quit. But if sitting still for 3 minutes makes you fall asleep, then you probably needed it!The solution is to help them sleep at night, so they can stay awake while trying to concentrate during the day. I incorporated some military techniques into a simple sleep meditation that anyone can use to get to sleep fast.Most people fall asleep before they get all the way through it. Once you learn how to use it, you can get some extra rest anywhere with a nap, too. It comes in handy on flights, waiting at the airport, or long car rides (when you aren't the driver.)I was in the Canadian Armed Forces years ago. Basic training had terrible sleep management. They made sure you didn't get much. If I was lucky, a few hours a night, and sometimes none.During basic training, I learned to fall asleep within seconds no matter what. This was because of sheer exhaustion after marching all day, digging trenches by hand, and going on midnight marches through lightning storms.Later, in the artillery, I learned to sleep right through literal cannons going off only a few feet away. We would get a bit of rest beside 105-mm Howitzers while they were firing. But this wasn't a skill. It was passing out.Utter mindless exhaustion is a terrible method of falling asleep. I don't recommend it. But we have a better option.The U.S. Navy Pre-Flight School came up with a more scientific method of falling asleep for their pilots during WWII. Falling asleep while flying is a huge, costly mistake that ends in death and destroys any chance of mission success. To make sure their pilots could use downtime effectively, they worked on methods to fall asleep in minutes.The pilots practiced these methods while sitting upright in a chair, feet flat on the ground. They learned to fall asleep easily in these circumstances.That means you have a serious advantage over these pilots if you're lying down in a dark room on a soft bed. Your chances of using this technique to fall asleep are huge.The US Army reportedly has a 96% success rate for those who use it, after 6 weeks of practice.This sleep meditation can work wonders. But it will be foolproof if you set yourself up for success by taking these additional steps as well:Find a comfortable position to go to sleep in. I prefer a bed, but any soft flat place where you won't be disturbed will work. If you have to, you can use this meditation to go to sleep sitting up, too.Start by paying attention to the softness of the sheets, blanket, and pillow. Notice the temperature. Enjoy the feeling of the fabric against you, surrounding you. Move around and snuggle right in.Take a deep breath, then let it out completely. as you take another breath, feel it make your chest rise. Follow it out of your body as your chest relaxes. Now start the meditation.If you follow all of these steps every time you want to go to sleep, you'll start training your body to relax and head off to dreamland. At first, it might not work every time. Try using one of these visualizations if the first steps don't do the trick.After visualizing one of these scenes, say to yourself, ""don't think, don't think, don't think, don't think"" for at least ten seconds.Falling asleep is a skill. That means you can get better at it if you put in the effort and some practice. It isn't totally out of our control like most of us assume.If you have the ability to go to sleep easily, it makes bedtime something to look forward to instead of a challenging, dreadful experience. It's worth your time to practice this skill. Over your life, it will pay you back with a ton of well-being.Take charge of your sleep time and get the rest you deserve.

Signal Processing for Scientific data analysis with Python: Part 3,"In this third part of signal processing with Python, I'd discuss use of median filter to remove large spiked signals. Here are links for the first and second parts. First, let's clarify once again, what is the difference between mean and and median of a series.To compute the median of a set of numbers, we need toMedianNow, consider a list of numbers. As you can see, most of these numbers in this particular list are below 50, whereas very few numbers are really large. The mean of these numbers iswhereas the median value isSo the mean value of the set is strongly pulled up by few larger values in the list which may be outliers (non-representative data points). Contrary to this the median is largely unaffected by the presence of outliers.So, when we apply a median filter to a particular data point, we basically replace that data point with the median value of its neighboring points within a manually set window.Before I discuss more about the median filter, I want to add that median is a non-linear filter. Thus, it is best to apply a median filter only to a limited number of data point in your signal. These data points are in most cases some unusual data points, outliers or missing signals. I will discuss more about linear and non-linear filters in one of the future posts.Codes in PythonLet's get to the coding part here. Import the necessary libraries numpy and matplotlib. '%matplotlib inline' enables you to visualize the necessary plots in your Jupyter notebook.Now first we create a set of randomly spiked data. To generate a signal we will use the cumulative sum of a list of random numbers which is also known as the Brownian motion/random walk. Numpy already has an in-built function for that, cumsum(). However, in a later post I might discuss how to define a function to simulate a random walk, just for fun.Now I am going to set a fraction of data points to some large number of values which will appear as spiked signal.You need to keep in mind that a mean-smoothing filter or a Gaussian smoothing filter is not going to be much useful here because the mean is going to be largely weighted towards the outliers which have large (positive or negative) values. But here our purpose is to replace the outliers with some combination of the neighboring points. This is exactly what the median filter is designed to do.Next we must decide how do we define outliers for a particular dataset. That information might be previously known from your experiment, for example, in what range you should expect the values to be. Here, however, we are going to decide on the threshold for outliers by visual inspection. Let's look at the histogram for all the data values that we have here.Now if we zoom into the x-axis we would find that most of the values in the dataset lie below 50. Thus, we set any value above 50 as an outlier.Now I initialize the filtered signal by a copy of the original signal.Now I am looping over time points in the series where the value is greater than the threshold. I replace these values in the original signal by the median of -k to +k neighboring values. I set a boundary here because it could happen that one of the really early (in our case <20th) or one of the last data points (in our case >(n-20)th) has a spike. In that case the large value + 20 (or -20) will be outside the range of our dataset. To prevent that error in the code we set the lower boundary as either 0 or outliers[i]-k , whichever is larger. Similarly, the upperbound is outliers[i]+k or n+1, whichever is smaller.Let's plot the original signal and processed signal together now.So, we have basically replaced the spiked data points with a median value of it's neighbors all while keeping the original signal intact. This is exactly what median filters are useful for.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*8SIjyJ8SbAFS6k4eWjRmcQ.png,https://nitaghosh.medium.com/signal-processing-with-python-ee5250ebd036,data-science,97a6caff53188c46155b6450a99518d7f4b1aee5d721a1e2232fa115
"Inside the New CDC Guidance on Reopening Classrooms: Masks and Social Distancing Key Safety Strategies, Vaccinations Not a Precondition for In-Person Learning","By Linda JacobsonStudents - even those in high school - can return to classrooms full time in communities with low to moderate spread of COVID-19 as long as schools enforce universal mask wearing and 6 feet of distance between students, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday in updated school reopening guidance.The agency also recommends handwashing, cleaning and contact tracing for all schools. But vaccinations for teachers, routine coronavirus testing and upgraded ventilation are ""extra layers of support"" that don't have to be in place before schools reopen, said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.""The science has demonstrated that schools can reopen safely prior to all teachers being vaccinated,"" she said, calling the new document a ""long-needed roadmap"" that was based on a thorough review of the science as well as input from parents, teachers and school leaders. ""There's more science to rely on, and we've learned a lot from that science.""For example, while she recommends some cleaning of surfaces, ""full fumigation"" of classrooms isn't necessary, she said: ""I don't believe the data suggests there is a lot of transmission that comes from surfaces to people.""Grouping students into pods that stay together, using cafeterias and other common areas as classrooms and seating one child per row on a school bus are other highlighted strategies. The U.S. Department of Education released a companion handbook with additional examples.""We need to get kids back in the classroom, and to do that, schools and educators need help,"" said Donna Harris-Aikens, senior adviser for policy and planning at the department.Education organizations, including the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Association of Elementary School Principals, reacted positively to the guidance.""With the new year, new Congress and new administration, we are greatly appreciative of the deliberate, coordinated and focused federal leadership on both prioritizing the physical reopening of schools and supporting schools in their work to do so,"" said Dan Domenech, executive director of AASA, The School Superintendents Association.The guidance, which Walensky said was ""free from political meddling,"" comes after a week of mixed messages from the administration related to reopening schools and questions over whether President Joe Biden would side with teachers unions holding out for vaccines. In addition, the CDC guidance goes beyond Biden's pre-inauguration pledge of reopening a majority of K-8 schools within his first 100 days in office by outlining guidelines that include in-person attendance for high school students.""Infection, hospitalization and test positivity are down sharply. Vaccine distribution is ramping up,"" said Rick Hess, director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""The science shows that schools are not a significant source of contagion, and the devastating effects of closure have become increasingly clear.""Hess was among those this week suggesting the administration had lowered the bar when White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said ""open"" means having at least 50 percent of teachers in classrooms ""at least one day a week.""He called Psaki's statement ""unconscionable"" and described the administration's position as ""anti-science foot shuffling.""On Wednesday, Psaki elaborated on the issue, noting that the administration was ""not planning to celebrate at 100 days"" if schools were open only one day a week.""That is not the ceiling,"" she said. ""That is the bar we're trying to leap over and exceed.""According to Walensky, few counties across the U.S. - only about 5 percent - have transmission rates low enough to relax the 6-foot social distancing requirement.A new color-coded system organizes schools into zones, ranging from blue for low risk of transmission - where there are nine or fewer cases among 100,000 people in a seven-day period - to red, where there are 100 or more positive cases per 100,000. The agency recommends full in-person learning for schools in blue and yellow zones and hybrid schedules for those in orange zones, where spread is substantial.Red zone schools would fall into two groups. Those that regularly test students and staff for the coronavirus could have hybrid learning for all grade levels, but those that don't should limit hybrid to the elementary grades and have middle and high school students learning remotely full time.John Bailey, a visiting fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, tweeted that the categories could confuse people who are used to their own state's colored tiers. In California's blueprint, for example, counties where the risk of transmission is ""widespread"" are coded purple.Some districts have already announced that they don't expect to reopen before the end of the school year. And Robin Lake, executive director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington, expects more to join the list ""unless parents revolt.""For months, parents across the country have lost patience with districts delaying the reopening of schools. Protests, lawsuits and angry outbursts at school board meetings have increased.""Parents and families cannot operate in chaos,"" said Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, a network of local parent advocacy organizations.Biden, in a CBS interview last Sunday, described moms leaving the workforce because their children aren't in school as ""a national emergency."" But parents would need to continue to make child care arrangements or try to work from home if their children attend only school once or twice a week.""Parents are looking for a plan, for stability and decision making based on science from public health officials,"" Rodrigues said. ""We can't keep moving the goalposts and the metrics based on which way the political winds are blowing for the unions.""Leaders of the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers say their members want to return to class, but demand testing and vaccines.""We remain supportive of widespread testing - especially as mutant strains multiply in areas of uncontrolled community spread - and we urge the CDC to remain flexible as more data comes to light,"" AFT President Randi Weingarten said in a statement.

Productivity Shame - the Nagging Feeling That You've Not Done Enough,"I was tired. It was the peak of the pandemic, and everyone was working from home. Even the kids were attending school online.My day was spent in meetings, getting kids on and off Zoom calls, quick snacks and multiple cups of coffee.It felt like the number of meetings had exploded. Every 5-minute conversation at the water cooler/coffee machine had now turned into a 30-minute meeting on my calendar.By the end of the day, I still had emails to reply to and had barely started on the presentation, which was due in three days. I sat down for another hour and made some progress by researching and creating the agenda slide.At midnight, I hit the bed, physically exhausted. But my mind was still racing with the nagging feeling that the day wasn't very productive. I berated myself for not making better to-do lists, or maybe I could have tried the Pomodoro technique. Perhaps I needed to set stricter boundaries with my kids regarding interruptions.Modern knowledge workers don't have an assembly line to work on, and neither do they have targets of making 50 calls a day. Deadlines are usually in weeks or months, and workers are often on their own for managing their daily schedules.Also, teamwork, mentoring, learning, reporting, are all part of the job. Such a myriad of activities leads to frequent context switching. We may be getting into the zone for programming, only to be interrupted a few minutes later by the next meeting. Or someone wants to ask a quick question on Slack/Teams.By the end of the day, we have barely made progress on our important project. Instead, we have spent the most time on collaboration. With everyone working from home during the last year, family interruptions have been added to the mix, creating even more disruptions.When we finally end up in bed and try to sleep, our brain reminds us of all the things we didn't achieve. We blame ourselves for bad time management, bad prioritising, not joining the 5 am club, not using a journal, not using a personal kanban board or whatever latest productivity hacks we've heard of.This nagging feeling of not doing enough and the guilt of ineffective time management leads to productivity shame.There are two parts to the problem - planning and execution.We start our day with lofty ideas of what we will accomplish. We have our big project on the top of the list, and we are sure we will make good progress. We are overly optimistic and underestimate the effort. We also neglect to account for lack of focus and frequent interruptions.We often have calendar entries for meetings, kids schedules etc. but we rarely add our solo working time to the calendar. We sometimes write down our to-do lists, or it is in our head, but it is seldom scheduled in our calendar.The underestimated effort, coupled with ad-hoc planning sets us on a collision course with failure.The day rarely hits us with a cannonball. It instead pokes us with hundreds of needles.If our day had a significant event such as a car breakdown or sick family member, we wouldn't feel productivity shame.The minor mishaps are the ones to send us on our guilt trip at bedtime. The few extra minutes it took to find the proper Zoom meeting for kids or answer a quick question for a stuck colleague or a short call from mum.Worst of all, we kick ourselves for self-indulgence such as the extra episode on Netflix, which we couldn't resist, or falling into the trap of watching too many cat videos on YouTube.Getting more planning tools or learning new time management techniques would multiply the feeling of guilt. Instead, we need a method to ensure success.We need to set ourselves up for productivity satisfaction.An outcome-based goal, such as getting a presentation done or writing a report, is likely to take more than one sitting over multiple days. We cannot derive satisfaction until it is complete.Outcome goals are also easy to procrastinate. We often choose busy work over important work. It is tempting to go through emails or social media, just for a few minutes before diving into the big hairy project. The few minutes turns into an hour, and we stop only when we absolutely need to get up from our desks.Process goals, on the other hand, require us to take action without worrying about the outcome. If you set up a process of reading emails 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes after lunch, it is easy to run a timer and leave the rest of the unread emails for the next slot.A process gives us a structure to break down our day, and we can derive satisfaction from following the process rather than depend on the uncertainty of the outcome.It is also easier to form habits around processes. We can even create habit stacks. I try reading emails only while drinking coffee. I may allocate additional time to respond, but reading the emails gets tied to my coffee break twice a day and doesn't spill over other activities.Now that we have discussed the problem at length let's dive into the 5x5 process.Here is a process that I find very useful for deriving satisfaction with my productivity at the end of the day:Set aside 5 minutes in the morning for planning, which consists of Steps 1 and 2 below.Use your favourite note-taking tool to create a list of 5 items based on the following criteria:Schedule five 30-minute slots in your calendar throughout the day. Add these between meetings or other existing commitments. These slots are your solo working time, where you can focus without interruptions.Next, mark these slots with specific items from your Five Little Wins in your preferred order. DO NOT use these slots for emails, chats or other collaboration activities.Your total focus time will add up to 2 and 1/2 hours. You will still have plenty of time to deal with emails, attend meetings etc.If you work alone, you may define recurring slots. Otherwise, it is better to schedule these slots during your Five Minute Planning as it allows other people to set up meetings with you until the morning of the day.During the focus time, set a 25 minutes timer on your phone, put it on 'do not disturb' and get to work. Avoid all temptations to pick up your phone or look at emails or respond to chat.Don't beat yourself up if you could not finish the planned item in 25 minutes. You will get better at estimating as you practice the 5x5 process.Why 25 minutes? Because it will give you a 5-minute buffer between tasks or before the next meeting. You can use this time to save your work, jot down any bubbling thoughts, get a drink, do a few jumping jacks or whatever gets you ready for the next item on your calendar.You need to review your five wins list throughout the day. Leaving this assessment for the end of the day is a sure way to dissatisfaction.Check-ins give you a chance to course-correct if needed. Check off the completed wins, and take note of the next one on the list. If needed, reprioritize or update your plan.You can schedule your check-ins in your calendar, or you can piggyback them on your focus time slots (remember the 5-minute buffer?).Schedule your last check-in at least an hour before bedtime. If there is something super important you've missed, you still have an hour to strike it off.After the last check-in, reward yourself with a pat on your back. You may celebrate with a glass of wine, a piece of dark chocolate, or whatever healthy way you celebrate your wins.Remember, you are rewarding yourself for following the process and not for the output you produced. If you messed up, write down a few improvements for tomorrow.Don't be too hard on yourself. You are starting on a new journey of productivity satisfaction. Give yourself time to hone your skills and establish new habits.We all have competing demands on our time, and it is hard to balance everything. It is easy to get sucked into a stressful race to juggle activities through the day, which only leads to exhaustion and dissatisfaction as we hit the bed.Further, the work environment is competitive. We always feel that our colleagues are getting more done. Or other writers on Medium are publishing more articles or writing better ones.Setting up a process-based target for the day and deriving satisfaction from following it gives us a much better chance of achieving productivity satisfaction.",,https://medium.com/curious/productivity-shame-the-nagging-feeling-that-youve-not-done-enough-6d8df5d9566c,productivity,98ba3a4811e0e53ee73d249880916c4a4a83541c22940c235e464a7e
The UX of Japanese web design,"Exploring their unique digital landscape.I received a question from a reader on my last article asking about the shocking contrast between Japanese product design and web design. On first glance it seems like these websites are stuck in the 1990's - low resolution images, stacked text boxes, narrow columns and banner ads flashing at you from every corner of the screen. As a UX designer I had to ask myself why something that seemed so flawed could be so prevalent in Japan?I was reminded that UX does not transcend cultures and locations, it is connected to the needs and experiences of the users wherever they may be.Japan uses 3 scripts in their language - hiragana (based on pronunciation), kanji (traditional Chinese characters) and katakana (used for words adopted from countries outside of Japan, making pronunciation easier). Unlike languages that use the Roman alphabet there are no italics and no capital letters; making hierarchical contrast in typography very different. The layout of text on print and web apply various treatments, designs and stylistic elements to create these contrasts. The visual distinction between these characters can be difficult at first. When looking at Japanese design; look at the language through the lens of the user. Luis talks about the importance of language as he takes us on a visual journey through the crowded streets of Japan in his article ""Japan in the Eyes of a User Experience Designer.""What are you looking for when you search a website for a product online? Information, customer reviews, detailed photographs of the item - the list goes on. In Japanese consumer culture; the more information given about a product in the early stages of the customer journey the better! Customers expect a level of transparency and accountability from the retailer. Listing product information in this way improves the customer journey.In a comparative study by btrax they looked at the designs of the Cookpad website in Spain and Japan. The design from Japan focused on text with images that support the copy compared to the design from Spain; where images take center stage. Read more about it the article: ""The challenge of designing UX and UI in Japan"".Take a walk through the crowded city of Shibuya and you can literally hear the advertisements shouting at you. The visual noise and chaos can be overwhelming but also alarmingly captivating. The intrigue of Tokyo's bustling city centers are echoed in the designs of their website with ads shouting at you from every corner of your screen. The web real-estate is much like Tokyo's urban real-estate. Densely populated home pages, ads and text crammed into any space that would fit and dazzling bright colors. This design has been around for some time and it isn't going away any time soon.Rakuten is one of the most successful e-commerce and online retailing companies in Japan; yet it is one of the most overwhelming home pages I've come across. These sites have a growing number of users who rely on design consistency. A major pain point for many of today's modern users of social networking apps are the frequent updates and changes to the UI that create frustration for the user and fragment the user experience.Thus, depending on your target demographic, the UX should address different user needs. The style of the websites match the brick and mortar stores, busy store fronts, oversized cards with deals and discounts give customers the sense that the store is popular and busy. Understanding Japanese consumer behavior helps to paint a clearer picture of their digital world.As we browse through the .jp websites it is clear that Japan's designs are most certainly unique but understanding the cultural context upon which their designs are based can help us navigate their digital world.For more on the author.Special thanks to Manuel Muller for his thoughtful question.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10000/1*sLI6Cb8819SsRvuKfYBrFw.png,https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/the-ux-of-japanese-website-design-b982076af2d5,ux,98dbe52551c762bc103fa7e468e62a9c3309f1553f0eb1bc9f9f1798
Why Our Brains Love Physical Buttons,"Ever since Douglas Engelbart first popularized the computer mouse in his legendary 1968 Mother of All Demos, people have tried to replace it. It hasn't gone well.Gesture recognition, trackpads, voice commands (remember Dragon Naturally Speaking?), touchpads, styluses - all these have come and gone. The modern mouse is wireless, laser-equipped, and bristling with buttons. But its core design and functionality is basically identical to that of the original mouse Engelbart demoed 50 years ago.It took a change of format to create something that even comes close to rivaling the mouse - the touchscreen on your smartphone. Touchscreens are perfectly suited to a tiny mobile device like the iPhone. But like the mouse, they're still fundamentally a physical, tactile technology. Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa are nice for some things, but how often do you use them to navigate an app or send an email?Physical technologies like the mouse and touchscreen have persisted because the best tech products aren't purely digital. They're hybrids - technologies that blend the digital and the analog, the virtual and the physical, or the automated and the human. Understanding our love of hybrids requires delving deep into our evolution and brain anatomy. It explains why your iPhone feels like an extension of your arm, why the Amazon Kindle continues to exist, and why humans can't help but love big, chunky, physical buttons.I'm a photographer, so I spend a lot of time thinking about and using cameras. I shoot both analog film and modern digital photographs, so I own both vintage cameras and modern digital ones. My favorite camera, though, is somewhere in between: the Leica Q. The Q is a digital, mirrorless camera, but its design and user interface aren't based on fancy new technology, but rather on the original controls found on a Leica film camera from 1935 - including physical shutter speed and aperture dials and a physical shutter.Is this some kind of hipster throwback - impractical, but intended to impress other photographers? No. Leica built the Q that way because it's the most logical way to set up a camera. All the functions you need are laid out for you in an intuitive, physical way. After taking 550,000+ photos on my Q, I can literally operate it with my eyes closed. I know the increments on the shutter speed selector by heart and can click it from speed to speed without having to look at it. When I press the shutter button, I can feel the tiny click of the physical shutter firing. If it doesn't fire, I know the Q hasn't locked focus, and I'll have to override its autofocus and find a focus point manually.The Q is such a fantastic camera in part because it's a hybrid. It blends the best elements of the digital world (a digital sensor, insane light sensitivity) with the best elements of the analog one (an intuitive set of physical controls, a real shutter). Other great tech products are hybrids, too. Steve Jobs reportedly hated buttons, and did his best to eliminate them from Apple's devices. But even he couldn't kill Apple's prominent Home button, which takes users backward in menus, or all the way back to a consistent home screen (and continues to exist even on the latest generation iPads, though it was eliminated on iPhone after the iPhone X).Having the grounding and reversibility of a Home button makes navigating a new app or website feel like meandering down a winding garden path in the physical world, rather than drowning in the infinite set of possibilities presented by an open-ended voice interface. You can try out new functions in an unfamiliar app, emboldened by the knowledge that you can always go Home with one press on a button that's right in front of you.Other devices exist entirely in order to give digital information a physical, analog presence. Most of us are totally capable of reading e-books on a cellphone screen. But many of us (myself included) are perfectly willing to plunk down up to $350 for the Amazon Kindle, a digital device that does its best to capture the experience of reading a physical book. High-end Kindles use E-Ink displays, which shunt actual ink around a fluid-filled panel electronically, duplicating the look and resolution of a real printed page.The newest Kindle even comes with an optional premium leather case that makes the device look (and smell) like a handsome bound volume from some aging professor's personal library. Amazon says that the case ""develops a natural patina, making each cover unique"" and ""opens and closes just like a book."" The Kindle is a perfect hybrid - it combines the best aspects of digital books (portability, ease of purchase) with the reading experience of physical ones.Why do people love hybrids so much? It likely comes down to our brains. Humans are highly tactile, physical creatures. Our skin contains four different kinds of mechanoreceptors, which allow our brains to perceive touch. Three of them detect basic touch sensations, like pressure and the stretching of our skin. But we also have a fourth kind of special, exquisitely sensitive touch receptor: the Pacinian corpuscle.Pacinian corpuscles detect vibrations. Unlike other mechanoreceptors, they're quickly overwhelmed by direct skin contact. But their sensitivity to vibration allows us to do something remarkable - it allows us to interact with tools as if those tools were part of our own bodies.Imagine you're holding a hammer. When you use it to hit a nail, tiny vibrations travel up its handle and into your hand. Your Pacinian corpuscles detect those minuscule vibrations, encode them into electrical signals, and send them up to your brain. Your brain then processes them using the same regions it uses to process stimuli that directly touch your skin. It's as if you've embedded mechanoreceptors into the hammer itself. Especially if you hammer things a lot, your brain becomes adept at understanding the vibrations that your Pacinian corpuscles detect. The hammer starts to feel like an extension of your body.Pacinian corpuscles allow you to interact with other kinds of tools, too. They allow you to feel the surface of the road while you're driving (every tiny bump generates a vibration that travels through the steering wheel into your hands), read Braille with your fingertips, and detect the rough texture of a piece of wool, or the smoothness of a glass windowpane, even the glass screen of your iPad. Pacinian corpuscles likely evolved to allow us to wield physical tools, like a rock hammer (or a sewing needle). But today, they're engaged (both passively and actively) when we use the physical interfaces of tech tools. When I turn the shutter speed dial on my Leica Q (and especially when I feel the tiny ""thunk"" of its shutter firing), I'm using my Pacinian corpuscles. The same is true when I press the physical page turn button on my Kindle and feel its satisfying click.Even tech devices without real physical controls find ways to engage your Pacinian corpuscles and other mechanoreceptors. Cellphones' virtual keypads are easy to use in part because they produce artificial vibrations when you touch a virtual key. Scientists have tuned these artificial vibrations obsessively so that pressing a fake on-screen key or button feels (to your Pacinian corpuscles and thus to your brain) exactly like touching the real thing.The field responsible for optimizing these physical sensations is called haptics (as are the sensations themselves), and is a subset of the field of ergonomics. Knowing that haptics can make or break a device or app, hardware companies like Apple provide detailed guides for other designers about haptic best practices. A good haptic, for example, should be completely predictable. As Apple says in their guide, ""If a haptic doesn't reinforce a cause-and-effect relationship, it can be confusing and seem gratuitous.""This predictability allows your Pacinian corpuscles and your brain to learn the patterns of sensations that a specific device or app produce (much as a physical Home button allows for predictable paths through an unfamiliar interface). Over time, these become more and more ingrained in your brain, enhancing the perception that the app or device is an extension of your body. If haptics are unpredictable, the sensations risk confusing your brain. If a hammer vibrated in a different way every time you picked it up, you'd have a hard time learning to use it deftly. The same applies to an app that changes its haptics with each new update.Good haptics - or good physical design, in the case of devices with real physical interfaces - is what makes great hybrid products so pleasurable to use and so successful. Via our Pacinian corpuscles, these devices interface directly with our brains, leveraging the same hardware that evolved over millennia to allow us to use tools.The lack of haptics also explains why virtual assistants can seem like a strange, alien presence. Interacting with Alexa doesn't feel like anything. Even a baby can pick up a physical device like an iPad and immediately begin interacting with it. Voice interfaces, though, take practice. The mouse has persisted for so long because it makes your arm and your fingers feel like part of the computer you're controlling, and piggybacks on neural hardware humans have used for eons. That kind of connection is hard to replicate with any other input device - especially one that relies on audio alone.To create great tech products, designers must deliberately build hybrids. This means embracing the digital advantages that tech products bring, while also taking heed of the basic, human need for something physical to pick up, hold, and touch. Tiny details - like how a button clicks or the haptics of a virtual keyboard - may seem minor. But they connect to something deep, physical, and fundamentally human. Getting hybrid interactions right can mean the difference between building a decent tech product and creating a life-changing one.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10000/1*M0cqgzKLz07Rb7_F-78BwA.jpeg,https://debugger.medium.com/why-our-brains-love-physical-buttons-5dc203a9014d,neuroscience,228f4fe32ba73957c4dd31fd86d3f0301989abf3a1e3fdee3cf0d745
Stories of Adventure and Calamity Make Us Who We Are,"We knew the bus had no windshield when we boarded it, but we felt unconcerned. Maybe we'd been in Africa too long at that point to be surprised. Perhaps we couldn't envision what the ride might be like without glass. Maybe we didn't care.Jimmie and I knew enough to walk far down the aisle, though, and we settled into the back row of the bus. We'd chosen to travel at night hoping sleep would help the 12-hour journey pass more quickly.As the vehicle made its way south, Mopti, the dusty city on the Niger River, had already begun quieting down for the night. Street food sellers lit the sides of the road like fireflies, their lanterns illuminating the last of their fried bean cakes or hibiscus drinks. Shopkeepers, sitting outside of their closed-up stores, laughed quietly and sipped sweet, green tea with friends before going home for the night.And then Mopti ended, and night engulfed the bus. When our eyes adjusted, we'd see the Milky Way spread out like a blanket above us, but at first, there was only blackness.That's when the bugs came out.Twenty years later, I sit in an Airbnb on the Oregon Coast, about an hour from my home in Portland. After digging stuffed penguins from luggage and pulling down additional blankets from closet shelves, I finally tucked my daughters in for the night moments ago. They're as cozy as they'd be in their beds at home.The pandemic rages, so we plan to hunker down here for digital school and work, taking walks on the beach during pauses. I packed the kitchen sink for a four-night stay: sacks of favorite foods, piles of books and games, our own pillows.This is what a mother should provide, no? Comfort, safety, familiarity.When the insects appeared inside the bus with no windshield, riders in front of Jimmie and I started to fidget. Women drew their wraps over their mouths; men dropped their foreheads on the seatback in front of them. Jimmie and I pulled the lengths of fabric we had planned to ball into pillows over our heads and positioned our backpacks before us like shields.The bugs pelted all of us. Big insects, small insects, stick-like figures, and meaty, juicy bugs. They crawled on our chests, scrambled up our cheeks, and became entangled in our hair, as surprised as the rest of us at the situation in which we found ourselves. The unlucky ones appeared on our bodies dead on arrival.Jimmie and I huddled under our armor of fabric unperturbed. We'd grown hardy after two years in Mali, cycling with our groceries, avoiding snakes in rice fields and communal dinner bowls, and carrying drinking water in buckets on our heads from wells to our homes.Concerned more about the bus driver's ability to maneuver the vehicle, Jimmie made his way up the aisle, stepping carefully around the sacks and the people positioned there. He reported back that the driver wore black sunglasses as he transported us down the unlit road. Sitting nearby, a friend who had brought burning coals onto the bus, boiled fresh glasses of tea for the driver.At least he'd be caffeinated.Looking back, I wonder what happened to my 23-year-old self who walked boldly onto a bus with no windshield to speed through pitch blackness? The unflappable person who lugged mattresses into the African sunshine to scorch bedbugs and peered into the faces of deadly vipers? Is my 46-year-old self capable of such courage?In our 20s, we notice older people and think, ""I'll always/never (fill in the blank.)"" Always enjoy being at bars until the wee hours. Never be tied to one place through homeownership. Always like long road trips and driving through the night. Never stay at chain hotels or all-inclusive resorts.And then, slowly, we change. Perhaps our neuroplasticity becomes rigid. Maybe our early risk-taking tendencies fade, or our mortality becomes palpable. Perhaps we stop caring if others consider us tough, cool, hard, and strong. Maybe we're more self-confident and self-assured.Now we appreciate hotel rooms with king-sized beds and can't imagine sharing a bathroom in a youth hostel. We enjoy seeing our retirement accounts expand. We're not shy about going to sleep by 10 pm.Yet, what about those stories of adventure and calamity? They define us.Our stories form layers of sediment that make up our lives. We tell tales to friends over dinner. Family members relay them in wedding toasts. And at the end of it all, at our memorial service, friends don't speak of the time we rented an Airbnb on the Oregon Coast that looked like our home; they tell how we lived without running water and electricity, spent a night listening to a snuffling bear outside of our tent, or were robbed in Italy.These powerful moments are the pigments that make up the messy, colorful, complicated, textured canvas of our lives.I want my daughters to have moments like this, moments awash in adventure, uncertainty, risk, and boldness. Though motherhood, ever the ultimate damper, wires me to keep them secure, protected, comfortable. Tucked into warm beds, snuggled in with penguins.Do I want my daughters to coexist with vipers, live six hours from a hospital, and take dangerous bus rides? While my heart screams, ""No!"" my brain, which values calculated risk, transformative experiences, and the power of international travel, yells back, ""Yes! (Just tell me about it afterward.)""Jimmie, and I didn't sleep that night. At daybreak, we made it to the capital city of Bamako to enjoy its treasures: air conditioning, chocolate, cold beer, and (painfully slow, dial-up) internet. We barely found the story of our journey from Mopti interesting enough to share with our Peace Corps friends. They were in their 20s, too; they had sensational tales of their own.",https://miro.medium.com/max/11520/1*iI35C7LCOVaU56amnhE9cw.jpeg,https://thecreative.cafe/stories-of-adventure-and-calamity-make-us-who-we-are-71686361e649,travel,247e3eba28e91423a8f5bc834da1e1dff5af68e8f38131828fabaeb5
How to get content out the door faster,"The best copy in the world isn't going to work if it's sitting in your Drafts folder.You know this. You also know that sometimes getting copy out of your Drafts folder and into the world is easier said than done.With that in mind, here are some tips to help you, no matter which stage of the copywriting process you struggle with.If it's the blank page that scares you, start by thinking big picture. Plan out the structure of the article. You might want to keep it very high level. You might want to go into detail, making a note of every point you need to hit. With an outline on the page, you've given yourself a structure to work to.Personally, I always create a structure before I start to write. When it's a topic I know well, I can keep it very high level because I know a few brief notes will give my brain the prompts it needs. I use the more detailed method when I'm less familiar with a topic.If you have no idea where to start or don't know what to say, you aren't ready to start. Take a step back to do more research, get more clarity on the brief or request more information - anything you need to do to get a clearer picture.If you struggle to start simply because writing copy is hard work, there are several things you can try.If you struggle to start because you get 'stage fright', I have a couple of tips. Even though your copy might be read by thousands of people, write it as if you're writing it for a single reader. This brings lots of benefits, quite aside from removing the fear factor.All the gurus will tell you to 'eat the frog' - do the big scary thing (i.e. writing copy) first. Personally, I find it helps to tick off a handful of 'quick wins' (reconciling invoices, replying to emails, shredding documents from previous projects, whatever) first. I know it's procrastination, but once they're done they can't take up space in my head and I have no excuses for not focusing.Sometimes, feeling full of energy is great when you're writing copy, so wait until you've had a good night's sleep if you can. Having said that, feeling tired can also work, especially when you need to be creative. I often find that when your barriers are down because you're tired, that's when the most creative ideas creep in.Finally, if you struggle to concentrate because you'd rather not be doing the heavy thinking that writing copy requires, use tools to help you focus. I use the Forest app to stop me picking up my phone. Copywriting friends swear by the Pomodoro technique. There are also lots of tools to stop you faffing on your computer too - here's a useful list.You've got a first draft you're happy with and you send it off to the people who need to approve it. And that's where the problems start. Everyone's got an opinion and they aren't afraid to share it! You end up in an endless feedback loop and are working on your twentieth draft before you know it. I've been there.The brutal truth is that sometimes this is inevitable and you just have to live with it.There are some things you can do, though.Before you start, check who matters when it comes to signing off the copy and put a DACI in place:· D = Driver. The one person responsible for corralling stakeholders, collating all the necessary information and getting a decision made by the agreed date.· A = Approver. The one person who makes the decision.· C = Contributors. They have knowledge or expertise that may influence the decision - i.e., they have a voice, but no vote.· I = Informed. They are informed of the final decision.This helps you because it reminds you whose opinion you have to listen to and whose you don't. (Although this doesn't mean you should ignore useful feedback just because it's come from someone whose voice doesn't - technically - matter.)Not only does this help you, it also helps your stakeholders. For example, your fellow marketing colleague might be the 'Informed' on a piece. Knowing this, they know they can just glance at a piece not find time to give detailed feedback. Similarly, your legal person might be a 'Contributor'. It means they're being asked to read for legal points not tone of voice or content, so they can read with their expertise in mind and nothing more.If it's a high stakes piece or one that's likely to be controversial, it can save time to pull together an outline for people first. You can then ask people to sign off before you proceed to writing the full document. In other words, you can try to get the arguments out of the way before you start writing in full.Finally, when you're sending a piece out for feedback, set it in context for people. At the very least you want to say, for example - 'This is the letter we'll send to people with their first order to welcome them to our company.' You may also need to go into more detail to pre-empt questions and concerns about what you've said and why. For example, 'We know from our research that the majority of people who buy from us value sustainability. It's why we've chosen to highlight some of our sustainability projects they may not have heard of yet.' By giving people the context, they can offer feedback that's relevant and useful.It can be really hard to let go of copy and publish it in the world.If you're scared it isn't good enough, there are a few things you can do.Firstly, I'm going to assume that you've done your best by the copy - you did your research and thought carefully about what you needed it to do for you. I think there's a difference between 'I'm nervous about publishing this copy because it's always scary going public' and 'I'm nervous about publishing this copy because I know - objectively - it isn't good enough.'Assuming you're nervous because it's scary to go public, remember that it definitely isn't going to get you any sales if it isn't out there in the world. Copy is better off out there and working for you than waiting to be polished to perfection (whatever perfection is).If you have a tendency to tinker or aren't sure which version of a headline is better, leave it to the market to decide. Split testing is the way forward. Most email marketing programmes offer a split testing option. You can use split testing software on your website. (There's a list of the best ones here.) If you're using printed literature, use different codes on the order form so you can track which version gets better results. Doing split testing means you can know for sure which version of your headline was better, rather than wondering if the one you didn't go with was an absolute masterpiece.Ultimately, writing copy is hard work for all sorts of reasons. There are, however, things you can do to ease the journey. I've shared some of my favourites here. If there are others that you use, I'd love to hear them!",https://miro.medium.com/max/7102/1*-pozJ1CID9gkacgxxEDJjg.jpeg,https://catherineevery.medium.com/how-to-get-content-out-the-door-faster-9e967c392fa,marketing,262f6bd0e661f7c5bd8961782bdc88e1957107c38667e5bdbc423045
"""Log-in to unsubscribe""","We have all experienced those unwanted spam emails and have hit that ""unsubscribe"" link as soon as we could. Most of the time it works, but not everyone adheres to the FTC rules and we are left wondering how to get rid of that annoyance.Recently I have been experiencing this more and more, because some person somewhere on this planet has the same name as mine and they think that adding @gmail.com to their name is their birthright. This has resulted in my mailbox filling in with huge number of emails from websites that I have never registered to. [note: I fail to understand why someone would provide an email address they don't own to their credit score company, bank, uber, loan company, etc. Maybe that topic demands another post.]I am unable to reach out to this person (because if I write an email to that person, it will come to me lol). So the best I can do is, every time they register on some website or app with my email ID, I click ""unsubscribe"".I have never clicked unsubscribe so many times as I have been doing recently. Interestingly, this has made me realize how so many reputed companies are not following the FTC guidelines and are indulging in this illegal practice openly, without any fear of retaliation.Let us quickly understand what the guidelines say about spamming.The CAN-SPAM act says:I care least about all other rules except # 6 because most business emails have an unsubscribe link, but what they do after you click it is very important.Let's look at some key aspects of #6 as described in the guidelines:This is where most of the violations happen. Rogue businesses want to make it as difficult for you as possible to unsubscribe from their mailing list. They do this by making you log-in to their website to unsubscribe. This is a totally illegal practice because if I have not registered with them, how am I going to log-in?There is one case in particular that I would like to highlight here (and the one that inspired me to write this post). There is a company in India called paisabazaar.com (They should thank me for giving them this free publicity). My namesake went ahead and registered my email address on this website. I learned about this on Dec 22, 2020 when I got an email saying I should check my new credit score. Since now I live in California, and I do not have an Indian Credit Card, I was surprised why I am getting credit score email from this company.So the first thing I do is hit the 'unsubscribe' link. It takes me to this page:This clearly is not what an unsubscribe page should look like. It violates the point #6 we discussed above:Since I do not have an India mobile number, and I did not want to create an account using my Gmail or Facebook credentials, I decided to write to them.(We will monitor this timeline)I tried to be very descriptive about what was going on, and what they were doing was not legal. 3 days later I got a reply from them. This clearly states that they are blocking my email ID from their records (I don't know what that means, I am the one trying to block them :D . They should be removing my email from their database.).At last, I thought the ordeal was over. But no, I was still receiving daily emails from them. I decided to remind them again on December 31, 2020.There was a big gap after that email and then I received this ultimate reply yesterday (Feb 9, 2021). Thats more than 40 days since my email. This time they openly asked my phone number so that they can assist me in resolving this issue........ Why???Why is it so difficult to delete my email from your database when I have already been communicating with you through the same email I want to be removed?I replied to them saying that I am not going to share any more personal information with you. This time I got a reply pretty quickly.In 47 days since this all started, I am back to the full circle where in my very first email I had told them that I am unable to unsubscribe using their website as I do not have an account with them. I need to wait and watch where this goes now.This practice is pretty rampant. Just because we usually do not unsubscribe from a lot of mailers, we do not realize this.As a UX designer, I feel sad that despite strong FTC guidelines, some designer somewhere may have succumbed to business pressure and delivered this poor user experience. Or worst, they were not aware that what they are doing is considered evil design practice.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1792/1*DrHA6BTGtGfcdg7jiKPVdg.png,https://uxdesign.cc/log-in-to-unsubscribe-ea0b9e99be1e,ux,265ec60e00e558d66c025d5e3e6079bf2b0b7381505a07b09fb11900
"Rediscovering Classmates, the Kinder, Gentler Facebook","The older I get, spooling my life out behind me, the more I want to retrace those threads, trying to recapture some essence of thought, feeling, or experience. It's a tic of late adulthood. The realization that you probably have less time ahead of you than behind you makes the memories even more precious.So, when I heard someone randomly mention Classmates, it ignited the tiniest memory ember. ""Classmates? I haven't thought about that platform in years.""Classmates launched in 1995, around the dawn of the modern internet, and it is arguably one of the first social networks. Before Facebook transformed the ""face books"" of college into a global social media phenomenon, one that would devour the personal information of almost 3 billion people, there was Classmates, a homey site that asked a simple question: Where did you go to school?Its primary appeal was helping you reconnect to former high school classmates. (You could add other schools, but we all know that the bonds we built in high school are the strongest.) I joined in the late 1990s and, for a time, busily filled out my information, shared old photos, and even communicated with friends from both of my former schools. (I attended high school in Colorado and New York.)Classmates grew at a good clip right into the turn of the century. I liked the service enough to stick with it even when it started charging a yearly membership fee.It took Facebook, which freely provided almost everything Classmates offered-and in many cases, much more-for me to cancel my Classmates subscription and walk away.Memories of Classmates and the connections I made there slowly faded away until I heard its name and decided to see what if anything was left of Classmates.com.TLDR: Classmates.com is alive, kicking, and in some ways very much the same as I left it. It felt, in some ways, like I was thawing a cryogenically preserved site. Like Sylvester Stallone in Demolition Man, Classmates looked untouched by the almost 15 years of neglect and ready for me to reconnect.The service is still owned by United Online, a sort of retro online company that also owns ""remember when?"" brands like Juno and NetZero.It's still a pay service-""Best Value!"" $1.50 a month-but there's quite a bit you can do for free. I used to have an ID number and password-that's right, the site is old enough that it once didn't use email or another social account for login-that have long since been deactivated. Instead, I created a new account and started rebuilding my profile for my high schools and even went so far as to add my junior high and grade schools.Scanning directories for my old schools, I was shocked by how little had changed. Class list interfaces still feature alumni names, years, and icons for location (a globe), story (a notepad), current photo (camera), and a link to their yearbook photo.Classmates' best feature is the yearbooks. It has tomes featuring pimple-faced teens going back to 1885. The catalog is not complete, but I found entire yearbooks for both of my graduating classes. One scan was poorly done, but the other was virtually perfect. This was especially meaningful for me since I left the Colorado high school I attended for three years right before senior year. As a result, I never saw my class yearbook and lacked any good way to walk down memory lane with classmates I'd known since grade school.The site is so out of date, though, that it offers no obvious way to go full-screen with the yearbooks and zoom in on a page. I discovered the counterintuitive solution: If I used Microsoft Edge to zoom out on the webpage, the yearbook image got larger.It was a wonderful rabbit hole, full of so much nostalgia and long-forgotten memories of people, teachers, clubs, and places. So many faces I hadn't seen in almost 40 years, frozen in time.Classmates is now marginally a social media site. It's there for you to build or rebuild connections, but without the stress of opinions, ideology, or minute-by-minute updates. My time there felt like visiting a library where all the books were dusty but familiar.After poring over hundreds of pages and countless familiar faces, and with my nostalgia appetite sated, I took note of a handful of Classmates guestbook alerts in my inbox. To see the names of those who expressed a passing interest in me, however, I'd have to pay.I appreciated the attention, and then thought that if they cared to reconnect, they'd probably seek me out on Facebook.Thanks for the memories, Classmates.",https://miro.medium.com/max/5252/0*z2rG6qPvRCClS3Sn,https://debugger.medium.com/classmates-at-26-where-have-you-been-e89228e941e6,social-media,278ac589de15ea680f8903f67cff7796953e3ff7018360904c1265e0
Afraid To Travel Where You Don't Speak The Language?,"Recently someone told me: ""I'm very uncomfortable at the idea of travelling to a country where I don't speak the language. It happened to me before, and I felt incapable and vulnerable. You've been in so many places where you did not speak any local language. How did you deal with that?""I certainly have been in many places where people don't understand me - and not just places that are non-English speaking. I've been in the United States and I was speaking very fast and drunkenly in my native Yorkshire accent and no one had a clue to what I was saying - even though I was technically speaking the same language as they did.I have also had real challenges in a country like China, where the language is so different.I was in a restaurant asking for what I thought meant ""rice"" and they would look at me and repeat the word as if they did not understand. I'd say it again, they'd repeat it - and this went on for five minutes. Until their faces lit up and they said the word again in a way that, to me, sounded exactly like what I had been saying - but which apparently sounded entirely different to their ears.Even after four weeks in China, I would be at a train station trying to decipher Chinese writing - where is the train to Shanghai? - and in any other country, I'd look for the words that say ""Shanghai"". But in China, I was thinking ""do those two symbols mean that this is the train to Shanghai, or do they mean that this is a train to Guangzhou?"" ""Do those two other symbols mean 'go this way to where the restaurants are', or 'go this way to the toilet'? Or, go this way to where my train is about to depart?"" It was absolutely baffling.Yes, it can be frustrating and uncomfortable. In many places around the world I have also felt vulnerable, incapable, incompetent. This is something unwanted, something that is not necessarily positive about the travel experience. But when I look back on those occasions, I always laugh and I always have a good memory of them.Because at the time yes, it is frustrating and it is challenging, but imagine a world where everybody spoke the same language - how boring would that be?I really love the diversity of languages on our planet. It's one of the things that make it so beautiful. I love how there are a thousand languages in Africa. I love how languages like Basque and Gaelic are being kept alive.Imagine a monotone culture where the whole world only speaks English. Will that be better for us? I don't think so.I think part of the discovery, part of the connection, is this communication with people who do not necessarily speak our language. For me - maybe for you as well - it's entirely possible to have more in common with somebody on the other side of the world who does not speak our language, than with the person who lives next door to us, who may speak our language but have completely different interests, tastes, culture and ideas.Personally, I feel I have more in common with many people who are all around the world than with people who are in my hometown. I can communicate with the people in my hometown on a language level, they can understand the words I say. But I feel they do not understand the ideas I have. When travelling, part of the connection I'm looking for is a connection of ideas, and that can come with people who do not speak the same language.Once I did a wonderful hiking trip to Colca Canyon in Peru. There was a Chilean couple, and mostly I was speaking with them - though they did not speak a word of English, and at that time, I didn't speak a word of Spanish. On top of that, Chilean is a very complicated Spanish to understand if you don't speak Spanish.Yet we had the most amazing two days, by the end of which I and this new friend, Jorge, completely understood each other - even though we never shared a single word of a common language.That has happened to me in many places across the world. Because communication is not just about the language we speak - it is about how we act, the ideas we have. It is also about how we try to communicate.And I found that as human beings, we want to make a connection with other people, with like-minded people. And 99% of the time, we're open to try and make that connection.So when I speak to somebody in a Chinese restaurant and ask for rice, it may take five minutes for the person in the restaurant to bring the rice, but we made it, we communicated. I got my rice, we made a connection, we had a laugh about it. Yes, it was frustrating. It would be better if I could get the rice in a minute, but - that's life. That's communication. That's what we do.I'd really encourage you not to think too much about how language can be a barrier that makes us feel uncomfortable. Think rather how language can be a part of how we make a new connection with another person.If everybody in the world spoke English, we'd have a very superficial culture. Everybody would understand each other in some way, but deep down we would still be completely different. So when we travel to new places, language can be a barrier - but for me, it's just a barrier to overcome. And when we overcome it, there is much to discover on the other side.So how do I deal with it? Well, I just go with it. Because I know that even if you don't speak my language, I have a bigger connection with you - who are into travel, and have similar ideas to mine - than with the people of the place where I'm from. They speak my language right down to every single nuance. But do they get me? I'm not sure.By Stephen Bailey.

Big Oil's Undemocratic Advantage You've Probably Never Heard Of,"We can't waste any more time addressing the global warming issue we're facing. The amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere are rising to dangerous levels. Nevertheless, due to political conflicts of interest, governments are slow to act. Moreover, the US is not exactly one of the frontrunners in fighting climate change. That's a shame because the US's wealth and resources could prove pivotal in global climate action.There are many ways we can contribute to a better environment ourselves, however. One approach is to use our pensions and wealth to help steer the big oil companies into falling in line with the Paris agreement's ambitions (reducing our GHG emissions by 50 percent by 2030 compared to 1990).In Europe, small-time investors can get an audience at the annual general meetings (AGMs) for shareholders. Surprisingly, this is hardly possible in the US. Through extensive lobbying with the Trump administration, oil companies structurally undermined the effectiveness of the US democracy.Can we do something about this as ordinary citizens? Or do we need intervention by the new government?And how did this happen?Shareholder activism by (institutional) investors and NGOs alike has picked up a lot of steam over the past few years. Activist shareholders buy ownership in a company to change the strategy for various reasons, but usually to generate more profit.For oil companies to remain profitable, they need to pivot away from fossil fuels to green alternatives. The goal of big oil needs to change from fossil fuel producers to energy providers. Unfortunately, large oil corporations' senior management remains unwilling to change course without either external intervention by governments or internal ""encouragement"" of shareholders.In Europe, NGOs such as Follow-This are filing climate resolutions at AGMs. They buy shares with donations or ask for proxy-votes of other shareholders, essentially lending voting power. Using the shares, the NGOs gain the right to attend AGMs and request voting on corporate strategy and the board of directors' appointment. Shareholder voting is a democratic process in Europe, as it should be. That means that if you get enough votes, the company has no choice but to adjust its strategy.As you can see from the following chart from Follow-This, they're getting increasingly successful in getting other (institutional) investors and shareholders on board:I figured that if they're able to get more and more votes for climate resolutions at AGMs in Europe, that should also work for US companies, right?Well, it turns out this is not the case. Apparently, the power of shareholders over senior management has been undercut by the US government. A slap in the face of democracy, as all people should be able to make their voice heard. The arguments presented by the government are both irrational and laughable. I'll continue with that next.Under the Trump administration, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) supported big oil companies such as Exxon Mobil to reject shareholder voting on climate resolutions because:Say what? Apparently, discussing the strategy of a company in which you have ownership is micromanaging? Saving the climate and determining the strategy sounds like macromanaging to me. I find it remarkable that the Republican party, always proud to reduce the government's influence, is interfering with the inherently democratic process of shareholder voting. Why is this happening?In 2021, Follow-This is also planning to introduce climate resolutions to US-based company Chevron, where they previously focused on European companies. Corporate lawyers are already getting ready for battle, aiming again to refuse shareholder voting. Again, comparable arguments are used:I hope that Biden will make good on his promise to fight climate change. Let's also hope that the newly appointed chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, will act decisively to prevent shareholder voting on climate action from being blocked.More articles by Martin van Duyse:",https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*FP1Y6p-VTqc4IL0oXS1khg.jpeg,https://medium.com/climate-conscious/big-oils-undemocratic-advantage-you-ve-probably-never-heard-of-189120f7e4c7,economy,284bdcc45f50af4c884158990ba7ff498535a16219b09393e6e323d1

Nine Tips for Travelling as a Disabled Woman.,"by guest writer Elvy.It was summer of 2016 when I found myself stranded alone, somewhere in Denmark with the train station staff telling me there was no way I was getting ramp assistance to get my wheelchair onto the train I needed. The famous ""we need at least 24 hours notice"" line was relayed (because why would disabled people want to be spontaneous like everyone else). Slightly panicked and mentally going through different scenarios in my head, I saw three men on the platform and a light bulb went on. I approached them and asked them to help carry me and my very heavy powered wheelchair onto the train. Now, I wouldn't recommend this, but desperate times call for desperate measures. It was either that, or spend my first night solo travelling in a train station.A few solo trips and years later, I can't help but reflect on my experience of travelling alone as a disabled woman.Travelling alone is one thing, travelling alone as a woman is another, and adding disability to that mix gives you a beautiful concoction of scenarios and lessons learnt. Having muscular dystrophy means that I have general muscle weakness and I use a powered wheelchair to glide around, so planning a solo trip requires a lot more thought and creativity than a non-disabled traveller.The global impact of the Coronavirus pandemic has particularly been felt in the travel industry. Whilst many countries are open for travel, many have varying levels of restrictions and lockdowns and it is worth noting that travel may be very limited at this time. It's important to prioritise your safety, and this article is meant to inspire and bring hope about the possibility of more travel adventures in the future.But taking a step back, the decision to travel alone is a big decision for any person. With some hope for the future of travel slowly creeping in, I can't help but reflect on my previous experiences and how these will help me in my future planning. If you've ever caught yourself thinking about travelling alone, but then stopped yourself for whatever reason, here are some lessons I've learnt over the years that continue to give me the push and confidence to just go for it.No two disabilities are the same and this is worth bearing in mind when reading up on ""accessible travel"".The psychological aspect of solo travelling is often underestimated, yet can sometimes be the main reason people choose not to solo travel. We often think of the practicalities, which of course matter just as much, (especially when we're talking about travelling as a disabled person), however, I found the psychological aspects just as important as the physical planning. Below are a few tips that will help you think about travelling alone:Solo travelling with creativity and planning can really be a life changing experience for everyone.Whilst we as disabled women have to take extra steps to enjoy things that society refuses to include us in, the more of us that are out there challenging these barriers and making sure we're seen, the more progress we can hopefully make in making travel more safe and inclusive.Happy travels!Elvy is a London based disabled blogger whose focus is on disabled travel, dating and lifestyle.

Therapy Made Me a Better Man,"Three things, right off the bat:Whew. There, I said it. It gets easier each time. Like a lot of millennial dudes, I grew up in a pervasive culture of toxic masculinity. Modeled by the behavior of my abusive father, I equated strength with a stoic demeanor. I thought ""being a man"" involved an unwillingness to reflect upon or talk about my emotions (or to have any, really), never asking for help, and always appearing calm and in control. To never be vulnerable was the pinnacle of manhood.When life got hard, I thought the right thing to do was to stifle those vulnerabilities - to create an internal dialogue of shame so that I might force my weaknesses away from the surface. I believed that thinking about my trauma would allow it to take hold of me, spreading it like an uncontrolled fire throughout my mind. As a young man, I equated this possibility with failure on an existential level, with the death of my masculinity.And it wasn't just from my dad. The culture of this stony and cruel toxicity came at me from every direction. When I was growing up, in pop culture the archetypal hero was male, yoked as hell, infinitely cool under pressure, and his strength was exhibited by his willingness to deploy effective violence and brutality against his enemies. In the news, we saw U.S. soldiers deployed to the Middle East uplifted as heroes, willing to do the grim work others would not, putting themselves in harm's way - and most importantly, never complaining.We believed that this was a man's duty: righteous violence without complaint. Over and over, the world taught me and my guy friends that this was how guys saved the day. This was the standard we should aspire toward. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the T-1000, a literal robot killing machine doing the violent work that needed to be done, saving the women and children while looking cool as hell, always calm, giving a thumbs-up as his body is charred by a vat of molten lava.I went through life the way you'd expect someone with unaddressed trauma and an unreflective, brute-force approach to problems would. Long stretches of outward calm where inner turmoil ravaged under the surface and inevitably blew up later. My interpersonal relationships were characterized by extended stints of my emotional unavailability peppered with fiery outbursts.The parts where I was quiet about what was bothering me - that's when I thought I was doing well. I convinced myself the outbursts were small hiccups, failures at meeting the disciplined standard of the stoic strong man ideal. Each time I resolved to do better, to not let it happen again. Repeatedly, I hurt people and hurt myself with this inability to analyze my thoughts and behaviors through the right framework.Therapy, of course, struck me as a complete absurdity. I couldn't imagine something weaker - to spend one's time bitching about one's problems, rather than doing something about them. How unmanly. Maybe it's for some people, I'd say, but not for me. I thought therapy was where broken people went to try and become less broken. Can you imagine the T-1000 laying down on a sofa and talking about his woes? Ha.At some point, wrought by failed relationships, changing cultural attitudes toward self-growth and the destigmatization of mental health, as well as an increasingly utilitarian approach to my chronic depression, I decided, ""what the fuck, I'll give it a go."" I'd spent decades doing it the other way and it wasn't working. With a majority of my days characterized by depressive fogs, despair, and confusion about how this came to be, I figured therapy probably couldn't make anything worse. After some headaches with my insurance company and a number of back-and-forth phone calls that very nearly made me bail on the whole thing, I set up my first appointment and went.I didn't know what to expect. There was a sofa; that I half-expected. I joked about laying down on it. I joked a lot those first few sessions, before my anxious energy finally aimed at doing the real work, before I knew what the hell that was. The therapist - my therapist, which feels fun and a bit comforting to say now - asked me some good questions, figured out where my headspace was, helped me thaw. We set some targets. This jived with my pragmatic sense. Little by little, one session at a time, the endeavor seemed less like pointless bitching and more like purposeful reflection.I opened up. We talked about childhood trauma and developmental outcomes. I remember thinking, yeah, shit happened to me, but I came out okay. It doesn't bother me much. I didn't realize until later how much of the emotions were just buried as a way to cope and function. I remember my complete surprise at my own tears coming down my face, my utter shock when my throat tightened and I found myself unable to speak, my astonishment at how relieved I felt afterward. How long had I been carrying that invisible weight?In analyzing trends from past relationships, I was introduced to the entire framework of Attachment Theory. Suddenly a whole lot of decisions and dynamics in my life made a lot of sense. It was cathartic. I continued doing the work outside of sessions, reading books and diving deeper, doing mindfulness meditation, keeping a journal, turning an unflinching spotlight onto my thoughts and feelings and behaviors. Celebrating small moments. Wanting to be better. Bit by grueling bit, doing it.I should clarify - this shit is not easy. In many ways, life is even harder than before I began. I've learned that progress is not linear, that the rational understanding of an unhealthy framework or maladaptive schema is not at all the same thing as overcoming it, that there are some moments that will fill you with a sense of such rage-inducing powerlessness that you wish you could just do a factory reset of your brain. But these are good things to understand, even if one must learn them the hard way.Therapy is not about ""fixing"" ourselves, and the people who go are not ""broken."" There isn't some perfect expression of the optimal human mind from which we are all deficient in various ways and to which we all aspire. But therapy can be a useful pillar of support for a reflective life in which we care about working hard at understanding ourselves and the ways we interact with and comprehend the world around us. The ways we cope and grow.I've learned that abandonment trauma and my insecurities don't make me inherently undeserving of love. I've learned that my thoughts, emotions, and behaviors can be understood, analyzed, improved. I've learned the incredible importance of re-parenting my inner child, of becoming his enduring caretaker, of the joy and pain of that journey. I've learned how all this reduces needless suffering in my life and in the lives of those around me. Hell, I'm happy just to have learned new vocabulary - schema and insecure attachment and everything else - so that I'm empowered to describe myself, others, and our relationships better.Most of all, I've learned that going to therapy doesn't make me weak or broken. It makes me vulnerable, but I understand now how a willingness to be vulnerable is a vital component of strength. My growth has instilled in me proper respect for the damage that can be caused by the unexamined life, even if we mean well. Therapy has provided a way for me to peel off all the conditioning from warped societal values and a difficult childhood so that I might become what I've really wanted to be all along.A strong man.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/0*YyNa13RJNHZ86-xx,https://mguevarra.medium.com/therapy-made-me-a-better-man-ab944bde78ff,mental-health,371a62f86d3a864b69b9da679aab6e356d31e85b89cdd0e2ae4d1100

The COVID economy is unlike anything we expected at the start of 2020. By this past summer, 10 million American workers were giving up on returning to their last employer. These losses were four times more likely to hit hourly workers than those who received a salary, and many hourly workers who did return to their old job saw their hours reduced.These issues are incredibly stressful for hard-working people looking to provide for themselves and their families. But while people are understandably worried about putting food on the table and keeping a roof over their heads, left-leaning politicians and pundits are making a case for additional expansion of the social welfare net. Yet as much as we need short-term government aid to get through this crisis - and we do need it - government aid can only be good for the country in the short term.When the government spends money to support the unemployed, it's a Band-Aid, not a sustainable solution. With jobs scarce and millions looking to the government for help, we tend to overvalue what government can do. Socialism starts to sound appealing, but as Margaret Thatcher once said, the ""trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.""The only power the government has right now is to buy the American worker some time. So, where can we turn for sustainable opportunity and meaningful hope? Where will the new jobs come from?Virtually all net new jobs - where real growth lives - come from new businesses, not from existing businesses that, in general, only create enough jobs to offset the ones that established companies are losing, and not from the government. In my opinion, economic recovery will come when the millions who have lost their jobs find new ones at thousands of new companies that will be hiring.Who will create those new businesses? Entrepreneurs. Those stubborn risk-takers who make use of the free market to offer a new product, deliver something familiar in a new way or make it available where it wasn't before. Those are the people who will be hiring, and the wages they pay and the materials they buy will help the economy heal itself, lifting us all.This should not be news. Entrepreneurship is the engine of growth everywhere. This is the magic of the free market. Free enterprise works for all of us - a rising tide lifts all boats. But entrepreneurs as a group have not communicated this crucial idea well enough.Read more: Why stop at a SPAC? Colin Kaepernick should have a mutual fundOne thing I learned as an entrepreneur is that marketing is essential. You may have a great idea - like offering $8 stock trades to investors when they always expected to pay much more - but if you don't get the word out about your innovative approach, your customers will never find you.Entrepreneurs have not done a good job of getting the word out about the essential role new businesses and free enterprise play in reviving a down economy. Because many people are uninformed on this point, when they see a new business open in hard times, they may think that the founder is crazy. If that business does well, and the entrepreneur prospers, people may even feel like that prosperity is inequitable or unfair. But every new business that thrives will benefit its community.We ought to feel good when we see new businesses opening and entrepreneurs succeeding. We should support new ventures and consider whether we could be part of one, too. If you're out of work yourself, your new job will probably come thanks to an entrepreneur. If you're a waiter whose restaurant has closed or a performer who's lost their venue, look to the entrepreneur who can reimagine a restaurant that works in a COVID world or a performance space viable in these changing times.And to those potential entrepreneurs who hesitate to start a company in a slow and unpredictable economy, who say, ""This is not the time,"" I say, look out! You're missing the boat! Entrepreneurs find opportunities by taking advantage of change, including the changes we don't like - economic decline, a pandemic, political uncertainty.During the 1970s, while the economy struggled, the stock market dived, and our politics was a mess, I built Ameritrade because I saw the chance to take advantage of stock trading deregulation to offer people a better deal. My new business grew to employ 10,000 people. That same decade saw the rise of Apple, FedEx, Microsoft, and Oracle.Look back to the Great Recession of 2008 to 2010. The world seemed to be ending, but some entrepreneurs risked starting something new, and their employees had the courage to take jobs at companies their families had never heard of. Some of those companies were Uber, WhatsApp, Venmo, and Instagram.I realize that starting a new business is intimidating. It's scarier than jumping off a cliff. So rather than looking to the federal government for more handouts, we could ask the federal government not to tax new companies in their first five years. The practical loss of revenue would be small because most startups reinvest their earnings back in the business, so they don't make a profit the government can tax. But the announcement of this pro-startup tax policy would help create a national focus on starting new businesses now when we need them.I know times are hard. I also know that Americans will respond with creativity and grit, as we always do. There is even a name for it - ""survival entrepreneurship,"" as noted by Rich Karlgaard on Forbes earlier this year. Economists tell us that the businesses founded by those who must succeed to survive, such as businesses founded by immigrants, often have a better chance of success. They have to be.Jobs will come back as long as our free enterprise system allows entrepreneurs to build new businesses. We can survive and, in time, prosper again. Look to the entrepreneurs - or become one yourself.Joe Ricketts is an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and founder of TD Ameritrade.This is an opinion column.

Be the Leader to Create More Leaders,"The term ""leader"" can be problematic. Some of us hear the word a lot but we don't necessarily know what it means. As a leadership coach, I help people find their strengths and unique voice to perform better at work, develop stronger relationships, and amplify their growth + impact at the organization. Yet I also hear from many people that they're not leaders because:One of the most important parts of leadership is the relationships you cultivate. The most important one being the relationship with yourself. In context of relationships, leadership is:If you're not sure what lights you up or what constitutes a good leader, think about the bosses you've had in your life. Which one of them was a fantastic boss? What part of their leadership would you like to incorporate into yours?It may be more common to remember bad bosses. Can you think of all your terrible, micromanaging bosses and the things you hated about them? What parts of their leadership do you want to stay away from? You can use these examples from your life, and more importantly, your reaction to these bosses to define your leadership values and what lights you up.One of the best bosses I ever had gave me two pieces of leadership advice:1. Hire people smarter than you and who think differently than you. 2. Create more leaders around you to work yourself out of a job.You want a smart, diverse team to be able to see your way around problems and find innovative, creative solutions. You want to work yourself out of a job so that you develop your team and create other leaders. This allows you to go on vacation without worries, remove yourself from being the bottleneck, and also start succession planning. Working yourself out of a job eventually opens up enough space for you to find different activities and scope that light you up and then... you're on the path of working yourself into a new job.There are two key ways to start creating more leaders: Delegation and Asking for Help.We often become leaders because we get very good at accomplishing things, whether it's executing on projects/processes, working with people, or contributing to the organization at some larger level. Over time, as highly performant people, we get to a stage where if we hold on to every single thing, we get overwhelmed and overworked-there is always more work to do. Yes, there is the process of prioritization which we all try to do. And sometimes there is still too much very important work to get done.This is where delegation comes in.As a leader, you know what lights you up and you know what lights up the people around you. Be a matchmaker and stop doing the things that don't light you up. Instead, give them to the people who want more opportunity, especially if it lines up with what lights them up.It's hard to delegate. You have to give up your control and your one right way of doing things. And it's this process of letting go, of eliminating the certainty of doing it yourself, that provides autonomy and creates more leaders. You can put in guardrails. You can help the person with defining the goals/outcomes and teach them how you've done the thing. However, give them some autonomy to do it in their own way and provide both the support to let them succeed and the space to let them make mistakes and learn.Part of the leadership process is to SEE/DO/TEACH. You first observe someone else doing it, or do your own third party research to figure out an unknown thing. Next you do it yourself. Figure out what works for you, learn from your mistakes and from others around you. Finally, teach it to someone else. See what resonates for them and what confuses them. Try telling them another way until it clicks. Watch them as they do it themselves, and provide the support they ask for. SEE/DO/TEACH cements the continuous learning process.For many people who follow the servant leadership philosophy and who exist to support their teams and others around them, asking for help can be difficult. Yet, can you think of the last couple of times when someone asked you for help and you were so excited and eager to say YES because the help was easy for you to do, it was something that lights you up, and it genuinely felt good to help someone else?Asking someone else for help is offering them a gift.If you know what lights them up, you will always strengthen the relationship. Asking for help shows your vulnerability, acknowledges their expertise, and overall builds more trust in the relationship.Leaders can stop doing everything themselves and create more leaders around them by asking for help.We may not always think of ourselves as a leader, and that's OK. We can continue to do the work to become more of a leader both personally and professionally. Start delegating and asking for help to be the leader who creates more leaders.Hello!

10 Must-Know Python Topics for Data Science,"Python is dominating the data science ecosystem. What I think the top two reasons for such dominance are being relatively easy to learn and the rich selection of data science libraries.Python is a general purpose language so it is not just for data science. Web development, mobile application and game development are some use cases for Python.If you are using Python only for data science related tasks, you do not have to be a Python expert. However, there are some core concepts and features that I think you must have in your possession.What we cover in this article is not library-specific. They can be considered as base Python for data science. Even if you are only using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, you need to have a comprehensive understanding of Python basics. Such libraries assume you are familiar with Python basics.I will briefly explain each topic with a few examples and also provide a link to a detailed article for most of the topics.Functions are building blocks in Python. They take zero or more arguments and return a value. We create a function using the def keyword.Here is a simple function that multiplies two numbers.Here is another example that evaluates a word based on its length.Functions should accomplish a single task. Creating a function that performs a series of tasks defy the purpose of using functions.We should also assign descriptive names to functions so we have an idea of what it does without seeing the code.When we define a function, we specify its parameters. When a function is called, it must be provided with the values for the required parameters. The values for parameters are also known as arguments.Consider the multiply function created in the previous step. It has two parameters so we provide values for these parameters when the function is called.When a function is called, values for positional arguments must be given. Otherwise, we will get an error. If we do not specify the value for a keyword argument, it takes the default value.Let's redefine the multiply function with keyword arguments so we can see the difference.Functions are building blocks in Python. They take zero or more arguments and return a value. Python is pretty flexible in terms of how arguments are passed to a function. The *args and **kwargs make it easier and cleaner to handle arguments.Here is a simple example:By default, **kwargs is an empty dictionary. Each undefined keyword argument is stored as a key-value pair in the **kwargs dictionary.Here is a simple example:Object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm is built around the idea of having objects that belong to a particular type. In a sense, the type is what explains us the object.Everything in Python is an object of a type such as integers, lists, dictionaries, functions and so on. We define a type of object using classes.Classes possess the following information:List is a built-in data structure in Python. It is represented as a collection of data points in square brackets. Lists can be used to store any data type or a mixture of different data types.Lists are mutable which is one of the reasons why they are so commonly used. Thus, we can remove and add items. It is also possible to update the items of a list.Here are a few examples on how to create and modify a list.List comprehension is basically creating lists based on other iterables such as lists, tuples, sets, and so on. It can also be described as representing for and if loops with a simpler and more appealing syntax. List comprehensions are relatively faster than for loops.Here is a simple list comprehension that creates a list from another list based on a given condition.The following list comprehension applies a function to the items in another list.Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each entry has a key and value. A dictionary can be considered as a list with special index.The keys must be unique and immutable. So we can use strings, numbers (int or float), or tuples as keys. Values can be of any type.Consider a case where we need to store grades of students. We can either store them in a dictionary or a list.One way to create a dictionary is writing key-value pairs in curly braces.We can access a value in a dictionary using its key.A set is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects. This is the definition of a set in the official Python documentation. Let's open it up.We can create a set by putting objects separated by a comma in curly braces.Sets do not contain repeated elements so even if we try to add same elements more than once, the resulting set will contain unique elements.Tuple is a collection of values separated by comma and enclosed in parenthesis. Unlike lists, tuples are immutable. The immutability can be considered as the identifying feature of tuples.Tuples consist of values in parenthesis and separated by comma.We can also create tuples without using the parenthesis. A sequence of values separated by comma will create a tuple.One of the most common use cases of tuples is with functions that return multiple values.Lambda expressions are special forms of functions. In general, lambda expressions are used without a name.Consider the following function that returns the square of a given number.The equivalent lambda expression is:Consider an operation that needs to be done once or very few times. Furthermore, we have many variations of this operation which are slightly different than the original one. In such case, it is not ideal to define a separate function for each operation. Instead, lambda expressions provide a much more efficient way of accomplishing the tasks.We have covered some key concepts and topics of Python. Most data science related tasks are done through third-party libraries and frameworks such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and so on.However, we should have a comprehensive understanding of basic operations and concepts of Python in order to efficiently use such libraries. They assume you are familiar with the basics of Python.Thank you for reading.

How to Stay Focused,"This week, in anticipation of the second session of Life of Focus, I've been sharing lessons about centering your life back onto what matters. For those who missed the previous lessons, check them out here.Today, for the final lesson, I want to talk not about making changes, but about making them last.Productivity is especially prone to bursts of enthusiasm followed by burnout. You get an idea for a new working routine, schedule or system. Maybe you even stick with it for a couple weeks. But, before long, everything has regressed.How can you make focus last?Part of the problem is simply that the initial commitment to focus needs to be long enough, to have a chance to sustain long-term habits. One reason Cal and I chose to make Life of Focus a three-month course was to give students the time to build a solid foundation.Studies of habit changing bear this out. While twenty-one or thirty days is often cited as the ""correct"" time to make a new habit, researchers that studied this found the average was actually over sixty days.[1] And this was only an average, harder habits required almost a year before they felt effortless.The lesson is simple: if you care about making a change in your life last long-term, you need to make it a priority for your life for more than a few weeks.It's true that time makes a big difference in the transition between new ways of life. The reason willpower is needed initially is that the old behavioral patterns get triggered automatically, and they require conscious reflection to override.Yet, I would argue that this is actually not the most important factor in whether a change lasts.Instead, the problem is that most new systems we dream up and implement for our lives are actually broken. They have broken parts that snag when we try to use them. With effort, you can use them for a while. But eventually they break down and you retreat back to an easier default.Let's look at a concrete example: A few years ago, I decided I was using Twitter too much. I'm off it now, but at the time it mattered for my work and so I didn't want to drop it entirely. What should I do?My first plan was simply to limit my total time for checking the service. I installed Leechblock on my computer and had it shut off the website whenever I used it for more than five minutes in a four-hour period. Now I'm only able to use it for around half and hour per day, which was about how much time I thought was appropriate. Good idea, right?For awhile this worked. Except, I found myself frustrated when I would open up a browser, try to check the website and it was blocked. This happened often enough, that one day, a couple months after I started, I simply removed all the restrictions.What went wrong?My plan wasn't unsophisticated. It even lasted for a few months, which is much better than most people's half-hearted promises to ""use my phone less."" Yet it didn't last.In retrospect, one of the major problems was simply that the context for checking Twitter was never restricted. Since any moment in the day could potentially be a time to check (as long as I hadn't used up my five minutes), then checking was always salient. The impulse was always there and this created a snag that pulled at my plans.These days I'm not using Twitter at all. But suppose I did want to keep up about twenty minutes a day for work purposes, what system could have worked better?If I had decided, instead of random five-minute intervals, to enable Twitter only at very specific times a day (say right after work or during lunch), then my impulse to check the service would be more likely restricted to those contexts.The decision of when to check social media (or even whether to use it in the first place) may seem trivial. Certainly such a small difference can't matter much?A small snag may not matter if its only encountered once. But repeated every day, for months at a time, and even small differences in friction can grind your plans to a halt.This suggests a change in mindset is required. Willpower and motivation matter, certainly. But in the long-run they're eclipsed by making the correct design choices.In the last homework for this lesson series, I want you to consider your own plans for focus. How are you trying to guide your attention? What are the systems that allow you to do that?Try this:In Life of Focus, we guide you through a process of redesigning the systems that govern what you pay attention to and why. All of this, of course, is to give you more power over how you spend your time and energy - back onto things that you really care about.On Monday, Cal and I will be opening registration for the second session of Life of Focus. I hope you'll join us!",https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*RPGYWnmYXXSQATVY.png,https://scotthyoung.medium.com/how-to-stay-focused-709a22a81e71,productivity,0481c1d8b6421d16693c76b365eb60e90150b6a81897522a12975e0f
Don't Wait: 5 Ways to Jump-Start a Career Change,"My husband and I spent a few weeks binging on Shark Tank, admiring all the intrepid entrepreneurs risking their life savings on an idea. They were so sure their product or service would succeed that they were willing to risk it all.There are many stories of start-ups that began from nothing, often selling their wares out of their cars or garages.My husband and I have been firmly entrenched in the middle-class category, making an average teaching salary in the U.S. and internationally. We always felt we could do more, but we never felt confident to take a risk on an idea.Somewhat unexpectedly, I have made a career shift that has left me unsure, excited, and nervous. Instead of relying on my comfortable teaching salary, I am finally doing what I have always wanted to do - research and write.It's taken me years to have the guts to try to make it as a writer, and I have spent hours making excuses for why I could never make it.The conditions were never right. It took my husband telling me at one point, ""You just have to grind it out. Put it in the work. Don't wait for the right time.""For most people who start a new business or try to make it as a freelancer, the conditions are never perfect. Sometimes we embark on a career change because we have to, and sometimes we create a business out of a garage out of necessity.Either way, it is your responsibility to create your own conditions for success.The hardest part of making a career switch is starting something new. It feels foreign to go to work in a new place or venture into previously unknown territory.I have been paralyzed with the overwhelming situation of too many decisions when deciding how to embark on a writing career.I spent hours reading articles about blogging, freelancing, creating websites, and making money. Each of these topics created a spiral of information that would suck me into the depths of the internet.When I resurfaced, I was positive that all of this newness was not for me. I knew that WordPress was better for a website, but the learning curve was too steep. I knew that selling my writing would require learning about marketing and SEO, but I was too nervous to try.Ultimately, entrepreneurs and freelancers spend too much time learning about their idea before actually buckling down and just doing it.If I want to be a writer, then I need to write. That's where I start.If you want to sell something, then you need to sell it. That's it.Ultimately, I decided to make a list of priorities for my new career. I made a list of short- and long-term goals that listed all of the directions I could go but didn't need to at this very moment.I put onto paper the many, many ideas I have had, saving them for when I would be ready to move in a particular direction.The first priority for any new workday is to write. Even if I don't submit a piece or have a particularly strong outline. I sit down, and I write. That's my first task. The other tasks, like marketing on social media or searching for new freelance opportunities, come second. Writing is the skill I need to grow first.If you want to try something new, try it. Don't become paralyzed by the fear of ""what if"" one year or five years down the road. Just start. That's the first step.As a researcher and overall curious person, I like to know everything there is to know about something before I commit.This means I spend too much time Googling and not enough time producing content. There is danger in information overload.It can cause us to second-guess our intentions, especially when we read conflicting advice.When I begin researching relentlessly on a topic, such as building a website, I become so overwhelmed with choices that I have to close my laptop and walk away.This means I have lost the opportunity to produce a great piece of writing because I was researching something that I didn't yet need.Your productivity will be affected by information overload. We all experience this with social media, work emails, and advertisements encroaching on our brains all at once.After deciding to just start already, it is just as important to avoid too much information that detracts from the primary task at hand.One way I combat information overload is to create lists and goals that I refer to when I open my laptop to work.I use Google Keep to organize my notes and ideas, and I never start working until I review what I am trying to accomplish.Keeping track of short- and long-term goals, as well as a prioritized To-Do list, keeps me from getting sidetracked by items that can be completed after I have finished writing for the day.Finding time to start something new seems impossible. But there is time; there is always time. It's up to you to prioritize how you choose to spend your time.It seems obvious that we should schedule our work time, but this can be hard to do when starting a brand-new business venture or freelancing job.I was becoming overwhelmed with all of the tasks I wanted to complete, feeling like I didn't have enough hours in the day.I commented to my husband that I needed to add another 40-hour workweek to my calendar to accomplish my goals.I now diligently schedule the times when I will write or work on other tasks, using Google Keep and Calendar to keep me honest.I know when I will do my writing next week, and I know when I will spend time on other tasks such as building an audience and updating social media.It's easy to engage in off-task behaviors when starting something that is different from your usual work schedule.It's vital to have a plan, and organizing your day, week, month, and even year can help keep you on track.Without my schedule, I would be lost. I need the calendar to help me achieve my goals.You can't wait until someone hands you thousands of dollars to start a business. Waiting for this possibility is unlikely to happen.It is crucial to take baby steps when beginning a new business venture. It can be tempting to go all-in, borrowing hefty amounts of money to finance a new venture.Shark Tank often advised contestants to start small and avoid taking large loans. They congratulated those who were able to grow their companies without much debt.My husband is interested in starting a YouTube channel, but we had a discussion about the items he would need. Of course, he would love a fancy camera and all the high-tech equipment, but the reality is that he could start with an iPhone and grow from there.Often those who are waiting for the right conditions become concerned with not having the ""stuff"" to start.Starting small with what you have will give you the room to grow without accumulating financial stress.Start with a small investment or product before diving into something that can quickly become too large to handle.It is possible to start with less. Waiting for someone to hand you thousands of dollars to fund your idea can be futile. Start with less and grow to more.It can be difficult to manage your time, money, and ideas without clocking in and making money for someone else. Knowing that you are now in charge can create a ""helpless"" mindset that is hard to overcome.At first, I felt a little lost as I learned to navigate a day of relative freedom and autonomy. I quickly realized that to be successful, I had to behave as if I was answering to a ""boss"" - even if it's just myself.This means using a calendar to schedule work activities and holding myself accountable to a personal to-do list.As a former teacher, I was used to someone telling me where I had to be, when I had to be there, and what I had to do while I was there.Now, as a writer, I have to make my own hours and decisions. It's up to me to create my career; I can't rely on anyone else.Taking the reins of your professional life is daunting, but waiting for someone else to do it for you creates an unnecessary waiting game.As cliche as it might sound, you are responsible for your own destiny. If you want a new career or job, then it's up to you to do it. This means taking a risk and creating the conditions to be successful.Caroline Castrillon, Forbes states: ""You keep saying to yourself, 'I want to be my own boss' or 'I want to work for myself.' Yet, you continue to convince yourself that it's either too late, too expensive, too crazy, or maybe just too risky compared to your seemingly 'secure' a corporate job."" -Subscribe to the Weekly Recap of my articles on Medium.",https://miro.medium.com/max/11520/1*9bYj4ir7l4QBu-sRRPNliQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/swlh/dont-wait-5-ways-to-jump-start-a-career-change-bc6215d2c96d,freelancing,500d95e6d32d5ade8f9de6ff6c75e7973094b4229e812bee36bbf40b
Will The Warmind Rasputin Return In 'Destiny 2'?,"Darkness is on our doorstep! This rumbling tundra of black has returned having had a taste of humanities demise during the first collapse. Whatever the reason may be it wants more but why?Towards the end of (Season of the Worthy) Darkness Pyramids entered into our solar system there was no warning or sign of their presence, until Eris Morn awoke a dormant Pyramid on the Moon.I should say it didn't take long for them to arrive but due to COVID-19 games development almost came to a halt. For several weeks we watched as the Pyramids moved closer into the Solar System until they were right on top of planets Mercury, Titan, Mars & IO (oh! How I miss IO).Upon the arrival of the Pyramids, Ana Bray and Rasputin were ready to launch a defensive strike against a coming tide of the Pyramids in hopes of stopping or slowing their advancements.The Warmind Rasputin and Ana were delighted with their success! That was until the Pyramid they attacked showed up on the display once again. The great Warmind, the Tyrant that every other AI that ever existed had feared was Cntrl + Alt + Dlte'ed from existence. In the lore book Duress and Egress titled: Ana: Frayed we find a sorrowful Ana struggling to overcome her failure, cables and sparks flew all over her work station as her Ghost (companion) struggled to piece what remained of the Golden Age AI together.Time has passed a new beginning is ahead of us as Season of The Chosen kicks into full swing. But one thing has my interested peaked. We can expect a war between Guardians and Cabal. A D1 strike is also set to return FALLEN S.A.B.E.R. A strike from Destiny where Rasputin calls for help to stop the fallen.But a bigger question is; How will this tie into the state of our current war coming? Ana Bray now has a workshop in the Last City and she has been fixing Rasputin and placing him into an Exo body I hope this means we will see this great Warmind arise to help us defend against the terrors of the night and return peace to our brilliant but scary cosmos.What will a refreshed Rasputin AI look like? Will he be able to evolve and adapt? Will he be able to access all his other off-world memory banks where copies of himself may exist? Will he become Felwinter 2.0? Without debris falling on him and wiping his memories so that he is reborn as a Guardian?Ana is trying to rebuild Rasputin better, stronger and able to do more.

The Lie about Flight,"Stories are powerful things.Armed with a good narrative, a belief about the way the world is, one can endure a surprising amount of tribulation. Stories become a hope we cast our eyes up towards during the low moments; something that tugs us through the mess, arranging it into some sort of meaning in its wake.If it's a truly good one, rich in significance and persistently asserted - by friends, family or the media we consume - one can also endure a remarkable number of experiences that challenge its truth, without ever wavering.--So, it makes sense that I could drink countless coffees alone and bear numerous Saturday afternoons that seemed to thrum with sharp solitude. That I could throw myself into room after room of foreign faces and flimsy conversation and dismiss the painful loneliness of it because, as the nomadic narrative went, it was better because it was somewhere else.They say people make the place and the truth of that was easy to see there. The city so untethered and young and restless and I shouldn't have been surprised because that was the point.To move in your twenties is to exercise that thoughtless freedom, revel in the youth and individuality and liberty of it all. I guess I didn't realise these experiences came at a cost. That you can't have total freedom and the deep and steady contentment that comes from remaining, enduring.So, we practice collective amnesia towards the majority of history, where consistency, familiarity and ritual were aspirational and instead act as though these are things to be escaped, outpaced and avoided at all costs. Instead, taking up a tireless dedication to ceaseless motion.--I know I write to try and justify the desire to come home. I'm gathering up reasons why coming back isn't necessarily a backslide, why trading the overseas city for a hometown can be something other than failure.Because the dream of flight looks different once you're living it; better in some ways, worse in others. The clean slate seems brighter, the rusted parts of yourself shift and change with dizzying ease; there's no one to say you've changed. Whoever you are today is who you've always been in the eyes of those who don't know you. We're intimately familiar with these golden linings. What isn't disclosed is the cloud it's around; the deep lonliness and stubborn shallowness.The fact that, yes, being tied to nothing means you're not restrained, but you're not attached to anything sturdier than yourself. Which is pretty damn unstable when the stormy moments hit.--It felt sudden, but looking back, the story about flight broke apart over months of hairline fractures. Little chips when reality bumped against how I thought it would be.Then one day, the scales tipped and it became more lie than story. So I booked a ticket, got on a plane. Tore airport tags off worn bags, tossed passports into draws and prepared to be asked why by those who still believed struggling overseas was superior to flourishing here.""It's not because I couldn't hack it,"" I'd say. ""This is actually, objectively, the better place. The better choice.""In the quiet moments, I questioned how true this was. Or if, just like when I moved, I simply chose a narrative that fit the present circumstance.Yet as time goes on, the more I believe the story I was told was always, if not a lie, a half-truth.--We all know how the story about flight goes; contentment is a terrible thing; almost always synonymous with a hometown. The city from which you came is a graveyard for the good life, where big dreams go to die and it's a life of constant transience between big cities that will give us enduring joy. Go and stay gone, because even if it's worse, it's better because it's somewhere else.Funny how quick we are to question someone's return, but never why we think leaving is inherently better.Because, it was in that metropolitan city, the one of unfettered freedom, filled with equally ephemeral souls there for a good time, never a long time, where I realised the people I knew who were so deeply content with life were the ones living supposedly 'mundane' lives.The ones who hadn't skipped countries like river stones, prescribing postcodes like silver bullets for internal troubles. Instead, they pursued the thick, rich pleasure of dwelling. Living testaments to Marcel Proust's over-quoted idea that ""the real voyage of discovery consists, not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.""Herein lies the truth never disclosed in the story about flight; there is freedom in going and staying, they just look different.--Being bound to something invokes it's own kind of freedom. Committed to a location, loyal to a community, allegiant to something larger than yourself, you're free from perpetual options and indecision. Spared from an obligation to novelty through movement.I'm the last to deny the value new places have; whether it's a suburb or a country. But there is a difference between it being the easy way to 'voyage' and being the only way.--If this recent revelation sounds steadily held, let me assure you it's not. The story around flight has held so strong for so long, it's un-shakability, is because it contains a kernel of truth; our innate desire to transcend.Some may feel it more strongly than others; a sense that, as the cringy Instagram posts go, 'the mountains are calling and I must go.'At a standstill in commuter traffic, wrestling with the jammed dishwasher door, packing lunch, booking in a WOF appointment; it's often life's most necessary and mundane moments when the feeling hits. An unpredictable suffocation that tugs the mind towards the inevitable urge to burn your entire life to the ground and run away.The flight narrative pathologizes this as a symptom of a substandard life, for which the only cure is flight. What I know now is that this isn't a warning sign of a mediocre life but an inherent quality of any life.As corporal beings with boundless minds, humans have always reckoned with a hunger for transcendence. We often jump to travel as a means, but the momentum has historically been outworked in countless other ways, from mounting Everest to composing a song, dosing up on drugs or simply day-dreaming at a desk.Popular discourse depicts moving overseas as the height of individuality and open-mindedness. It's delightfully ironic to consider how, occasionally, it's the very opposite. Tempting as it may be to believe otherwise, travel doesn't spare you from commitment or monotony any more than staying in your hometown does.This isn't to say anyone who goes abroad is merely pursuing a cliched, uninspired path of transcendence (something that would sound awfully resentful coming from a person who returned home). But rather that, when it comes to the universal ambition to eclipse what is familiar, there are many more paths than we may think.--One year, one pandemic and one full-time job later and I'm tied firmly to one place. Not free of those urges to go, but using them as fuel to explore paths that don't involve flight. More subtle, more steady, but no less able to give us that incomparable thrill of seeing with new eyes.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*iZGXP0pk5U1Ceha13ook_A.png,https://sarahpollok.medium.com/the-lie-about-flight-9c656dbba3aa,travel,657da5cdd2d9ac89ac9946683a9e0e7ab0ff32856f27f6c90a15aae0
Retro Modding Your GBA Console,"Since the rise of Android-powered emulation handhelds has changed the way that I enjoy handheld gaming, I have let my GBA go to the wayside.Nevertheless, nothing is better than pulling out an authentic Nintendo console to play some Golden Sun or Pokémon Emerald.Unfortunately, the original GBA (Game Boy Advance) is just so the dated feeling when you put it next to a beautifully backlit console that has access to thousands of titles at once.So, I set out to waste some money and reinvigorate my trusted old GBA. Here are some of the modifications that you can do to bring your GBA into the 21st century.First and foremost, one of the most frustrating things about the original GBA is having to collect all those game cartridges, am I right? Sure, that's part of the prestige of being a collector but digging through your collection can be a painful experience if you have a lot of titles.Flash carts came on the scene quite a long time ago, originally being available through online retailers like Lik-Sang (yes, I am that old). With a flash cart, you can theoretically store thousands of games on a single cartridge.The earliest flash carts that I had were very prehistoric, the first one used a serial connection for data transfers. Nowadays the flash carts are a lot more intuitive and easy to use, often working with a MicroSD card.Full disclaimer, I am not being paid to promote products but my flash cart of choice is the EXSEK EZFlash Omega. It's reasonably affordable, available on Amazon, and it includes adapters for the Nintendo DS as well.Yes, that's right, you can play ported DS Roms on your original DS console as well. Although that's a topic for another time, as right now we are focusing on the all-mighty GBA.Perhaps one of the biggest letdowns of the original GBA, when it came out in 2001, was the lack of a backlit screen. There were plenty of handhelds before it that had backlit screens, but Nintendo still thought otherwise.When you've played modern consoles and mobile games with a beautiful backlit screen, it can be so hard to travel back in time and play unlit. But in recent years there has been a rise in the availability of backlit screen kits.Now I know what you are thinking, you have to be an electrician to get this done, huh? Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. Although you will need to have some general knowledge of soldering.There is not one specific mod kit that I can point out because there are thousands available. But if you do a quick eBay search of ""GBA Backlight"" you'll be able to find one with ease.Installation takes about an hour and the joy of being able to play the original GBA with a backlit screen is downright amazing. You'll experience the games as you've never seen them before.Mario Kart Super Circuit, for example, looks great and so does one of the most recent games, Banjo Pilot.Finally, bringing some new life to the case of your GBA can be a great upgrade as well. The original colors were not bland by any stretch of the word, but there are some special edition colors that you can enjoy.I went for a clear orange case because I had always wanted an orange Game Boy Advance. If you remember there was not an orange console that was released in America.Thus, we didn't get to enjoy that limited edition color. There are other colors that you can do as well, such as yellow, green, and just about any other color that you can think of.Naturally, there isn't a single shell maker that I can highlight, but once again a quick eBay search will unlock thousands of replacement shells.The process is an easy one, you'll just need a Triwing screwdriver to open the original shell and replace it. It will only take a few minutes to do the replacement and you'll have a brand new and unique GBA.This one should be without question at the top of your list. Because the original GBA used AA batteries, and nothing was worse than running low on power right in the middle of a game.If you are going to be upgrading to a backlit screen you are going to need the power behind it. You don't need to do any type of installation, but a good set of rechargeable AA batteries will make all the difference in the world.I should note that there are a few rechargeable battery mods that you can do, but these require a lot of time and effort. For me, it was too much trouble so I just purchased a set of rechargeable AA batteries.My GBA was back on the road and looking and playing better than ever. You'll wonder how you ever made it on the original batteries.Handheld gaming changed universally when Nintendo released the 32-Bit console in 2001. I know for me, I was blown away by how great the graphics were and the variety of games.As we approach the 20th birthday of the GBA it is time that we pull our old friend out and enjoy it once more. Sure, the Game Boy Advance SP offered a backlit design built right in.But it was the original GBA that most of us enjoyed in middle school and on those long road trips during the summer.The GBA was and still is an iconic part of the video game industry, and few handhelds have managed to captivate gamers as this one did.With just a little bit of work, you can bring your GBA into the 21st century, incorporating new upgrades and bringing you into a gameplay experience that feels quite natural.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*J0DQ-my0GGsp_frT4683FA.png,https://medium.com/super-jump/retro-modding-your-gba-console-23600fea00e,gaming,664fcdc4a684e61b5f2e94dc7dd288baebf4f79e8622fca3b3ab2aaf
Why I'm Obsessed with the 'Am I the Asshole?' Subreddit,"Like thousands upon thousands of other people, I am addicted to reading 'Am I the Asshole?' on Reddit. I first encountered AITA (the preferred abbreviation) through Twitter when an account that reposts particularly juicy threads kept popping up in my timeline. One thing led to another, and I'm now an unabashed asshole addict. Every few days for the past few months, I log on and get my fill of roommate drama, relationship woes, and family fallouts. Locked down and hungry for human interaction, I find a sense of connection here, though I've never actually commented or voted on a thread. Without demanding anything of me, AITA offers material to discuss over dinner with my husband, dilemmas to ponder, complicated social scenarios to occupy my understimulated mind.As a lifelong fan of advice and 'agony aunt' columns, I am not surprised I've fallen hard. Growing up, I'd snatch the 'Life & Arts' section of my grandparents' newspaper to read Ask Abby and Dear Ann. I moved on to Miss Manners, Cary Tennis, Dear Sugar, Dolly Alderton, on and on. Maybe I'm a nosy person. Or, to be more generous, a curious person. A person accepting of the universe's chaos while simultaneously longing for it all to make sense. Aware of the fact that there are endless problems, complex problems, problems that never stop, that life is indeed one big fat problem. Fully aware, and yet taking comfort in the fact that while there are no easy answers, there are often answers.That life's most challenging situations can be boiled down to this: YATA - you are the asshole. NTA - (you're) not the asshole. NAH - no asshole here. ESH - everyone sucks here.But it's more than the simplicity. It's the civility, the empathy, the generosity of the advice. I have read hundreds of comments that read like they were written by professional advice columnists. Comments that make me want to know the person who wrote them, to befriend them, to ask for their perspective on my own issues and hang-ups.This is not to say that everyone is always nice. This isn't a campfire, no one's singing kumbaya. When hard facts need to be spoken, they are spoken. When someone needs to be told they're an absolute monster, commenters will step up and say it, but in the most helpful, constructive way possible. After all, this forum exists to illuminate truths, and in doing so, light a clear path forward. Occasionally, there are updates. People who report apologizing for their poor behavior. Seeking counseling. Making amends.To me, AITA feels like the internet as it could've been. A version of reality where rigorous discourse exists alongside human decency. A sacred digital corner where the assholes haven't yet won.I want to explain what this version of the internet means to me, but to do that, I need to back up. I need to tell you a story.When I was eight years old, my dad landed a consulting job in the emerging 'software' world, thanks to a recommendation from my uncle, who already worked in the Dallas-based office. When I think back on it, it seems obvious that my dad was unqualified to do this kind of work. That everyone should've seen the dangers that lurked around the corner. But this was the wild west, the dot-com bubble - there were no rules, no real qualifications, not yet. There was only possibility. Uncharted hope.Prior to nabbing this big-shot job, my dad worked in 'loss prevention' in a supermarket chain, watching black-and-white video monitors in a back office and attempting to stop people from stuffing steaks down their pants. With his security guard salary and my mom's income as an artist, we rented a haunted, falling-apart house outside of San Diego. We went to a small but diverse school. My memories were mostly happy, sunny, stereotypical southern California.But opportunity called in the form of a lower cost of living and higher pay. When we moved to Texas, we rented a brick house, which was in full working order. There was a swing in the front yard and a playhouse in the back. There were no ghosts. Just culture shock. My mom fell into a depression, which manifested in physical symptoms. Headaches, earaches, none of which could be solved, no matter how many doctors she saw. While she spent her days on the couch, utterly miserable, I got made fun of in school for my accent and my clothes - even my teacher joined in. But, hey, we were on the up and up. My dad bought a top-of-the-line minivan. We embarked on our first cross-country vacation. We dined in the chain restaurants favored by middle-class white people. For my birthday, I got the stylish clothes I wanted from the Limited Too.Of course, things would soon fall apart, as they always were going to do. First went the job. Then came the bills, stacking up for the things we could no longer afford. Eventually, we'd get booted from our home and wind up in a doublewide trailer on my grandparents' rural property. I'd spend my entire adolescence there. I don't particularly like to dwell on it, but I was a really lonely kid. I read obsessively. I ate for comfort. I wore baggy clothes and mostly tried to go unnoticed while secretly hoping that someone interesting might notice me. Ashamed of our ever-worsening living conditions, I would learn to push people away, to put up walls, to always keep a distance. But no man, woman, or child is an island.While my life was a depressing shit show, the internet of my youth was very much a place of possibility. Uncharted hope. As a teenager, I relished the fact that screennames afforded you anonymity. No one would know who you were or where you lived or what you looked like or how much money your parents made unless you wanted them to know. Like Cinderella at the ball, you could show up in your finest, present yourself as a princess when really you were little more than a sooty stepdaughter.In my digital glass slippers, I logged onto message boards, chat rooms, penpal matching websites, zine distros. I connected with others, based on our interests, our outlooks, our shared senses of humor. Here I was, invisible and yet fully seen. Judged only by the contents of my character, the history of my posts.Like lonely kids everywhere, when I left my hometown, my world opened up. I no longer relied on the internet for connection. I made friends, foged connections, started relationships in real life. With distance, I was once again handed a pair of glass slippers. Like the folks on the web, the people I met in Austin, Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo, London, wherever, had no idea who I had been, only who I was in the present. How could they know? It wasn't until I was in my late twenties that I'd be able to say, ""I grew up in a trailer"" or think back on my upbringing as ""white trash."" It wasn't until my thirties - years after both of my parents had died suddenly and prematurely - that I could laugh at stories about our broken-down cars and our off-brand food. That I could speak of the symptoms I'd never gotten checked out at the doctor due to a lack of health insurance. The firm orders not to answer the phone unless we were absolutely certain it wasn't a debt collector. The bitterness and resentment of my father, who emotionally checked out of the rest of my life. The helplessness of it all.And meanwhile, while I was living IRL all of those years, the internet changed. Social media smashed the glass slippers. Sure, shards remain - we still get people hiding behind non-descriptive screennames and pictures of sunsets. We engage with catfishes and trolls and bots. We deploy exaggerations and half-truths and filters to hide our flaws. But, for the most part, today's internet consists of people we know and influencers we recognize by sight. We get headshots and bios and links to portfolios. We see the food others eat each day, their clothing choices, their home decor. We can look up their husbands' salaries on Glassdoor and see how much their houses cost on Zillow. We get closer, and in doing so, we often feel further away.But back to AITA. For the most part, Reddit is anonymous. You can be who you choose to be. And that means the same things it used to mean, the same things it's always meant. People who ask for advice might be lying, making things up. People who answer the call might be presenting themselves in only the best possible light, taking a moral high ground they wouldn't take if the same situation were happening to them.But there's some beauty in this. There's some magic. Unlike social media trolls, people are choosing to use their anonymity for good - or at least neutral - reasons. They're choosing to don their glass slippers to connect, to share, to help, rather than to bully or swindle.In many ways, I read AITA to get my fix of gossip, human drama. But I also get a hit of something else, a deep breath of something I haven't felt in a long time: a new perspective. A glimmer of that uncharted hope.It's perhaps a pointless exercise, but I recently let myself wonder what it would've been like if we'd stayed in California all of those years ago. If my dad hadn't flown too close to the figurative sun. Of course, I can't blame him for wanting a better life for his family. NTA - not the asshole. Or more accurately, NAH - no asshole here. But I can let myself imagine, can't I? To ask who I might have been. Who I could have become. What our family would've looked like. Whether or not my parents - who both avoided seeking preventative care due to the anxieties they'd developed about the cost of healthcare - might still be alive today. See, I told you. Pointless. But we all wonder these things from time to time, don't we? If we'd veered left instead of right. If we'd taken that scholarship. If we'd apologized to that friend. If we'd adopted that dog. If we'd rented in this neighborhood instead of that one. If, if, if.It's silly, this wondering. We all know this. Because there aren't if's in life. Not really. Life just is.To me, AITA feels like a small part of some alternate universe. The one where things are as they could've been.And that's why I keep showing up. Reading. Scrolling. Admiring the anonymous souls who offer their generous insights, and silently cheering on the strangers who are turning to the internet to help them navigate those ever-present choices that haven't yet become if's.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8544/0*L9EcZgduzzQFQt0d,https://carlyjhallman.medium.com/why-im-obsessed-with-the-am-i-the-asshole-subreddit-88be802ea67b,social-media,667ad0ed9197971652dabc3872534bc8c3f4b90a1ef5d41d9491c52c
Linear Regression: Everything From Math to Program Part-3,"Hello All !!!This is the third and final part of the series Linear Regression: Everything From Math to Program.Part 1: Regression with One Independent VariablePart 2: Regression with Two Independent VariableIf you have made it so far then it's obvious you have understood concepts of Linear regression and how those beautiful libraries on regressions working in the back-end. I don't want to share anything fancy with you guys at this point and make this blog lengthy and complicated. There are no derivations in this part and we will use the same concept that we have derived in part 2. We are also not performing calculations on Excel since the dataset we are working on will be huge and Excel won't help us in that. So what we are going to do in this part.We will build on what we have learnt so far in the last 2 parts by writing a program in Python to predict a dependent variable Y based on multiple independent variables X1, X2, X3 and so on. We are not using any popular libraries like Scikit-learn to build linear regression model. There are humongous tutorials for that. We will use numpy for matrices operation and see how we accomplish the task step-by-step so that even a novice can understand it.Please refer to Part-2 for all the basic operations. In this tutorial, we are going to build general program which can be implemented on dataset of any size.Prerequisites: pandasPlease share your thoughts on this series in the comments section or connect to me on LinkedIN. I would be happy to help. Also, don't forget to follow me on medium.com for more such posts in the future.Let's begin!!!Step 1: Understand the datasetIn this tutorial, we are using an insurance dataset from Kaggle. There are 7 columns in the dataset: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, insurance charges. Our task is to predict the insurance charges on the basis on age, sex, bmi (body mass index), children (number of children covered by health insurance), smoker (does person smokes) and region (residential area of beneficiary).Step 2: Import librariesStep 3: Read datasetWe will use pandas library to read the csv file that we have downloaded from here and perform other operations.There are 1338 rows and 7 columns.Until now we have worked with numerical type independent variables. The other type is categorical or text format. In our dataset, they are sex (male or Female), smoker(yes or no) and region (Southwest, southeast, northwest etc.) We need to convert this columns datatype into integer before regressing.Step 4: Convert datatype of columns to integerTo do so, we will use astype method by pandas to convert the columns to a category like 1 for yes and 0 for no. And then, assign the encoded variable to a new column using the cat.codes accessor.Step 5: Convert Pandas dataframe to numpy arrayWe could have used pandas for implementation of this program but I wanted to reuse the code we developed in part 2 and thus converting it to numpy array. We will use to_numpy function provided by Pandas to do so.Step 6: Prepare training and testing dataWe are using numpy array indexing to split the entire dataset into training feature and label as well as testing feature and testing label. We are using first 1334 rows for predicting the values of regression coefficients and use last 4 rows to test the performance of predicted equation.Step 7: Calculate Regression coefficentFrom here onwards, all the steps for predictions are same as explained in part 2. Please refer to part 2 in case you are unable to infer any part.Note that the number of column of regression coefficent matrix (=6) is 1 greater than number of dependent variables (= 5)Step 8: PredictionIn this step we will predict the testing data that we have created in step 6 and calculate the value of dependent variable (or insurance charges)This may seem pretty daunting to you if you are not familiar with programming in python. Let me break it down for you.Firstly we create a numpy matrix of size equal to number of testing data (=4). Then for each testing row we substituted the value of regression coefficents and calculated the predicted value of Y.As usual, you can refer to my github account to get complete program in Jupyter Notebook. Click on star icon on top right corner in github to show support to my project.ConclusionThis was all I had to share with you guys on Linear regression. Please drop your reviews on the posts in the comments section. You can connect to me on LinkedIN if you want to discuss anything. I am always happy to help :)Till next post...

Adventures in a Portuguese Post Office,"Lisbon, Portugal is a beautiful, vibrant, and colorful city. It features hand-painted ceramic tiles on most of the buildings, which serve as both decoration and insulation. I had the privilege of living in Lisbon for a month and while I was there, I took a class on how to paint these beautiful tiles. Little did I know that mailing the tiles home to my mom would be far more complicated than actually painting them.Over the course of the three-hour class, taught by a middle-aged Portuguese woman dressed in bright, vibrant clothing that vehemently contradicted the unenthusiastic look on her face, we had each completed two tiles, along with several glasses of vino tinto (that's red wine in Portuguese.) We left our tiles with the instructor to be kilned and would pick them up in a few days' time.""Gracias!"" I said to the instructor on the way out the door, receiving a sigh and an eye roll as my farewell.Lisbon is the first place I've ever lived where English was not the primary language, and I really struggled with Portuguese. I thought it was similar to Spanish (it isn't), which I had studied in high school and college, and I kept saying ""Gracias"" my first few days until I learned that thank you was actually obrigada, if you're female; obrigado if you're male.Fortunately for me, many of the residents spoke English in addition to Portuguese and would greet me in English. I got used to this, perhaps complacently so, and eventually stopped beginning every conversation with ""Hola, desculpe no falo Portuguese..."" (Hello, I'm sorry I don't speak Portuguese."") This did not go over so well at the post office.Now, in addition to the perpetual self-consciousness I already felt for being blatantly non-native, I was fresh off an unlucky accident at the gym and I was in a lot of physical pain when I headed to the post office. I had been doing box jumps, where you squat down and then jump onto a wooden box, and on one of my attempts, my feet missed the box. My right shin slammed onto the hard, wooden corner with all of my body weight on top of it, and excruciating pain shot through my leg. I caught myself just before my face hit the box, then collapsed to the floor in pain.Ow ow ow ow mother F#$%^&!!!I pulled my pant leg up to look at it, and it was a good one. Or a bad one, depending on how you feel about dim sum shaped contusions on your shinbone.I sat on the floor and elevated my leg on the wooden box of death to slow the swelling and reduce the throbbing. I hoped it looked like I was just taking a breather, not trying to determine whether or not I had cracked my tibia in half. As I walked upstairs to the locker room, the pain intensified. The endorphins from my workout were no longer enveloping me in a feeling of invincibility, and I was in agony.I need ice!But first, I had to go to the post office and mail the two tiles to my mom in California. I would not have another chance before we left, as tomorrow would be Good Friday (businesses closed), I flew to my next city early Saturday morning, and I couldn't take on the extra weight of the tiles in my already overstuffed luggage. I threw on my raincoat and limped over to the post office, wincing, trying not to cry as I slipped on a wet cobblestone and saw my life flash before my eyes. Which brings us back to the friendly mail clerk at the Agencia dos Correios.She smiled at me as I approached the counter. I smiled and said hello as I pulled a couple of postcards out of my backpack and set it on the counter.""Are these okay to reach the United States?""Silence. Her eyes turned cold. She hates me. She said nothing, just looked at me as though I had punched her grandkid in the face. Her entire demeanor had changed from gentle and helpful to unfriendly and annoyed. I felt my fight or flight response kick in. I immediately started sweating, my hands shaking, my leg throbbing in pain from the extra blood now pulsing through my veins. I held the postcards out to her like a child showing a report card to her parents.Pleeease say yes.She reluctantly nodded yes. I exhaled, and then pulled out the tiles.""I also need to mail these...""She just stared at me, unsympathetic.""I need a box of some sort?""She shrugged. I turned to look at the boxes and envelopes for sale, picking them up to see if my tiles would fit. After what felt like far too long, the clerk asked me if my package was ""For Portugal?""""No, to the United States?"" I replied in feeble question form.""Those only for Portugal.""She reached under the counter and pulled out a padded envelope that would barely fit one of the tiles.""Thank you,"" I said, trying to fit the tiles inside. It clearly wasn't going to happen, so I went to look for any other boxes that would work. As I stepped away from the counter, my backpack came crashing down to the floor. I spun around, confused and embarrassed, and realized that I had my phone in my pocket connected to my external charger inside my backpack, the contents of which were now all over the floor.I couldn't even look at the clerk. I could feel her eyes on me. I bent down to grab my bag and everything that had flown out of it, and winced from the pain that shot through my leg. Another customer walked in as I wiped sweat from my brow. He looked at me, looked at the counter, back at me.""Go ahead,"" I motioned towards the counter.He regarded me like an insane person relieving myself in the middle of the floor, stepping extra-cautiously over my bag so as not to catch anything. I'm fairly certain he and the clerk were mocking me in Portuguese. Either that or they were sharing a hearty laugh over his stamp purchase.As I gathered my belongings and shoved them haphazardly into my backpack, another customer walked in and approached the second counter for service. Once I had my mess back together, I slowly stood up, not wanting to make sudden movements on my leg. I grabbed the envelope and my tiles and got in line behind the two customers. One of them finished so I stepped to the counter for service, when I heard a voice over the loudspeaker say in Portuguese, ""Now serving number 142.""I was baffled. I hadn't seen anyone else come in, but when I looked around like the dazed idiot that I was, I saw that there were now three more women waiting in the back of the post office, all holding tickets and resting easily on the benches in the waiting area. I did a double take. I had seen no such number dispenser.I didn't realize that the Agencia dos Correios operated like a deli.And now I had lost my spot in line.One woman kindly smiled at me and pointed to the number dispensing machine. It looked like a big red refrigerator but with one button in the middle instead of a door. Seriously? How did I miss that? Feeling stupid again, I nodded gratefully at her, got my ticket, and sat down.My leg started throbbing again. My face was hot with embarrassment. I was sweating more, still wearing my jacket and scarf from the rain. This was taking longer than I had anticipated. I wanted to run (well, hobble) away and come back tomorrow. But I knew they would be closed. I almost, ALMOST started crying, right there in the Portuguese post office, which made me feel even worse. I took a deep breath, calmed myself, and avoided eye contact with the other customers.Moments later, my number was up. Fortunately it was not the original clerk who called my number, so I walked up to the other counter and started with""Desculpe, no falo Portuguese...""The new clerk just chuckled at me as if to say, ""No shit."" But at least she smiled! Before I said anything else, the first clerk said something loudly in Portuguese to my new clerk. Catching her up on my stupidity, presumably.Here. We. Go.The new clerk looked at me and my sad little envelope.""If you send it in that it will arrive broken."" She was gentler with me, probably not wanting to see me go full meltdown in front of her.""Yes, I know. I need a box. Can I buy a box?""I'm now miming a box, as if a post office employee doesn't know what a cardboard box is. I stop miming. She sighs, gets off her chair, and walks to the back. I wait nervously, avoiding eye contact with the first clerk.Don't look... Oh what's this on the counter here? I stare at the counter, sweating more, tracing the lines with my finger.My clerk returns with a box! And bubble wrap! She hands them to me and I smile, ""Obrigada, obrigada"" (thank you, the correct version) as if she's just handed me the Publisher's Clearing House check for $5,000 a week for life. I wrap the tiles, put them in the box, and she hands me the address form. I do it wrong of course. She says it's fine and hands me a customs form.""List the contents of the box, their value, and speed of shipping you want.""There are so many different ways this form could be filled out incorrectly. I freeze. I ask unnecessary questions.""Is this pen ok?""She doesn't justify my stupid question with a response. I start filling it out. Contents: Two souvenir tiles. Value: Well, I painted them sooo $0. That's as far as I get. I stare at the unchecked boxes and look at her like a frightened Chihuahua. She says it's okay and takes the form. I think I am finally finished.""15 Euros"" she says. Oh yeah, payment! I pull out my Visa card.""No card, only cash."" Oh for the love of - I have no idea how much cash I have left. My leg throbs. I find 20 Euros in my wallet and pay the lady. She gives me my change and before she's even finished taping the box shut I am sprint-limping out the door.I'm free! I stumble out into the streets of Lisbon, now grateful for the cold air, and gingerly make my way home as my body temperature begins to regulate once more. I stop for a bag of ice to treat my self-inflicted flesh wound. As the clerk at the market gets me the ice, I grab a bottle of wine. I can just afford the wine and the ice with my last few Euros. I hobble home, pour myself a glass, and ice my leg with the old timey, reusable ice bag my sister got me for Christmas knowing how accident-prone I am.I elevate my leg on a garbage can, like a lady, and take a moment to appreciate that I did not break down and cry at the Agencia dos Correios. I have three more months on this journey, and no doubt endless hijinks to endure. But for now, I toast myself to the small victory of surviving my first foreign post office.One small step for most, one giant leap on a broken shin.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1224/1*c3v6JC0J5Hq9X6RL2-0jSg.jpeg,https://medium.com/curious/adventures-in-a-portuguese-post-office-8a1e63ce1e4f,travel,757f12652880afde19283cdbb2e3ac05e80cec857c1a532d5c9eeeb4
Don't Be Distracted by Lucrative Contracts When Freelancing,"As a freelance writer, I find that my contract work distracts me from my long-term freelancing goals, and I think that is typical for other freelancers as well. Considering your contracts won't be around forever, it's important to focus on your growth outside the contracts. I will be focusing this article specifically on how to do that.After graduating in May 2020, I was a COVID-19 contact tracer for a short while before becoming a freelance writer. I write articles for multiple websites, one of which I write for as a contractor. In my spare time, I am working on an ebook and getting my blog up and running. It seems like a lot because it is.However, I have the privilege of working from my living room on the outskirts of Cincinnati, no commute required. The fridge is 10 paces from my workstation and I drink an endless amount of chocolate milk every morning for breakfast and every night for dessert. I make $1,250 a month keeping up with this routine. It's a great freelance life.From November - January I had an incredibly lucrative contract, in which I published multiple long-form articles each month to receive a guaranteed monthly payment. It was a fantastic contract in my eyes, and it has now been replaced with a new contract from the same company.I cannot state the new amount I will be receiving as the contract is active and the amount is confidential, but I am somewhat pleased with it. The contract is different and more difficult, but it is also different in beneficial ways as well if you catch my drift.In order to meet the requirements of my new contract, I will need to write much more than I am used to. This is not because the contract requires longer articles per se, but because articles have a chance of performing better if a location is used, at least from my determination of how the audience on the site responds.I do not typically write location-based articles, so this will either change my writing style or force me to churn out even more articles per day. This is a significant note for someone with limited writing energy who is trying to launch a blog and an ebook.The ultimate goal in freelancing is to own a successful blog. My own blog is a serious work in progress, as I am a perfectionist who isn't fantastic at web design, but we're getting there. I intend on selling services from my website, having my articles on one blog tab on said site, and using SEO to get valuable views.I do greatly enjoy contract work, but when you're dependent on one contract, that's what you are: dependent. I want to have a rotation of contracts so I don't panic when my only contract falls through. Most contracts have a clause where either party can end the contract at any time, and it can happen suddenly.Having multiple contracts also allows you to say no to contracts that push your limits, whether that's writing too many articles per day or something you don't agree with. I know a few writers who negotiate their contracts, but I'm at the point where I'm just grateful to have them. Having a successful blog would certainly help to alleviate some monetary pressure.My income is mainly reliant on my one contract at the moment. It is a lot of work, and I am tired after doing it. Completing all this writing for a single contract diminishes my energy levels and makes me not want to work on my blog or ebook. Considering both of those are far more important than a single contract, I needed an action plan.You may find yourself in a similar position, so I encourage you to follow my plan if it applies to your situation.My plan is as follows: write articles that fulfill both my contract requirements and my writing theme on other sites I write for so I can double/triple publish each article to maximize earnings. This will only work for you if your contract doesn't include exclusive article rights.Additionally, I will write a few location-based articles for both platforms to boost my performance on one website [contracted site] while maintaining my performance on the other. I'm actually quite excited to write an article about my favorite place in the United States! Plus, it'll give my (free) newsletter a little bit of variety.If I am tired of writing for a period of time, I will work on the behind-the-scenes work on my website. I still have a lot to do such as setting up payment methods, checking my contact forms don't continue to send emails to my spam folder, etc. Again: the blog is a significant work in progress.If you are a freelancer, whether writing or some other craft, try not to use up all your energy on your contract(s). The point of freelancing is to be self-sustainable without a company. Work on your own products before those of others, even if those others are paying you well.Make time for the dream.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/1*LOApzXFUtBq571Kd5OgC7g.jpeg,https://medium.com/blankpage/dont-be-distracted-by-lucrative-contracts-when-freelancing-2e2481c12417,freelancing,782bcac29434de121055f7ddf7286309ca51a1bcf26efb240819b37b
Will Amazon Be 'Kinder' After Jeff Bezos?,"OneZero is partnering with the Big Technology Podcast from Alex Kantrowitz to bring readers exclusive access to interview transcripts - edited for length and clarity - with notable figures in and around the tech industry.To subscribe to the podcast and hear the interview for yourself, you can check it out on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Overcast.Jeff Bezos is resigning as Amazon CEO. And because 2021 is the craziest news year on record, we mostly haven't stopped to consider this seismic story and what it means for the business world. Jason Del Rey, a senior correspondent at Recode and author of a forthcoming book on Amazon's battle with Walmart, joins Big Technology Podcast to discuss what Amazon looks like after Bezos.Alex Kantrowitz: How surprised were you when you saw the news that Jeff Bezos resigned?Jason Del Rey: I think it might've happened sooner, if not for the pandemic. I think many people both inside and outside of Amazon have said that this almost formalizes the way Bezos was interacting with the company for a couple years now-working on his pet projects, early big swings, trying to make time for his rocket building and other increasingly philanthropic initiatives. So, anytime it was going to happen, it was going to feel like a big moment. And it is, but when I could digest it for a second, it was not altogether surprising.Why do you think he's leaving now?There are three theories, and I think they could have all played a role. One is he was planning to leave before the pandemic and then felt like he couldn't with everything facing the company and society. And so now, hopefully feeling like we're on the back end of the pandemic and with the vaccines rolling out, he thought it would be a fair time to pass the baton. Does he want to be testifying in front of different congressional committees more? Or have to face that? I don't know anyone who wants to do that. Maybe he'll still have to, as the founder and executive chairman, but I don't think he wants to spend his time being briefed on that stuff. And I think there's going to be more of that to come.And then, from a financial perspective, Amazon will sort of be lapping their amazing gross numbers from the pandemic. So, he'll stick around a couple more quarters, maybe as those growth numbers don't look quite as good as we lap them. This is a generous take, but he'll take the brunt of it if the growth slows down, before passing it off to Jassy. But I think it's a combination of the fact that he has other interests he's been spending time on, the scrutiny he doesn't want to be the face of for much longer, and then really trusting that Andy Jassy is the person who can make sure his company stays on track.You're writing a book about Amazon and Walmart. Jeff Wilke was the head of worldwide consumer, and he's out, too, so the two big characters inside Amazon are leaving. Will that change your forthcoming book on the battle between Amazon and Walmart?It's a new era, so obviously I'll be looking for changes. I think unlike Brad Stone's book, which is an Amazon-centric book, I think Brad has some work to do between now and his publishing in May. My book's not coming out for a bit after that, so I'm not super concerned. Maybe I want Jassy to play a bigger role in this book now than I anticipated, but that is not high on my stress list. And I have a lot of things on my stress list.Amazon under Bezos had this retail DNA, which is notoriously cutthroat and frugal. Now Jassy is coming from the money-printing side of the business, Amazon Web Services, one that doesn't have those constraints. Will that background make Amazon a kinder culture?I think it's a complex answer. On one hand, the guy now running Amazon's retail business is Dave Clark, who has run the warehouse network operations for years in sort of a cutthroat fashion. A great Bloomberg profile said his nickname used to be the sniper, because he would, in his early days, hide out in an Amazon warehouse to watch workers and fire people on the spot if they weren't doing the right thing. So, Clark is running that retail business, and he's a tough guy. I'm interested in Jassy coming from AWS. I've talked to Amazon former execs who won't say this publicly, but privately they tell me, ""Jason, when's the last time Amazon has really had a breakthrough invention?"" And they will point out Alexa, AWS, Kindle, and the initial idea for Amazon, basically.So, my big thing is will Jassy taking over in some way directly lead to the next great invention? And does Amazon even need that? With all the room to grow in retail, in logistics, in video media, in Alexa, the things they already do well, it doesn't really feel like that, but there's an argument. Some former execs would say privately that they worry the company's already touching day two, which is this idea of like when you stop becoming that inventive, scrappy, no-holds-barred startup.Tim Bray, who left Amazon in protest after they fired whistleblowers, told you, ""AWS was, by a wide margin, the best-managed place I've worked."" Was that surprising to you?When I spoke to Tim Bray, I asked him, ""How do I make sense of you going out the way you did and then this praise of Jassy?"" And he basically said he doesn't think Jassy had anything to do with the whistleblower firings, that he was really upset about it. The truth is Andy Jassy is on the S-team [Bezos' senior leadership team] at Amazon, so I don't know that he oversaw those firings.I think Bray was talking more about the DNA that comes from Bezos. I think that is true. I've had people describe Jassy to me as, ""Well, there are a lot of similarities in management style and philosophy,"" but he's ""more human than Jeff Bezos."" The word empathetic has been used as well.He's a hard-charging executive, for sure. But I think some people internally have a hope that the place will become, you may have described it, a nicer place. How that manifests itself externally, I have no idea, but I'm going to be looking for any signs of change. I'll stop there. But those are some of my thoughts on that topic.I think the company's biggest weakness is that it does have a lack of empathy. Let's say the company does get more empathetic-does that make it stronger?The answer I want to give is yes, it would make it stronger, but then I look at all the coverage, all the employee activism, much of it shining a negative light on the company, and yet there are record sales and profits through the pandemic. People will say it's not on consumers to vote with our wallets; you're just trying to get by day to day. I don't know that being more empathetic will make it a more popular company. I think the service has historically been so exceptional and far and away the best thing in retail. People just make decisions that are best for them when it comes to buying stuff. Recruitment-wise, no one wants to be at the center of potential antitrust enforcement.Lastly, do you see the antitrust crackdowns as a real risk to Amazon?I've talked to people about whether the government has the bandwidth to take on more than two giants, and I think there's still a real risk Amazon's facing. I've been surprised at how combative they've been with critics over the last few years from both a communications and public policy side. They had a lot of friends on Capitol Hill a few years ago. Now they go in there and every conversation doesn't start with, ""Oh, I'm an Amazon Prime customer."" It starts in a sort of interrogation, and that's what I've learned over the years reporting. Maybe Jassy will instruct his comms and policy teams to take a different tack. I'll believe it when I see it.So, yes, I think there's real risk. I've reported on Lina Khan, sort of an antitrust scholar and a previous lawyer on the House antitrust subcommittee that investigated the tech giants, who believes all these companies need to be reined in. She's in contention for the FTC commissioner spot, which would be a very big deal. I think there's real risk. And you would think Jesse might not want to sit down before Congress or other courts and might want to take a different tact, but smart people inside the company think the best way forward is to be somewhat combative and dismissive of some of these complaints. And I'm just here to watch the ride.",,https://onezero.medium.com/will-amazon-be-kinder-after-jeff-bezos-3536c11e03ec,business,798bb645fadf2c631bb00dec5d9e6c152faddeecc94646b23bbfce3a
6 Reasons Why Istanbul is a Great Base For Digital Nomads,"As remote workers, we are always looking for great nomad bases.We favor cities with suitable remote working spots but also intriguing sites that satisfy our wanderlust.Istanbul ticks all of those boxes.Over the last few years, I've spent a combined three months in the Turkish metropolis, and I always love to return.There are many reasons why tourists love Istanbul, and there are even more perks of living and working from here as a digital nomad.Situated on two continents, its eclectic mix of cultures is second to none in the Western world. Better still, its liveability, low prices, and top-notch infrastructure make the megacity an ideal place to spend a few months as a remote worker.On this basis, here are six reasons why Istanbul is an excellent base for digital nomads.Istanbul is the only city in the world that spans over two continents: Europe and Asia.The city on the Bosphorus strait was founded in the 7th century BC by Greek colonists. They called it ""Byzantium.""Over the centuries, the Byzantine Romans turned the settlement into an important city and renamed it ""Constantinople"" in the 4th century AD after Emperor Constantine. Constantinople became the capital of the Byzantine Empire and a global cultural and trading hub.In 1453, the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople and renamed it ""Istanbul."" It remained a global powerhouse for centuries and became the economic and cultural center of the new Republic of Turkey in 1923.Istanbul's history is long and eventful, and the remnants of that multifaceted past are still ubiquitous in the 15 million-plus megacity.Today, Istanbul is a melting pot of ideas, cultures, and architecture. To some extent, Istanbul is a microcosm of Turkey, a highly diverse country.From conservative Muslim neighborhoods to hip bar areas full of nightclubs, you can find everything in Turkey's largest city. It's where East and West meet, ideologies clash, and people come together.All of this diversity makes Istanbul such an incredible place to live and work as a digital nomad.In short, you'll learn something new every day, and you'll encounter the real-world meaning of diversity - one of my cardinal reasons for traveling the world full-time.When it comes to cultural and culinary sites, few cities compete with Istanbul.Heading to the old Ottoman center of Sultanahmet, you can visit the Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Topkapi Palace, the Basilica Cistern, and the world-class Archaeological Museum - all within a few hundred meters.Away from the Old Center, there are huge palaces like the Dolmabahce, picturesque areas like Galata, and enticing oriental markets like the Grand Bazaar.You couldn't summarize Istanbul's sites on a few pages, and it would take months to visit everything.Aside from historic locations, Istanbul's culinary offer is limitless. In this context, the areas of Taksim, Kadiköy, and Cihangir are favorites of mine when it comes to eating and drinking.Istanbul is the 10th most-visited city in the world, are even in 2020, millions of tourists flocked to Turkey as the government kept the borders open with adequate measures in place.All in all, Istanbul will undoubtedly guarantee the adventure aspect of your digital nomad lifestyle.Historic sites are great, but digital nomads naturally want to know about remote working locations.Fear not, Istanbul has plenty.Being the economic heart of Turkey, Istanbul attracts thousands of ambitious young professionals and entrepreneurs from all over the country and the Middle East. Better still, there is no shortage of coffee shops, coworking spaces, and other locations to work from as a digital nomad.As a remote worker, the best choice is to rent an Airbnb in either Taksim or Levent, one of the city's modern business districts. Both areas have lots of coffee shops, apartments with fast WiFi, and affordable coworking spots.Next, Istanbul's infrastructure is passable in most areas and first-class in some.You can find strong WiFi throughout the city, and SIM Cards are available at every corner. The malls are world-class and sell everything you would find in Western Europe or North America.Istanbul does have some cleanliness issues, but these are limited to various areas.All in all, the infrastructure is satisfactory, and you won't miss any Western amenities - creating a highly livable environment.English levels aren't great outside of the tourist neighborhoods, but you'll get around. Learning a few Turkish phrases will be helpful if you want to venture off the beaten track.That brings me to the locals. Of course, it's wrong to generalize, but Turkish people are some of the friendliest and most hospitable souls on this planet.I have lots of personal connections in the country - creating a bias - but I have to say that I would characterize the locals as some of the most welcoming and charming people you'll find anywhere. Learn a little bit of the language, and you'll see the real Turkey, far away from negative media portrayals and politics.When it comes to safety, Istanbul doesn't have significant problems with crime. Most petty crimes are, in fact, opportunistic. Consequently, common sense will suffice to say safe in the Turkish megacity.Most remote workers want to take advantage of geo-arbitrage by relocating to a cheaper city.That's where the downfall of the Turkish lira plays into the hands of digital nomads.The city became more expensive for locals in recent years, and the prices of imported products rose, but Istanbul is still highly affordable for nomads who earn dollars or Euros.Having spent some time here in early 2021, I can safely say that it's the cheapest big city in Europe. Whether it's rent, food, or cultural experiences, there are few places in Europe where you get as much bang for your bucks.Compared to American cities of similar size, the cost of living is 63% lower than in New York City and 54% lower than in Los Angeles, according to Numbeo.The last substantial advantage of choosing Istanbul as a nomad base is its public transit network - and its shiny new airport.Istanbul has a rapidly-growing subway network that connects the city's main transit hubs. Better still, the streetcars connect the smaller neighborhoods, and the Bosphorus ferries make continent-hopping a piece of cake.The last piece of the city's excellent transport network is the brand-new Istanbul Airport. Opened in 2019, this is hands-down one of the best airports in the world.I always like nomad bases that are well-connected with a vast offer of flights, and Istanbul excels in this area.The new airport has flights to every continent and is one of the busiest on the planet. Whether you want to continue your journey to South America, Russia, Southeast Asia, or Australia, you'll find a flight.Here is my summary of why Istanbul is a great base for digital nomads:Sign up for our new newsletter to stay informed with up-to-date curations from our editors:👇",https://miro.medium.com/max/2700/1*u47U9ob7GJqx71PhBClRIQ.png,https://medium.com/world-travelers-blog/6-reasons-why-istanbul-is-a-great-base-for-digital-nomads-ad7feb70090f,travel,843f3fc5069c8946ab62947109ef4ce663c244593b12ba6024162067
Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Multiplayer Review,"Call of Duty as a franchise is something I've had an on-again-off-again relationship with. The first game I played in the series was Black Ops 2, one of the highest-rated titles in the franchise, and with good reason.I played Black Ops 2 on my PlayStation 3 so much I actually got to Prestige 2 before my attention was completely diverted when I finally got a copy of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I've never had a first-person shooter game captivate me quite like Black Ops 2 did, especially when it gave me the incredibly satisfying feeling of mowing enemies down with a machine pistol, the KAP-40.Luckily, to my pleasant surprise, Activision has brought back some of the things I loved about Black Ops 2 into their latest title. In this review, I hope to answer the question, ""is Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War worth the $60 asking price?""Like many of my fellow Call of Duty veterans, I bought the game for the online multiplayer mode. Team Deathmatch is and always will be a fantastic, simple gameplay mode players can enjoy over and over again.The objective of Team Deathmatch is simple: two teams of 5-6 players each run around the map shooting each other until one team scores 100 points (1 kill = 1 point.) The more kills you get, the more opportunities you have to use Scorestreaks: powerups that help increase your chances of winning the match.The most common powerup you'll see is the Spy Plane. It's one of the easiest to unlock and is pretty helpful during a fight, allowing you to see where enemy targets are on the map. The Spy Plane is the 80s equivalent of Black Ops 2's UAV, keeping the winning formula for the series alive.In the menu screen, weapons are highly customizable, featuring as many as 54 possible attachments. You can equip up to 5 of these on your primary weapon, or up to 8 with the Gunfighter Wildcard equipped.The more kills you gather with your selected weapon, the more it levels up along with your character, providing you with new attachments and camouflage to customize. This feature has been carried over from Activision's second most recent release, Modern Warfare, and I'm bittersweet about the mechanic.On the one hand, customizing your weapon in a video game to this level of detail hasn't been done before, and it's pretty cool to see how attachments actually have a meaningful impact on your playstyle. On the other hand, it makes me miss the Black Ops 2 days where you could have 9 possible attachments, 3 of which you could apply to your weapon, and that was it.The complexity and sheer variability of the current weapon customization system might be intimidating for some and turn off others who just want to drop into a lobby and blow off steam by blowing off another player's head.A trend that has been plaguing the gaming industry as of late has been microtransactions, small payments game companies incentivize you to pay to increase your overall enjoyment of the title. Fortnite has V-Bucks to customize your character's looks and emotes, Watch_Dogs, Assassin's Creed, and others have DLC packs to increase the number of missions/levels in the game, and Call of Duty has both its own currency and a Season Pass upgrade.You can pay money to buy Call of Duty points and use those points for weapon and character cosmetics, and by purchasing the Season Pass you can unlock more weapons, player skins, calling cards, and other digital goodies by regularly playing the game.This content should already be included in the $60 price of a game instead of something that has been intentionally removed and resold to the general public. We've gotten to a point where there are multiple editions of the same game for sale available on launch day, a ""base"" edition for $60, a ""deluxe"" edition for $70, and a ""gold"" edition for $100.The problem I have with the two most recent versions of Call of Duty is how after every match, you're shown a progress tracker of your character through the current season and all the items you could be unlocking if you purchased the Season Pass. I've already paid $60 for the game, why should I pay more?Don't get me wrong, cosmetics are fantastic additions to a game. But when most of them are locked behind paywalls, the average consumer won't be able to enjoy them.One thing that has been kept in one form or another from Black Ops 2 is the Proximity Mine, aka the ""Bouncing Betty"" of Black Ops Cold War. The Proximity Mine serves as a Field Upgrade or what I refer to as another Scorestreak that's accessible to anyone regardless of how poorly they're doing in a given match.By pressing both L1 and R1 on your PS4 controller or LB and RB on Xbox, you can place a mine that will jump up and detonate when an enemy walks near. Strategic placement of your Proximity Mine is key: if an enemy spots it, they can shoot it to prematurely cause detonation, rendering your advantage useless.There's something inherently gratifying about placing a mine behind a corner, moving to a different part of the map, and getting a notification onscreen letting you know some unfortunate player blew himself up.The other thing I loved about this iteration is the inclusion of some maps from Black Ops 2, namely, Express and Raid. Both have been touched up a little to reflect the 80s time period your characters are fighting in, and the sense of nostalgic familiarity I have with the maps add to my overall gameplay experience. I find myself coming back to play even if I'm losing a match on these maps just because they remind me of the great times I had playing Black Ops 2 back when I was fifteen.Call of Duty isn't the same as it used to be. The influence of microtransactions and the increasing complexity of games has taken the industry by storm, and these trends don't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.I enjoy a lot of things about Black Ops Cold War. The gunplay feels nice, the 80s themed maps are refreshing, the inclusion of maps and the 80s version of a Bouncing Betty from Black Ops 2, and the time period are all great reasons to pick up this game and give it a try.Is it worth the $60 asking price? To a veteran Call of Duty player, yes. But for those seeking to play a solid first-person shooter, I wouldn't recommend picking this up for anything above the $45 mark.

Future prospects & the ,"In the past ten years, with the continuous growth of available and usable big data, the fourth paradigm as a new scientific research paradigm has attracted more and more attention from scientists at the same time, many shortcomings have been exposed.For example data uncertainty problem, data complexity problem, data dimension explosion problem, data scale boundary problem. At present, the major issues facing network science, brain science, social science and other fields are extremely complex and dynamically changing problems, using simple experiments like classical physics (first paradigm) and theoretical deductions based on axioms and hypotheses (second paradigm), model-based computer simulation (third normal form) and data-driven correlation analysis (fourth normal form) can not be solved. For this reason, scientists have begun to seek a new scientific research paradigm that is closer to the nature of data and intelligence, and more effectively understands complexity and uncertainty.At present, this kind of new scientific exploration methodology has not yet formed a final conclusion. Generally speaking, this kind of new scientific research paradigm is immersive embodied research with intelligence as the research goal. Temporarily call it the ""fifth paradigm"".The ""fifth paradigm"" focuses more on the interaction between people, machines and data, and emphasizes the decision-making mechanism of people. The integration with data analysis embodies the organic combination of data and intelligence; the ""fifth paradigm"" emphasizes the ontological perspective of data, and believes that data itself contains the laws of natural intelligence, and is also the carrier and product of new intelligence. It is expected to be driven by data. While being intelligent, it breaks through the boundaries of existing computational intelligence capabilities and constructs a new intelligent paradigm with the help of natural intelligence.At present, the exploration of the ""fifth paradigm"" has just started, and its basic characteristics cannot be summarized methodologically; but it is certain that an important feature of it is ""fusion"", which requires the integration of the first four paradigms and integration. New methods emerging from cutting-edge research such as statistics, network science, and brain science.Computers are used in the third and fourth paradigms the third paradigm is ""human brain + computer"", the human brain is the protagonist; the fourth paradigm is ""computer + human brain"", and the computer is the protagonist. The fifth paradigm not only emphasizes the ""organic integration"" of human brain and computer, but also may further learn from the calculation and decision-making mechanism of social system and human brain system, thereby paying more attention to the formal modeling of human and society in scientific research circuits. Integration with computing.The development of data science and computational intelligence has given birth to the ""fifth paradigm"" the development of the ""fifth paradigm"" is inseparable from the enrichment of data science and the breakthrough of computational intelligence capabilities.From the perspective of research objects, the ""Fifth Paradigm"" is a ternary space in which scientific research extends from the study of the physical world and human society to the integration of ""human-machine-object"";From the perspective of research goals, the ""fifth paradigm"" is not only a traditional scientific discovery, but also the exploration and realization of intelligent systems;From the perspective of research methods, the ""fifth paradigm"" emphasizes the immersive embodied research of people in the circuit. At present, it is still difficult to give a clear definition of the ""fifth paradigm"". Perhaps in 10-20 years, the characteristics of the ""fifth paradigm"" will become clear, and it may gradually become one of the mainstream paradigms of scientific research.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1252/1*7E9FF_eelQHv1vh0F1lNCg.jpeg,https://medium.com/cloud-believers/future-prospects-the-fifth-paradigm-of-data-science-7d2eb44fcc85,science,856c6b3b0725c1f37c5fdbf0cdb559b40fba98147efcc94973811808
Deepfake: Angel or Evil?,"By Haokun Liu, Hanzhi Ding, Wen Han TangThe technology for modifying photos and videos have been in use for many years. For example, a lot of people probably heard of or used Photoshop. In the film industry, we have seen so many movies with special effects, such as putting an alien spaceship above New York City. In recent years, with the flourishing of deep learning and artificial intelligence, this technology has ushered in another development and a new word, 'Deepfake' has come to our eyes.What exactly is Deepfake? This unique term has two components: deep and fake, where deep is the shortened form of deep learning. It refers to synthesizing videos, audio, or photos using deep learning techniques where the voice or face (or other characteristics) of a person would be swapped to another person's characteristics. Many might think that this is just another similar technology with traditional media modification. Still, by leveraging the power of neural networks and deep learning, this technique's outputs could be highly deceivable and outperform those conventional methods.The term 'Deepfake' was first brought up by a Reddit user in late 2017. Even though the name only came up in recent years, the technology idea has emerged since the last century. Its academic research history can be dated back to 1997 when a project called the Video Rewrite software was initiated that year, which can alter video footage using machine learning techniques. At first, the term 'Deepfake' only described particular videos where the person's face was exchanged using AI techniques, but as things progressed, its scope was extended to include other related applications, such as synthetic audio, where the voice was exchanged using similar techniques. The technology behind Deepfake can be applied in the marketing business, fashion business, film industry and other fields. However, as the popularity of Deepfake increases, many abominable issues also occurred. These issues include but are not limited to fraud, misleading public opinion, blackmailing, pornography with faces of actresses or actors swapped to other people and other conceivable things. Individuals who value the positive benefits of this technology in various industries have started to use the term 'Artificial Intelligence Generated Synthetic Media' to avoid the negative connotation under the name 'Deepfake'. And some also developed anti-Deepfake detection applications to help combating those negative actions.By reading this blog post, we hope that people not only can learn about Deepfake and its technology, they also realize how serious these negative impacts are and how important the careful use of technology is.Algorithm:First, we will introduce a few fundamental points about the Deepfake algorithm.The Face Swapping PipelineHere is a flow chart of face swapping from the article Exposing DeepFake Videos By Detecting Face Warping Artifacts.Start with face detection (green box) and face landmarks (red points). This step determines which area is going to be swapped. Transform matrix normalizes warp face area. Then the Deepfake model will take the normalized face image as input and return a synthesized face image. Use the same transform matrix to refine the shape and apply post-processing, including boundary smoothing, to the composite image.The kernel of Deepfake is an auto-encoder, which is an unsupervised deep neural network. The encoder takes data input, compresses it into a small code, and then the decoder regenerates the original input data from that code. The encoder and decoder have to be trained together but can be used separately. To swap two faces, it needs one encoder and two decoders. In each round, encode two warped faces first. Then, let decoder A identify and convert face A, and let decoder B do the same to face B. Repeat the above operations until the two decoders can convert the two faces and capture the key information of the faces. Finally, by applying decoder B on encoded face A, face A is swapped to B.Generative Adversarial Networks improve the Deepfake algorithm. GAN is a deep neural network including a generative model and a discriminative model. When generating images, the generative model G produces the faked image, and the discriminative model D tries to detect the fake one. The algorithm is straightforward: G takes a noise variable z and generates an image G(z), then D will output the probability D(G(z)) and D(x) where x is a real photo set.During the training, the generator G's goal is to produce an indistinguishable image and to fool the discriminator - maximize D(G(z)). Meanwhile, the purpose of discriminator D is trying to separate the image generated by G from the training image set - maximize D(x) and minimize D(G(z)). In this way, G and D constitute a dynamic min max game process, making the final output very close to a real one.Each decoder is a generator now, and it will let the discriminator distinguish the generated image in each turn.Application:What is the future of Deepfake, and which area will be used for Deepfake technology? I would like to share some existing cases and let you imagine. Here's a little sampler from Jordan Peele and BuzzFeed, using some of the latest AI techniques, to make Peele ventriloquizes Barack Obama. The sampler had Obama voiced his opinion on Black Panther (""Killmonger was right"") and called President Donald Trump ""a total and complete dipshit.""Peele's production company used a combination of Adobe After Effects and the AI face-swapping tool FakeApp. FakeApp is the most prominent example of how AI can facilitate the creation of photorealistic fake videos.Researchers have developed tools that let you perform face swaps like the one above in real-time. The system was designed by researchers from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics, and Stanford University. First, the ""target actor"" (Bush, Trump, Putin, and Obama) is rendered with a neutral expression. Then, the source actor's expressions (the other guy) are captured via webcam, and those expressions control the animation in the YouTube video.Adobe is also creating a ""Photoshop for audio"" that lets you edit dialogue as easily as a photo. It is working on a new piece of software that would act like a Photoshop for audio, according to Adobe developer Zeyu Jin, who spoke at the Adobe MAX conference in San Diego, California, in 2016. Project VoCo is designed to be a state-of-the-art audio editing application. Beyond your standard speech editing and noise-cancellation features, Project VoCo can also apparently generate new words using a speaker's recorded voice. Essentially, the software can understand the makeup of a person's voice and replicate it.Deepfake Generation Example:Here's a brief introduction to how to make a very simple fake video, such as replacing faces with anyone in a video. FaceSwap is a tool that uses deep learning to recognize and exchange faces in images and videos. To make a fake video, you will have to:● Gather photos and/or videos● Extract faces from your raw photos● Train a model on the faces extracted from the photos/videos● Convert your sources with the modelWe first gather some photos, then run:python faceswap.py extractThis will take photos from the src folder and extract faces into the extract folder. Then, run:python faceswap.py trainThis will take photos from two folders containing pictures of both faces and train a model that will be saved inside the models folder.Finally, run:python faceswap.py convertThis will take photos from the original folder and apply new faces into the modified folder. The idea is to use a face-to-face converting deep learning model you just trained and apply it to the original image.They even have a GUI version, which doesn't require you to write a line of code. However, you should always remember the Manifesto:● FaceSwap is not for creating inappropriate content.● FaceSwap is not for changing faces without consent or with the intent of hiding its use.● FaceSwap is not for any illicit, unethical, or questionable purposes.● FaceSwap exists to experiment and discover AI techniques for social or political commentary, movies, and any number of ethical and reasonable uses.The Ethical Problems of Deepfake:Besides the usual use of Deepfake technology, it also created a lot of ethical issues that could harm both individuals and the public. A sample issue of fraud caused by Deepfake might be a scene described in the following: you received a voice message from your parents who asked you to transfer 100 thousand dollars to a new-created bank account for some emergencies. The message also explained that they recently changed their phone number. Of course, you could recognize your parents' voices and talking styles, so you believed this message and made the transfer. However, after this, you received a second message from the same number and asked you to make another transfer, you finally grew suspicious and dialed your parents' original number and found out that this was a fraud. Regarding this, we can see that unlike traditional phone scams, with Deepfake, the scammers can even forge the authentic voices and talking style of a person with a low cost and high quality, and make it difficult for victims to distinguish between real and fake. However, not only audio, highly synthetic videos or photos can also make people believe in something that never happened, which usually could reduce people's vigilance and result in huge losses.Another massive problem would be the production of synthetic pornography. The creation of the word 'Deepfake' actually came with made-up porn videos with actresses or actors' faces swapped to celebrities.' But this does not only happen to celebrities; it is also possible for ordinary citizens to be seriously affected. For instance, some may use the related techniques to retaliate against others by sabotaging their reputations, hurting people around them, or using them for blackmail.Also, apart from identifying fake stuff from reals, there might be another issue where people start to treat real ones as fake.In addition to personal harm, Deepfake may also cause damage to the public interest. The public may be guided intentionally by fake videos, photos, or audio, which might appeal to the public and difficult to distinguish from actual ones.There might be other incidents brought by Deepfake that can be severely harmful and raise concerns. We believe that all these would be profoundly serious issues that people need to be aware of when understanding the concepts of Deepfake.Anti-Deepfake:Due to its ethical problems, people have been trying to find the techniques to fight against DeepFake. Let's start with a quiz on Spot Deepfakes https://www.spotdeepfakes.org/There is a Hybrid LSTM and Encoder-Decoder Architecture developed by researchers at the University of California, Riverside. The whole approach has three steps: (1) using the LSTM network, dividing the image into patches, observing these patches pixel by pixel, and extracted resampling features. The key point here is to find the distorted natural statistics at the boundary of tampered regions (2) using a convolutional encoder on the whole image. (3) using a decoder network to generate two heat maps for predicting manipulated and non-manipulated classes. Then a finer spatial map indicates the manipulated regions in an image.Besides, Sensity(formerly Deeptrace) provides a powerful defense against weaponized deepfakes with their Detection API. Their free API can tell if the uploaded photo is fake.Conclusion:In this blog post, we have introduced the basic knowledge and some possible industrial applications about Deepfake. We also talked about a lot of negative consequences brought by the abuse of the use of Deepfake and the things we can do to prevent or fight against them. We hope that by exploring our writing, more people will be able to see another picture of infinite possibilities brought by technology innovation and also be aware of the perniciousness caused by improper use of technology.References:Faceswap-GAN.

How to Use Neuroscience to Better Your Writing,"Whenever we talk about writing, the conversation almost always revolves around language and grammar. These tools serve to express the beauty in the work of art that is writing.Everyone loves art. Readers constantly drool over any piece of well-written content, and the authors are heavily applauded. However, a considerable disconnect exists between the appreciation most writing gets, and whether or not it serves its intended purpose.Writing is meant to convey some information. It wouldn't be of great benefit to readers if they were to go through a piece and fail to get the message, no matter how good the writing is. Sadly, this common in so many cases.We are living in an age where information, news, and entertainment are abundant commodities available on multiple platforms.Every day, readers have to sift through a ton of data to find what they are looking for. The resulting decision fatigue compromises both their attention span and their ability to grasp the message.As such, the means used to convey a message goes a long way into ensuring that readers get the most out of it. To communicate effectively, writers need to recognize the existence of subtle neurocognitive mechanisms involved in language and information processing.The good news is that we are in luck. Recent developments in the field of cognitive neuroscience are seeking to provide clear-cut, science-based approaches on how to optimize the writing process. The goal is to expose writers to the powerful subconscious tools that govern how the reader's brain appreciates written content.Renowned author and communication strategist Yellowlees Douglas, in her book, The Reader's Brain: How Neuroscience Can Make You a Better Writer, explores this in broad detail.Her bracing, mordant, and lucid words show that good writing is a skill we can learn - and that the best way to do it is not to disregard grammarians and style gurus but to understand what goes on in the mind of the reader.Here are a few research-backed highlights from the book that will transform your writing.To prime is to prepare somebody for something.A journal published in Nature indicates that priming is an excellent form of implicit learning.Implicit learning is the learning of complex information in an incidental manner, without awareness of what has been learned.By exposing experimental subjects to lists of random words, researchers discovered that the earlier exposure triggered accurate recall the following day, even though the subjects didn't know they would be tested later.The results of the experiment translate to writing. When you tell readers the purpose of your writing in the first sentence or paragraph, you make it easier for them to understand the subject matter and increase their recall of later contentThe readers will subconsciously know what to expect from the piece even when their attention wanders in between.According to Yellowlees Douglas:For instance, I recently wrote a science piece titled: How Virtual Reality Can Be Used to Manage Pain. In the opening paragraph, I begin by establishing: ""Chronic pain is one of the major reasons people seek medical counsel. Yet, the available therapies are still ineffective or cause unbearable adverse effects. Virtual reality is emerging as an efficient, drug-free alternative to manage both acute and chronic pain.""My opening paragraph primes the reader to the context of the challenge at hand, that of chronic pain and the existing difficulty in managing it. It proceeds to offer a possible solution which is VR. The readers expect to be told not only how VR can be used to manage pain, but also why the new therapy is noteworthy considering that we already have existing pain management protocols.Priming is similar to providing a subtle ""table of contents"" to outline the major learning points the reader should look out for.The last item in the ""tell them"" triad mentioned previously refers to what psychologists call the recency effect. Recency implies something that happened or appeared not long ago.The recency effect is a phenomenon that when people are asked to recall in any order the items on a list, those that come at the end of the list are more likely to be recalled than the others.Recent information is better remembered and receives more weight in forming a judgment than does earlier presented information.For example, if we describe a person with three positive traits followed by three negative traits in that order, the individual will be more negatively evaluated compared to if the order was reversed.In writing, if you want some point to remain salient in the reader's mind, you should finish with it. This is because the readers remember final sentences in paragraphs, items in lists, and paragraphs in documents more clearly than anything else they read.The mechanism behind the recency effect involves the memory formation processes. The recency effect is dependant on short-term memory. Short-term memory is the ability to hold a small amount of information in the mind for a brief period.Short time memory is limited in both duration and capacity. It lasts between 20 and 30 seconds without active rehearsal. The only way to ensure that the information is retained is to recall It within the shortest time.A good example of this is trying to memorize a phone number someone has read to you a few seconds ago. Without reciting it a few times, you will forget it.The same mechanisms apply to writing. The takeaway from the piece should be presented in the summary to reinforce the reader's grasp of the information. If you assume that you already conveyed the information earlier on and fail to reinforce it, it will quickly fade from the reader's memory.The recency effect is one of the best effective communication skills you can leverage due to its importance in the formation of lasting memory.A cause is something that produces an event or condition; an effect is what results from an event or condition.It is within human nature to ask why and how. Readers want to know what led you to come to the kind of conclusions you present. They want to perform their analysis of the factors in question to see whether they agree with you.And if your writing is based on definite scientific facts, they are still interested in having some background information on the science behind the facts.When you turn sentences into micro-narratives of cause and effect, you make your writing easier to read and recall.The purpose of cause and effect is to determine how various events relate in terms of origins and results. Research has shown that cause and effect explanations enable people to grasp new information adequately. This is because they allow readers to make inferences and reason out the facts presented in a story.The readers will feel like they are more involved in the story rather than having everything presented to them in a way that they can't perform their analysis.You must already know this from all the fuss language experts make about the passive voice. What you might not know is how the passive voice affects your writing from a neuro-scientific perspective.The passive voice is more ambiguous to interpret and places a higher load on working memory.The sentence ""The dishes were washed by Anne"" requires absorbing an action with no actor then parsing a supporting phrase. The reader still has to infer that ""Anne"", the object in the supporting phrase, is the actor that was missing.There are a lot of moving parts in the sentence that have to be held in working memory. They have to be collected and assembled into something coherent to produce meaningful communication.A journal published in 2013 explores the intricate neurological implication of the passive voice in sentences. Researchers listened to passive and active sentences and performed a sentence-picture verification task using functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI).Passive sentences elicited greater activation of brain regions that process complex syntax compared to active sentences.They concluded that when writers use passive construction, readers' brains show more activity- and reading speed slows down, no matter how simple the content is.The moderate use of the passive voice is plausible when it's unavoidable. However, it should be kept to the minimum.Let's face it, readers approach articles with over-ambitious expectations that sometimes a writer can't deliver.When delivering bad news, the structure is everything. There's so much that qualifies to be bad news, no matter how insignificant it may seem.Studies show that delivering bad news in the first paragraph creates unwarranted resistance and hostility to the rest of the message. It will result in a cognitive bias that interferes with the reader's perception and reception of the vital information.An appropriate way to do it is to prime the reader with a neutral opening paragraph, one with content that's neither misleading nor straight-to-the-point bad news.Open the second paragraph with a rationale for the unwelcome part of your message. Then embed the most lethal content in a minor clause in the dead center of the paragraph. Close that paragraph with a neutral sentence, mentioning whatever benefits you can conjure to offer your reader.Finally, craft a short, positive paragraph as your closing that's forward-looking, maintaining your readers' goodwill by using the article's recency position.In summary, delivering negative news should involve a buffer or cushion statement, an explanation, the negative news itself, and a redirecting statement.Your readers will get the message without getting hostile towards it.Picture this; our brains have evolved from that of primitive ape-like cave dwellers to complex ones that can interpret letters to evoke sounds and meanings.Therefore, writing, reading, and everything in between is part of a learning process that our brains can be trained to accomplish. It is important to recognize that writing is not only an art but also a science.Take time to understand the subtle neuro-cognitive mechanisms involved in language and information processing. Only then will you be sure that your work makes the most impact on the reader.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/0*Q4w5gfFiRrtOn4sc,https://medium.com/@leonokwatch2/how-to-use-neuroscience-to-better-your-writing-6bbea9a741a1,neuroscience,872f32fe65eb23593f7d36cf9c57de1224493d238eb7f66c92d8e4ba
The Ultimate Backlink Strategy SEO Guide For A Smart 2021,"Backlinks are links from one website to a page on another website. Backlinks typically come from what is known as a referring domain. A single referring domain may generate tens of thousands of backlinks.Earning high-quality backlinks is a very challenging part of SEO. Nonetheless, it is an essential part of ranking high with search engines. The links strategy, part of which being the backlinks strategy accounted for 18-21% of rankings obtained in 2020, hence why it's worth addressing.A backlinks strategy is the approach used for managing backlinks and acquiring new backlinks.Here is an end-to-end guide on managing backlinks smarter in 2021.Google and other major search engines consider backlinks ""votes"" for a specific page. Pages with a high number of quality backlinks tend to have high organic search engine rankings.Backlinks are important because they:This includes reaching out to any partners, bloggers, external parties, suppliers, and other business associations, which have mentioned the company but have not linked to it and asking them to do so.A contextual link is a type of link, usually found within the body of content and is in context with the idea surrounding the link. This type of link is highly valuable as context and semantics are becoming more and more valued in the process of content interpretation in search engine algorithms.Here are some strategies you can use to gain such links:In order to do this, simply be the best at something. On a more serious note, best of X articles and blog posts are being written every minute of every day, so finding out what customers, visitors, and readers like about your company or content is the first step in knowing who to reach out to for links.For instance, Canva is pretty good at introducing graphic design to non-designers (and, it's also free), so it would reach out to bloggers, who compare different free image editing software for people with no professional experience. That way by introducing their company and product, it could get a shot at being featured as part of a 'Best free graphic design software for beginners' list.By using your expertise and unique data, you can become a source for other bloggers and journalists.To start, simply subscribe to HARO (Help A Reporter Out). This is a free service that connects expert sources (like yourself) with bloggers and journalists who are looking for contributors. Here is how content requests look like in the email when received.You can also reach out to journalists directly.Make updates to your old content. It takes less work and delivers faster results.According to Neil Patel, by doing this you can obtain a spike in search traffic, improve your click-through rate, improve your content's accuracy, and improve your site's overall freshness.Here are some quick-fire tips to implement this straight away:Everyone loves a tool that helps. A while ago, I was astounded to find out that Adobe has a free background remover tool, having observed that this can be used by people frequently for doing quick photo editing work, but also mentions and (likely) conversions, too.In a nutshell, here's how to get started:An Ultimate Guide is a piece of content designed to be the best, most comprehensive resource on a given topic. It covers enough information that you don't need to go elsewhere to learn more about that subject.The reason why these Ultimate Guides attract inbound backlinks is that they help bloggers and journalists reference a concept they mention.Infographics are probably the most common visual asset used to earn backlinks. It's always good to experiment with them if you haven't done it before. Check out how to optimize infographics and images for SEO, regardless of whether you have beginner or advanced SEO knowledge.However, if you feel infographics don't work well for your brand, here are a few other visuals you might consider creating:Listing your website on online directories goes a long way in helping improve your presence on the web.It's important to find high-traffic directories with authority links in order for this strategy to be successful.This tactic involves reaching out to a website that has a broken outbound link (a link to an external source) and suggesting they update it with a link to one of your pages. Of course, your page has to be a good resource on the topic to which they were originally linking, so it makes sense to swap the broken link with yours.The challenge with this tactic is, of course, finding these broken links. We can do this by using tools such as Deepcrawl's reports:Testimonials and reviews help in customers' purchase decisions. They help improve rankings, establish trust and credibility, and earn trustworthy mentions.In this article, Julia McCoy shares how you can use this approach in four steps as part of your backlinks strategy.Digital PR involves gaining high-quality backlinks from websites and online publications and honest customer reviews.These tactics help sites reach their target customers by featuring the business on websites they read, podcasts they listen to and the social media accounts they love.A good, free and quick way of doing so is by posting as a business on platforms such as Medium, Vocal, and LinkedIn. Why not jump on a trend and hop on Clubhouse while you are at it? The golden rule applies here, as per usual, namely: create meaningful, noteworthy, showstopping content that your users will love and share, otherwise - best not bother.The skyscraper technique involves mirroring and improving upon the content of top performers in the key ranking positions for your desired keywords.Here is the holistic approach followed, regardless of which tactic is used, anytime an external stakeholder is involved:The outreach effort itself, while in its first instance is about creating a connection, in the long-term it's all about building a relationship.Not all links have the same value. Links that come from authoritative sites will improve your search rankings more than links from low-quality sites.So, as you conduct your link building outreach efforts, know which sites are worth pursuing, and only reach out to qualified sites worth your time and effort.Check out this guide on how to assess the quality of a backlink, before you outreach to them.To identify sites that are likely to link back to your website, first look at the sites that link back to your competitors.Click on any backlinks website to get the exact URL that links to the competitor.View the type of content that links to your competitor and then send a request to the publisher to publish a link to your website in the same capacity.Give them a compelling reason that adding your business to the list will improve their readers' experience.Linking pages that are guest posts, also indicate that the site is a great guest blogging opportunity for your brand as well.If you're producing quality content and actively engaged in outreach efforts, you will start to receive mentions of your brand on other sites.Ensure each mention of your brand includes a link back to your site.Set up a Google Alert for your brand name and regularly search for your branded terms to find mentions of your brand. If the mention doesn't include a link back to your site, reach out to the publisher and request it.Just as some website publishers don't always link when they should, they might also include links that are broken or incorrect.When you see a broken link on a website (that is relevant to your brand or industry), contact the publisher, notify them of the error, and provide a link back to your site that would be a good replacement.Images embedded in websites often include a link to their source. Sometimes, these links are not pointing to the appropriate site, or they are broken.Keep an eye out for these opportunities as well, especially if a website has linked to one of your graphics.Ensure that all of your graphics used on other sites appropriately link back to your site.Relationship building is about leveraging your partnerships and contacts to grow your backlink profile.The best relationships are the ones where both sides gain something through the connection. So as you engage in link building activities, spread the benefit to both sides.Link to other sites to improve your chances of getting links back to your website. Linking to another site can help you get on their radar.In the SEMrush Audience Insights report, you can enter up to 5 competitors to compare against. Once you enter the domain you will see the Audience Overlap graph. This will display each of the domain's audiences and where they overlap with each other.This helps you start the relationship, but it also increases your chances that the site you link to will return the favor.When you feature a brand on your website, the brand is likely to mention the post (and might link back to it) on their website.The brand is also likely to share the post through their media distribution and social networks, which provides even more benefits and exposure.Another way to get high-quality backlinks is by offering to give an interview or contribute to roundup posts.You can also get your name and link back on websites by offering to write testimonials or leave a review about another brand.Choose the top tools or brands you work with and contact them to offer to write a review about your experience.Brands are usually eager to feature testimonials on their site and often link back reviewers in the credit line.Build high-quality backlinks by making connections offline. A perfect way of doing so is by hosting an event or sponsoring a meetup or conference.The presence of COVID has made digital conferences a casual thing, so make sure to capitalize on this trend, as this significantly reduces the costs necessary to host a digital meet-up.When you host the event, you can gain links from event listing sites, and you typically get a link on the event page when you sponsor a meetup or conference.A strong social strategy helps drive traffic to your content and increase your exposure, which is great for your brand and also your link building efforts.Sharing your content and making it easy for others to share your content, and helping your posts get maximum exposure on social networks can and will improve your site's SEO.Backlinks are often quite a difficult aspect of the SEO strategy as they involve thought, outreach and relationship-building. Many specialists avoid this part of SEO, precisely as quite a huge part of its success depends on other people's perception of the content, and its value.Without it though, there is a high risk in operating in an echo chamber, creating content only for search engines and not for users, which is exactly what Google downranks and what good SEO specialists avoid supporting.",,https://medium.com/bite-sized-marketing/the-ultimate-backlink-strategy-guide-for-a-smart-2021-df6c195bfab,marketing,879dbc6f2454ce42afe23ca54cf71f2c271e201276af7c8b3ea8666f
How Doubling My Earnings Taught Me The Reality of Freelance Hustling,"You've got to go big or log off the computer.I've never been so tired in my life.Lately, my eyes have taken on a heavier weight, my attitude has been shorter, and my body is slower.I've worn my exhaustion like a badge of honor because it's a symbol of just how much energy I have thrown into my newfound side hustle - freelance writing.I published my first story just under a month ago - 25 days to be exact.Within 25 days I have managed to crank out 26 published stories and double my earnings from January to February. It didn't come easily by any means.I've truly stepped into the world of what some may call 'entrepreneurship' and others call 'self-employment'.Whatever it is, these past 3 weeks have taught me what it truly means to be a hustler.The grind doesn't stop when you hit 'publish'. The real work begins after you submit your story.In the past year, for various reasons I've developed insomnia. I've found that I am lucky if I can stay asleep for more than 2 hours at a time.After I started freelancing, my sleep troubles have increased tenfold. It's as if my mind and body know that there is more work to be done.No matter what you do in life, networking will always be a key player in your success.For the first time in my life, I am an active user of Twitter.Initially, I created my account so that I could utilize the platform to advertise my work. However, I quickly came to realize that it's a great way to connect with other writers.I am can bounce ideas off of others and share my experiences while taking in other peoples.To be fair, I am expanding my audience which is giving my work more exposure but I am also a contributing member of a creative community.Ask me how many Medium-specific Facebook groups I am juggling at the moment. Actually, please don't because it's almost embarrassing.Honestly, without a huge following, I have found that I spend about 75% of my time promoting my work.I post links to my story any chance that I can get without being that 'spammy' asshole.Although, I have to promote my work as much as I can it's an integral part of my success.For full transparency, much like many other writers on Medium that I've come to find, I decided to try my hand at freelance writing because of Shelby Church's YouTube video.I had never even heard of Medium before, but the prospect of making a few thousand dollars off of an hour's worth of writing was enticing.I will tell you that I have not made over a thousand dollars ... yet.However, I have had a financial gain - a considerable one at that. But, with freelancing, your income isn't always going to be consistent and you have to be comfortable with that.I shamelessly admit that I check my stats page probably every 10-15 minutes.To me, a big part of the success that I have had thus far is tracking the traffic that comes to my page.The first day I posted I managed to draw in a total of 3 views and today, I managed around 200.But, that's not the marker I hit yesterday and it might not be the marker I hit tomorrow.You can't control the internet - it is what it is.If I am being honest, I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to give up in the last 25 days.To work for yourself is exhausting, especially when you don't see the numbers that you'd like to. I am a lot more stressed these days because I am constantly wracking my brain for topics to write about.But, it's worth it.I believe it was Mark Twain that once said,I love to write. I am a writer. For as long as I can remember, I've loved to create stories, both fictional and non-fiction, that others can enjoy.The joy that writing brings me outweighs the amount of work it takes to build a name for my work.In the grand scheme of life, everybody likes to consider themselves a hustler. We are all trying to make a living, and most of us do the typical 9-5 grind Monday through Friday.Freelancing has shown me what it means to push the limits and work hard for your money.To be a successful writer goes beyond being able to crank out meaningful content. As a freelancer, you have to be able to market yourself in a way that makes people want to read your work.On top of finding people that want to support you, you also have to build a thick enough skin to accept that people aren't always going to be in your corner.Just because you had success today doesn't mean that you are going to have success tomorrow - that's when you have to work that much harder.I doubled my earnings from freelance writing but I am far, far, far from what most would deem a successful writer.I'm just an initiative away from being an all-encompassing hustler.",,https://medium.com/technical-excellence/how-doubling-my-earnings-taught-me-the-reality-of-freelance-hustling-4689ccff39e7,freelancing,910a6310f2e597f223642845ab30f2363cd9aa1784432a27c1e7b920
Here's what an immortal Italian plumber can teach you about quantum physics,"Or, what would Quantum Mario Bros. look like?During a lecture for Introduction to Quantum Computing, the topic of the Quantum Zeno effect came up. We'll get into the details of this, but essentially it says that - unlike a ""watched pot"" which eventually boils - a ""watched quantum pot"" never does boil. One of the students asked if this was similar to how Boo works in Super Mario Bros. The answer is almost, but no. However, we can use Boo to learn about quantum physics anyway!Nineties kids and younger millennial hipsters will have fond memories of Boo, the lovable ghost character introduced in Super Mario Bros. 3, the greatest video game of all time. If you are not familiar with Boo, you can see the game mechanics in this video:Here's the gist. If Boo touches Mario, Mario loses his power-up or dies (don't worry, he comes back to life). Boo chases Mario if Mario is not facing Boo. If Mario is looking at Boo, Boo covers its face and doesn't move. I made a simple animation summarising this.Characters in video games obey rules. These rules are coded by the developers intentionally - if the game behaves in a way not intended, it is called a bug. If you looked at all the lines of code needed to make a video game, you would be able to see the rules. Sometimes these rules are called physics. In some games the ""physics"" is actually real physics. For example, in Angry Birds, the rules the birds obey are the actual equations of motions invented by Isaac Newton over 300 years ago to describe gravity. The ""physics"" of the game is the physics of real life. Mario, on the other hand, doesn't obey the true laws of gravity when you make him jump. But, there was still a rule the character obeyed that we could call ""physics"". In any case, all of the rules coded into nearly every video game ever made are derivatives of Newtonian physics. Newton's laws are often called classical physics - the reason being that it has been superseded by modern physics, including quantum physics.What if the rules Boo obeyed were those of quantum physics?Disclaimer: if Boo obeyed quantum physics, we would not be able to see it do much of anything interesting on a screen because a screen displays classical information. The purpose here is to give you an intuition for some aspect of quantum physics. For a deeper understanding of quantum physics, you have to read this book.With that in mind, we ask: what if instead of super Mario, we had quantum Mario? Actually, scratch that - let's keep Mario classical. He will act as the scientist - or, as they are called in the quantum business, the observer. Instead, let's make Boo behave quantumly.The first difference between Classical Boo and Quantum Boo is that Quantum Boo doesn't move along a smooth path from start to finish. Quantum Boo is never found in the space between the starting point and Mario. Quantum Boo can only be found at its starting point or on Mario. The only thing that changes for Quantum Boo is the probability of catching Mario. This probability can be visualised as transparency. The more transparent Boo is, the less likely it is to find it there.Quantum Boo starts to disappear from its starting location and simultaneously reappears at Mario's location. After some time, Boo's probability of catching Mario is 100%. Before then, there is some chance that Boo has caught Mario and some chance that Boo hasn't moved at all. At this midpoint, Quantum Boo is in a superposition of both locations.Uh oh! Quantum Boo seems unstoppable. But wait! Mario has the power of observation - the power of quantum measurement. Whenever Mario looks toward Quantum Boo, Boo is only either found on top of Mario or at Boo's starting position. If timed correctly, Mario can force Quantum Boo back to its starting position with a 0% chance of catching him. Of course, Mario could get unlucky and turn to find Boo on top of him as well - it all comes down to a quantum coin toss!When Mario is not looking, Quantum Boo begins the transition. But this takes time. And, if Mario forces Quantum Boo to the starting position, the clock resets and Quantum Boo has to start the transition all over again. So, if Mario turns around often enough, he can force Quantum Boo to never move at all!Well, that's it. That is how a quantum Mario Bros. game would work. But now that your appetite is whetted, I know you want to dive deeper. So what are these principles of quantum physics on display in quantum Mario Bros.?In classical physics, the state of Boo is a list of all the important properties it possesses. Boo has a location, direction, speed, and whether or not it is hiding. Boo's position can be anywhere, which means the possible states are continuous. Continuous means any small change is another allowed state. You can't count the number of possible states in classical physics - it's uncountably infinite. In quantum physics, the possible states Quantum Boo can be found in are discrete and finite - you can count them.This is generally true in quantum physics, and the first identified departure from classical physics. In fact, a Nobel prize was awarded for this ""quantum hypothesis"" made in 1900. Now, if Quantum Boo can only be found in one of two locations, it must jump from one location to another without visiting the space between. Many of the early physicists studying the new quantum theory famously despised these ""quantum jumps"".Yet, Quantum Boo does somehow move continuously between the two locations in an ephemeral way. The probability of being in one location or the other changes continuously. An instant after Mario turns his head away from Quantum Boo, Boo ceases to be in the starting position. Boo is also not at Mario's position either at this point. In fact, Boo is in no definite position at all! This new state is called superposition. It's not here or there, and it's not both here and there. It is something entirely new.A lot of words are written about quantum superposition that are just plain wrong. Here they might have said Quantum Boo is in two places at once. But this is wrong - Quantum Boo is at neither location, so it can't be at both! When words are written that are correct about quantum superposition they are often contorted in unnecessary ways, as if they are skirting around some issue. The reason for this is the apparent need to always couch quantum physics in classical terminology. Well, here is a better analogy for quantum superposition. Imagine you have blue and yellow flowers. You've always had blue and yellow flowers and that is all you know. One day, you decide to cross-breed them. You end up with a new color of flower. What do you call it? Do you call it blue and yellow? No. Do you waste an entire blog post about explaining why it is neither blue nor yellow? No. You simply give it a new name, green. That's quantum superposition. You can't contort it into classical physics language - it's just something new.Phew. I didn't mean to go off on that tangent. Now, where were we?Mario cannot ""see"" the quantum superposition state of Boo. Boo only occupies a superposition when Mario is not looking. There is no answer to what quantum superposition ""looks like"". As soon as Mario looks, Boo is either found on top of him or way back at Boo's starting location. Boo is never found in the space between. In quantum physics, Boo is said to have collapsed into the state it is found in.This is the source of the so-called measurement problem in quantum physics and at the heart of all the meta-physics and philosophy under the name quantum foundations. In short, the problem is that there are two rules for how Quantum Boo behaves. When no one is looking, Boo seems to spread out potentially occupying every allowed state. But, when someone decides to look, Boo jumps instantly to one of those states. Some physicists say that this is a problem because laws of physics should apply independent of whether physicists, or Italian plumbers, decide to look. After more than 100 years there is still no consensus on this problem beyond the fact that quantum physics works impressively well when applied in the laboratory.Zeno was the dictator of the galactic confederacy who brought billions of Teegeeack to Earth in a souped-up jumbo jet 75 million years ago only to kill them with hydrogen bombs releasing thetans which now stick to humans and cause spiritual harm. Wait. No. Wrong book. That was Xenu, not Zeno. My bad.Zeno (of Elea) was an ancient Greek philosopher known especially for his ""paradoxes"". Most of Zeno's paradoxes are little arguments for the impossibility of motion. Of course, we move all the time - hence the paradox. The most relevant one is the ""Arrow paradox"", which can be simplified as follows. At every instant an arrow is motionless (it is where it is). It takes time to move. But time is composed of instants. So it is always motionless. Therefore the arrow does not move.There have been many arguments given about this paradox that I won't repeat here. The simplest refutation is to deny that time is composed of instants of zero duration. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.Would you believe me if I told you that now you have all the knowledge and intuition to explain the quantum Zeno effect to your friends? (Maybe don't though unless quantum physics naturally comes up in conversation.)Boo starts at 100% probability of being in the starting state and that number smoothly goes to 0%. After a few instants then, the probability of being in the starting state is still, say, 99%. If Mario turns around, there is a pretty good chance that Boo is found in the starting state. When Mario turns away, Boo moves again into slight superposition, slowing increasing the probability of landing on Mario. But, if Mario turns around again quickly, Boo will surely be found back in the starting state.In other words, if Mario turns frequently enough, he can ensure that Quantum Boo never moves. It's the quantum Zeno paradox, as taught you by quantum Mario.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*1cfD2AD22yK-aegG,https://csferrie.medium.com/heres-what-an-immortal-italian-plumber-can-teach-you-about-quantum-physics-9b1f9d642bdd,science,932fdbfbcc85251a548a32d7855d889445d69ebf713d167599635fa8
10 business leaders fighting to make the Black experience a permanent part of corporate America,"These entrepreneurs, business and government leaders, and venture capitalists, are working to amplify Black voices across the country.By Marguerite Ward and Dominic-Madori DavisThis Black History Month seems different from those of recent years.There's an overwhelming outcry from the American public, specifically from Black people, people of color, and their allies, to combat systemic racism and enact equity.In May, video footage of the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, went viral, sparking an uproar. Business leaders denounced the killing and promised to do their part to effect change. Suddenly there was more attention put on the antiracist work of Black people and people of color, work that's been going on for decades.Against this backdrop, Insider teamed up with the National Black Chamber of Commerce - a nonprofit nonpartisan organization dedicated to the economic empowerment of Black people - to highlight 10 people on the front lines of advancing racial equity and inclusion in business.These Black entrepreneurs, business and government leaders, and venture capitalists are working to lift up Black and brown communities through their work. Insider spoke with them about the work they're doing, how the Black Lives Matter movement affected them, and their hopes.Harry Alford and his team at Humble Ventures have funded more than 50 Black-owned businesses in 2020 alone, some of which include a social network that centers communities of color and a fast-casual restaurant whose mission is to redefine healthy and affordable food for all.Alford said the Black Lives Matter movement validated his company's mission and gave him added motivation to keep investing in Black entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs of color. While he is optimistic about 2021, he thinks leaders in the business community will need to keep their focus on advancing racial diversity, equity, and inclusion.""I don't believe the problems that surfaced in 2020 will disappear with the shift of administrations,"" he said. ""We must continue to do the work. We need to listen. We need to learn. We need to speak up when we see injustice.""Naj Austin is an entrepreneur focused on building communities that foster inclusion and growth for people of color and their allies. Originally home to 150 members in Brooklyn, Ethel's Club has expanded to an online community in the wake of the pandemic, and has opened hubs across the US now serving at least 1,000 people. Her tech platform, Somewhere Good, a social network and marketplace for people of color, will be publicly available in the spring.Austin said the Black Lives Matter movement brought more people to the communities she's been working to build for years.""We had long been doing work centering and celebrating Black voices, so as folks started to look for places to heal, grieve, and talk online, we were ready,"" Austin told Insider.The founder also shared her top advice for anyone looking to start their own business.""I know how hard it is being a Black founder with the world stacked against you in almost every way,"" she said. ""My advice is to keep pushing and to lean on one another. If we build alongside one another, we can create a lot of magic in the world.""André Blackman is the founder and CEO of Onboard Health, an executive-recruiting company dedicated to building an inclusive future in the healthcare industry. His work focuses on helping talented professionals - including many people of color - get hired at companies building the future of healthcare across a variety of roles, including data science, engineering, and business development.The pandemic and Black Lives Matter have combined to put systemic racism top of mind for many private and public-sector leaders, especially when it comes inequities in healthcare. This surge in interest gave Blackman and his team a chance to help educate company leaders and lead recruiting efforts to change the face of health and healthcare in the US.""With many companies who made diversity commitment announcements, invested in equity work and truly took action last year - I'm hoping that we're able to at least begin to see the direct results of that work from 2020,"" he said, adding he was hopeful that companies will continue their DEI efforts in 2021.Marla Blow is the North American Lead in the Center for Inclusive Growth at Mastercard.Blow and her team has been focused on working with the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund and has teamed up with the Community Reinvestment Fund to help micro and small businesses obtain loans.Blow and her team at Mastercard have digitized the operations of the nonprofit microfinance organization Grameen America, allowing it to reach over 130,000 women with $1.6 billion in small-business loans, according to Blow.In response to the killing of George Floyd, she helped spearhead Mastercard's five-year $500 million commitment to help close the wealth and opportunity gaps in Black communities.""The horrific murder of George Floyd by the police put a harsh spotlight on the appalling wealth and opportunity gaps faced by Black Americans in the US,"" Blow told Insider. ""The reality we must confront is a financial system that has systemically disadvantaged and excluded Black communities throughout this country's history and contributed significantly to the inequality in our society.""Jeff Cherry is the founder and executive director of the startup accelerator Conscious Venture Lab and the founding managing partner of the Conscious Venture Fund. His work focuses on investing resources and capital in entrepreneurs behind companies focused on making the world a better place.""Talented people are equally dispersed across society, but opportunities are often limited by race, gender, or unconscious bias that have no bearing on the ability of the entrepreneur or their ideas,"" Cherry said.His work centers on supporting people who have traditionally been left out of the startup ecosystem. Since founding the accelerator in 2013, Cherry has invested more than 50% of the firm's capital in minority and female founders and has created more than 21 jobs for every $100,000 the firm has invested.The Black Lives Matter movement has drawn more investors to Cherry's work, and the work of other VC funds backing Black founders. When Freddie Gray was killed in Baltimore, in 2015, the fund committed to investing in underrepresented founders, Cherry said.""We committed our work then to investing in more minority founders and being a pathway to create racial equity and generational wealth in minority communities,"" he said. ""The public execution of George Floyd shocked the nation into action. Action to which we continue to support.""As associate chief technology officer for New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio, Gary Johnson leads NYCx Inclusive Innovation.NYCx Inclusive Innovation is an urban research and development program that works with entrepreneurs to develop solutions to problems in New York neighborhoods.For example, one group of founders developed a mental-health program for Latinx youth in underserved communities.""My mission is to break down the paradigms and silos that exist between underrepresented founders, venture-capital communities, and government innovation,"" Johnson said.In June, Johnson was selected to serve on the mayor's first task force for racial equity and inclusion. In this role, he helped the city make a $157 million investment in high-speed internet for 600,000 underserved New Yorkers, including 200,000 residents living in public housing.About $87 million of that investment was redirected from the New York City Police Department's budget.Johnson said he thinks the Biden-Harris administration will help spur more economic innovation on the state and local level, especially for marginalized communities.""There will be an increased demand for entrepreneurs in civic tech and urban innovation, to research, pilot, and rapidly scale solutions that address systemic inequalities, improve quality of life for citizens, and promote an inclusive economic ecosystem,"" he said.Obi Omile is the CEO of and cofounder of theCut, a software company that helps local barbershops manage everything from appointment scheduling to client relations.More than 8,000 barbers use the platform, he says. Since the company launched, in 2016, the app has been downloaded 2 million times and used to book 20 million appointments.""We're empowering barbers to become better entrepreneurs and to create the lives they want for themselves,"" Omlie told Insider. ""Barbers are some of the first business owners that young people meet in communities of color. With theCut, Barbers are able to build stronger businesses and continue to connect and lead within their communities.""TheCut has also teamed up with barbershops to provide haircuts to students in need, and the company has teamed up with the Kids in Need Foundation to send school supplies to students.During the pandemic, the company donated more than 5,000 face shields to nurses in New York and Tennessee and helped fundraise for barbershops. The company was affected by the pandemic at first, Omile said, but as states began to open up, it saw an uptick in business.""Our goal has always been to make barbers' lives easier,"" he said. ""In most rooms or conversations people will already have an opinion about you. It'll be your job to prove them wrong but also to help change the narrative and pave the way for others.""Rodney Sampson is the executive chairman and CEO of Opportunity Hub, a holding company committed to building racial equity in the technology, startup, and venture ecosystems. Through several programs, OHUB offers re-skilling, talent acquisition, startup support, fundraising, and DEI solutions to corporations, cities, and colleges.The program helps everyone from college students to more experienced talent find jobs. It also connects founders with entrepreneurship support programs. Sampson is also a partner of the 100 Black Angels & Allies Fund, which invests in the development of Black tech entrepreneurs.Speaking to Insider, Sampson said OHUB has sponsored over 1,000 Black, Indigenous, people of color from more than 400 colleges and universities to attend the conference SXSW through its OHUB.SXSW venture.Last year the company joined forces with Steve Case's Revolution Fund and Morgan Stanley to create a $2 million fund to invest in Black startups. For Black History Month, OHUB teamed up with UNC-Chapel Hill Kenan Flagler Business School to launch two certificate programs in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Solutions and Black Technology Ecosystem Investment.Creating policy and initiatives to help advance economic rights is key to the Black Lives Matter agenda, Sampson said. ""Black Tech and Black Lives Matter must be hand in hand in the continuing fight for human, civil, and economic liberty,"" he added.""It is important for big tech and the startup ecosystem to remember that racial equity must be sacrificial rather than performative,"" he said.Black entrepreneurs need to persist through their pain and scale their productivity to be successful, he said.DeShuna Spencer is the founder and CEO of kweliTV, a streaming service that focuses on showcasing the work of Black creatives.""Our mission has always been about amplifying and celebrating Black lives - even before the Black uprising that we began seeing last year after the horrific murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and many others before them,"" Spencer told Insider.Kweli means ""truth"" in the Swahili language and speaks to the company's mission to ""curate content that is an authentic reflection of the global black experience,"" Spencer said.She added that the Black Lives Matter movement has made her more intentional about her work and role as CEO. KweliTV created kweliGIVES, in which it donates 1% of its revenue to nonprofits in the Black community.Last year the service launched subscriptions and live channels on Comcast Xfinity, Cox, and DistroTV, and for the new year Spencer said the company was looking to explore revenue models and invest more in community building.""The media plays a huge role in how Black people are perceived,"" she said.""While I may not always be able to march in the street, I am using my platform to speak truth to power.""Stefanie Thomas is an early-stage investor at Impact America Fund.Impact America Fund is a Black female-owned and operated venture fund. About 80% of the CEOs Impact America Fund backs identify as a person of color, and 70% of them are led by a Black person. In October, IAF raised $55 million for a VC fund.""My passion lies in supporting scrappy entrepreneurs who are figuring out how to leave a footprint on the world along with a financial legacy for their families,"" Thomas said.""I am always looking for companies with high growth potential that are also defining what it means to scale solutions that power a more just and equitable economy.""Thomas also runs a digital resident program with a focus on infrastructure for the creative economy. She said this past year has brought forth ""an unwavering commitment"" toward centering Blackness in the nation's political and social dialogue.It has become ""the standard-bearer of what is fundamental to and inherently valuable for any organization that claims to care about Black Americans,"" she added.

"How Being Prolific Made Picasso, Bach, and Godin So Successful","What do Seth Godin, Pablo Picasso, and Johann Sebastian Bach all have in common? Yes, they're all uber-successful. But they're also all extremely prolific.Seth Godin, for example, has authored 20+ books in his life, all of which have been bestsellers. And despite his busy schedule, he's still been able to find time to write one new blog post a day for the last 10+ years.The great artist Pablo Picasso has been estimated to have created somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 works of art in his lifetime. That's around 1-3 new works of art a day.Similarly, composer Johann Sebastian Bach composed over 1,000 pieces of music. At his peak, Bach produced at least one new song a day.In the book ""Originals,"" Wharton professor Adam Grant says that in order to be a successful radical such as Godin, Picasso, or Bach, you have to be prolific.Unfortunately, most people are scared to be prolific because they're scared to be imperfect. Rather than put themselves out there, they'd rather spend years fine-tuning their ideas. But this strategy is a mistake.This is what Godin, Picasso, and Bach avoided. Instead, they focused on being prolific. And so should you.Now, you might be thinking that there's a trade-off between quality and quantity. That in order to do truly 'great work,' you can't do very much of it. But this just isn't true.In Originals, Adam Grant says,This is exactly what professor Jerry Uelsmann noticed while teaching his photography class at the University of Florida. On the first day of class, Uelsmann divided his film photography students into 2 groups.Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the ""quantity"" group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work they produced. If a student submitted over 100 photos, they would get an A in the class.Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the ""quality"" group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester, but in order to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image.Interestingly, however, at the end of the semester, Uelsmann was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the ""quantity"" group.How did this happen? It's simple. During the semester, the ""quantity"" students were busy taking hundreds of photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. As a result, they were able to hone their skills.The students in the ""quality"" group, on the other hand, didn't do any of this. Instead, they just student sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than one mediocre photo.Therefore, if you want to create work that is great, then you have to be prolific and not worry about whether or not your work comes out perfect.Over time, this will make you a better writer, film producer, or painter because creating a lot of work will provide you with a lot of feedback. This will allow you to learn from your mistakes, which in turn will allow you to get even closer to 'perfection.'Highly successful individuals such as Seth Godin, Picasso, and Bach are not reliable creators of great work. In other words, they don't always consistently create work that is great.Seth Godin, for example, has once said that over 50% of his posts are average. As stated earlier, Picasso created over 50,000 works of art in his life. However, Picasso is only known for about 10 pieces of art. Similarly, among the 50 greatest pieces of music ever created, 3 belong to Bach. But in order to create those 3, Bach had to write over 1000 songs.Not everything Picasso, Bach, and Godin created was innovative and revolutionary. But here's the even more interesting thing: Godin, Picasso, and Bach had no idea which one of their works were going to succeed and which ones would fail.None.According to Professor Dean Simonton, a psychologist who's spent many years studying creative productivity, he says,In fact, most of their works were misses. Oftentimes, we tend to think that people who are successful have somehow cracked the code to success. That everything they create is going to be a hit. But this just isn't true. Successful people are just as clueless as the rest of us.But then why are they so successful? Easy. Because they keep creating.In the book ""Maximize Your Potential,"" author Jocelyn K. Glei says,In other words, highly successful people have increased their chances of succeeding simply by producing a lot of work.Therefore, in order to create a few masterpieces of your own, you need to be willing to create a lot of garbage along the way.So whether you're a writer, an artist, or an ad exec, it's going to be extremely difficult for you to predict what is going to be successful and what isn't. I mean, if Picasso and Bach couldn't predict which of their works were going to succeed and which ones were going to fail, then you probably won't be the one who will be able to decide which of your ideas are going to succeed or fail either. Because of this, you always have to keep trying because the more times you try, the more likely that you will create successful designs, start-ups, or pieces of art.In an increasingly unpredictable world, you have to leverage the statistical advantage of randomness by producing a lot of work.Oftentimes, when we think of successful geniuses, we tend to think of them as some amazing human-being who possesses some magical ability.But successful geniuses like Bach, Godin, and Picasso aren't born geniuses at all. Instead, successful geniuses are just average people who have chosen to be highly prolific.Simonton says,In other words, being prolific is what makes Godin, Picasso, and Bach so successful, not their innate talent.So whatever your field of work is, start creating and make sure you create a lot. When you create regularly, success will strike regularly.If you resonated with this article then join thousands of others who have subscribed to my book club where I talk about the best ideas from the books I read.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1482/1*m9iNHEAg6jsVcjQ2jBlRWQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/mind-cafe/how-being-prolific-made-picasso-bach-and-godin-so-successful-5b6da7b76a47,productivity,971bc589f6480be3ef85329ec6ef6e610cca2f5eba5455655b807fd3
Crazy Simple Anomaly Detection for Customer Success,"The topic of anomaly detection is fascinating. There is a vast number of methods that can be used, from simple statistics to more complex unsupervised learning methods. Additionally, the impact of anomaly detection is huge. The ability to detect when things are not going as planned is a fantastic tool and one that has the potential to save lives (for example in preventive maintenance).In this article, we will explore an extremely easy approach to anomaly detection. Sometimes the simplest solutions can have the greatest impact. In this case, we'll use the median absolute deviation or MAD to detect possible outliers in the number of WhatsApp messages transacted by businesses.In the area of Customer Success, and in particular, in SaaS B2B companies, measuring our customers' product usage is paramount. In essence, SaaS businesses want to understand how their customers are using their product and how much they are using it. The reason behind it is that if customers are not using your product, it's very likely they are having some kind of trouble. It could be that they just don't understand how to use it, they are not getting value out of it or they are experiencing some sort of product bug. In any case, a drop in usage can result in customer churn. Among other things, the role of the Customer Success team is to identify cases where this could be happening and help those clients to ultimately lead them towards success.Besides regular checks using, for example, MBRs or QBRs (monthly or quarterly business reviews), the Customer Success team can assume a proactive attitude by understanding when customers are using their product less than usual. This is a perfect example of implementing anomaly detection. The idea is to detect anomalies in the usage data from every customer and have the Customer Success team reach out to those customers that are dropping their usage.The kind of data to be used is very specific to the business. If you are an e-commerce platform like Shopify, you might be interested in tracking sales, if you are an email marketing platform like MailChimp, you will be interested in emails sent. As I work in Sirena, an app that lets businesses communicate with their customers through WhatsApp, I will use data on WhatsApp messages usage. For this article, I will use randomly generated data of WhatsApp messages coming from a very simple simulation. This dataset is publicly available in my Github: FakeData/WhatsAppMessagesThe dataset contains the number of messages transacted by 4 different customers through a period of 10 weeks. To keep things simple, we will focus on only one customer; Customer 3.The median absolute deviation or MAD, is a very simple measure of variation in a sample. In that sense, it is quite similar to the standard deviation in terms of measuring statistical dispersion. The MAD is defined as being the median of the absolute value of the residuals between each observation and the median:However, a great advantage of the MAD in comparison to the standard deviation is its robustness or insensitivity to outliers. Both the mean and the standard deviation are highly influenced by outliers and therefore are extremely bad for anomaly detection. In their paper, Leys et al. (2013) show that many researchers are still using standard deviation for representing dispersion and suggest a change towards MAD instead. They even show how to calculate it using SPSS and R. In this post, I will show you how to use it in Python to detect anomalies or outliers.We'll start with looking at a single customer, Customer 3 in this case:You'll probably be quite surprised by how easy the implementation of this is. In fact, calculating the MAD is basically just one line of python:What that line is doing is defining a (lambda) function that takes a numpy array (x) and calculates the median for the element-wise absolute value of the difference between each x and the median of x. Which is exactly the definition of MAD. Simple.The only (very tiny) complication we face when calculating the MAD is that we would actually like to calculate a rolling MAD. But that's also quite straightforward using numpy:As you can see, first we calculate the rolling median and then we add the rolling MAD. We can plot how that looks together with the data to get a sense of what we are doing:We can see that the MAD is highly lagged, and that's OK. Remember we are not going for a hugely sophisticated anomaly detector or a predictive model. We just need to get a sense of what it would be ""normal"" usage changes for our clients.Great, now that we have our MAD, we need to define criteria to understand if an observation is an actual anomaly or not. To do this we'll add a threshold and create upper and lower bounds for our rolling MAD:Great! Now we can add those boundaries to the graph and see what we are dealing with:That's looking good! Now we have our MAD and a boundary that can help us determine if an observation is an anomaly or not. This means that for every point in time if the observation is above the upper bound or below the lower bound of the rolling MAD, we'll say that's an anomaly.In this specific case, it looks like that 50% threshold might be a little bit too tight. We can try changing that until we are comfortable with the number of false positives. We can try with 70%.Using this data we can very easily get a list of all the anomalies detected by our MAD implementation:The result shows us what the usage was for each day (values), what we expected to see (MAD) and the interval (upper and lower MAD).In this post, we have explored a very simple way of implementing anomaly detection for usage data using the median absolute deviation or MAD. Of course, there's a lot of tinkering you can do to adjust this to your specific use-cases, such as the rolling window, the threshold, or the decision on when to notify your team. I'm sure you can imagine a Slack integration notifying Customer Success Executives when one of their accounts has dropped their usage. However, if your product usage has a relevant seasonality, consider adjusting the notification service. For example, in our case, it doesn't make a lot of sense to notify CSEs if the drop in usage occurs during a weekend (usage is expected to drop during weekends). Another option is to have two MAD bounds, one for the weekend with a more permissive threshold and another one for weekdays with a more tight threshold. The possibilities are endless.ReferencesLeys, C., Ley, C., Klein, O., Bernard, P., & Licata, L. (2013).

A Long Slog Ahead for the 'Other Economy',"Headline economic numbers aren't capturing the distortions and depth of pain in the economy.An Uneven Recovery for Businesses and ConsumersThe new spate of headline economic numbers released in the past week show mostly improving numbers, but a deeper look reminds us why 'averages' are misleading when evaluating performance metrics. The uneven recovery and distortions we are seeing in the public markets are driven by stimulus packages shaped by ideology rather than problem solving pragmatism. The massive fiscal and monetary stimulus injected into the economy throughout the pandemic was spectacularly successful at adding fuel to large companies with access public markets (to the point that several companies saw their stocks soar even after filing for bankruptcy). Simultaneously, small businesses failed by the thousands as PPP proved inaccessible, too restrIctive or too complicated for many independent business owners. Stimulus checks spurred retail spending, but the bulk of this spending went straight to online retailers and technology companies that were already benefiting from the shift to online shopping. These companies were propelled to new heights and have been able to consolidate their competitive positions while brick and mortar businesses, especially small independents, languished and many failed. Before the pandemic many offline retailers were already under threat from online competitors and the pandemic merely accelerated the inevitable. However, experiential industries that were thriving pre-pandemic like the Restaurants industry has been particularly devastated by the crisis and somewhat impervious to government stimulus due in part to the industry's fragmentation, but because of restrictions in PPP that failed to understand the nature of these small businesses that already worked on small margins, and were quickly rooted out by qualification screening.A Deeper Look at the Economic NumbersAlthough the drop in the unemployment rate to 6.3% may seem like a return to a normal range, the massive exodus from the workforce seen last spring when the pandemic struck had a distorting effect on the usefulness of the headline unemployment number. A deeper look at other Labor metrics, such as the Employment-Population Ratio provide more perspective to the true Employment picture. During most economic crises, workers gradually leave the labor market after becoming frustrated with their job hunt, but the nature of this crisis caused people to immediately exit the job market. This was prompted by entire swaths of the economy, particularly brick and mortar retailers, restaurants and hospitality businesses shutting down or limiting their services. Although the Employment-Population Ratio has improved over the low of ~51% (a historic low). The first reading for February '21 at just 57.4% is a level not seen since 1983.The Employment-Population ratio reflects changes in demographics over time, so the long term trend is largely due to the aging US population, but that doesn't account for the large gap between the 61.1% in Feb 2020 and 57.5% in Feb 2021. A better representation of the current unemployment picture would add back the nearly 7 million additional people who reportedly want a job but are NOT considered part of the labor force.Employment improvements in January were consistent with the trends seen over the course of the pandemic in which employees working in industries such as Retail and Hospitality have suffered considerably more joblessness than those working in jobs that are easily shifted to work-from-home, such as Professional & Business Services, which showed the largest job growth in January.Another pattern seen in January that is a continuation of a broader pandemic trend is that the jobs suffering the largest net losses are also the lowest paying jobs. In the chart below the lower left quadrant shows jobs that show both the biggest losses for January and lowest weekly wages, while the upper right quadrant shows jobs with net gains in employment and the highest weekly wages.A similar perspective from www.tracktherecovery.org charts the unemployment rate by income group, showing how stark the contrast in economic reality is between the highest and lowest wage groups. After a year of record fiscal and monetary stimulus the disparity should be disconcerting, especially the 21% drop for the lowest income bracket compared to employment growth in the highest bracket.Inflation for 2020 came in at a subdued 1.4% (excluding food and energy), and a steep decline in energy prices offered some relief for consumers, but Food inflation increased 3.9%, the steepest increase in over a decade.Food prices for at home (grocery) and away from home (restaurant/convenience) increased at the same rate, despite a large shift away from restaurant occasions to grocery, which might have driven a disproportionate increase in prices in Food at home.Interestingly, there was significant disparity in price escalation within the Food away from home group, in which Limited Service (fast food/convenience) prices increased by 6%, double that of Full Service meal price inflation. As the economics of the $659B restaurant industry (pre-pandemic $854B a drop of 23.8% - National Restaurant Association) are transformed by the pandemic, we can expect Food Away from Home inflation to continue to outpace other areas economy. Factors that will drive restaurant prices in 2021 include:A. The large number of restaurant closures has reduced competitive saturation in many trade areas, which creates pricing power for the surviving units.B. Third party channel partners that enable delivery and curbside ordering for much of the industry have made tremendous penetration in the industry, but the economics are impossible to sustain without high double digit price increases.C. Wage rates will increase for restaurant employees. Even if Federal minimum wage initiatives are not passed, local municipalities and labor market pressure will put pressure on labor costs.D. The required minimum investment in technology took a significant leap forward in 2020 and higher prices is one way restaurants will support these investments.Although the broad economic situation indicates that we should expect above average increases in restaurant food prices in 2021, it will manifest unevenly as local economic conditions will affect business pricing strategies at a local level.Economic distress concentrated in the bottom third of households driven by aforementioned joblessness in low paying professions has manifested in food and housing insecurity. Food insecurity peaked in December with over 13% of US Households reporting going hungry in the past week, with Louisiana suffering the highest insecurity at 18.2%. Likelihood of eviction of foreclosure also hit a high of 35.5% of households in December, but it too is demographically and geographically disbursed.Revitalizing Community EntrepreneurshipThe fact that the economic pain from the pandemic has hit people and businesses that are geographically disbursed adds to the complexity of the recovery and limits the effectiveness of the standard government stimulus tools because they are largely designed around helping large industries that benefit most from public markets. It's hard for the Federal government to get money to independent businesses. Organization and business networks like the SBA and banks that would normally be a great help can't quite wrap their heads around extending loans and grants to business that have no collateral, lots of debt, small margins and no clearly articulated business plan - which is reality for most small businesses even in good times. This pandemic is not a normal economic crisis, it's a public health & economic crisis that has devastated people, communities, industries and businesses unequally. As we emerge from the crisis, we are starting from a place where businesses with the deepest pockets have an almost insurmountable advantage over independents - a much bigger advantage than before, compliments of the US Taxpayer and the Federal Reserve. If we want to revitalize small businesses and boost local community entrepreneurship, we need to target the help with a vigor that rivals the torrent of liquidity their large-scale competition enjoyed during the crisis.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1536/1*_4Tm_RD_BAYlWjdlWwb7NQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/a-long-slog-ahead-for-the-other-economy-aba14eb588c,economy,0987cacd4515ca2487d7973f3b24c52f364e6d63fe6fafd4a4b88378

Deep dive: Mobile design principles and best practices,"With nearly 9 million apps at people's fingertips, it's tough out there for a mobile app designer. At least a thousand new apps pour into the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store each day. Yet, more than 75% of them are downloaded, opened once, and never used again. Most of this can be attributed to poor usability.Take just one industry: eCommerce. With 3.5 billion smartphones globally, it's losing hundreds of billions of dollars every year by not following UX design best practices. The site is either too slow, the search is broken, the UI is indecipherable, or the navigation is awful.Things looked pretty dire for an unlucky development team when people kept leaving 1-star reviews on the app store about their expensive creation. The reviews complained that the app was ""too slow."" Desperately wanting to correct the situation, the team rewrote the app over several months at an eye-watering expense.When they tested the app again, they were mortified. It turns out people meant that the navigation was awkward, using the UI was cumbersome, and finding things was ""too slow."" It was a UX issue, not a speed issue!If they'd followed mobile UX design best practices, they could have produced an app with superior usability. Following ""golden rules"" and standards would have improved their mobile UX, and they would have received better reviews.People don't want to learn a new mobile interface every time they open an app. They want to be entertained or get things done. They want products that are easy and ""just work.""Mobile users want instant access to everything. It's estimated that people check their phones about 80 times a day! Because they're often used for short bursts of activity, frictionless designs with great UX succeed more.Neuroscientists say our brains are energy hogs. The brain evolved over millennia to be as efficient as possible - to save energy. People crave consistency and ease-of-use because our brains prefer the least amount of friction.Unquestionably, everyone wants their app to succeed. But if something is unusable, it means increased friction, and people will move on. No matter how aesthetically-pleasing the visual design, how fancy a micro animation is - if the app's usability is flawed, the experience will be broken.Coined by Jakob Nielsen, Jakob's Law states that ""Users spend most of their time on other apps. People prefer your app to work the same way as all the other apps they already know.""The most popular and successful apps follow mobile UX design best practices because these ""tried and true"" standards mean that people don't have to re-learn a UI. It's not about cloning other apps. It's about not breaking expected patterns unless it provides significant value.Usability is a quality attribute in UX made up of many components. There are many, but let's dive into five crucial ones:● Learnability: How easy is it for people to accomplish basic tasks the first time?● Efficiency: How quickly can people perform tasks?● Memorability: When people return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?● Error Recovery: How many errors do users make, how severe are they, and how easily can people recover from them?● Satisfaction: How pleasant is it to use the design? Does it help people accomplish their tasks? Was it a satisfying interaction?Let's dive deeper into usability. First up, navigation. There's a saying in the UX world, ""discoverability always wins."" Discoverability in UX refers to a UI where every possible interaction is crystal clear to users. If people can't find something, ""it doesn't exist."" A hamburger menu, for example, is detrimental to usability because it's considered hidden navigation. It impairs usability because it has low discoverability and a high interaction cost.Among many mobile navigation patterns, the ""tabbed view"" is a popular one. Content is divided into tabs (like desktop devices), and users navigate between the tabs from a toolbar accessible on any screen.Mobile usability experts have performed countless tests between tab bars (aka the bottom navigation bar on Android) used for the ""tabbed view"" and the hamburger menu for mobile navigation. Which one came out on top? It was the tab bar (seen above on the right). Why? Because it exposes the primary navigation and allows movement between primary destinations in an app. If unavoidable, designers can use a hamburger menu on the tab bar for secondary, less important options.A particular form of navigation may have become ubiquitous, but it doesn't mean it's the most efficient. After countless tests, Facebook and Spotify decided that a hamburger menu should not be used as an app's primary navigation. They require significant effort from the user. They have to discover it, tap it to open, read through all the available options, make a decision, and tap again to go to the option selected.Kebab menus belong to the same group as hamburger menus. They are also seen everywhere, and people are getting used to them, but they still decrease discoverability and, therefore, negatively impact mobile UX. It's best only to use a kebab menu as a last resort. People don't see them, so may as well not have them!When designers don't know how to properly structure mobile content (its information architecture) and design efficient navigation, they typically use hamburger menus and kebabs as a design crutch. Astonishingly, some UIs sport not one but two kebabs, as the last screen below demonstrates.Since ancient times, people have used symbols to communicate with each other. It is a scientific fact that our brain processes (recognizes) symbols about 1000x faster than reading text. The Greeks, Egyptians, and Chinese used symbols in some of the earliest writings.On the left side above are some symbols that Native Americans used to communicate. How many can you decipher as to their meaning? Maybe the top row - not much beyond that.But when we see the descriptions in the lower right, they make more sense, and recognition becomes a lot faster. We'll see in a second why this is important.Whereas universal icons are instantly recognizable, non-universal, unlabeled icons are a guessing game. People are stopped in their tracks. Unlabeled icons in a UI are equivalent to throwing a roadblock into a user's path because they have to stop to decipher their meaning. User flow comes to a screeching halt!The screens below from some popular apps show unlabeled icons. Try to guess what they all mean and where they would take you!Recognition refers to our ability to ""recognize"" an event or piece of information as being familiar. At the same time, recall is much more of a ""cognitive burden"" that involves pulling related details from memory. Showing users things they can recognize improves usability over needing to recall items from scratch.For example, using icons in a UI is powerful because it allows for the instant recognition of a symbol. If a standard warning sign icon is shown in a dialog, it immediately makes the user pay attention because the next action may be destructive. But if an icon is designed to force users to recall and decipher meaning - a hand held up, for example, instead of the warning icon - it decreases efficiency and usability.There's also a concept in UX called ""value vs. pain"" - how much investment one is willing to make to find out where an icon leads. Most people do not want to learn and memorize what an icon means in one app when using many different apps every day.The mobile UX design best practice for icons is: always label icons with text. Labeled icons ensure that meaning is conveyed quickly and easily and that they are consistently understood. Most big-brand, popular apps do it.On mobile, speed is king. Milliseconds earn millions. In mobile eCommerce, even a one-second delay in load time can negatively impact conversions by 20%. If a slow mobile experience drives customers away, a fast mobile experience can help attract and keep them.BMW listened to this recommendation and supercharged its mobile site using Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and Progressive Web Apps (PWA) - two state-of-the-art technologies for speedy mobile site experiences. After they did this, the proportion of people clicking through to a BMW sales site soared from 8% to 30%, nearly 4X higher than previously.With AMP (accelerated mobile pages), Telefónica, one of the largest mobile network providers in the world, improved load times for its mobile site by 70%. This speed boost helped the company increase click-through rates by 31%!German eCommerce site Bücher was able to speed up its site by 33% by using ""lazy loading"" of images, and as a result, increased their book sales. The critical takeaway for designers is to work with developers to improve the speed of mobile sites and apps because it will dramatically increase conversions and boost mobile UX.Notifications contribute to an experience that helps people accomplish a goal and should be treated like any other digital product component. However, notifications can cut both ways. If handled well, they can boost UX and assist engagement but risk becoming an annoyance when executed poorly. Striking the right balance is key.Too many unnecessary notifications can frustrate users who may then silence notifications or stop using the app altogether. They are mostly interruptions, so it's crucial to look at the notification's message and how and when to ask for permission to send them.The first app above asks users if they're enjoying the newly updated app immediately after opening it. The next two show H&M bombarding people, asking them to ""allow notifications"" and flashing a privacy notice as soon as they open the app. Marks and Spencer, another UK retailer (the last two), does the same. They are all examples of poor UX.For mobile push notifications, the best practice is to delay notifications of any kind until people have had the chance to explore the app.There's a fine line between an interaction that works and one that is unusable. Because usability is crucial on mobile, well-executed interaction design plays a considerable role in implementing great mobile UX. Observing interaction design principles takes on added importance as screens are small, and various form factors come into play.Whether in digital product design or industrial design, design conventions are rooted in human behavior, ergonomics, and psychology. They follow best practices and expectations of how things work. These conventions have evolved by trial and error over a long time and are proven to be effective.It's foolhardy and somewhat arrogant to ignore design conventions. Without them, we risk annoying people. Imagine if every bicycle, every door handle - or the pedals and the steering wheel in every car - worked differently, all purely in the name of ""innovation."" Designers need to consider expectations to reduce friction.Discoverability - touched upon a little earlier - means: It should be evident what actions are possible from the UI and the current state of the device. Not just on the homepage, but on all the screens. Remember the kebab and hamburger menus and the unlabeled icons? They represent hidden or cryptic information. Designers should design UIs that let people discover features and interactions quickly.Signifiers. They are the clues or signals to affordances. Although this seems like a straightforward concept, it's one that seems to confuse people the most. People use the term ""affordance"" incorrectly all the time. In practice, designers need to use signifiers to indicate what affordances are present in a UI. A signifier can be a button, a menu icon, an input field, or an image that's just peeking in from the side of the screen, signaling - signifying - that users can swipe to it.Feedback. When we initiate something in the real world, we expect some feedback. Press an elevator button, and the button lights up, signaling that the system has received the call. Touch your transportation card as you get on a bus, and you'll hear a ding. It's comforting in many ways - it's the world ""feeding back"" confirmation to an action.The same needs to happen in the digital realm. Feedback is closely tied to the usability heuristic ""visibility of system status."" Feedback may be visual, a sound, or haptic feedback, like vibration - for example, when you put an item in the shopping cart with Amazon's iOS app.Mapping is about mapping UI controls to something natural - taking advantage of physical analogies and cultural standards in the real world. It leads to an immediate understanding in interaction design. One could call it ""ergonomic UX."" For example, a designer can use a spatial analogy in the UI: To increase a value with a slider component, swipe a slider up; to decrease it, swipe down. It's immediately familiar. People don't have to decipher meaning.Mental models are also called ""conceptual models"" and are closely related to mappings. Remember what neuroscience calls ""the lazy brain"" and the case for frictionless design? Mental models are images in a user's mind that inform their expectations of a particular interaction and how something works in the real world.For example, this Mercedes seat adjustment control is perfectly designed to align with people's mental models. It's immediately clear and usable.When these interaction design principles are applied rigorously, they will provide excellent usability, leading to higher quality mobile user experiences.Let's dive into six essential Laws of UX that mobile designers ought to observe and add to their arsenal. These laws are grounded in psychology and human-computer interaction science (HCI). Adhering to these ""laws"" is especially important for mobile sites and apps. Whether a UX designer acknowledges them or not, these laws of UX rule and operate and will impact a design's effectiveness.Great customer experiences are based on trust and meaningful, consistent interactions. Any designer worth their salt must consider cognitive psychology and the effect of their work on their intended audience. For example, let's consider a bank with over 25 million mobile customers. In that case, it can be easily seen how ignoring the laws of UX could seriously inhibit their app's usability and consequently affect their bottom line.First up, Fitts's Law. It states: ""The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target."" Even though mostly applicable to desktop UI design, Fitts's Law can also apply to mobile UIs. The distance from one tap to another can be used to either assist or impede an interaction. For example, a destructive action such as ""sign out"" can be placed at the top of the mobile screen, and the confirmation can come up on the bottom. This would impede the interaction and provide enough time for the user to reconsider. Inversely, closely-related, non-destructive actions could be placed closer together to speed up interactions.Believe it or not, this ""law"" comes from early studies looking at muscle movement and targeting by telegraph operators and was later adapted to HCI (human-computer interaction).Hick's Law states: ""The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices."" In a poorly designed scenario, this law could be violated by a UI that presents too many choices and asks people to remember too many things - for example, offering too many options to choose from when ordering something on mobile. Mobile UIs need not be simplistic but should be simple to use.We saw this earlier, and it relates to the consistency of mobile UIs. Jakob's Law states: ""Users spend most of their time on other sites or apps.""Designers can simplify the learning process by providing familiar design patterns, thereby increasing conversions. People expect a product to work like all the others.Miller's Law states that ""the average person can only keep around seven items in their working memory."" When this rule is disregarded, people are forced to think more than they should have to. UX professionals often refer to this phenomenon as cognitive overload.Ignoring Miller's Law can seriously cripple mobile UX. If there are too many things people have to remember, it could cause frustration and decision paralysis (aka ""overchoice"").Lawrence Tesler worked at Xerox PARC in the mid-80s and was instrumental in developing the modern GUI, the foundation for Apple's Macintosh. Along with Bruce Tognazzini - another usability guy - he argued that when an application is simplified too much, people begin attempting more complex tasks. So, minimalist design is OK, reducing complexity is OK, but there is a certain amount of complexity that cannot be decreased.This one is named after a Russian psychologist: Bluma Zeigarnik. The Zeigarnik Effect says that uncompleted tasks are easier to remember than completed ones. It turns out that our brain has a powerful need to finish what it started. Hollywood has used this trick for eons in episodic TV, known as the ""cliffhanger.""For example, designers can use visual indicators for complex tasks that take longer - such as progress bars - to indicate when a task is incomplete, nudging people along to finishing it.Taken collectively, observing these laws of UX can help guide a mobile UX designer toward creating the most effective design for any given product. Even though they are not actual ""laws"" but rather ""tried and true"" cause and effect relationships, mobile designers should nevertheless take notice of the driving forces behind the laws of UX to design superior mobile products.Last but not least: designers have other ways to boost mobile UX. They can take advantage of hardware components in a mobile device in creative ways to enhance user experiences.All mobile devices have a camera that can be used for barcode scanning, computer vision applications, and augmented reality.

How Ali Abdaal Makes Over $1m Per Year as an Online Entrepreneur,"From 2017 to 2020, Ali Abdaal built a 7-figure online business while completing his full-time medical studies at Cambridge.As a YouTuber, instructor, and podcaster, he explores the principles, strategies, and tools that help people live happier, healthier, more productive lives. His YouTube channel has 1.4 million subscribers, and with a book and a second online cohort around the corner, these numbers likely double in 2021.Recently, he published a 50-minute video on how much he earned in 2020. Ali's levels of humbleness, humor, and self-reflection make it one of the most inspiring entrepreneurship videos I've seen.This article gives a quick glance at how he made more than a million dollars in 2020, and more importantly, the key takeaways from his entrepreneurial journey.Ali diversified his online income streams over the years. While he built the last two pillars in his early online career, the first three emerged more recently.Teachers on Skillshare earn revenue through royalty payments and premium referrals. Instructors make money for every minute watched by Premium students in their classes and for every student they bring through a referral link.Ali has seven classes on Skillshare, with more than 100,000 students watching his classes at more than 9,000,000 minutes of watch time.In 2020, Ali launched the part-time YouTuber academy. He teaches students how to grow a YouTube channel from 0 to 100,000+ subscribers and transform it into a sustainable, income-generating machine.The pricing starts at $1495 for the essential package, up to $4995 for the premium package. His 2021 enrollment for February is already sold out.Brands pay YouTubers to feature their products or services in some way. Sponsorships require an existing audience, and Ali got his first sponsorship deal in 2018 when he already had 50k subscribers.Sponsored videos might run in-video advertisements or use product placements, like Ali does here with Notion, or here with Apple.Affiliate marketers earn a commission by promoting other people's or company's products and content. The broader creators' reach, the more people will buy what they talk about.Ali's main affiliate income sources include Amazon's affiliate program, Tiago Forte's Second Brain Course, a special Keyboard, and a paperlike iPad protector.Google AdSense is the main income for many YouTubers. The advertisements are the short 5-second clips before videos or the snippets you see while watching a video. To start earning money with AdSense, YouTubers need a minimum of 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 valid watch-hours on their channel.For reaching $136,859 in 2020, Ali published 98 videos with 1.3 million subscribers.It's tempting to use Ali's success as an example for a get-rich-quick scheme. Nothing could be further from the truth. His entrepreneurial journey is another proof that shortcuts don't exist. Instead, success is a result of smart habits and strategies.Value creation is the most important metric to measure. Recently, Ali shared a tweet, stating:But if you look at his history, you see that he didn't cheat. He found his creator-market fit step by step.In his first months, he targeted the one group he could provide value for: students wanting to get accepted into Cambridge medical school. He recorded videos on test-taking and interview questions.A few months in, he expanded for the students among him, sharing learning strategies and university productivity desk set up. Only after more than a year of video creation, he tapped into a broader audience and shared videos on note-taking, a general desk setup, reading, and time-management.He went from a niche audience to a broader audience by focusing on the group of people he can truly help.How to apply this lesson:What do you know that can help other people grow? What have you done with ease that other people are struggling to achieve? Focus on this niche as a start. Whatever you do, focus on the single most important metric: creating value for your audience.Ali started in 2017 and didn't earn a cent from his first 50 videos. He needed to build a solid 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch-hours before he'd qualify for the income program.Around the same time, Ali posted his first video in 2017, Danika Chilibeck and I started Investella, a personal investment platform for women by women. We put in 20, 40, 100 hours and but didn't see desired results. We grew impatient because we didn't make any money. A few months in, we stopped.That's the difference between Ali and most people on this planet. He continued to trust in his process and producing great content, while most aspiring entrepreneurs stop along the way.His YouTube success didn't come overnight. Before earning +$100k a year, he had published more than 300 videos. He stuck to the process and published consistently without expecting returns.How to apply this lesson:Making money from online creation is a long-term game. You won't see the desired results in the beginning. But if you keep working, you might suddenly hit a glass ceiling. Progress is slow but exponential. Whenever you think about quitting, keep in mind, you're in for the long term.While preparing this article, I expected to find a secret sauce for growing a content channel into a thriving business. But there's no secret.On his website, Ali writes that all it takes to become a successful online entrepreneur are three things:Successful content creators know there's no magic trick. And that's why they can calmly focus on creation. Ali followed his own advice. He created one to two high-quality YouTube videos for more than three years and ultimately saw the results.How to apply this lesson:Don't waste time searching for a secret source. Use success stories as inspiration but don't get lost in them. Creation is all that matters. When looking at your metrics, don't feel discouraged. Use data to analyze what works and do more of it. But apart from that, don't agonize over low stats. Instead, spend all of your energy consistently creating user-centric content.In 2017 Ali invested £ 2000 in buying camera equipment while he didn't make a single cent from his new YouTube channel. Three years later, he wrote in the advertisement for his part-time academy:Learning fuels growth. The best entrepreneurs are lifelong learners and don't hesitate to spend money on themselves. A quote from Billionaire investor Warren Buffett sums up why this strategy works:How to apply this lesson:Make self-investments and learning a priority. Seek courses, coaching, and training within your niche. Don't agonize about whether you should spend money on these things. Save on consumer goods, and invest the spare income into learning and growth. Finally, make reading a habit.Ali said he planned to launch his part-time YouTuber academy as another Skillshare course. Then he talked to Tiago Forte and David Perell (both sell online courses at +$1500 and +$4000).Probably that's how Ali learned about the features of learner-centric online courses: highly interactive, community-based, feedback opportunities, accountability.Because he connected with people who've successfully done what he intended to do, he deviated from his original plan. He learned that a top tier offer at a higher price is a better way to go.How to apply this lesson:Make it a habit to connect with new people. In a Forge article, Michael Thompson shared great strategies for how to do it. He suggests calling one new person every week and reaching out to people you already have weak ties with.If there's one thing we learn from Ali Abdaal's impressive way towards a YouTube millionaire, it's that the best way to make large amounts of money on the internet is to provide value at scale. Here's what to remember:",,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/how-ali-abdaal-makes-over-1m-per-year-as-an-online-entrepreneur-77294f986e93,startups,1992e38bec618a7f78819a0b0eb457fb2e1cebb922c553201660ff5e
How to Measure Your Day When Writing Full-Time,"One of the most significant difficulties I've faced since I started freelancing as a writer full-time is learning how to measure my workdays.The typical Mon-Fri 9-5 offers us so much structure and the ability to measure our output because it's neatly handed to us. What we should be doing, how we should be doing it, by when - there are multiple constructs in place to guide us. Throw in the benefit of the staff break room for refuge during lunch and colleagues to chat with and help motivate you; it's easy to see why this is such a comfortable way to work for many.Discovering how to set-up your day in the way that's most effective and productive for you is a hardy test of self-discipline for every writer I know. I can tell you the truth: it's an ever-evolving process. I've tried to breakdown my days and measure them in countless different ways, including:Then there's the question of how exactly you set yourself up to work:Or do you do what I usually end up doing and winging it each week based on what work lands on your lap?No matter how many plans, structures, timetables or promises I put in place for myself, I can pretty much guarantee that a week or two into any new way of setting up and measuring my freelance workdays will quickly go out the window.By its very definition, freelance writing is about being a bit freer with how you approach work. Throughout my attempts to find the 'perfect' balance in my freelance work-life, I've repeatedly come back to the question: When is my output enough?Grand notions of working to my 'full capacity' often plague me, but something I've come to realise is that 'full capacity' is such a stab-in-the-dark concept when it comes to freelancing. In my contracted roles for companies, I have a set job description that defines what I do, and I can add value with fresh ideas.With freelancing, I make all the rules. My job description(s) have very few boundaries, and the ones I do have quickly get stretched, bent and broken when a client sends an intriguing project my way. So, how do I measure my writing days and output if it's so often up for repeated redefining?Essentially, I've had to make my own metrics for measuring what 'enough' looks like to me, within any given week or month. Here are a few ways I do that:Some projects will demand a full-time schedule from me; others might only ask for a few hours. The kicker is when the projects pay the same but require wildly different time commitments. It makes it hard to feel like I've 'achieved' success.This is how I've learned to focus on the work. As long as I enjoy and find the project interesting, it's adding to my professional development and paying what I think I should earn for it - that's what I focus on.Instead of a lengthy To-Do list that seems never to end and makes you feel unproductive when you don't successfully tick everything off by the end of the day, aim for more realistic achievements.I review all my deadlines for the week on Sunday and plan which ones need to be completed on which days - I set myself no more than three goals per day. Three has been a highly realistic and achievable number for me - as long as I complete my three things, it's been a successful day. If I manage to do more - that's a bonus.I found myself getting into a rut where even when I had plenty of work on my plate, I still felt compelled to be seeking more. Whether it was pitching pieces, applying to freelance gigs via online platforms or scouring for call-outs and submission openings - I was always looking.Of course, there needs to be a degree of this factored into your work life as a freelancer. Still, it's also okay to take a break if you have enough work and focus on delivering consistently good work over continually seeking for more.Consistency also includes keeping your social media relatively accurate and relevant alongside website updates and a little bit of self-promo/marketing when necessary. Showing up positively and consistently leads to great results as a freelancer.As I mentioned, my methods (and madness) around how I measure my freelance writing output and success changes frequently, and that's because my work changes just as quickly.There is no 'perfect' way of doing things, only the way of doing things that work for you within any given day or week - and that will naturally change as your projects and clients change or evolve. And indeed, as you evolve as a freelancer.Instead of focusing on the standard measurements for output, success and professional growth, I've learned what's more important is working with people who make me feel good and appreciate the work I do, I'm challenged in the right ways by the work I take on, and I feel good about the work I'm producing.Ultimately, these are the ways to measure your day - and output - as a writer.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*id7v5Px2bKtZRGXb,https://medium.com/blankpage/how-to-measure-your-work-day-when-writing-full-time-5cba821d904b,freelancing,2049c15e7b6bcd1dfc8f08ecb1fbf79d44dd64aecbd0abca5ee88de0
Inspiring Quotes By 7 Physicists That Aren't Albert Einstein,"Everyone knows famous quotes by Einstein that grant a lot of insights into his miraculous mind. And just in case you haven't had the opportunity to read any of his works, you might want to take a look at the following excerpt:Albert Einstein (1879-1955) is a master in so many fields, and analyzing his quotes is a beautiful task on its own.Thus, the world has physicists that also delivered valuable views on the planet. And they either lived long before Einstein or are colleagues in mind.The following quotes offer you the chance to reflect on your thoughts, and besides, shatter the belief systems of your audience.No great enumeration of physicists can call itself great if I don't mention Isaac Newton (1642-1726).And this quote is essential as it gives credit to all the predecessors in a specific field:Please keep in mind that Newton's quote achieves a form of humbleness that, in reality, was not his most prominent quality. Newton used this quote in a letter to Robert Hooke, another expert in the field of optics.Isaac Newton believes that Hooke was more like a dwarf in the respective science-field.Newton was intensely jealous and could not have enough attention to all his achievements.Nevertheless, you can use this quote if you:Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) was a Prussian polymath.With his work ""Kosmos"" (German for cosmos=universe), he laid the foundation for a unification of the diverse branches of science and culture. It also contributed to developing a unifying explanation of everything - the universe as one interacting entity.In his five years of traveling extensively in the Americas, he explored and described them through the eyes of a scientist:And this quote has its brilliance as it explains the growth in everyone's life. Besides, it shows that we should not rest ourselves on past achievements as we:Wernher von Braun (1912-1977) might be the most controversial person on this list. He was first the leading engineer for the Nazi Germany rocket program, and afterward a pioneer for space technology in the United States:And this first quote gives kudos to all large projects as it highlights the bureaucracy involved. Sometimes bureaucracy is so overwhelming that the original goal is not visible anymore.Quite interesting is the next quote, especially considering that Wernher von Braun used it:It is needless to say that von Braun played a significant factor in the space program, but one shall never forget where he started his career. And just like he said: science is like a knife. Let us hope that future scientists remember this quote because massive changes are waiting for humans if you look at virtual reality, crypto-currencies, or alike.Marie Curie (1867-1934) is the first female Nobel Prize winner and the only one who won the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields.She coined the term radioactivity and received her first Nobel Prize (together with her husband) to pioneer this field. She got her second Nobel Prize for the discovery of polonium and radium. The first element might have gained notoriety as it was the poison for Alexander Litvinenko.And she lived her life like the child in her first quote:Sadly, she died due to aplastic anemia. It is a direct result of her radiation exposure. Even though she did not fear anything as she was a master in almost any field.Just think about the small terrestrial beings around you. They conquer the world with fresh minds, virgin eyes, and don't fear anything.They enjoy the experience itself - something that we should try more often.Born in 1858, Max Planch is another recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics. He got it for his discovery of energy quanta in 1918.His main contributions towards theoretical physics are enormous but fall short compared to his role as the originator of quantum theory.Besides his significant triumphs in the world of physics, he loved quotes almost as much as Einstein did. My favorite does not only cover his territory of physics but the understanding of the world itself:As with all lies, the truth will come out one day. And their enemies will not have the chance to hold up the lies. You can find examples for it in history and current developments.Born in 1564, almost no other ancient person received so many superlatives for his work. Known as the ""father of modern physics"", he explored or combined fields that shattered the belief systems at that time.He even argued with the pope (using his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems in 1632). He was tried by the Inquisition and spent the rest of his life under house arrest.If a person is mindful enough and firm in his beliefs, you can expect brilliant quotes. The best one might be the following:Before Kant's ""Sapere Aude,"" - Galilei used this quote to say the same. He reminds us to:Aristotle (384-322 BC) was a great philosopher and wrote on physics, among other subjects. And set the base for many scientists afterward.Especially for Western societies, you cannot ignore his influence on knowledge, problems, and inquiries.And one of my favorite quotes by him is used frequently even today:""Stay hungry, stay foolish"" is somehow the new interpretation by Steve Jobs that leads in the same direction.It is great to play around with ideas, and nobody should take this ability (""to be a bit crazy"") away from you - if everyone looks in the same direction, you won't find new paths.As with all great literature, the real power lies in the application of the newly obtained wisdom. Some quotes date back more than 2300 years and are still valid today.Sometimes, it is worth looking deeper into subjects as Einstein was not the only genius on the planet. I wish you great fun in exploring the world without focusing on the prominent parts.

A couple turned a 100-square-foot RV with a fireplace and patio into their dream tiny home on wheels,"Most people live in RVs to travel, but Kirsten and Devin Trout saw an RV as a way to save money and live tiny.By Monica HumphriesBorn and raised in Delaware, Kirsten and Devin Trout had no plans to move.Then, one day in 2017, the couple both felt the itch to relocate to Nashville, Tennessee.""We never talked about moving to Nashville, so it was very random for both of us,"" Kirsten told Insider. ""Since we never talked about it, we just felt like it was a God thing.""Kirsten, 27, said she was sitting at home thinking about Tennessee; meanwhile, her husband, 29, was on his way home with the same thought. She said they discussed moving to Nashville for the first time, and the next day they started making plans.Nashville appealed to them for a variety of reasons. For the Trouts, it was a place with new things to explore and where Devin could pursue a career in country music.With their sights set on Nashville, their next challenge was finding a place to live. After searching for affordable housing, they eventually landed on a tiny home on wheels.In the fall of 2017, the couple was set on moving, so they started exploring housing options. They searched for homes and apartments, but couldn't find anything that fit their budget.Devin kept searching for a way to make it work, and one day he stumbled upon a YouTube video of a couple living and traveling in a van, Kirsten said.A van felt too small for the couple and their three dogs, but an RV could work, they decided.That October, they spent $18,000 on an old fifth-wheel RV, a type of large camper towed by a pickup truck.The couple stayed in Delaware while they renovated their new home. The RV had a handful of issues, like water damage, so the couple hired a friend to help them replace the flooring, paint the interior, add trimming, and remove cabinets.At the end of the year, they traveled down to Nashville, and by January 1, 2018, the couple was living in their renovated home parked at a campground.Initially, they planned to live in the RV for one year, sell it, and use the money to put a down payment on a home.""Then we fell in love with the lifestyle and the freedom of it all,"" Kirsten said. The RV gave them autonomy, privacy, and outdoor space, and it was still more affordable than a home with a mortgage, she said.After spending two-and-a-half years in the RV, the couple decided they wanted to travel more. So, they abandoned their house plans, and by the fall of 2020, they decided to go smaller.Read more: A family of 4 lives in a 350-square-foot RV that has multiple bathrooms, a washer and dryer, and a fireplaceWhile traveling was doable in their fifth-wheel RV, the couple decided it was just too big for their travel needs. A smaller camper meant they could have a smaller car, fit in more campsites, and save more money.Kirsten said she was initially hesitant to downsize, but after weighing the pros and cons, she felt the ease of traveling in a smaller RV outweighed the negatives.The couple started looking for their next home and landed on a Forest River XLR Micro Boost, an 18-foot toy hauler RV with a patio that extends to 23 feet and an interior living space of around 100-square-feet. The couple purchased the vehicle for $16,000.The couple fell in love with their current RV for a variety of reasons.Kirsten wanted an open layout that didn't have built-in furniture, giving her the freedom to pick out furniture and change the home's floor plan. The vehicle has a bedroom, bathroom, and living room, which also serves as the kitchen area and dining room.The toy hauler also features one of Kirsten's favorite things: a fireplace. Her other favorite feature is the back patio. The doors open out to a small area where the family's three dogs, Daisy, Phoebe, and Bonnie, can enjoy fresh air.With their ideal RV model, Kirsten was excited to turn the blank canvas into a home.Kirsten estimates that they spent about $1,500 renovating their RV, turning it from gray and brown to fresh white with pops of color.So far, the biggest expense has been hiring painters to redo the interior, according to Kirsten.Beyond a fresh coat of paint, Kirsten has added a slat wall in their bedroom and a stained trim around their front door. The renovation still isn't complete, but Kirsten said only the small details are left, like adding a few pieces of decor and deciding on accent wall colors.Read more: Before-and-after photos show how a family of 5 transformed an outdated RV into a modern space that they now live in full-timeDue to the pandemic and busy work schedules, the couple hasn't traveled much since purchasing their home but they hope to explore Tennessee and its surrounding states in the future. They plan to take weekend trips to nearby campgrounds and boondocking (off-grid camping where RVs aren't connected to water or electricity).In the meantime, they've welcomed friends over for bonfires and created fun memories in their new home.""It's amazing,"" she said of her life in Nashville. ""I'm so proud of all of this.""For more great stories, visit Insider's homepage.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/0*bI-0idstNdyTcMtx,https://medium.com/insider/how-a-couple-turned-a-100-square-foot-rv-into-their-dream-tiny-home-a36730ee7a82,travel,2584c88d9432e6a26f2a453bfd908bfa59c90464ec44d2fb313652e2
"Journalism says it's a service, but it doesn't think like one","Several months ago, I was part of a gathering for solutions journalists from around the world. The term ""solutions journalism"" sounds positive, but this form of media isn't focused on feel-good stories or ""puff"" pieces. Solutions stories look for what people are doing about a problem, and evaluate whether these attempted solutions are actually working, for whom, and why.At the summit, I spent one lunch session chatting with a writer who is building a health and parenting newsletter for her regional readership. ""I'm creating something I really believe has value,"" she told me. ""But - does it? I can't really tell.""People were reading her newsletter; thanks to increasingly-sophisticated analytics tools, journalists and publications can tell a lot about reader behavior. Her data could tell her who was reading, what content they opened, how much of it they read, how many times, at what times of day, on what platform, and whether they passed it on to others.But what the data wasn't telling her was why they were reading it-and what impact, if any, it was having on them.Like design, journalism is in the business of delivering ""the data + the why"" of human behavior. Publications tend to have clear and thoughtful mission statements that answer the why of their work: ""Why do we think journalism matters?"" And therefore: ""What kind of stories do we think should we tell?"" And, ""How is our content unique from others' content?""But many outlets - especially those that aren't investigative-driven - don't have nearly as clear a grasp on the why of their audience: ""Why does our audience think we matter?"" And underlying that: ""What do our readers need from journalism? In what ways do they rely on us to meet that need? Is our publication demonstrably changing readers' understanding or behavior? How do we know?""A service delivers something of value that people cannot provide for themselves. For an industry that describes itself as a service, this inability to evaluate its own success is a fairly large miss.It is conventional editorial wisdom that understanding reader preference is a necessity - so in addition to tracking analytics, editors will often try to capture readers' tastes by asking them, via reader surveys.The problem? Designers and editors both know that what people say they care about is often different than how they actually behave. Behavior is influenced by many factors, all of which may change over the course of a day (or week, or year). Readers may say they want more stories about municipal water treatment because they know that's a ""good"" thing to say - or even because they genuinely intend to sit down and learn about water safety. But after the survey, when the editor runs analytics, she'll see that people still click far more often on stories about BTS, not water treatment.Service designers work to get beyond stated user preference, to better understand user behavior and lived experience. What does safe water mean to the readers who said they wanted more stories about this topic? How are their lives affected by it? What kind of information about water safety, if any, do they need and rely on? What are the consequences if they don't get it? What kind of information could be of help that they don't even know about?To answer these questions, service designers spend time with users to better understand their daily lives. This process is called ""contextual inquiry""-gathering qualitative data on how people use a product in the context of their lived experience.Service designers will pay attention to things like: When does this person interact with the product? How (mechanically, step-by-step) do they interact with it? What else is going on in their lives/days when they do? What do they do with it? And especially: What do they do with it that surprises us? What places do they get stuck? Are there any parts of the product they can't access? What makes them stop using it? Are there other products they use instead of this one? Why? Are there any points we would expect them to use this product and they don't? What can we see about why?This line of inquiry isn't just useful for specific story topics - it can (and should be!) applied to audience as a whole.If you're an editor, ask: What kinds of information do your readers rely on for their wellbeing? What do they rely on you specifically for? And where do (or might) those spheres overlap?Once we've observed the behavior and context of our own audience, we can start to draw insights. Thanks to existing analyses of reader behavior, we already have some insights into universal audience needs:Framing these insights as a question of ""how might we...?"" allows us to immediately begin to try answering it.What kind of journalism service can you imagine? Look at these ""how might we's:""We could bundle our ""institutional expertise"" on city issues and sell to paying subscribers, including the government, universities, philanthropies, nonprofits, and businesses.We could combine all of these services above by reimagining our publication as a community service and a business: One that highlights a real-time civic problem on its home page, accessible to all, and provides a historic deep dive for paying subscribers.Journalism's mission statement is to act as an informational service for its core audience and the public at large. As the industry faces perilous times, the industry's biggest potential lies in a version of the model practiced at the gathering I attended: The ability to evaluate journalism's impact; and to identify where it is working, who it is working for, and why. Journalism's survival as a critical public service depends on it.Originally published by Modernist Studio.",https://miro.medium.com/max/188/0*jdI-P2HA2vA0mq_7,https://uxdesign.cc/journalism-says-its-a-service-but-it-doesn-t-think-like-one-96744e2696be,design,2765cc8dda7349bc018364bb0b5b90c76346dc4d5300cd972b79fa17
Just Easy Enough,"It took me about five minutes to figure out The New York Times app on my smartphone. As Android apps go, this is a relatively long time - with many others, I've been up and running in under a minute. This particular app, though, offers complete access to every section and every article published by one of the great newspapers in history, including videos, recipes, travel guides, and a dizzying array of multimedia doodads. For a casual browser like me to learn to navigate that in the time it takes to drink a cup of coffee is an astounding achievement, not just of technology, but of empathy and insight.My banjo, on the other hand, is something I've been working at diligently for six months now, and I've only just emerged from the rank of total beginner. There are chords to memorize and rolls to practice, proper hand position, rhythmic and harmonic structures, and after hundreds of hours of practice, the payoff is a modestly accurate rendition of You Are My Sunshine. It's occasionally frustrating, but not unfair or unexpected - I knew the rules when I picked the thing up.In our current rush to digitize everything, we struggle with two competing arguments about the value of simplification. The first, and most widely accepted, is that an easy-to-use tool will always triumph over a hard-to-use one. This is Interaction Design 101, and it's the main reason why ""disruptive"" products like Spotify and Uber keep gushing out of the digital world. When you use technology to cut steps out of a task, people gravitate toward it. It's why we do our holiday shopping at Amazon, send an email instead of writing a letter, and go to the grocery store instead of learning to farm.The second, which nips at the heels of usability like an earnest herding dog, is that ease-of-use snatches away precious moments of satisfaction, isolates us, and makes us dumb. It's an argument that doesn't entirely unseat the ease-of-use imperative, but it does have merit: for most of us, pulling up a song on Spotify is an impoverished experience compared with dropping a treasured LP on the turntable in the company of friends.As with most dichotomies, the answer lies not in one argument or the other, nor even in some compromise between the two, but in learning to discern which argument is right in which situation. I don't want banjo playing to be easy, but I also don't want to spend two years figuring out how to read today's headlines on my phone. The difference has little to do with technology, and everything to do with the intentions and expectations I'm bringing to each task.Of the hundreds of tools and skills I use on a regular basis, there's little consistency in the length of their learning curves, which can range from seconds to years. The fancy integrated shifters on my bike took just a few minutes to figure out, while Google Docs, the software I'm using to compose this article, took weeks to master. Twitter, which I check several times a day, needed a month or two to feel really comfortable, and TurboTax seems to take two or three painful days of relearning every year. The difficulty correlates with the versatility of the tool to some degree, but not entirely - you could argue TurboTax does a lot more things than Twitter, yet it's still easier to learn.Part of this is attributable to other people. Much of what makes Twitter hard (and Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, Tinder, Snapchat, etc.) is the people on the other end of it. People are unpredictable and complicated, and any tool that mediates between them is going to develop social norms, which spawn hashtags, abbreviations, sub-tweets, attribution standards, and on and on. These take time to learn, and they're not optional if you want to get actual value out of the tool. But there are plenty of technologies that connect people, without the steep learning curve - text messaging, for example. And others, like complex video games, that involve no people at all, yet take eons to master.The real correlation, I'd argue, is with how specific our expectations are. TurboTax, Spotify, and the shifters on my bike all share a single-mindedness of purpose - they're complex in operation, but I engage with each of them knowing exactly what outcome I want. For TurboTax, it's a complete, legal tax return with the maximum possible refund. For Spotify, it's immediate access to a song, or a curated introduction to new bands. For the shifters, it's the next gear.What am I using Twitter for? To stay connected with friends, to get more fine-grained perspectives on current events, to promote things I'm writing, or some combination of all three, which ebbs and flows with the seasons. That's part of its appeal, but also what limits its simplicity. The act of learning how to follow, retweet, post images, and build follow lists is also an act of discovery; I'm learning what else is possible, and this is ultimately what makes the platform so useful. If I was using Twitter today like I used it when I first started, I wouldn't be using it anymore.Music offers an even more instructive example. Once upon a time, the only way to hear a song was to play it on an instrument, or find someone else who could, and this made all music social and precious. It's no wonder inventors bent themselves to the task of recording, playback, and distribution; first with the phonograph, then with the radio, the LP, the cassette, CD, MP3, and now streaming media. Each of these was a successively better answer to the question, ""How do I hear that song?"" Moreover, this increasing ease of access spawned all sorts of new and wonderful experiences: blasting a familiar mixtape on a road trip, constructing and playing the perfect dinner party playlist, the random access trip down memory lane that a good streaming service can enable.But all of these technologies only answer one question. They get us to the song. The song is the point. The song is king. Rewind to the ancient days when the song, the performance, and the communal listening were inseparable, and you see that it's not the only question. For the musician, there's the question of mastery, and of unexpected discovery of new ways of playing - what the physicist Richard Feynman called ""the pleasure of finding things out."" The difficulty of learning the instrument, with its embedded harmonic structure and physical preference for certain patterns, is fundamental to this process.For listeners, there's the question of intimacy with the music and of shared experience with each other. Hearing the song is part of it, and it's the most easily identifiable part, but it's certainly not the only thing that's happening. For some of us, the song itself is almost irrelevant. Instead, we want to see an immediate cause and effect, of fingers on strings linked indelibly to sensations in our ears. Or we want to know who else loves what we love, and see how they dress, how they stand, whether they bounce to the music the way we do. This is why we still pay to see live music when we could stay home and hear the same song more clearly, while seeing the musicians more vividly, for free.This willingness also shows the limits of optimization. ""Hearing the song"" is a concrete, specific outcome, and it responds well to ease-of-use efforts. ""Engaging with music"" is something much more nebulous, that we often pursue despite - or because of - its unknowable outcome.Similar things could be said about taking pictures: the ease of the smartphone snapshot vs. the cultivated skill of SLR photography.Or for procuring dinner: some of us delight in the creativity of crafting a meal from scratch; some of us just want a can of soup to make us not be hungry.Absolutely none of this makes Spotify or iTunes a bad idea, any more than a delightful dinner party conversation makes Twitter a bad idea. What we're slowly coming to grips with is the unimaginable complexity of human experience. Every task we complete or pleasure we pursue has dozens of moving parts, some of which can be improved or optimized through thoughtful design, while others just can't.The wisest conclusion for designers and the people who pay them is that we need to start thinking about how easy something should be, and making room for both simple and more complex versions of the same task. Spotify vs. the banjo may be an extreme example, but there are already many arenas of experience that support multiple levels of ease. This is why Vine and iMovie can thrive in a world that already has Adobe Premier and Final Cut Pro.There's an onus upon us as users though, too, to stop mindlessly insisting that everything be easy - or conversely, that only the most manual option will do. I, for one, am grateful that a snapshot of my son no longer requires a roll of film and a working knowledge of apertures and f-stops. But I wouldn't trade our banjo practice sessions for the world.This article originally appeared in the Design Week Portland online journal.

The Subscription that Makes CEOs Into Superusers,"Talking about The Young President's Organization with Scott MordellScott Mordell was the CEO of the Young Presidents' Organization or YPO from 2011 through 2020. Prior to that, he was a YPO member as the result of leadership roles at Chamberlain Group, HeathCo LLC, Duchossois Industries and Arlington International Racecourse. The Global YPO Community includes more than 29,000 members in more than 140 countries. Membership is limited to executives and entrepreneurs who have achieved significant leadership success at a young age. Combined, they lead businesses and organizations contributing $9 trillion in annual revenue.What I find fascinating about YPO is how intense and powerful the community is. People I know who are members will move mountains to make sure they can attend their regular meetings despite the fact that they're among the busiest people I know. Many of them fit the bill of superusers, my word to describe members who go beyond just being good members who pay their dues and get value from the offerings, but contribute significant time and money of their own to benefit the organization. Scott and I discussed what YPO has done structurally to attract, engage and retain CEOs around the world, how they've managed to recreate the magic globally and how they transform members into superusers.The following interview is adapted from my podcast, Subscription Stories: True Tales from the Trenches.Robbie Baxter: Tell me about the forever promise that you make to your members. What is it that you're going to do for them forever in exchange for their engagement and loyalty?Scott Mordell: First of all, we welcome extraordinary leaders to come together and grow together to improve their lives, businesses and ultimately, the world. It can be lonely to be a leader of an organization. Our forever promise is that you'll never walk alone in your journey as you go forward.Robbie Baxter: We all need that especially during times of COVID when we can feel especially lonely. Walk me through that experience of a new member, and this is a typical scenario, from the time that they first hear about or become interested in YPO, through the time when they feel like they're fully part of their forum.Scott Mordell: For many years now, we've been doing this and we've been a quiet organization. We've not been trying to put ourselves out there as anything other than helping our individual leaders grow and become better people. With that, some people will more often than not hear about YPO through other leaders, somebody who's been in contact with the organization or as a member of the organization in some way. Now, with social media and everything else happening, many prospective members and people aspiring to be members find out about us through social media. Once somebody becomes aware, there are two paths. One is if I come in contact with you, Robbie and I say, ""I think you'd be a fantastic member of YPO,"" the courtship and the conversation begins to happen. You're wondering what YPO is. What do they stand for? Why would I want to be a member? These days, people are joining fewer organizations as time goes and there'd be much more discriminating about how they participate in organizations. There's a diligence process that happens. For us, it happens from person to person. It's me explaining to you how YPO has changed my life. I'm a better leader, a better husband, better person than I would have been without YPO. To talk that all the way through and in that way, we can connect you to people in your industries and all the rest.Once the aspiring person says they would like to join YPO, then there's a pre-qualification process at which somebody fills out a rudimentary application that explains how their businesses have sufficient size and they are the leader of this organization. That matters to us. It's critical for our peer-to-peer relationships that people can have that peer empathy that we are running our organizations. Once that process goes forth, this person is going to be recruited into a chapter more likely than not. They will typically attend a chapter event and get to meet a number of the different members as time would go and it gives a flavor of what this YPO journey is going to be. From there, that leads into the formal application process, and the formal review process.Other people will reach out to us through our website. They have heard about YPO want to learn more. They can talk to our members right through our website and a live chat right then and there because CEOs expect person-to-person contact and attention. We spent quite a bit of time towards that. Then we'll either recommend them to a chapter or we have virtual chapters. Some of our incoming members will join virtual chapters because of where they live, maybe there's not a local chapter. We've got about four hundred seventy-five chapters located around the world. We're in many of the major business centers, but as we know some great leaders aren't in the major business centers. We want to make opportunities for them as well.Robbie Baxter: There are few things I wanted to follow-up on. I'll try to do them one at a time, although I'm excited about the different topics. One thing I like is that you're clear on who your ideal member is and it's the person who's responsible for leading the organization. I believe that one of the most important things about building a successful membership organization and justifying recurring revenue is that the organization is clear about who's an ideal member and also who's not an ideal member. The other thing that I find interesting is this is a friction-laden process. It's not like I give you some money and you tell me which chapter to join. It seems like you've deliberately put quite a bit of friction into the process of becoming a member.Scott Mordell: In a peer-to-peer organization, the members are the product or the experience for the other members. If we're going to create this safe space for people to truly be with peers, it's important that they be peers and we don't apologize for that. We create a safer place for people to share ideas because they know they're speaking with peers. That clarity has always been part of YPO. We debate what a peer is every single year and we go through all of those parts but in the same vein, that's important to us in terms of clarity.Relative to the process ahead, as we evolve, in some cases we're creating a little less friction relative to what it looks like but this isn't just my revenue is certain amount and therefore I should be in. There are personality attributes that would suggest whether or not you're a peer in terms of joining and in contributing to an organization like this. We are seeking a sense of curiosity and a sense of commitment to the experience. A member knows what they are getting into, so they don't say after going through the process that it isn't what they thought it was going to be. We try to minimize that. As a result of that back and forth relationship that builds up between the prospect and the organization, and between the prospect and the other members that that prospect meets in the process is particularly important to help validate everybody that this is going to be a great experience and we're going to have a good experience together.Robbie Baxter: What I love about this and what I hope our readers take away from this is that sometimes having that upfront discipline and not rushing to acquire anyone who wants to be part of your organization can lead to a more powerful value proposition for the members. As a result of that, a longer duration of the membership. I have something else that you said that stuck out for me. You talked about the forever promise being, ""You'll never walk alone,"" which is beautifully simple but also very ambitious. When you were describing some of the conversations that your members have, you mentioned being a good husband, being a good spouse. People don't usually think of that when you say, ""This is an organization to help me be a better leader and maybe I leave my personal life at home."" I don't think that's the case at YPO. Can you talk about that how, ""You'll never walk alone?"" To me, not just you'll never walk alone on your professional journey but also you can bring the rest of yourself to the group.Scott Mordell: Leadership is a whole-person experience. When I'm making business decisions, I'm bringing to bear my entire life, my personal life, the way that I feel now, all of my experiences, who I trust and who I don't trust, what's worked and what hasn't worked. YPO embraces the entire member's experience. That means that we embrace family inclusion. We embrace our spouse and partner inclusion. We provide programming for that whole experience. When we meet in our groups, we recognize that sometimes what's on my mind now is all my personal topics. We feel that if we did professional topics and limited within a range, that's not who we are about this lifelong journey about how a member's going to improve their leadership and their lives in the world. It requires a holistic attitude. We embrace that one hundred percent. In that sense, it's a big part of the distinction between YPO and maybe some universities, maybe some other different membership organizations that we recognize that the member joins the organization, not the CEO box of an organization and not the organization but it's the member, it's a leader herself or himself that joins the organization. We're very committed to that leader's development.Robbie Baxter: I'm going to ask you a question that I didn't tell you about in advance because of where this conversation is going. I hope it's okay and you're up for answering it. You were a member of YPO before you became YPO's leader. I'm curious if you could share maybe a little story from your time as a member and perhaps a time when you brought your whole self to the meeting. It would be helpful for people to understand what that might look like, bringing your whole self to the group.Scott Mordell: When I left Arlington International Racecourse, which was my first CEO role when I became a YPO member, I was at a career juncture and it was not entirely about my career. I had involved discussions with my forum about who I was going to be as Scott Mordell like, ""Who is Scott Mordell?"" Not, ""Who is Scott Mordell as a CEO? What's the next place you're going to go?"" but, ""What matters to you? What excites you? What doesn't excite you? Why?"" That ended up being a drawn-out in a good way, a personal experience for me to understand how that would play out.One other example which touches me and makes me want to cry as I think about it, I was a baseball coach for my kids. One of the kids that played with our kids ended up going to Italy and did what the college exchange students shouldn't do, but he got intoxicated and went home alone. They found him in a ditch beaten beyond recognition. He was in the hospital and I didn't know what to do. I called a YPO member in Milan who I knew, it turns out that he happens to be a doctor. He took it upon himself to fly to Rome, put himself into this situation and take care of this young man, helped the family connect with the hospital there.It was extraordinary to see YPOs in Italy who I barely knew. We're helping extradition and all kinds of support for the family. This is wasn't even a YPO family. It was people doing the right thing. When I think about that, that had nothing to do with business, had nothing to do with networking, had nothing to do with, ""Scott's going to do a favor for me in the future."" Those people are acting with an extraordinary amount of grace and goodwill. That's this whole person as it gets. There are many stories like that around YPO. I'll never be alone. When I'm in crisis, I'm coming to YPO. When I'm not in crisis, I'm going to help people. It's the spirit of togetherness that creates a sense of community.Robbie Baxter: How do you keep this magic as the organization has grown this intimacy and trust when you go across borders and adding new people all the time? How do you keep this level of community and culture even as you grow, expand and evolve?Scott Mordell: Part of it is that friction-filled process is helping people understand with some degree of clarity as to what the experience is going to be. As a result, we're going into it all wide-eyed and having big expectations as to what we can do and participate in. We have some personality attributes which are very important. We also are clear as an organization, we're not allowed to be an advocacy organization. We're not here to tell you exactly what to do. We're here to tell you what we're doing, what somebody else is doing, share through their experiences and you draw your own conclusions.As a result, we're not for or against any kind of economy, any kind of politician, any kind of philanthropy or charity work, any kind of industry. As a result, we do engage and invite open sharing. We welcome that and we welcome disagreement in, ""This is what I'm doing. This is what you're doing but I'm not here to convince you."" That welcoming spirit and curiosity that's inherent in all of the members translates incredibly well from chapter to chapter, no matter what country we're talking about whether it's in Mauritius, Canada, Singapore or China, it translates very well. It's implemented by the local cultures.What feels confidential for somebody who's grown up in China might be quite a bit different than what feels confidential for somebody who's grown up in England, for example. At the same time, it can be implemented based on their local mores and the local ways that people engage. When we cross-pollinate across our borders, whether it be through virtual events or in-person events, we come together with that same spirit of curiosity and acceptance that helps it all to work. It's a lot of similar protocols and attitudes, but they're implemented with cultural and geographical diversity.Robbie Baxter: If I went to a forum meeting in San Paulo, would it feel like Auckland or Dusseldorf? To what extent are you like McDonald's where the experience is consistent globally but with little bits of local flavor? To what extent would I maybe not even recognize that I was at a YPO event if I were in a different market?Scott Mordell: The only way that we're similar to McDonald's is we both have menus. We have a menu of opportunities. What we do is if there's a forum meeting in Oakland versus one meeting in San Paulo, they're going to go through basically a similar process of a meeting. There's an opening, a reminder of confidentiality and norms of how people are coming together. There's a conversation starter, updates, then there's a talk around what we'll call presentation, certain deep dive topics and issues. There's an exercise that everybody participates in and there's a check-out.That process will be the same wherever you go into a forum meeting around the world. How does that get executed? What's a good conversation starter in Sao Paulo with a particular group and in Oakland could be quite a bit different depending on what the current issue is, the tone and attitude of those members who are joining at the time. That's where we've got the menu. We've got resources available which can help the moderator, the person leading that particular group because it's all member-led. In terms of how we go about doing it, we try to resource them with the materials, so that they can build their own meeting that's effective for what they're trying to achieve at a point in time.Robbie Baxter: I talk about this concept of superusers. A superuser is somebody who goes beyond just being a good dues-paying member, who's using your services regularly and well, getting good value and happy to pay a fair price for that value. A superuser goes one step beyond that and contributes their own time and in some cases, money, toward the good of the organization, helping that organization's brand and product be more successful. YPO has a lot of those. One of them is a client of mine, McKeel Hagerty. He's the CEO of Hagerty Insurance, very well-known as perhaps the world's leading brand for classic car enthusiasts, but he's also the past global chair of YPO.He is phenomenally busy, running a good-sized organization with lots of challenges and yet during the time that we were working together, he was the Global Chair of YPO. Traveling all around the world, coming to meetings, speaking, talking about the future of the organization, dealing with challenges as they arose. I'm curious, how do you get people like McKeel to donate hundreds of hours for the good of the YPO Organization, well beyond what it would take for him to be a good and active member in his forum or chapter?Scott Mordell: It's complicated and simple at the exact same time. We're a peer-to-peer organization. Everything that we do, every single event is led by a member. Our overall governance of the organization is led by member boards, committees and volunteerism as part of the spirit of the organization. More than two-thirds of our members have volunteered in some way, shape or form for the organization. We're blessed with superusers like McKeel. He was a phenomenal chairman of YPO and an example of what we consider the model YPO owners, but we've got two-thirds of 30,000 people who have participated as leading events or are participating in other ways in terms of leading their forums. Why would you donate time back to something? It's because you get something back with some validation, some relationships that build because I'm volunteering, I may meet people from different countries outside of my industries that I may not have met.Otherwise, I may develop bonds and delight as I go around and have different experiences outside of my workflow. I become accountable as I build relationships by working alongside people. Nothing's going to make me do something more than me deciding to do it. That sense that I want to do it because I want to support you and help you becomes a cycle of participation. It does evolve to the point where we have some superusers and people who donate incredible amounts of time, who are incredibly busy but they find the time. It's because of the relationships, the contribution that they can make to others, the validation and value that they're coming back, the learning, the new ways that they're thinking, it becomes a self-fulfilling experience. In that sense, once you begin to get that, you want more of it.I've been CEO for many years, I've been a member for 25 years. I'm stepping out of this CEO role, I'm going to go back and take a breath. I'm sure I'm going to find other ways to volunteer back into YPO because I want to keep connected with my community. Going back to the earlier point you had raised relative to, it's more than business, it's the whole family. In my case, once my kids and my wife were getting value out of YPO and we feel we're part of that community, now I'm wanting to make the community great for them too. Therefore, it's not just a business pursuit, it's a personal pursuit. When it's personal, it becomes very sticky. Our renewal rates are over 95%. It's unheard of for membership organizations. It's because people are getting this kind of value and that's with two-thirds of our members volunteering over the course of their journey. I'm proud to be part of it. It's been a model that's been followed and sometimes the model is better than the management. Sometimes it works because it's a pure organization.Robbie Baxter: If you join YPO because you're leading an organization and then you move to a point where you're not leading an organization either because you're looking for the next thing or you're taking a break or you retire. Do you keep your membership in the organization? Do you need to be an active leader of an organization of a certain size?Scott Mordell: Earlier on in your tenure journey or your first six years when you join and say there's a transition which is perfectly natural, people are moving around to organizations and changes. We implement what we call grace, that you get a certain amount of grace time while you're putting yourself back into a leadership role. Members will find those roles. After one has been a member for over six years and the whole rest, while you are in YPO, you've been doing this now for long enough. If you've changed companies or changed the way that you lead organizations, whatever their scale is, you continue on as a member.Robbie Baxter: You're a member for the rest of your life if you choose to be?Scott Mordell: Yes. Our youngest member is 22 and our oldest is 99. That range of experiences of our members and when offered in the net safe communication space that, ""I've been through this and this is what I have to share."" There's a generational value, a business value and a life-stage value that our members get to share that as much more than business challenge value.Robbie Baxter: Talk about a forever transaction. Join when you're 22 and stay until you're 99 is close to as forever as it gets for people. As a membership person, I love that because I think a lot of organizations focus on a particular moment in time solving that pain point that might bring someone to you. I might call it a headline benefit. For example, people might be joining YPO because it's their first time leading an organization, or because they've run into a thorny problem and realize that they have no trusted peers and a friend or they have only one. Their one trusted peer friend says, ""This might be a good time for you to think about joining YPO."" Beyond that headline benefit is all of what I call engagement and retention benefits. All the reasons that somebody would choose to make it a habit after they've gotten through that sticky, difficult point that brought them in the first place.Also, that commitment to say, ""We're following you on the entire journey. You will never walk alone."" It doesn't say you will not walk alone for as long as you're a CEO or as long as you're a leader of an organization but never. Metaphorically, that's a useful concept. I had one question, I don't know that I heard you talk about acquisition metrics, awareness metrics, reasons for the loss, the things outside of the current membership base. What are the metrics that you use for people who are not members?Scott Mordell: We track our exit surveys and all of those reasons as to why people are leaving YPO. For the outside metrics, we track our pipeline in terms of who's in the pipeline and we can keep track of where that's going. We have some target markets as every organization does and how that pipeline looks in that target market area, which is quite important as we would see.Robbie Baxter: A target market like, ""We're growing in China. We're growing in New Zealand,"" or like a certain industry, ""We're trying to grow in Biotech or Pharm?""Scott Mordell: We're much more geographic-oriented. We're seeing that the industries end up reflecting the geographies a lot of times. We do run our industry spread but we don't say, ""We're running low on financial services. Let's go get some."" We don't do that because we haven't had to because we've been represented. What we do is we look at the markets, where we think are likely CEO prospects. One has been a growth area where in the last many years, we've grown from about 118 countries to over 140. Some of that's a wider footprint but in many cases, it's following the economy and finding out where the depth and the growth of the economy is making sure we're being meaningful there. Social media, the followers and we are not chasing just numbers, we want the right followers. We want people aspiring who are close to where we are, close to becoming members and also people who are opinion leaders and relevant in that way. We'll break down our followers and track that as best we can. We can always get better at it. It's a constant journey as everything gets more connected.Robbie Baxter: We're talking during the COVID 19 pandemic and I have to ask, what has been the impact of COVID on YPO? What has happened and how have you responded?Scott Mordell: Like everybody, it's been quite dramatic. We've had a number of members who have been in great pain and distress because of the economic impacts and also the societal impacts, and then we've got members who are doing very well in contributing and helping in different ways. We've seen the whole range of different approaches. It's disrupted everything. We've gone from 8,000 in-person events to 0. We've canceled some big events and had to make the pivot to much more digital and on-demand activity as everybody is doing the same.Our members are getting Zoom fatigue like many other people as well. We're evolving, even those engagements to be more person to person rather than one to many as that would go, and we're being aggressive about how we do that. The technological change is in need of technological change as is quite dramatic. Like many organizations, we're doubling down on some of the platforms that we're going to need to have in the engagements that we need to have. We've upped our personal attention. We do a process we call needs and leads and member to member exchange, where somebody is in crisis or somebody needs PPE or somebody needs some support or somebody needs some financial guidance. We're matching them with the members that we have, who can offer and help that. We have a lot of givers and a lot of people in need, and we're personally matching them.Robbie Baxter: For example, if I'm a member in Singapore and I need PPE, I would go directly to YPO headquarters and say, ""This is what I need."" You and your team would act almost as a matchmaker or concierge to try to figure out who might be able to help them in a digital way?Scott Mordell: Yes, and we created a mini marketplace group site where people could say, ""I've got a whole bunch of PPEs. I've got disinfectants."" We've published every single week where we could make that available to people. Some of that was done personally and facilitated as you described. Some of it was, ""I'll go to the Coronavirus microsite and if there's a PPE list, I'll look at the current one and I'll see what I can do."" Inventorying all that and moving that along is quite a bit different than the programming we were doing before COVID. It's highlighting for us that beyond the pandemic, the needs that people have are very varied all over the place. How do we create a real marketplace of needs and support for those needs that are more than our structured programming but is much more individualized? We're doing that through personal support as we evolve. It's a process underway but it's taken shape here under COVID.Robbie Baxter: Some of those features or benefits that you've created in response to member needs during COVID, are things that you plan to continue after things go back to where it's possible to go back to being in person?Scott Mordell: Think about what's happened for all of us. Our urgencies, in a lot of cases, have become immediate. It's not just personal growth but now we have urgent and immediate needs in a crisis, and how responsive and agile can we be as an organization to help members with what they need, not what would be static learning programming. With COVID, we've made a shift for that. That helped us create greater clarity about what it is that that member wants and needs. We need to be there for them because that's part of the lifetime journey. It's changing our outlook.Robbie Baxter: I want to wrap up with the two last things. The first one is I would love to get your advice for people who are reading, who tell me all the time, ""My membership, they are important people, they're very busy, they don't have time for the community, they don't have time to respond to my questions or requests."" What's your advice for leaders of global networks and communities who are trying to keep busy and powerful people engaged, and even to tap into this power of superusers?Scott Mordell: I'm always reminded that as human beings, we will do what we want to do and we will passively resist or aggressively resist what we don't want to do. Be very mindful about why would somebody want to volunteer time for the organization and what are they getting out of it for themselves in terms of their growth, in terms of their relationships, in terms of their whole being, in terms of whatever they're seeking? If we're not providing that in our communications or in our engagement opportunities, they tell us that based on the lack of response, based on the lack of participation and based on how hard we're trying to push something on them. We think it's a good idea but maybe they don't. Do you listen humbly to that?I believe a membership organization of any kind is an ongoing dialogue between whatever you consider the organization and the community that the organization represents and the individual members. If you can't keep some meaningful feedback loop or relationship that's as personal as it can be, you're starting to work for large numbers. It's easy to rationalize large numbers, but losing one can be devastating if it's for the wrong reason. In that sense, having that current dialogue is important. When people feel that they're being heard, their contributions and voices are meaningful and they're getting something out of those conversations, they're going to keep coming back for more.Robbie Baxter: The best piece of advice you received?Scott Mordell: In my role, I get a lot of advice from CEOs to CEOs. Continue to be more conversant in a person-to-person voice, don't speak on behalf of the organization. Every communication should come from a person, not from the organization. Nobody has an alliance with the organization and they have an alliance with other people. The advice I got was we need every communication owned by a person behind it and let's stand up for that no matter who it is but somebody who's going to own that communication and be the person speaking to the other person. We're going vigorously with person-to-person voice. Xavier Mufraggi, our new CEO who has replaced me at YPO, is all over that and pressing that. It's exciting to see. The advice is there, heard and being acted upon.Robbie Baxter: What is the first subscription you ever remember getting?Scott Mordell: Time Magazine. When I was 13 or 14 years old, I remember my father telling me, ""Scott, you have to be a generalist. You need to understand how the world works. You should subscribe to this."" He made me pay for my own subscription out of my newspaper route money. I've always been a generalist, reading and trying to see the world since then.Robbie Baxter: Your favorite subscription now?Scott Mordell: I'd have to say YPO. I'm a lifetime member of YPO and I'm not going anywhere. It provides value for me in so many different ways. It's going to help me as I renew myself for my next chapter. I'm fully committed to it.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*EbBg39hCUN6l7F80,https://robbiebax.medium.com/the-subscription-that-makes-ceos-into-superusers-738932d48353,leadership,3547d2afb285dfde9d74819c5dcd6ef7f1664044bd6a00c488a9339e
What I Learned On My Road Trip Through Alcoholism,"The word befuddlement comes to mind when I think about how I made it this far in life. Having five incredibly close calls with death, and an equal number of concussions, I decided my guidance system was either broken or possessed by a thirsty demon. No matter what course I was on, I always ended up with a drink in my hand.When I was in my 20's, my only goal was to outlive my dad who didn't make it to see his 30's. But once I turned 30, I achieved my only goal in life and had no idea where to go next. So what did I do? I did what I always did; I drank.Bored? Drink. Stressed? Drink. Drink? Drink. You get the picture.For four more years, my faulty GPS kept me on the path of this lubricated lifestyle. But shortly after turning 34, I opened my eyes to reality. On the morning of December 23rd, 2019, just a few days before Christmas, I realized I spent the last 15 years of my life coming to the conclusion that my drinking was going to kill me. I was faced with a tough question: drink or die? I faced this question before but never had I felt as ready as I was on this morning to answer it. 13 months later, I'm sober, and still here.Now that I've been sober for a while, I'm sure you're expecting to hear me say I've never felt better. Now, while that is true, it has not been an enjoyable journey. In fact, it started terribly. If I learned anything in my first few weeks, it was that this world is nothing but a torturous, spinning rock.Fortunately, once I regained the ability to function before 3pm, my feelings changed for the better. I started looking forward to waking up clearheaded and coffee never tasted so good. Mornings were the easy part. I knew the nights were going to be the hardest, and they did not disappoint. They were a roller-coaster of ups and downs.During my first few months of sobriety, I cycled through so many emotions while binge eating through alcoholic cravings. When I wasn't eating myself to the brink of extinction, I was battling an incessant barrage of questions like:The first question, ""am I doing the right thing,"" was an easy one, it was yes. But it never stopped popping up in the back of my mind as the cravings crept in, no doubt driven by the same evil that possessed my GPS for 15 years. This devil in my head was hell-bent on getting me to drink again. He would constantly challenge me with the second two questions, ""why can't you just have one drink?"" ""You really can't drink like a normal person? I bet you can this time, just go ahead, have one.""I knew he could not be trusted. This voice, the one I hear when I'm at my weakest, begging me to pop the tops and bring on the numbness, is not who I am, and he no longer has any sway over which direction I take my life.Though I have ceased listening to my devil, I am still thankful he exists because without being aware of his constant presence, I may forget the dangers that lie inside the bottle. Which brings me around to the last question, ""Is there something wrong with me?"" That's an easy one too, and the answer is yes; Alcohol.I was nursing a hangover on the couch while watching a YouTube clip from The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. The clip starts with Craig doing his opening monologue, but instead of his normal routine, he informs the crowd that he's ""going to do something a little bit different.""The monologue, though still sprinkled with a few jokes, turns into a deeply personal story where he compares the situation Britney Spears went through in 2007, to the times he often found himself when he was deep in the throes of alcoholism. He tells the audience about a time he was thinking of jumping off a bridge on Christmas to end his life, but got drunk instead and forgot to do it.When he was watching Britney Spears deal with her problems under the spotlight, he was reminded of himself in his darkest days, and says to the crowd, ""she clearly needs help."" The point Craig was making in his monologue is that we all need a little help every now and then, and it's important to recognize that.Something inside me connected with this story and it shook me to my core. At that moment I knew if I continued on the path my devil was carving out for me, I was going to have a story like his, or worse; no more stories to tell at all.That video inspired me to put forth a solid effort at quitting. So, in my way of reaching for help, I signed up for Audible with the sole intention of listening to self-help books, and downloaded my first book; ""Alcohol is Sh!t,"" by Paul Churchill.I have listened to this book four times through. It isn't your typical self-help book where the author whispers sweet nothings in your ear while trying to guide you to some far off, beautiful place in life. Instead, it's full of profanity, cold hard facts about alcohol, and lots of stories from similar people in the same situation in which I found myself.Now, when I hear that devil's voice, I think about all the pain and negativity alcohol has inflicted upon me: the few times I almost killed my best friend, the multiple times I almost died, the time I woke up in jail, the time I woke up in the hospital, the time I woke up to the police at my door waiting to take me to jail, and the second time I woke up at the hospital with a catheter inside me, broken ribs, a lacerated liver, a collapsed lung, and stitches in my head with no recollection of the previous night's events.Thankfully, my best friend - the one I almost killed a few times - spent the night in the hospital with me that last time and was there when I came to. He was able to fill me in on what happened the night before, including the multiple times he and the nurses had to tell me to stop pulling on my catheter. Yikes.These were the realities I needed to hear, and all of these events became the memories I would keep with me when I found myself digging in my pockets, searching for my keys to drive myself to a drink. Without these reminders, I might forget the pain alcohol has caused me, and inevitably end up back on the path of the lubricated lifestyle.If you find yourself in a similar situation to mine, especially after having endured the abomination that was 2020, give Paul Churchill's book a download, or watch the Craig Ferguson video I found so inspirational. Maybe you will connect with something in it the way I did, and it will jump-start your motivation.Once you decide to take the path of most resistance, there are so many things you can do to fill the void that alcohol once occupied in your daily life, you just have to look for them, and give them a try. Here are a few things that work for me:No matter what you decide to do, you aren't too far gone. Nothing, aside from death, is irreversible.If you feel like you're on course for that ultimate irreversibility, reach for the steering wheel from the least heard parts of your mind and make an attempt to turn it. Even if you just graze the wheel, you will end up in a better lane and on a far better course than the one you were heading down.If you feel like you are unable to change your course, and feel yourself veering toward the exit ramp, please get in touch with the people at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 1-800-273-8255 (24 hours a day) where you will find people who are willing to listen to you and help gently guide you back onto your highway.Once you decide to increase the quality of your life by cutting out the things that are holding you back, stay on your course, and don't let that devil in your head keep dictating the directions you take. That red bastard belongs in the back seat and he is only there to remind you of what you shouldn't be doing. Like all backseat drivers, he has no idea what he's talking about. Fuck that guy, I believe in you.Here are a few resources that will jump-start your journey down a new road.As always, thanks for reading, and if you need any further help or have any questions on my thought process or internal struggles, feel free to email me at j.mike.stanley@gmail.com (!)",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/1*0zme0czk8DJxmQP-9Syzzg.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/what-i-learned-on-my-road-trip-through-alcoholism-98b26eb718d0,mental-health,3558fbb679bde8dc0a6b56221aa2833a80e100b41013f8b13010eabd
How thinking like a developer can help you create more realistic prototypes,"ProtoPie's goal has always been to give designers autonomy. To do that ProtoPie needs to work the way a designer thinks. So far it has done a fairly good job at hiding away things like code and development constructs; giving the designer the freedom to be messy and explore ideas without concerning themselves with the build quality or organisation of their prototypes.But as prototypes become larger and more complex it becomes quickly apparent that creating in that hot messy exploration mode will eventually result in more time being spent fixing things than creating them.Comments come back from stakeholders such as; ""can you just make it do this"" or ""can you just change that"" and soon enough you are trying to retrofit changes; your time is being eaten up by bug fixing and rebuilding (something developers call refactoring).But it doesn't have to be like this. By adopting a few simple tried and tested principles that developers have been using for years and you can start to alleviate some of that pain and frustration. You can then get back on track building prototypes that can be more easily changed and iterated; as well as being able to be shared and collaborated with more easily.I can't tell you the number of hours I've wasted trying to figure out how a designer has prototyped something. It's no one's fault. We all have different ways of doing things but because of a lack of standards many hours figuring out how something has been built can be wasted.We can alleviate this with standards. Patterns, processes, and principles all contribute to creating common practice and understanding.So let's look at how we can apply some of these standards to ProtoPie.Over the years the developers have created processes, methodologies and frameworks to help them work more efficiently with code and more collaboratively in teams. Having a shared vocabulary of how things are organised and coded is crucial to enable a team of developers to work together efficiently.One of the biggest leaps forward in terms of code modularity was the invention of OOP (Object Oriented Programming).Previously to OOP, code was procedural; that is, it would execute in a linear fashion. Line 1, line 2, etc. With OOP, the structure was changed from Procedural to modular and many of the things we'll be borrowing from will be from OOP.One of the key concepts of OOP was the idea of classes. I like to think of components as synonymous to classes in oop.Components are key to modularity and reusability. It's all very well prototyping fast and hot but that likely means your duplicating UI independently. It takes a little bit more time but if you start seeing yourself duplicating a piece of UI more than once then it is likely to be a good candidate for a component.Components in ProtoPie can seem a little overwhelming and they do indeed bring with them a higher learning curve, but persevere because you will literally reap the rewards of using components very quickly. You will be able to internalise each component's functionality. This not only makes finding bugs easier as each instance (copy) of a component uses the same triggers and responses; it also enables you to reuse those components in other projects. Either way, it's a win-win.To find out more about components in ProtoPie check out this primer video:ProtoPie uses messages to allow components to talk to other components. You use the Send response and Receive trigger to pass messages through your prototype. Send and Receive have different channels. Think of channels as pipes or tunnels, each one is connected to a different part of your prototype. There are types of channels; Send to Current Scene, Send to Parent, Send to Child and Send to Component.We can apply the getter and setter pattern from OOP to messages within ProtoPie. Using this pattern makes it very clear what each block of interaction is doing.We can think of receive messages as getters and send messages as setters. Getters as you might expect are used to get information. As an example, I might add a Receive trigger in a component and call it getActiveWindow.The above trigger block is inside of my component. When the message is received the responses inside will execute.A setter is the reverse and would be a message that you send out such as in the example below. Setters could be triggered either by a getter or by something that happens internally inside your component.Adhering to this format makes it very easy for you to see what's going on inside your component. It also helps to differentiate internal component functions from external ones, things outside that affect (or in tech speak mutate) you component state or behaviour.To find out more about messages check out this primer video:In programming, there are two well-known constructs; variables and functions. Variables are containers for values. You can have lots of different types of variables. In a way its a bit like that game where you can only put a star in a box with a star-shaped hole or a circle or a square. Similarly, variables in ProtoPie have types, such as number, text and colour with each one only accepting numbers, text or hex values.We can use the OOP pattern for variables in ProtoPie in two different ways. Public variables and private variables. We can make variables public by tapping the overridable check box in the Variable section of the properties panelNow we can change that variable directly in the overrides panel outside of our component.For internal variables, we simply omit the overridable check box and therefore can only change them internally.Because overridable variable names are actually used in the overrides panel I tend to write them like this: My_Public_Variable. This makes them a bit more readable.To find out more about variables check out this primer video:Functions are a collection of actions that receive an input and send out an output. Functions are the workhorse of programming and work like mini-programs normally with a singular task. They are a great way of compartmentalizing your functionality into smaller digestible chunks. This has the added benefit of making them easing to debug.In ProtoPie we can use the concept of methods inside of our components in two ways. One way is using the messages channel Send to Component and Receive from Component.We can send a message from one trigger in our component to run a collection of responses inside of a receive trigger in the same component. This is another cool feature in ProtoPie that allows the compartmentalization of component responsesAnother way to create methods is by using the Detect trigger. You can do this by detecting a change in a variable enabling the detect to then execute a set of actions.Here's an example using detect in this way to create a Text field component:Creating a smart text field componentI use a leading underscore for method names just to make them easy to spot - another thing borrowed from OOP.So that about wraps up this look at how you can apply some formalisation to your prototypes in ProtoPie. Have a crack at some of these approaches and see what you think. Like most things, there's a bit of an investment initially but you will reap rewards pretty quickly.For more inspiration on how to build components in ProtoPie check out these.Learn ProtoPie Componentshttps://www.patreon.com/protopilot.For further reading, if you're interested in diving deeper into OOP and learning to think more like a developer:If you want to start your journey learning interaction design and prototyping without needing to learn any code or programming skills check out my YouTube and Patreon channels.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1240/1*3MplCbToL9mGuTdmPpmJcA.png,https://uxdesign.cc/how-thinking-like-a-developer-can-help-you-create-more-realistic-prototypes-e5ffba9cae4e,ux,3735e95a20a981a3a3bb56dbad1b49bb9ba46b31c65599ab43fd1348
Calm Your Soul With One Breath,"Since I was a teenager, I've struggled with chaotic thoughts.Most of the time I'm not in control, and it's been that way for well over a decade now.Recently I decided to put my foot down and stop these thoughts once and for all.After hearing about mindfulness and meditation for what seems like my whole life, I finally took action. This technique is the first thing I learned.I'm not about to stand up on a soapbox and tell you that this is going to change your life. I will make one promise to you though:Using this technique will bring you instantaneous peace.The first step is to simply relax and become aware of your breathing. You do not have to breathe deeply or change how you're breathing at all.However you're breathing right now is okay, become aware of it.Feel the air coming through your nose mouth. Feel it pushing down into your lungs, expanding them.Taste and smell the air. Gather the experience the air has to share with you.Now that you've noticed your breath, the next step is to inhale slowly and deliberately. Don't push your lung capacity, just breathe as deep as you feel comfortable doing.As you're inhaling, think to yourself""Breathing in, I am aware of my in-breath.""This helps center your mind onto your breathing. It stops you from considering anything other than your breath for just a moment.When you're ready to exhale, begin doing so.As you exhale, think to yourself""Breathing out, I am aware of my out-breath.""This further centers your mind. You're bringing your mind away from the chaos of the world and into the safe space of your soul.The whole exercise is one complete breath, but you can repeat this as many times as you need to. Each time you breathe, repeat the words in your mind and focus on your breath.When I wake up in the morning, I stretch and do this simple breathing exercise. When I'm confused about what to write next, I practice mindful breathing.Mastering this breathing technique will allow you to create your own personal bubble of peace no matter where you are.If you're a creator of any sort, mindful breathing is an invaluable tool for creative clarity. It's helped me come up with new ideas and fix up old ones.Thanks for reading. Have you ever practiced mindfulness? Let me know!",https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*OZoUE3vp6qRbndcYrq2Hkw.png,https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/calm-your-soul-with-one-breath-791a01d4227a,mindfulness,3913b7d5682768cc10b2193d6158fb6f8f1d8427a9f7dedb699fa76a
A Halo Above Her Head,"Author's note: This is my round 1 submission for the NYC Midnight Short Story Challenge 2021 competition.Simon raised his arms toward the sky, and gazing at the fluffy white clouds sprinkling the bright blue background, he felt his feet lift off of the pavement below.He floated up, above the masses as they scurried along the sidewalk, passing the windows of the second, third, and fourth floors of buildings that lined the street.""I'm flying,"" he cried, his chest bursting with joy.Seconds later the world began to swirl with vertiginous speed.And just like that, the dream was over.Simon propped himself up on his elbows fumbled for the bedside lamp. Then he opened his dream journal, clicked his ballpoint pen open, and jotted down a few notes:3:34 a.m. Flew down the street of a small town. Was lucid for about 4/5 seconds before the world spun apart.""Did you make the appointment?""""Yes, mother, I'm going to see Dr. Graham tomorrow,"" Simon sighed, fumbling with the piece of paper that held the appointment information. ""I still don't see the point - """"You walked in front of a speeding bus is the point, Simon,"" his mother interrupted, her voice trembling. ""You could have died.""""I know."" Simon stared at the floor, ashamed. He still didn't understand how it happened. He could have sworn he was in the middle of a dream; he remembered the hands of his watch spinning, and the sensation of floating up in the air, and the feeling that the world around him was unstable, trembling even. A feeling he never had when he was awake.Fortunately, the bus driver slammed on the breaks just in time, slowing the bus enough so that the resulting impact merely shoved Simon off-balance, toppling him to the ground. Unfortunately, when Simon fell to the ground his head smacked the pavement, causing him to lose consciousness. A bystander picked up Simon's phone and dialed his emergency contact - his mother - to report that ""the person who owns this phone was just hit by a bus.""He remembered waking up under the bright lights of the emergency room to the sound of his mother's sobs.""Oh my god, Simon. What have you done?"" Simon's eyes fluttered open, and he saw his mother leaning over his face, the light from the ceiling forming a halo above her head. It took a moment for his eyes to adjust to the bright lighting; when they did, he could see that her eyes were bright red, and her cheeks were wet from tears.""Are you on drugs?""""No, it's not like that at all,"" Simon insisted.""Are you, um...are you, are you okay?"" She whispered, motioning toward her own head.""What are you asking me?"" Simon felt the heat rising up the back of his neck, creeping towards his face and ears.""I don't - """"Are you asking me if I'm crazy?"" Simon's eyes glowered at his mother, who shook her head as her worn eyes refilled with tears.""You walked in front of a bus, Simon. Why would you do that?""""No mom. I would never, ever..."" he shook his head and held out his arms to her. She embraced him, weeping.""Please stop mom. I'm so sorry. I would never intentionally hurt myself. I promise.""""I'm glad you came to see me today, Simon,"" the doctor said greeting Simon with a polite smile. ""Please sit down,"" he continued, motioning toward the chair in front of his desk.Simon took a seat and glanced around the small office. It reminded him of the cramped faculty offices where he'd met with professors back in his college days, with floor to ceiling bookshelves crammed with books, binders, and stacks of loose paper.""So, why are you here today?"" Dr. Graham peered over his glasses at Simon, pen in hand ready to write. Simon shrugged and started to say he had no idea, but then he remembered the tortured sadness in his mother's eyes.""Because I walked in front of a bus. But - "" he held up his hands as if he was trying to stop another bus from running him over. ""I thought I was dreaming. Okay? I don't have a death wish or anything."" He studied the doctor's face, searching for a reaction. But the doctor's expression revealed nothing.""You weren't intentionally trying to hurt yourself?"" The doctor asked, his eyes narrowing as he listened for Simon's answer. Simon shook his head vigorously.""No, not at all. And I've tried to explain this to my mother, but - """"Your mother?""""Yes. She's why I'm here.""""You're here because of your mother?""""Yes. Well, no. Actually, I would not be here if my mother hadn't insisted. She worries about me,"" Simon shrugged. The doctor nodded.""When the bus hit me,"" Simon continued, ""I ended up at the hospital. And after that, my mom insisted that I talk to somebody about my dreams.""""Your dreams?"" The doctor sat up in his chair now, adjusting his elbow to rest his chin on his hand. He still hadn't written anything down.""Have you ever heard of lucid dreaming?"" Simon tilted his head, wondering if such a subject would be in the realm of study for psychiatrists. He imagined it would. But the doctor only offered a slight shrug.""Sure. Is that what you were trying to do?""""Well, that's the thing. I could have sworn I was in the middle of a dream. All the signs were there. I saw the - """"Signs?"" The doctor interrupted. ""What do you mean by 'signs'?""Well, for me, it's clocks.""""Clocks?""""Yes, clocks. Like my watch. You see,"" Simon lifted his wrist to show the doctor his watch. ""I stare at the hands, and I try to make them move.""""How do you do that?""""With my mind,"" Simon answered, and hearing himself say it out loud, it occurred to him how ridiculous he sounded. ""I mean, of course, I can't move the hands with my mind, I know that. I'm not crazy.""""So why do you try?""""Try what? Make the hands move? I'm training myself to look at my watch all the time, and when I do, I check to see if I can make the hands move. The more I do it, the more it becomes a habit. And the habit follows me into my dreams. Only, when I'm dreaming, I can make the hands move.""""Oh?"" The doctor sat up now and clicked his pen as if Simon finally said something worth noting.""Yes. That makes sense, right? How else could I move the hands?"" Simon shrugged and watched Dr. Graham look down at his notepad and begin writing.""Go on,"" the doctor said, still writing.""Well, I did my watch check, and I could make the hands move. So, I knew I was in a dream."" The doctor paused and glanced back up at Simon.""How does that make you feel? Waking up in a dream?""""It feels amazing, honestly. In fact, it feels like being a god. Well, it feels like what I imagine it must be like to be a god,"" Simon answered with a small smile. ""I control everything. All of the people. The setting. The weather.""""Mm-hmm.""""I can fly, I can - """"Excuse me? Did you say you can fly?"" The doctor raised his eyebrow at Simon.""Yes. Well, you know, in my dreams.""The doctor sat back in his chair and frowned. ""So what possessed you to want to walk in front of a moving bus?""It was Simon's turn to sit back and frown. He'd wracked his brain for days, trying to remember what he was thinking at that moment. Was it a failed attempt at flying? Was he testing the idea that he could pass through solid objects? He had no -""WAKE UP, SIMON,"" the doctor's thunderous voice reverberated against the walls of the tiny, cramped office, and disrupted Simon's thoughts with a jolt of electricity. The doctor's face was the size of the moon, eclipsing the light shining into the office from the window behind him. His bulging, veiny eyes bore into Simon's soul, while his large, cracked lips drew an uneven frame around his yellow-tinged, gritted teeth.Startled, Simon gripped the arms of his chair. But in the blink of an eye, the doctor was back in his chair, writing more notes on his notepad.""What did you just say?"" Simon creaked in a voice just above a whisper.""I didn't say anything,"" the doctor muttered as he continued writing. ""You were telling me why you wanted to walk in front of a bus.""""No. No, that's not true. You just told me to wake up, didn't you?"" Simon stared at the doctor. A strange feeling came over Simon, and he glanced down at his watch. ""Move,"" he thought silently, staring at the hands.All three hands began to spin. A feeling of calm replaced Simon's confusion; this was a dream. That explained everything. He glanced around the room and tried to make out the title of any of the books on the bookshelves that surrounded him. Instead of words and letters, there was nothing on the bindings but random marks and symbols.""This is a dream,"" Simon declared, rising to his feet. ""This isn't real. You aren't real.""The doctor stopped writing and stood up. He raised his hands in front of him, a posture that could be viewed as both defensive and an attempt to calm Simon down.""Simon, please sit back down. You are not dreaming. I assure you; I am really here.""""No, this is a dream,"" Simon shook his head and pointed at the bookshelves. ""See those? No words. Just gibberish,"" he said, his eyes skipping from book cover to book cover.""If this is a dream, that means you can fly, right?"" The doctor's voice was calm, and he lowered his arms. ""So, show me. If this is a dream, then fly.""""Fine,"" Simon said confidently, raising his arms to his sides. ""Lift,"" he thought, waiting for the feeling of his feet lifting off of the ground. In an instant he was hovering a few feet above the ground, looking down at the doctor.""Simon, I need you to - """"Do you see? Do you see me?"" Simon cried. ""I'm flying. I'm dreaming. This is a dream. I told you. I'm - """"Simon, I need you to tell me about the bus,"" the doctor stared up at Simon. ""Why did you step in front of the bus?""Simon floated back to the ground, his thoughts returning to the bus dream. He thought how strange it was to be awake inside of this dream, trying to remember a different dream. He shook his head.""It's like I told you. Maybe I was testing a theory, seeing if the bus would pass through me, something like that.""""But it didn't, did it?""""No. Because I wasn't dreaming,"" Simon sunk into the same shame and embarrassment he felt in the emergency room when he woke up to his mother's sad eyes.""But you believed you were dreaming. Just like you believe you are dreaming now, right?""Simon shot the doctor a look. ""What are you getting at?""""Do you remember how fast that bus was going?""""Sure,"" Simon nodded, visualizing the bus barreling down the lane. ""I specifically remember thinking that it was going really fast.""""How far away was the bus when you stepped in front of it?""""I jumped out at the last second,"" Simon recalled. ""I didn't want to give it a chance to slow down.""""Why?""Simon checked his watch again; the hands were still spinning. Then he looked at the doctor. ""Go away,"" he thought. Why couldn't he make the doctor go away?""You aren't real,"" Simon hissed at the man behind the desk. ""None of this is real.""""How can you know that Simon?"" The doctor challenged.""Because of this,"" Simon shrieked, holding up his wristwatch. ""Because of that,"" Simon pointed at the bookshelves. ""Because you just told me to wake up,"" Simon pointed his finger at the doctor's face. ""That's how I know.""The doctor shook his head. ""That didn't happen, and none of that proves - """"And I can do anything I want to in my dreams,"" Simon growled at the doctor. ""I could kill you if I wanted to.""The doctor stepped behind his chair. ""Simon, please calm down.""""No. You don't control this dream. I do,"" Simon snapped back, storming behind the desk. The doctor moved his chair between them, but Simon shoved it aside, causing the doctor to stumble backward against the window behind the desk. Then, Simon grabbed the doctor's neck with both hands, cutting off his air and preventing the doctor from making a sound. The doctor dug his fingernails into Simon's wrists, but Simon was unfazed by the pain, even as blood began to flow from the deep cuts.The doctor struggled, trying to kick Simon back, but with each passing second his strength dissipated. His face turned a deep shade of purple, and his eyes bulged out of their sockets. After a minute or so, the doctor collapsed to the floor, his neck slipping out of Simon's hands.Simon stared at the lifeless body. It was the first time he'd ever killed anyone in a dream, and he was surprised by the lack of remorse he felt.""This is just a dream,"" Simon whispered before running from the office and into the busy city street outside. He glanced at his watch - the hands were no longer spinning. ""Strange,"" he thought, then shouted ""MOVE"" at the still timepiece. Nothing.He spotted a clock at the entrance of a shop a few doors down. He rushed over, staring at the hands. ""MOVE"" he screamed. But the hands did not move. People gave him strange glances as they walked past.""This is impossible,"" he howled, grabbing the arm of a man rushing past him. ""This is just a dream,"" he shrieked at the man. The man's face twisted in outrage and he yanked his arm away.""Get the fuck away from me!"" The man roared.Simon stumbled back, screaming ""Wake up! I need to wake up!"" He watched people avert their eyes as they walked past him. In the distance, he saw a bus roaring down the bus lane closest to the curb of the sidewalk.""This is a dream,"" he repeated, less certain than before. ""This has to be a dream."" But what if it wasn't a dream? The memory of the doctor's lifeless body upstairs sent a shudder down his spine.""No, this must be a dream. I'll prove it,"" he whispered, stepping into the bus lane and closing his eyes.""Oh my god, Simon. What have you done?"" Simon's eyes fluttered open, and he saw his mother leaning over his face, the light from the ceiling forming a halo above her head.",https://miro.medium.com/max/9792/0*ioS2M7xqpGK9rIR1,https://medium.com/the-shadow/a-halo-above-her-head-a5f99a48cdd7,fiction,3954c89df64030de52a39d8779a93239f459232eabc8d0208f377aa2
The Most Important Self-Care Is All The Things You Dread,"""The doctor will call you from 11.30,"" said the tired-sounding receptionist.""Great: 11.30,"" I replied.""No from 11.30,"" she repeated.""Oh I see, but like from 11.30 to what sort of time?"" I said, feeling silly.""I'm afraid I can't tell you,"" she replied shortly, and she hung up.I'm quite alarmingly nervous of doctors and doctor's receptionists at the best of times. When I know I have an appointment coming up, I don't sleep as well, my heart races, my palms sweat and my stomach gets confused. It doesn't matter what I have to talk to the doctor about: it could be something as intimate as thrush or innocuous as a sore thumb, I'll still be a wreck.In pandemic life, it's somehow worse. They could apparently call at any moment, like say when I'm eating soup or on the toilet. And if after the call they decide I need to go in, then I have to mask up and hope for the best in surgery of sick humans; worse still, if they decide I need to go to the hospital, I have to take my chances there. Having already knocked out nearly 3 months of my life with Covid last year, I'm in no hurry to do it again.When I first heard of self-care it was from influencers buying themselves extravagant bouquets and taking complicated baths. I remember one who even posted herself greetings cards that said things like ""You're amazing"" on the front.I thought it looked privileged and a bit silly. Nevertheless, somewhere along the way I caved and used self-care as an excuse to buy organic facemasks and candles romantically named things like ""Old Library"" and ""Last Light"".This didn't last long. While these treats gave me a hit of pleasure, they didn't reach deep (except perhaps into my bank account). It occurred to me I'd misunderstood what it meant: self-care is really about looking after yourself mentally, spiritually and physically and less about buying stuff. I came across this quote from author Anne Lamott, and it resonated:I started to look after myself better. I felt more rested and began to enjoy all the little things I could give myself, many of them free. I went for long walks, drank coffee in patches of sunlight by open windows, spent whole afternoons block-carving while crime fiction novels played on Audible. It was a revelation. Even so, with all the unsolved worries I still had zipping around my head like pinballs, my core happiness remained unchanged.Unfortunately, it turns out self-care also includes doing all the things I loathe in the present but could make or break my future.I may not want to explain the minutiae of my embarrassingly human body to a doctor or submit myself to poking and prodding, but I'm lucky to have access to help and I'd be neglecting myself if I didn't take it. Similarly, I've never grown to look forward to my 40 minutes of daily exercise, but if I don't force myself out for a walk, my mental health suffers. I'll also never likely enjoy the anxiety associated with submitting short stories or articles to magazines, but doing so keeps me aligned with my values and dreams, and future me may well be glad I made the effort.And yet, there's a lot of happiness to be found in the relief of confronting our least-favourite tasks and methodically eliminating our worries. I used to keep trying to add things into my life for increased happiness. Better clothes! More hobbies! More self-care activities! Now, I'm starting to wonder if happiness is actually my natural state, what's left when my fears are taken away.Think about it: how would you feel right now if you'd spent today finally addressing all the niggling worries and unfinished projects hanging over you? Would you feel even better than if you'd spent it doing the nourishing self-care activities you love?When we approach self-care this way, it's also rooted in trust. Between starting and finishing this story, my doctor called and I was able to have my telephone appointment. Yes, I need to go in for further checks; perhaps I'll even have to have tests at the hospital. Nevertheless, I feel lighter just for getting started down the path to addressing a worry. Every time I solve a problem or worry, I grow more confident in my ability to look after myself.Self-care is a balance between nourishing myself in the present and living in the moment and looking after my interests in the future. And I have to accept the most important self-care is nearly always the things I least want to do.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10000/1*-JQrgZPvHiYtgWBEeUrAuA.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-most-important-self-care-is-all-the-things-you-dread-b41dae26b055,mindfulness,4567eefd9b7e4a0cc345c0edbba9a6069251bef2e39633f60f48126a
Why You Might Need a Humor Audit: the Benefits of Laughter,"Meet Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas, authors of Humor, Seriously: Why Humor Is a Secret Weapon in Business and Life.Dr. Jennifer Aaker teaches about human-centered AI, designing for VR/AR, and the power of story at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where she was awarded the MBA Professor of the Year, 2018-2019. Her work has been featured in The Economist, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, and Science.Naomi Bagdonas is a lecturer at the Stanford GSB, an executive coach for leaders of Fortune 100 companies, and a media consultant for celebrities making appearances on shows from Saturday Night Live to The Today Show. She received her formal training at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. She experiences first-hand the benefits of laughter, teaching improv at the San Francisco county jail and performing at comedy venues.Jennifer Aaker: Through our past experiences, we realized we'd sorely underestimated humor's potential to transform work and life. For Naomi, it was about using humor as an outlet and asset to deal with the seriousness of work she was doing. For me, humor was never a focus initially but sure, I liked laughter (which is impossible to say without sounding like a sociopath). This changed after I wrote my first book, The Dragonfly Effect about the power of story and networks to drive positive change in the world, and realized that humor could drive people in ways I had never before imagined.Naomi Bagdonas: The two of us met in 2014 after I guest lectured in one of Jennifer's classes on a completely unrelated topic. That led to us exploring questions, like what if together we could blend the behavioral science of humor with principles from comedy and apply them in a way that would actually be useful in business? We ended up creating and co-teaching the popular Stanford GSB course, Humor: Serious Business. Now we want to scale this beyond the classroom to help people find more joy at work and in their lives. So, here we are!JA: There's a huge lack of humor in the world, especially among serious people (which many of us are), and what's surprising is that it's costly. At first, when you hear how seldom adults laugh, you think, ""Well, that sucks, but it's probably practical."" But research shows ""that sucks, and it's wildly impractical."" Not laughing is a mistake. It costs you health, creativity, relationship-building, and negotiating power. It's an easy mistake to make because there's so much social reinforcement for the idea of being buttoned-up all the time, which we know because we've been teaching at business-school, which is ground zero for overserious attitudes.NB: We've all fallen off the humor cliff. Between the ages of 23 and 70, our ability to laugh declines precipitously, a phenomenon known as the ""Humor Cliff"". The average 4-year old laughs up to 300 times per day; the average 40-year old laughs that many times in 2.5 months. And that's in average times - which these are not. Add an endless pandemic, global warming, and whatever is happening with everyone's quarantine hair, and it's a miracle we're laughing at all.JA: Humor changes our brains. A lot of humor's power is chemical. When we laugh, our brains release a cocktail of healthy hormones like dopamine, endorphins, oxytocin, and this changes not just how we feel, e.g. more calm, confident, and resourceful, but how others perceive us - as more influential, likeable, and trustworthy. Oxytocin, by the way, is the same hormone released during sex and childbirth - both moments when, evolutionarily, it benefits us to feel bonded. In other words, having sex, giving birth, and laughing with colleagues on Zoom have more in common than you might think. Everyone's building bonds, and no one's wearing pants.Tip #1: Do a humor audit.JA: At the beginning of our course at Stanford, we have our students complete a Humor Audit - asking ourselves and others when we do, or more often don't, show a sense of humor and looking for those gaps where we aren't bringing our full, funny selves to the table. They spend one week and simply write down the moments when they laughed and when they made someone else laugh. So, for the next week, start a list and jot down these moments.Don't overthink it. These moments don't need to be knee-slappingly-funny. They can be moments that made you smile or even just tilt your head a little and go...""Huh!""This sounds quite simple, but it puts into practice a psychological principle called the priming effect, which essentially shows that we find what we set out to look for. Meta, I know.This habit creates a mindset shift. By the end of the week, you'll be navigating your life on the precipice of a smile rather than a frown.NB: You can also learn a lot from comedians, who are just really observant people with a sense of timing. Just noticing what's a little off and pointing it out is a start. This gets us not only laughing but also engaging more with what's around us.Tip #2: Use Comedy TechniquesA common misconception is that humor involves inventing something from thin air. When you think of it this way, it feels terribly difficult. In reality, humor more often involves noticing what's true.These truths can be really simple, like people video conferencing from home may or may not be wearing pants. Oh, guilty as charged! Then, you can use easy techniques like the Rule of Three to move that observation from mundane to (slightly) comical.Using the Rule of Three, we might say, ""When you're working from home, you just don't have some of the subtle things that make office life office life, like afternoon tea, supportive eye contact in meetings, and trousers.""JA: The other thing, which sounds kind of crazy at first, is to laugh every chance you get. If something's remotely funny, push yourself all the way into a laugh, which is both chemically rewarding for you and socially bonding for everyone around you.Tip #3: Be generous with your laughter.It's in your interest to let yourself laugh if something's remotely funny. Scientifically, being easy going with laughs is hugely beneficial. You feel closer to those you laugh with. Physiologically, humor is kind of like drugging your colleagues, but in a completely healthy way.Research shows that having a sense of humor makes managers 23% more respected and 25% more pleasant to work with. Also better looking. And that's science. Simple.JA: Even people who aren't funny should be using humor. You've heard, ""Don't quit your day job,"" right? We agree with that; don't quit your day job, but DO bring a sense of humor to your day job. As long as you aren't offending anyone, your sense of humor will help. That doesn't usually mean telling jokes, but being willing to be playful and laugh with others. Those kinds of easy things cut the tension and boost morale.NB: In order to use humor and levity in the workplace, you don't have to ""be funny."" What's far more important than cracking jokes is cultivating joy.See if you can follow me here: humor is both objective and subjective, which is a statement all people half disagree with. Most people believe it's one or the other, but we can objectively group people into four different humor styles that show why they have different subjective experiences of what's funny.JA: Also, sense of humor is not something you either have or don't. In reality, your sense of humor is like a muscle - even if it feels weak right now, the more you flex it, the easier and more natural it becomes to make yourself and others laugh. Part of this is just about understanding your own humor style. Over the last five years, we've run studies that show people that people tend to fall into four broad humor styles:The key is to disabuse yourself of the idea that using humor is the same thing as ""being funny"". Get to know and practice your humor style. You can take our humor quiz to find your humor style.NB: Now, humor isn't without its risks too. For example, there are risks with each style. For example, standups and snipers are at greatest risk of offending or alienating. Sweethearts and snipers are at greatest risk of taking away their own power through self-deprecation.That means something - especially if you look at gender differences through the lens of humor. For example, male leaders typically self categorize as Standups and Snipers at work, whereas female leaders typically self-categorize as Sweethearts and Magnets. This means that men, in general, are more at risk for offending, whereas women are at higher risk of over self-deprecating and undermining our power.We dive into how to mitigate these risks in the book. We devote an entire chapter 7 of the book, and a day of our course at Stanford to exploring how humor exists in the space between the comedian and the audience. It is so context dependent, and we don't always know the context of our audience. So there are risks but also ways to mitigate them.JA: We actually created a 21-day humor bootcamp to work on your humor every day, You can take via text message (bootcamp.humorseriously.com). It's like a helpful, slightly-annoying friend who gets you to work on humor on a daily basis. After those three weeks, a lot of this work will become internalized and natural. Humor is sometimes hard, but it gets (much) easier when you develop a habit. Also, we are the most enjoyable slightly-annoying friends you will ever have.NB: First, humor has a transformative effect on our behavior, psychology, mental health, creativity, feelings of closeness with others, and sense of meaning in life.Second, humor is a completely underleveraged asset at work. Our workplaces are far too humorless.Third, humor is a learnable skill. Small shifts in behavior and mindset are all it takes to reap the benefits, which are particularly profound in hard times.JA: Lastly, humor isn't just a way for us to be more effective leaders and more joyful people, but it's a way for us to lead lives of greater meaning. Research studies conducted by hospice workers have revealed surprising consistency about what people wish for in their final days of life - the regrets they have when looking back on how they've spent their time. From this work, five themes emerged: boldness, authenticity, presence, joy, and love.Here's the big secret: humor mitigates all five of these regrets.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2080/1*_8RQHTavUxjyruIrn_unYQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/behavior-design/why-you-might-need-a-humor-audit-the-benefits-of-laughter-b5fe87d0a6ee,mindfulness,4869bfe391e495a9a96564c3edb202fe63cdd8368434bef89ec80f89
10 Online Tools to Reduce Distractions and Increase Your Productivity,"I'm constantly on my computer. Whatever I do, whether writing, learning languages, playing games, or even chatting with my friends, I'm always online. And just like everybody else, I tend to succumb to distractions.To combat this, I've done a lot of research to control my urges and restrict what pulls me away from whatever task I choose to tackle. Some were awful. Some were okay. And these 11 ones are just incredible.I hope they can serve you as much as they've served me so far.Disclaimer: I am not receiving any compensation for any of the below tools. I only genuinely appreciate how useful they have been to my life.I usually have dozens of tabs open at the same time. Most of the time, all I can see is the icon from the website, which isn't very convenient when you're trying to concentrate on one thing.Luckily, Google Chrome has developed a tool for people who open way too many tabs at the same time: tab groups. With a simple right-click on any tab, you can create a group and give it a name.All the tabs you add to the group will then be compiled into one single tab. A single click on it is enough to expand it and show all that's inside. Until you do, however, you get to have a less-crowded tab bar and concentrate on whatever you choose to.Grouping tabs together can be very useful when you plan on using some (or all) of them during the same browsing session. Yet sometimes, you fall upon some things you want to look into later. Or you just want to go back to some pages another day.This often happens to me when I'm diving into Korean resources. One link brings me to another and then many more. By the time I'm done browsing, I still have many other tabs I still want to have a deeper look into.That's when the One Tab extension becomes useful. This extension allows you to save your tabs in one place, easily reachable by clicking on ""Display One Tab"" after right-clicking on any webpage.Each new tab saved there is grouped with other tabs saved the same day, making it easy to find what you want later on. Sometimes I keep them for months, sometimes they stay there until the next day.It's extremely convenient to declutter your browser from tabs you already know you won't use the same session or day.When you're prone to falling to distractions, it can be useful to completely block certain websites. Strict Workflow allows just that.This extension is based on the Pomodoro Technique and blocks certain websites for 25 min and then allows a break of 5 minutes. If you want, you can change the settings to different lengths of time.I used this extension often in my previous job to concentrate on tasks that needed my full concentration. The fact that a simple click on the extension icon activated it and the impossibility to turn it off in the middle of a session was very useful.These extensions are a god-send for addicts of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I'm bundling them together as all these three extensions do the exact same thing: hide the feed to prevent you from mindlessly scrolling it until the end of the day.I used to be addicted to Facebook so I've mostly used it for Facebook but the other two work in a similar way. The only slight change is the added bonus that the Facebook extension replaces the feed with a random quote. I find it neat.It's possible to bypass these extensions but it'll at least make you think for a second whether you actually want to scroll. There's nothing wrong with scrolling, as long as that's what you plan to do right now. Other times, it's better to keep this trigger at bay.This one is very similar to the feed eradicators but I keep it in a different section because it has a lot more features. Oh, and also because I'm much more addicted to YouTube than anything else.The DF Tube extension can hide and block pretty much anything you want on YouTube. My current setup only leaves the Subscription bar and allows playlists to be played.DF Tube is among my most relied upon extensions of all time. There's a lot I wouldn't have accomplished had I not had this extension to prevent me from hours upon hours of pointless Mario Maker videos.I'm an avid user of Notion and anyone who uses this platform will probably know and already be using this extension. It is perfect for when you want to save some reading content for later.With two clicks, you can copy the entire text of an article without having to highlight it. Notion Web Clipper recognizes what categorizes as the main content and then saves it.If your Notion set-up is well-organized, you can even save the texts in different, topic-separated, pages. Perfect for finding the content again later.I don't use this extension anymore since I now only use one screen at a time, but this one is a helpful tool for those who connect two or more screens on a single computer.The extension automatically blackens the browser's content the moment your mouse switches to another screen. It's perfect when you have one screen for your music, one with Facebook open, and one for work.Obviously, the best would be to have your distractions either shut down with Strict Workflow or hidden in One Tab, but if you still need them open, that's a perfect tool to not let your eyes wander away.This is the only paid one but, after using it for over a month, I feel compelled to mention it. This tool is probably the most efficient and useful I've found in a very long time.Freedom allows you to block websites, software (like games for example) on your computer, and apps on your phone at the same time. Since I've started using it to block almost everything except Medium when I write in the morning, I've seen my productivity increase manifold. I used to write a maximum of one long article in the morning. Now I can easily write three full-length posts.When you can't even reach for your phone for some distraction, all you can do is be productive. And it's a mere $19 per year after you use the code they automatically give you during the free trial. I don't know about you, but I find this worth it.There are a lot of other similar tools available on the market, but freedom was the one that surpassed them all for me. Especially since I can't cancel a session already started.Distractions are a plague online. They're everywhere, lurking and ready to jump on you to take you away from what you originally planned on doing.I've been through it all, like most people. Luckily, I grew so tired of it I dove into a rabbit hole of distraction-reduction tools. It took me years to gather all those and have what I now consider an almost-perfect set-up.You don't have to waste so many hours doing the same. Give these a go and look for better only if they don't satisfy your needs.If they work well, then smile and be happy about it.And then get productive.",https://miro.medium.com/max/7426/1*DGAVoq5E4sr7BpSXDvzg3w.jpeg,https://medium.com/curious/10-online-tools-to-reduce-distractions-and-increase-your-productivity-ab174bceb6ce,productivity,5401fe72f5240bf710752dc4d491c197d1d22ad44b2fd1c8688fdaaa
Bayesian A/B Testing WhatsApp Messages,"In this article, I will walk you through the process of performing an A/B testing analysis from the perspective of Bayesian statistics to determine the best WhatsApp message template to send to customers.To be fair, there is no difference if this is about a website landing page, a product feature or WhatsApp messages. The logic of A/B testing can be applied to any experiment. However, because I work at Sirena, I find it appropriate to use the example of WhatsApp messages.Let's set up the case for some context. You are an online retail business operating through WhatsApp in the modern era. For the purpose of this article, let's say you get 10K messages per working week, most of them during the day and so your incoming WhatsApp traffic might look something like this:Once your contacts reach out to you, a Sirena Bot contacts them right away. After your bot talks to them, they get transferred to one of your sales reps and the sales process begins. The question is, which message should your sales representatives send first?Ideally, you already have a bunch of message templates (highly-structured messages or HSMs) that your sales representatives can use. Probably they are currently alternating between a few options, but not really sure which one works best.Let's find out!Obviously answering this question will require us to dig into our data. For the purpose of this article, I have generated a random sample of data that simulates 10K incoming WhatsApp messages. The dataset is publicly available in my Github: FakeData/WhatsAppMessagesIn the data, we can also find the result of sending a given HSM (message template) to an incoming message. The result can be twofold; either the contact converts or they don't. The meaning of conversion here is not extremely relevant, you can think of it as something extremely simple, such as getting a reply, or something more elaborate as getting a positive reply determined by a sentiment analysis model. In any case, the result boils down to a 1 (converted) or a 0 (not converted).The flexibility of this dataset is that we can choose what message template to ""send"" to each incoming message and it will tell us what was the result. Pretty neat!If you are not familiar with A/B testing, the basic idea is to randomly choose which treatment (A or B) to give to an individual. It's a form of a controlled experiment where some fraction of the people get one treatment and another fraction gets another treatment. In the end, the objective is to determine which of the treatments is the ""best"".In our case, our treatments are different message templates (HSMs) and because we want to start simple, we will randomly assign each incoming message to one of the templates in a uniform manner. This means that at the end, we should have roughly 1/3 of the incoming messages being answered with HSM₁, another 1/3 with HSM₂ and finally, 1/3 using HSM₃. If you know anything about multi-armed bandits, you might recognize that this is not optimal. For now, bear with me and I'll write about multi-armed bandits in another post.Let's assign those message templates:If you recall, the dataset has data on how an incoming message would react to each message template:Now we are ready to explore our data.Now that we have assigned HSMs to every message, we can take a look at the data and explore the results. I won't focus too much on this part since the point of this article is the Bayesian analysis itself. However, it's important to check what the empirical conversion rates are for our sample:We can see that in our sample, the best template was HSM₂ with a conversion rate of about 10%. The worst conversion rate was for HSM₁ with a conversion rate of roughly 3.4%. The difference between these two templates is extreme, but if we take a look at HSM₃, with a conversion rate of 7.7%, one can wonder if there is really any difference between HSM₂ and HSM₃.Now let's move to the fun part. We want to understand how different the conversion rates for our templates actually are. The question is: is HSM₂ really better than HSM₃? Or was this just by chance and an artefact of our sample?To analyse this, I'll take a Bayesian approach. I recognise most people will be familiar with the Frequentists approach (such as hypothesis testing) and I'll probably write about it in another article. However, for the last couple of weeks, I've been obsessing about Bayesian statistics, so we'll use that. Specifically, I will use PyMC3 to model the problem and obtain posterior distributions of our conversion rates for each HSM.To start, we need to create a model for our conversion rates. The beautiful thing about Bayesian statistics is that it lets you incorporate prior knowledge or domain expertise into your analysis by using priors. In this case, let's not make any bold claims about our conversion rates. We'll use uniform distributions for the two conversion rates to represent how we have no clue what those conversion rates are.The next step is to define our delta, which we'll define as the difference between the first conversion rate and the second one. This can be interpreted as the gain in conversion rate that HSM₂ gives us compared to HSM₃. Last but not least, we use the conversion rates from our uniform distributions to model the conversions we observed. To model these conversions, we'll use a Bernoulli distribution that takes values that are either 0 or 1 with a certain probability (our conversion rates).After sampling from our model, we can plot some diagnostics:From these plots, we can see that a priori, HSM₂ has a conversion rate of about 9.6% and HSM₃ has a conversion rate of 7.7%. Additionally, we have the posterior distribution of deltas or the distribution of how much better HSM₂ is compared to HSM₃. All in all, it appears our model has converged and is looking good. Now, let's explore those posterior distributions.Notice that our Bayesian analysis has yielded distributions as a result instead of point-estimates. This represents our uncertainty about our estimations and is a perfect way to communicate results with business stakeholders. For example, looking at the distribution, we can see that the conversion rate of HSM₂ is anywhere between 8.7% and 11.2% while the distribution of the conversion rate of HSM₃ is between 6.2% and 8.7%.At the same time, we can analyse the distribution of delta (the difference in conversion rates). We see that the difference lies between 0% and 5%. This means that in the worst-case scenario, HSM₂ has no difference in conversion from HSM₃. However, there is a high probability (86%) that HSM₂ can increase our conversion rate by 1.25pp or more!In this article, I've shown you how to perform A/B testing using a Bayesian approach to determine which WhatsApp message template is the best.

Is It Time to Make Money From Your Passion Project?,"""I'm not sure I should keep doing this.""My friend who writes fiction in her free time, asked for advice. Despite having fun with her passion project, she wasn't sure if she wanted to keep doing it. After all, it took a lot of time and she didn't earn anything from it.Her experience is very common. When I first started following my passion, I offered free group calls where I helped people. It was my version of a passion project.At first, I felt ecstatic. It was wonderful to help people and practice my skills. It was great to do something that felt aligned and that I felt passionate about.But after a while, that excitement wore of. I needed to figure out why my feelings about my passion project had changed so dramatically.Motivation persists when efforts feel rewarding and the perception of reward can change.In other words: your passion project has to feel rewarding to you, and what that means might develop over time.At first, expressing you passion or getting positive feedback might be enough. But over time, you might also need other rewards to stay motivated. One such reward is financial compensation.Let's explore how you can start getting paid for your passion project.The first step to change is clarity. You need to get clear if and to what extent you want to monetize your passion project.While turning your passion into a side hustle has many benefits, it also has drawbacks. It can turn something that you feel passionate about into something that feels like a job.The pressure to earn money from your project can kill off the passion that made you start it in the first place. This is something I experienced when I started charging for some of the things I previously did for fun. So, tread carefully. Not everything should be monetized.The extent to which you want to monetize your passion project also makes a difference:The more you want to earn from your passion project, the more effort and time you will likely have to put into it.Example: ""Hmm, I definitely want to recover my expenses. It doesn't feel good to pay money to do this. I also would like to get some pocket money from it. Would I like to turn it into a genuine additional income stream? Perhaps later. Right now, I first want to start earning some money from it.""In this step, you determine whether you can monetize your passion in its current form. For people to be willing to pay for something, they need to receive value from it. This value can be information, entertainment, transformation, etc.However, just because people receive value from something doesn't mean they'd be willing to pay for it. We all receive value from search engines and yet, due to social convention, few of us would be willing to pay for it. (Of course, we indirectly pay for it anyway with our data but that's a separate story.)To find out if people are willing to pay for what you do, research how people monetize comparable passion projects. It can also be useful to ask in online groups if people are aware of something that's similar to what you do.Create a list of all the different ways you could monetize your passion project.Example: ""Hmm, so my fiction readers definitely receive value from what I'm doing. I'm receiving a lot of positive comments. Would they be willing to pay for it?Well, if I look at other fiction writers, many of them do get paid at least some money if they put their writing into book form. I think there are also platforms such as Wattpad where some fiction writers get paid. I could also check out if there are fiction writers who use Patreon and offer their supporters exclusive stories.""Pick one of the the monetization routes (either the simplest or the one most likely to succeed) you have brainstormed in the previous step and implement it.Ultimately, there's only one way to find out if you can monetize your passion project: give people a way to pay you and see if they respond. Over time, you also want to try out different ways to monetize your passion. If the first one doesn't work, perhaps it just wasn't the right one.Example: ""Alright, so putting my writing in book form would take a long time, so I think I will begin by creating a Patreon and offer the people who support me through that exclusive stories.""If you already have an audience who loves what you're doing, you might have made some money right away. If not, it could be that you don't yet have enough people who want to support your passion project.Either way, you want to continue to build your audience. The bigger your audience, the higher your income potential. So, decide on a plan for increasing your audience.Example: ""Alright, so I tend to receive some comments on my writing so I think I already have somewhat of an audience at the moment. To increase my audience, I want to continue to improve my craft, write more frequently, and encourage my fans to share my writing with others. I also want to expand to other platforms to reach people there.""By following the steps above, my friend can start earning money from her writing. Over time, this can lead into a side business or even a full-time business.My friend can get there by deciding to monetize her writing, exploring ways to make money from it, taking action, and growing her audience.You can do the same.If you have started or are considering to start a passion project, why not take it up a notch and aim for a profitable one? By monetizing your passion project, it might also stay more rewarding for you.I give more advice on how to start getting paid for your passion here.A 5-day email course with tips on budgeting, investing, and productivity for 20-somethings.

This is why you want to consider an eGPU for Deep Learning on your mobile Work Station,"Deep Learning is a task that was definitely not intended to run on a mobile device like your personal Notebook. Usually local GPU clusters or cloud based Server Systems are used to train models in an acceptable time period. However, everyone that is in to AI in general likes to try out stuff on its own. Depending on your field of interest it gets quite obvious that without any GPU at hand you should not even consider to start. If you have a Nvidia GPU (AMD with plaidml is possible but not well established by now) in your machine you might be confident to give it try. Unfortunately you realize that this will not be sustainable. It is nice to be able to train a VGG-16 with a batch size of 2 with your mid/ low level RTX 20 series card, but it just takes too long and your notebook will sound and feel like a plane before take off. These machines can easily handle daily work, but were for sure not designed to train deep learning models for 24 hours straight. Even if you have a good gaming notebook with a descent GPU, you may not want to run machine learning projects on your local GPU for the following reasons:When I realized that, I started to research what options I have if I would like to keep my current gear but become more ""competitive"" regarding machine learning. I ended up with the following two options:Option 1 was tempting at first, but I have read a lot of articles on medium covering the problem with randomly selected GPUs, which vary a lot in speed. I still think that it is the best option for beginners to start with, because a lot of tutorials are targeting Google Colab and it is fro free. But, I personally like to have my projects running on my local machine without having to rely on internet connections or anything else. Hence, I decided to buy a used eGPU to test what benefit it would give to my system.I got my hands on a used RTX 2080Ti eGPU all in one solution from Gigabyte. If you start digging deeper into eGPU related topics you will quickly realize that the Thunderbolt 3 connection is limiting the performance gain of the desktop GPU because of the maximum 4 PCI lanes it can use. I was afraid that this could result in a very poor performance in machine learning, but as you will see, I was wrong (luckily :D). As a side note, the performance dip for gaming is indeed very big and I would not recommend to buy an eGPU for gaming if you already have a dedicated GPU inside your Notebook.My system has an i7 9750H 6 core processor with 32gb of RAM running on POP OS 20.04. The integrated Nvidia RTX Quadro 5000 Max Q is one of the most capable mobile GPU chips out there (at least before the new RTX 30 Series). So if you run on a mid-/ low level Nvidia RTX 20 Series card, you will gain a lot more performance than even shown in this comparison. I used the AI-Benchmark tool. This way I wanted to assure that you can compare your machine to the results of my system using the eGPU.The eGPU set up scored 27104 points in AI-Benchmark, which is 17.6% less than the best official result for any RTX 2080 TI system (full Desktop Tower). The dedicated Notebook GPU scored 17046 points, which is actually higher than the listed score in the ranking. That is a performance loss of 37.2% compared to the eGPU set up.The performance gain for training using the AI-benchmark was 34.8% over all tests. The test palette ranges from simple Image Classification tasks over Image Super Resolution Networks, Natural Language Tasks and TimeSeries problems. As you can see the eGPU shows the biggest performance gains for Image related tasks whereas it shows not a great benefit for TimeSeries Tasks. Overall I am really pleased with this performance boost.I also did a real world test using one of my own projects. I trained the EfficientDet D0 512 x512 for a two class object detection task using the facial mask set from Roboflow. I trained the model on both systems for 10k steps with a batch size of 12. The eGPU set up took 93 minutes to complete this task. In comparison, the dedicated Laptop GPU needed 124 minutes to finish. This is 25% less time spend on training.The performance gain during Inference is 29.8% on average ranging from a performance loss of 9.6% all the way up to a top performance boost of 50.2%. Interestingly the eGPU struggles with the Super Resolution task the most. Again, the TimeSeries models show no big improvement compared to other Image tasks.If you want to stick with your portable Notebook, getting a hand on an external GPU can definitely speed up your AI game. Especially Computer Vision Tasks will benefit a lot. It will not only save you precious time but also can retain a good health of your machine for a much longer time. Keep in mind, that I tested the eGPU setup against one of the fastest mobile chips out there, hence you might benefit a lot more!",,https://alex-vaith.medium.com/this-is-why-you-want-to-consider-an-egpu-for-deep-learning-on-your-mobile-work-station-a26dc9ed8673,artificial-intelligence,6813fed36ca8567692bd3d9e7b96c5ae2844fcee769eb5703b7a9ee7
Your House is the Enemy,"Let's say you have a goal to reduce your snacking.You spend your morning with the goal in mind - feeling really good about the decision. At lunchtime, you purposefully turn your attention away from the brownies the cabinet and feel virtuous. Around 3pm, your stomach rumbles and you think about the brownies...and jerk your thoughts away. ""No, I am not snacking"" you remind yourself. You have a nice dinner and carefully eat the one square of chocolate you promised yourself. Then 9pm comes around and finds you shamefully shoveling brownie into your face with your bare hands over the sink.The next morning you again commit to reduce your snacking as you clean the chocolate smears from your cheeks - feeling really good about the decision.Its a vicious cycle.And one that has been written about in far too many places for me to feel like I'd add much to the conversation. However, there is one small change that may have helped mitigate this cycle.Imagine if the brownies were gone?In other words, if you don't create and control your environment, it will control you.But, guess what? This is great because you can design your environment to work FOR you instead of against you - supplementing your willpower instead of eking it away.By changing using the concept of environmental design, you can make it harder for yourself to do the 'bad' behaviors and easier to do the the 'good' ones.Here are a few ways to get started:Example: I hate waking up early and I hate when its cold. Its harder for me to stick to my goals of waking up early because its cold, and my bed is not. So I have my clothes waiting next to my heater so they are toasty. Slipping into a pair of baked socks and sweater is a nice reward for leaving my bed.Example: While driving, I floss my teeth with a flosser. Do I look weird? Yes. Do I care? No. It is easy to remember to floss because I have the flossers in my car door and a trash can to toss them in.Example: I am building the habit of removing my contacts nightly, but if I need to hunt down the case, the glasses, the cleaning solution...well its WAY easier to just sleep in them. So I have all these things in a cute container on my sink next to my yummy melatonin gummies (Pavlov would be proud). When I don't want to look to be on my computer anymore, I put in the trunk of my car.These are just a few ways to be nice to your inner angels and starve your inner devils. There are tons of ways to use environmental design in your own life, but the first way to begin is by noticing how your environment impacts your choices.And once you notice it, what will you do to make a change?",https://miro.medium.com/max/1188/0*TFW4ryOLpyuZbiVw.jpg,https://samseaster.medium.com/your-house-is-the-enemy-7a5e9426f5c9,productivity,7072dc11938c72c116d865eb2ba1bc1dd059bbe5d05a2dadcf7226de
Genomics New Clothes,"This is the twenty second article of my column Mathematical Statistics and Machine Learning for Life Sciences, where I discuss in plain language some mysterious analytical techniques that are common in Computational Biology. Genome-wide genotyping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) brought unprecedented resolution to genetic studies in Life Sciences, but also resulted in rapid growth of high-dimensional genetic variation data suffering from the Curse of Dimensionality. In the present article, I will give some theoretical background of the problem, and discuss why it is extremely challenging to do any meaningful and robust analysis in modern Genetics and Genomics.Everyone who works with Genomics data has probably heard at least once a phrase said by somebody from senior colleagues:Every time I hear this phrase, I think how easy the life of an analyst was when working with 10 genetic variants, and what a scary headache it is nowadays to analyze million-dimensional genetic variation data. The reason I am worried about robustness of genomics research is because I typically think about any type of data in terms of matrix dimensions.For me, the choice of analysis technique depends on the ratio between N (the number of statistical observations, samples) and P (the number of variables / measurements / features). In the figure above, you can see that this ratio for genetic variation data matrix (left) is very different from e.g. scRNAseq data (right) even though the products of the dimensions are equal. Indeed, usually for a WGS project, we can afford to sequence around ~1000 samples (see e.g. 1000 genomes project), while we discover millions of mutational differences across individual genomes, so the feature space is million-dimensional. This is orthogonal to the data structure in single cell sequencing, where sample sizes break records every year approaching millions of cells sequenced, while the number of genes expressed per cell is often limited to ~1000, at least for the high-throughput 10X Genomics technologies. Thus, while containing similar amounts of elements, the data matrices from genetic variation and scRNAseq are dramatically different. I refer to scRNAseq as Big Data since it gives a lot of flexibility and statistical power for analysis. In contrast, I tend to consider genetic variation as Little Data because of numerous limitations of working with this high-dimensional data type.Typically, I choose a particular type of analysis looking at the dimensions of the data. For example, if N ~ P or N > P we can use traditional Frequentist statistics. If we have a lot of data points, i.e. N >> P (epidemiological limit), one can again of course use the Frequentist statistics, but this limit gives us much more freedom to try non-linear approaches such as Machine and Deep Learning. Finally, in the most difficult limit P >> N (high-dimensional data), assumptions of Frequentist statistics, such as normality assumption, are not valid any more, and one should use some regularizations or priors within the Bayesian approach. As you see, genetic variation data falls into P >> N limit.Why would it be dangerous to continue using traditional Frequentist statistics in the limit P >> N? One example would be a linear regression Y~X problem, where X is a high-dimensional genotype matrix, and Y is a variable of interest (trait or phenotype). It turns out that the linear regression problem can not be solved in the high-dimensional (P >> N) limit because the covariance matrix can not be inverted, it diverges in the limit due to the Curse of Dimensionality.Another example would be the famous biased variance estimator within the Maximum Likelihood (which is a synonym to Frequentist statistics) approach. It can be derived that the variance estimated from maximizing p-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution is given asHere you explicitly see the interplay between N and P, i.e. the closer P is to N (still providing that N > P) the more the variance estimator is biased. I do not know how this equation would look in the high-dimensional limit P >> N. I assume Karl Pearson, Roland Fisher and other fathers of Frequentist approach never considered that there can be a data with dimensionality P > N.An interesting way to demonstrate the difference between high-dimensional (P >> N) and low-dimensional (P << N) data is to compute the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and display the distributions of eigenvalues, this can be easily done at least for random matrices with different dimensionality.From the figure above we can see a clear difference between shapes of the distributions and ranges of eigenvalues computed for data with different dimensionality. The eigenvalues follow the Marchenko-Pastur law and this distribution can be utilized for further investigation of the nature of high-dimensional Genomics data.One of remarkable manifestations of the Curse of Dimensionality in Genomics is the sparsity of Genomics data. Sparsity is a lack of statistical observations (often due to poor sampling) for certain ranges of variables measured in an experiment. In case of Genomics, sparsity is a consequence of inability to find enough carriers of rare alleles. Consider 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 100 individuals. Assuming minor allele frequency (MAF) of 10% for all three SNPs, we can expect only 10 minor allele carriers for each SNP, only 1 carrier of both minor alleles for two SNPs simultaneously, and 0 samples with minor alleles in the positions of all three SNPs simultaneously.Therefore, we can not in principle associate a trait of the 100 individuals with minor alleles of all the 3 SNPs. Moreover, even if we try to to do association of a phenotype (Phen) against only two SNPs simultaneously, Phen ~ SNP1 + SNP2, i.e. in 2-dimensional space, we still can not robustly compute it because of the lack of observations (only 1 sample) of carriers for both minor alleles together. In the figure below, circles are the carries of minor alleles. For a 1D problem, Phen ~ SNP A, we have 10 minor and 90 major allele carries that is probably enough for a robust linear or logistic regression analysis. However, when we have a 2D problem, Phen ~ SNP A + SNP B, we have only 1 sample in the bottom right square of the 2D parameter space, so we can not proceed with the regression analysis because of the improper sampling.Therefore, despite a fair sample size n=100 (at least for Evolutionary Biology it is a fair sample size), we can't compute a simultaneous effect of two SNPs on a variation of a trait (Phen). Moreover, even the UK Biobank with n=500 000 participants would not be able to analyze more than 4 - 5 SNPs with MAF = 10% at a time. Note, that for p=1 000 000 SNPs (approximate dimensionality of the genetic UK Biobank data set), the sample size n = 500 000 is not really large enough, we still have sparse data at p >> n suffering from the Curse of Dimensionality.In reality, the best we can do is to analyze 1 SNP at a time similar to Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). This implies that we can not capture any interplay between variants providing that a phenotype might be caused by a co-occurence of minor alleles from multiple variants, rather than effects from individual SNPs. To still account for the effects of multiple SNPs it is common to construct a so-called Polygenic Risk Score (PRS), that can be later validated against the trait / phenotype of interest in an independent sample.This however results in a problem known as The Missing Heritability problem. The problem is formulated as a lack of reliable prediction of a phenotype of interest from the genetic variation data. To say it differently, genetic variants individually detected to be associated with a phenotype of interest, can not explain a reasonable amount of variation in the phenotype of interest when collapsed together in a Polygenic Risk Score (PRS).Despite multiple explanations of the Missing Heritability problem have been suggested, one obvious thing would be to note that the causal genetic variants in GWAS are searched one-by-one (because we do not have the power to test multiple SNPs) and put together in an additive manner in PRS, and therefore can not account for epistatic non-additive effects of multiple variants that potentially might underlie the phenotypic variation.Another important consequence of the Curse of Dimensionality in Genomics data that leads to individual rather than collective testing of genetic variants is the necessity to correct for multiple testing in order to decrease the number of false-positive discoveries. This however does not seem to solve the problem of false-positive discoveries entirely. As it is elegantly shown by Naomi Altman et al. in the Nature Methods article below, correcting for multiple testing with accepted false-discovery rate of 5% still results in a number of false positives far beyond the expected number.Therefore, it is not uncommon even in very well powered GWAS studies to see obviously spurious but strong genetic signals for such phenotypes as ""number of vehicles in household"", ""time spent watching television"", ""weekly usage of mobile phone in last 3 months"", ""salad / raw vegetable intake"" etc. that can be nowadays detected and explored thanks to the GWASbot.Those phenotypes are hard to believe to be heritable and hence their strong ""genetic signal"" possibly originates from confounding by another factor such as population structure. The confounding factors are rarely known in reality, this fact further complicates our ability to use genetic studies for prediction of common traits such as diseases for the purposes of e.g. Precision Medicine.Therefore if we were to use genetic variants identified in GWAS studies for predicting common diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA), that would probably not be successful compared to the prediction based on clinical factors (body temperature, blood pressure etc.) alone, see below.Moreover, a recent study demonstrate that predictive power of microbiome data exceeds that of GWAS studies in the discrimination of complex human diseases.The poor prediction based on genetic variation data is another demonstration of the very complicated high-dimensional nature of the data that suffers from the Curse of Dimensionality.Let us give some theoretical background for the Curse of Dimensionality. If we were to visualize a high-dimensional data such as genetic variation, we would be very surprised to see how strange the data looks in high dimensions. For example, let us simulate a data uniformly distributed in a p-dimensional ball with p = 2, 5, 10 and 100, and visualize any two dimensions of the data:It turns out that when dimensionality of space grows, the data points become more and more concentrated on the surface of the p-dimensional ball with the hollow center. Further, if we plot a histogram of pairwise Euclidean distances the data points will look more and more equidistant and far away from each other with the growth of the space dimensionality, note how the distributions become more narrow and shifted toward larger distances when increasing the dimensionality in the figure below.It can be derived that the mean pairwise Euclidean distance grows as a square root of the number of dimensions. This law explicitly demonstrates that data points move further away from each other in high-dimensional spaces.To empirically demonstrate this law, here we will construct a random data matrix, compute Euclidean distances between all pairs of data points, and visualize this dependence. The green curve in the figure below is the mean distance, and the red curves display two standard deviations from the mean.The latter figure displays the mean pairwise Euclidean distance between data points as a function of the number of dimensions on a log-scale. Computing the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) linear regression one can obtain the slope of the line to be equal to 0.56 which is close to the theoretical value of 0.5. In a similar way, computing an average distance between any given data point and its nearest, middle and farthest neighbor, one can obtain the following figure:We can see that the difference between the distances from a data point to its closest and farthest neighbors becomes indistinguishable in high-dimensional space. This implies that we can not group ""good"", ""bad"" and ""ugly"" data points together based on their similarity metric any longer. Therefore, clustering in high-dimensional space is widely acknowledged to be very unreliable simply because all data points look equally similar to each other. In terms of genetic variation data, this implies that e.g. ""sick"" and ""healthy"" individuals can not be confidently separated based on their genetic information, this results in a poor prediction of traits and eventually the Missing Heritability Problem. In my previous post, How to Cluster in High Dimensions, I tried to explore the clustering problem in some detail. You might also want to check the article No True Effects in High Dimensions to get a better intuition about weird things in high-dimensional data analysis.Another manifestation of the poor grouping of data points in high dimensions is the very weak correlations between the data points. Below, we construct a random data matrix following Normal distribution, and compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between all pairs of data points.The figure above displays the maximal Pearson correlation between pairs of samples as a function of increasing dimensionality of the data. We observe, that when the number of dimensions reaches approximately 100, no pair of data points demonstrates Pearson correlation with coefficient above 0.5, that means the data points are more and more difficult to group and cluster in high dimensions. In terms of genetic variation, it is problematic to assign samples to a certain population based on their genetic background by using the raw matrix of genotypes. One should at least try to reduce dimensions in order to address this problem.What can we do to minimize the damage from the Curse of Dimensionality in Genomics data? I see the following four options that can improve our analysis in Genetics research area:Increasing sample size is a brute force approach that is not always affordable, however it is the most straightforward way. Regularization should be used in my opinion more often in Genetics research. At least performing association studies genome-wide with LASSO in a sliding window seems like a possible thing to do to account for epistasis without a lot of problems due to the Curse of Dimensionality. Performing dimension reduction and replacing the original genotype data with latent variables seems to be a relatively easy and efficient way to overcome the Curse of Dimensionality problem, and there are already some promising attempts in literature. Finally, Bayesian statistics is another way to perform a meaningful analysis in under-powered studies thanks to the priors that essentially provide regularization and reduce risks of overfitting for high-dimensional genetic variation data.In this article, we have learnt that it is extremely challenging to perform a robust analysis with genetic variation data because of the high-dimensional nature of the data that suffers from the Curse of Dimensionality. Due to low sample sizes and sparsity of genetic variation data, genetics analyses often result in poor predictive power of common traits that is known as the Missing Heritability problem. High-dimensional data behave in a counter-intuitive way when data points become equidistant and very poorly correlated with each other that results in severe problems when clustering the data.As usually, let me know in the comments below what topics in Life Sciences and computational Biology seem especially mysterious to you and I will try to address them in this column.

Next Generation Digital Damage,"I've got a real problem with how we're fucking up the next generation by attention farming for ourselves. The seeds we've sown that grew into our offspring are in for a rude awakening unless we change our ways on the double.I'm not talking about protecting the environment as goodness knows plenty of well-intentioned people have already taken up this cause. I'm also not talking about helicopter parents, participation awards, or the relentless pursuit of living our dreams vicariously through children when we failed on the sporting fields of the globe.I am talking about the digital blob that grows exponentially every day through both harmless intent, and malicious actions alike, known as the ""Digital Shadow"" of minors. They are unable to comprehend or control its growth and at the same time, we do little to stop it.This week here in Queensland, Australia, thousands of children returned to the classroom to begin Term 1 of a new school year. In addition to the swell in traffic during school pick-up and drop-off time, there has been a surge in digital media being shared online in a virtual pissing content that competes for the fickle attention of friends, family, acquittances, and strangers alike. Our collective social media feeds are inundated with ""back to school pictures"" in front of family homes and cars, in front of schools and colleges, and fully displaying names, ages, grades, and school uniforms of children.Some schoolkids begrudgingly pose for the pictures while others mug for their parents' attention, knowing mum and dad will eagerly upload their digital replicas. The photos end up on Facebook, Instagram, and endless other places to try to ""get likes"" and out-do their connections in a race to see who gets the most attention. Social media is the online version of ""keeping up with the Joneses"" where we spend the time we don't have, doing things we don't need to impress people, we don't like.Authorities and privacy advocates alike plead with parents not to upload pictures of their children in school uniforms or provide any more information than they have to. We may think we're being a good digital citizen and watching our backs on the big, bad Internet while we throw the next generation to the wolves. Three decades in Information Technology and Cybersecurity have taught me that predators do not respect rules, laws, boundaries, and are incredibly skilled at aggregating information, manipulating minds, and exploiting the smallest weaknesses.Seriously, people. What the actual fuck are you thinking sometimes? Do you not have access to enough media about the dangers online and the risks children face every day just by existing? One of the basic principals in cyber is minimising your risk profile and attack surface, but the more you willingly expose to the Internet, the more massive that digital footprint you leave becomes. And the larger the digital shadow grows.The Internet has been around nearly 30 years, give or take, in its present form. We now have an entire generation (which is rapidly becoming two generations as millennials have children) that do not know the world without this electronic medium. We're immediately sceptical of anything we don't voluntarily do online, but embrace contradictory risky behaviour.The government wants me to give my name, email, and mobile number for contact tracing during the pandemic and try to keep us safe? Hell no!Upload pictures of minors in their school uniforms with names, grades, and other private information? Hell yes!Come on, shake your heads.Now that we have an entire generation growing up not knowing a world without the Internet, their introduction to cybersecurity and online safety is the same as when we learned not to touch the hot stove. We got burned. Once, if we were lucky, but we learned.Unfortunately, virtual scars don't go away and, if anything, can get worse instead of healing somewhat like physical ones can. There are untold volumes of past transgressions and embarrassments online still readily found from blunders made decades ago. That personal picture shared with a love interest they then shared with their friends? You bet it's still out there! Controversial posts on social media? Ditto. A lot of this gets dug up at the worst time, and the recent emergence of ""Cancel Culture"" is a perfect example.Today, no kid grows up without a camera (usually the back of a smartphone) in their face for every little thing they do. Even the smallest kid-ism is preserved for posterity and smeared all over social media, emailed to relatives, liked, shared, commented, turned into a meme, and sent to every corner of the Internet, known or otherwise.When I entered the workforce, new parents had to bring pictures of their offspring physically to my desk to show off. Now they flood our social media feeds with them and while you can ignore, unfollow, and block the fact remains, your kids' digital replicas are online and accessible to people without our same moral code.Your kids don't know any different in the beginning; they only know this is how they get your attention, so they play along to make you focus on them instead of your phone, but you're only focusing on them through your phone. You can't take that picture fast enough to edit it, crop it, filter it, post it, share it, and hashtag it so others can click on it, share it, like it, and comment on it. Their analogue life shared online is a way to get your digital dopamine hits, and when you get them, you keep posting.Eventually, kids grow up but still play along. They want you to take their picture and post it because they know that means they get more of your time. In time, they start to develop self-awareness and play along or, hopefully, begin to question what their digital image is used for. They get their very own social media accounts and, in time, may even repeat the cycle with their families.This outcome isn't always the case. Sometimes we grow up and figure out that there are other ways to exist than online, but Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) and different ways we become wired to exist virtually keeps us connected. Remember ""The Matrix""? Could that become a reality in the future? (well, at least the part of living in a purely fabricated, digital world) Remember that a lot of the technology once seen on Star Trek in the '60s eventually became current tech in some form.By the time the next generation reaches adulthood, there will be a digital shadow of a petabyte or more in size created through no action of their own. And because virtually none of that data-sharing was the kids' doing via direct digital footprints, we're the ones responsible, setting them up for a world of pain they can't possibly hope to control.But there is a way forward, and it starts with thinking before you click. Asking yourself, ""is there any possibility this picture could come back to haunt my child in the future? (yes, haunt THEM, not you). Ask if you need to share that detail and why. Are you posting that picture on Facebook for Nan & Pop to see? Or are you trying to mug for attention in front of your peers? ""My kid is better than your kid"" is nothing more than a game of one-upmanship you'll never win.Scroll through your social media feeds. Are there posts, pictures, and videos that share more than you should? Is there any information shared that could lead a predator to your door? It's good advice not to leave your bins out when you're away or leave boxes for expensive electronics or baby items at the curb for rubbish collection. What you post online can have the same effect.You know the details you post online that get used in targeting you with advertising? You type in ""Toyota"", and suddenly you're swamped with car ads; the information you freely share online can give a predator enough information to commence grooming and building a relationship with a minor.These points are not fearmongering as goodness knows there is enough already. Instead, I hope to make you stop and think for a moment and be mindful of your online presence - and the digital shadow you are creating for your children.Please go ahead and continue to use social media because it is, after all, to be ""social"". Just stop and think first before you post. And perhaps it's time to go back through older posts and remove any that could become a problem. Avoid the ready-fire-aim approach.Stay safe out there.Disclaimer: The thoughts and opinions presented on this blog are my own and not those of any associated third party.

The Actual Science Behind Some of Today's Biggest Wellness Trends,"Every year, it seems, something new comes along promising to decrease our pain and stress while improving mood and sleep. Almost as quickly as these magical fixes arrive on the scene, many of them disappear - either because they lose their novelty and notoriety, or because they are displaced by the next great hope.From copper bracelets to spinal braces, oxygen bars to cryo spas, soak tanks to you name it, there is no shortage of ""wellness products"" that enter with a splash and exit with a whimper, promising to make quick work of complicated problems. Whether they deliver the promised benefit oftentimes remains an open question.Products containing copper, specifically those which also provide compression, have become ubiquitous. They include copper socks, sleeves, and braces claiming to get you back in the game or even improve athletic performance.Worn just above the calves, compression socks are believed to improve blood vessel efficiency. In a February 2015 study on compression socks, marathon runners who wore them for 48 hours after an event performed better on treadmill tests two weeks later when compared to a placebo group. Another study in February 2019 of elite volleyball players suggests compression socks can ease the stressors of long-haul travel. While claims of improved athletic performance remain unverified, the likelier scenario remains: Compression clothing, specifically socks, may help in recovery, even weeks after endurance events.When it comes to compression back braces, however, claims of improved athletic performance as well as enhanced recovery remain unverified. Bracing of any kind is typically done to limit range of motion and provide stability after an injury. There's also a specified duration for using most braces, typically four to six weeks. Braces are not meant to be a permanent wearable. Prolonged restriction of the spine, specifically, may lead to core muscle weakness. Humans come with a natural lower back brace, sometimes called ""the corset of the core,"" in the transverse abdominis muscle. Strengthening the abdominals, as well as other core muscles, will lead to a stronger spine and less pain, which in turn could improve performance.Perhaps the most surprising finding within the medical literature is the role of copper and its effect on skin. Wound dressings that include copper particles or polymers were patented less than a decade ago. There's some indication that socks (and even pillowcases) made with fiber or thread containing copper oxide can have a healing or therapeutic effect on skin. Pillowcases are thus marketed to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, socks to increase skin elasticity and eliminate athlete's foot infections, and wound dressings to enhance healing time.A back brace will not improve your athletic ability and compression socks cannot help you run a marathon. Compression socks can, however, help in recovery - and the copper infused variety might minimize athlete's foot and skin infections.Since the early 2000s, from New York to Los Angeles, two varieties of health spas have emerged with increasing regularity. One, the cryo spa, features a vertical tube-type device that you step into which surrounds your body from the shoulders down and engulfs you in nitrogen gas at temperatures below 230 degrees Fahrenheit.The second type of spa offers variations on float therapy. Picture a large, domed bathtub for one person, where you float in water containing high amounts of epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) at body temperature, with sight and sound minimized or eliminated altogether.Both industries have put forth a variety of health claims as to the benefits of cryo or float therapy, including enhanced focus, stress reduction, improved healing, weight loss, or better sleep. The supporting research, however, remains somewhat limited and inconclusive.Here's what we do know.An ancient medical text known as the Edwin Smith Papyrus, dating back to 3500 B.C., made numerous references to the use of cold therapy. This understanding grew over time and led to icing parts of the body to numb them for medical procedures prior to the discovery of anesthetics. French army surgeon Baron de Larrey, during Napoleon's Russian campaign, packed the limbs of soldiers in ice prior to amputations to render the procedures more bearable. The idea behind cooling the entire body grew thanks to work by Japanese rheumatologist Toshima Yamaguchi in the 1970s, who treated patients with frozen instruments. Although today's full-body cryo spas have yet to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, this hasn't stopped athletes, celebrities, and many others from stepping inside them.Perhaps the most popular, best known, longest standing method for treating an injury is itself a form of cryotherapy - better known as an ice pack or ice bath. Among trainers and physical therapists, ice packs and baths are ubiquitous in locker rooms. The use of ice has been shown to decrease pain through a numbing effect on nerves, reducing blood flow (as well as white blood cells) into an area, thereby limiting swelling.As for whole body cryotherapy, a study of 120 patients with pain conditions ranging from fibromyalgia to rheumatoid arthritis reported a reduction in pain, lasting about 90 minutes, immediately after their therapy session; another study suggests the treatment may be an adjunct in alleviating anxiety and mood disorders. To fully explore the promise of other benefits, including injury recovery, anti-aging, or weight loss claims, more studies are necessary.The science behind float tanks is equally singular and small. Conceived in 1954 by American physician and neuroscientist John C. Lilly to study the origins of consciousness by cutting off all external stimuli, float tanks are touted by some as a form of ""hyper meditation"" to reduce stress and improve focus.The European Journal of Medicine sheds light on such claims in a review titled ""Curing the sick and creating supermen-how relaxation in flotation tanks is advertised on the internet."" They concluded that benefits of treatment are often exaggerated and not backed by specific science or corresponding studies.Before stepping inside a float tank, consider a study of 46 participants which found doing so ""temporarily inducing (of) psychosis-like experiences."" On the other hand, in a 2018 study, 50 participants who were anxious or depressed reportedly experienced a reduction in anxiety symptoms and a substantial improvement in mood.Theories behind float tanks, cryo spas, or copper compression clothing all come from areas and disciplines with some scientific validity. It's hard to argue against the pain-relieving, anti-inflammatory properties of an ice pack; anyone who's sprained an ankle or stubbed a toe can attest to its efficacy. It's slightly more difficult to expand these claims to whole-body, nitrogen-based, below-freezing therapy. While ice as therapy has been around since 3500 B.C., archeologists date the practice of meditation back even further, to 5,000 B.C. Float tanks are a way to induce the latter, or even supercharge the effect of meditation - present-time consciousness and connection between mind and body. Sure, copper is antimicrobial, but a brace made of copper fiber will not ""heal"" joints, improve performance, or speed recovery. Compression on the other hand, in some cases, will.Upon deeper study and until further notice, the tried and true way might just be the best way. A simple hot or cold pack can be surprisingly effective. Gymnasts, basketball, baseball, or football players immediately ice a suspected injury, and do the same after a long, grueling match. Prior to activity though, athletes hydrate and prepare for competition with a series of stretches or warm-ups to increase muscular blood flow. External heat (hot packs) can work much in the same way, preparing muscles for activity.The idea that if something works, more of it would work even better doesn't always hold up. Any treatment will usually have parameters for a therapeutic effect - an optimal zone, if you will - where less wouldn't help and more might be overkill.So, before you reach for whole body cryotherapy, try a targeted ice pack, ice bath, or cold shower. Consider meditation before signing up for a float tank session. Runners or endurance athletes might try wearing compression socks, and evaluating their effect on recovery. For those who suffer from athlete's foot, consider the copper infused variety. Whether it's floating, compression, or extreme temperatures, the smart bet is to experiment and find your ""Goldilocks Zone.""",https://miro.medium.com/max/17148/1*__k1SRJdfiAI3pw5f_ThMQ.jpeg,https://elemental.medium.com/the-actual-science-behind-some-of-todays-biggest-wellness-trends-3755b7a8b96d,science,8138c55eba65117d89593d5341852d0b5c819c5c1df520cc2e45f113
New Data Show Recent Graduates Who Received Pell Grants Left School with $6 Billion More in Debt than Their Peers,"By: Nancy WongThe Department of Education recently released new data for the College Scorecard, a critical consumer tool that provides vital college- and program-level data on college outcomes that are available for download. With this year's release, the Department refreshed the Scorecard's data, including college costs, student debt, graduation rates, and student body demographics, and they added the following new data elements:Of the new data elements, we spotlight median debt by Pell Grant status, which can shed light on college affordability for low-income students. Most students who graduate with debt are from low-income backgrounds - national data show that over 7 in 10 of graduates (73%) with any federal loans also received a Pell grant, and that Pell graduates have about $4,500 more in debt than other graduates.[1] However, data showing differences in debt loads between Pell and non-Pell graduates has not been available by college or program until this release. These data indicate that debt disparities for students who progressed through the same education and graduated with the same degree are very common, and quite sizeable.Pell Students Graduate with Higher Median Debt than Higher-Income PeersLooking at median debt from College Scorecard, Pell graduates also have higher debt burdens than non-Pell graduates across credentials and when compared within the same program.[2] In fact, among a combined cohort of graduates from the Classes of 2017 and 2018, the median Pell recipient graduating from a bachelor's degree program acquires $26,863 in student loans while their non-Pell counterparts borrow only $23,395 (15% more debt for Pell students than non-Pell).[3] In associate degree programs, non-Pell graduates had a median debt of $12,250 compared their Pell counterparts who had borrowed $16,370 (34% more). Non-Pell graduates who completed certificates also borrowed $9,833 in contrast to Pell graduates with $11,814 (20% more). Across these three credentials, the median Pell-to-non-Pell debt gap is $2,553.[4]Pell Students Graduate with Higher Debt in Three-Quarters of ProgramsWithin the program-level data, Pell graduates borrowed more than non-Pell graduates at 75 percent of programs.[5] Across credentials, Pell graduates had borrowed more than non-Pell graduates at 74 percent of bachelor's degree programs, 77 percent of associate degree programs, and 73 percent of undergraduate certificate programs. In many of the programs, the gap is quite large: About 28 percent of bachelor's degree programs and 29 percent of associate degree programs reported Pell graduates borrowing more than $5,000 than their non-Pell peers. In about a quarter of programs, Pell graduates fare better than non-Pell graduates when it comes to debt loads, though the gaps are generally much smaller. Overall, only 3 percent of programs saw the debt loads of Pell graduates to be at least $5,000 less than non-Pell peers.Billions Needed to Close Pell Debt Gap in Every ProgramThese Pell gaps mean that students from low-income families must repay more debt than their non-Pell peers, and the amounts add up in a startling way. After adding up the debt gap across programs where Pell students owe more than non-Pell students, the total Pell debt gap amounts to approximately $5.96 billion in extra loans across all three credentials, as shown in the visualization below.Importantly, these data may understate the true debt burden of Pell students. This is because Scorecard data exclude non-federal loans that play a crucial part in cumulative student debt of graduates. For instance, the latest Scorecard data suggest that the median debt of Catholic University graduates is between $15,500 to $27,000, depending on the program. However, Catholic University reported that indebted graduates leave school with about $46,700 in average debt once private, nonfederal loans are added in.[6] These same self-reported data show that 45 percent of their graduates' debt consists of loans from banks, schools, or their state, not included in the much lower Scorecard figures.Policymakers Should Double Down on Pell GrantsThe federal Pell Grant program is the nation's most effective investment in college affordability, but its purchasing power relative to college costs is at an all-time low. At its peak, the maximum Pell Grant covered 75 percent of the cost of tuition, room, and board for students attending public four-year colleges, a share that has fallen to just 28 percent today. Doubling the Pell Grant is critical to eliminating disproportionate debt burdens for low-income students, as well closing disparities in enrollment and completion by income. For more on why now is the time to double the Pell Grant, see our recent joint publication with UNCF.Nancy Wong is a senior research associate for The Institute for College Access & SuccessOriginally published at https://ticas.org on December 21, 2020.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2666/1*uQHc4d2rf2d5rTbl0YkXkg.jpeg,https://ticas-org.medium.com/new-data-show-recent-graduates-who-received-pell-grants-left-school-with-6-billion-more-in-debt-660022973b55,education,8172abdeadd3018e4d1d5ecf5f970f902b8d3b2df35026a2606b0d00
20 Rules That Will Help You Become A More Effective Boss,"Leadership Isn't Easy. That's Why So Many Bosses Suck.The Toxic Boss.Everyone's Buddy.The Screamer.The Narcissist.The Egoist.The Inexperienced.There are many reasons leaders fail.As many readers are aware - through direct experience - ineffective (or worse - toxic) bosses have a profound impact on the well-being of everyone in the workplace.A failing boss makes the lives of every team member miserable.They undercut morale.They reduce productivity.They incur unbearable costs on organizations due to high turnover and reduced productivity.Yet ineffective bosses are obscenely common.In many cases this is because the wrong people are placed in these positions.Frequently (and the ones who inflict the most organizational and human damage) are people lacking empathy and self-awareness.These are the toxics - people who have generally managed up, impressing their bosses on the backs of their people. They don't care about their people and never will as long as they achieve their own selfish goals.Sadly, they will achieve results for a period of time - results driven by fear. But these results are not sustainable and come with costs that no company wants to bear (high turnover, unhappy workforce).What about the non-toxics?There is an even large population of ineffective leaders who are generally good people, who have performed well in positions of lesser responsibility, but are promoted to quickly and simply lack the experience and knowledge to lead effectively.You may have heard of the ""Peter Principle"" - where people perform well and are promoted beyond their level of competence. While I do not doubt that this does happen, I believe that more often than not it's less an issue of competence then it is a lack of experience OR a genuine lack of interest in being in a leadership position (perfectly normal and acceptable - being a boss is not for everyone). Most people who want to be in leadership roles can be good bosses provided they are self-aware and work hard at the job.I am living proof of that. I have led people in multiple high stress organizations during my career. I will be the first to admit, I was far from an excellent boss - but I was always a good boss.Tough Job. Easy Fail.Being a boss (i.e. a leader) is difficult work. A good boss will go home exhausted every day. It is NOT easy.Good = defined by being both effective at meeting organizational goals and doing so while maintaining a workforce with generally high morale.1. If you don't want to be a boss - if you were truly happy doing what you were doing previously, speak up!As a former boss myself, I hold people who speak up in high regard. It is better for the organization and better for the person. And it is totally ok to not want to be in that role.2. Ask for training.Yes, this may be a little pollyannish - it is an almost universal fact (and organizational failure) to assign so many unprepared people to leadership roles without even acknowledging that training is as important, if not as essential as experience. You get training for the most menial roles, but not for the most significant. It's as if you are supposed to know - from day one - how to keep a diverse workforce upbeat and productive.I spent 25 years in the military - and in my service, despite the fact that effective leadership was embedded in the culture, I received only 5 days of concentrated leadership training. It was not surprising that I encountered so many ineffective and failed leaders during my time in the service.3. Actively demonstrate mutual respect with every member of your team.Show team members that you value and respect them as human beings and as contributing members of the team. I cannot overstate the importance of taking the time to do this. Again and again.4. Get to know as many of your team members as possible.Yes in some organizations and leadership positions this is impossible. But in most it is an entirely achievable goal.At one point I led a unit of 100 people. I knew each person's first name, a little bit about each one's interests and family. This is vitally important. It may take a little time for you to learn a bit about everyone, but it is time well spent.Moreover during the learning phase you will have to approach every team member and ask questions. People want to know you are interested in them beyond what they can do for you.5. Ask questions and listen. Enough said.6. Observe for the first 30 days (or 45) before making large changes to the organization.7. Be optimistic and upbeat.You may have just had a fight with your spouse, or be in a bad mood for whatever reason. Don't show it. It's exhausting sometimes - but your mood will effective the entire organization.An unhappy boss is a scary boss. A scary boss shuts people down.8. Don't be a friend.9. Hold people accountable.10. Hold yourself accountable.11. Practice self-awareness and self-assessment.12. Fight for your people.Do all that you can to provide them with resources and support they need to do their jobs effectively - this is a component of Servant Leadership.13. Don't ever exhibit irritation or a thin skin.You will be criticized. Get used to it.14. Employ empathy intelligently.First make sure you know what empathy means. Really. Then use it to put yourself in the shoes of your team members. You need to understand what it is like to be one of the team members before you can effectively lead them towards a goal.15. Be observant.Recognize when a member of the team is struggling and engage that person.16. Set an example.If the boss doesn't spend 15 hours a day in the office, team members will not feel that they have to do the same.If the boss works out at lunch, members of the team will feel comfortable taking a real break too.What the boss does and says matters. A lot. If you spend most of your waking life in the office, demonstate not a lick of work-life balance - guess what? Exactly - your entire team will assume that is what you expect of them.17. Give the team or members (where due) public praise and credit for organizational or personal accomplishments.18. When necessary provide critical (but useful) feedback to team members in PRIVATE.Never publicly criticize - which is different than a team meeting where you are providing general, but useful criticism to the ENTIRE team for a poor outcome. Even here you must own the failure though - and acknowledge your own role in the outcome.19. Never, ever, play favorites.20. Above all be fair.See number 10. Everyone should be treated the same way. People will not respect a leader who is perceived as unfair. There is no faster way to undermine your role and effectiveness.Whew! Why Would Anyone Want to Be a Boss?Don't take being a boss lightly, think about your every action and the potential consquences and impact.If all else fails, remember the leaders who motivated you in the past and emulate them.You have it in you. Go lead!",https://miro.medium.com/max/10944/1*QbPNDPlN-n6EBAoxe7DK3w.jpeg,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/20-rules-that-will-help-you-become-a-more-effective-boss-8cb6812d926c,leadership,8281dcfd60db03342111196bedb88861986f12d4849611da0eee49c6
Why Your Relentless Pursuit is So Attractive to Others,"You're driving hard towards your goal. You're throwing your energy, your effort and your focus at your leadership role and trying to deliver the impact and outcomes that you seek.But the results seem elusive. Achieving the goal is uncertain.Doubt may be creeping in.Others aren't helpful, trying to tell you to relax or scale back your expectations.Are you taking the right path to achieve your goal?Should you quit and redirect your effort? What would that signal to others?And what if you're chasing the wrong thing? What if you're being unrealistic? What if...gulp...you're wasting your time?We need to draw a distinction between your over-arching purpose and your career goals compared to the individual strategies you may employ to achieve short-term goals.Sure, you'll have individual goals in the short term. Today. This week. This year. These help you prioritize and allocate your time. But don't lose sight of your long-term goal and the perspective of achieving God's plan for your life. Your purpose. Why you're on this earth.Michael Jordan was driven to be the best player in the game and to win. Period. He wanted to win everything he tried: basketball, baseball, golf, poker...whatever. Games, practice, cards on the plane after the game. Win.He famously said, ""I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.""Shots will get missed. He's human. Games will be lost. He's playing against the best players in the world.But his commitment to win championships (and to do whatever was necessary to take him and his teammates there) drove his activities, his schedule, and his priorities.Similarly, Thomas Edison, who invented the incandescent light bulb, the movie camera, the phonograph, among other things, was asked about all his failures and missteps along the way.He replied, ""I have not failed 10,000 times - I've successfully found 10,000 ways that will not work.""He provided perspective in addressing why he had ultimately been successful in these endeavors when others had not. He said, ""Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.""Jordan and Edison both exhibited a relentless pursuit of long-term goals. This allowed them to use their setbacks and missteps along the way, to learn and to motivate them to try one more time. Again. And again. And again.I've identified four people who are not just examples of relentless pursuits, but honestly, these are my personal sources of inspiration to grind. Relentlessly. Every day.Gary Vaynerchuk has built a $100MM media empire and a strong personal brand with equal doses of intentionality and hard work. From humble beginnings (working in his family's wine retail store), he embraced email marketing and created thousands of hours of YouTube content before it was cool, and established a strong following. Insanely strong. Since then, he has built VaynerMedia into a full-service digital agency with more than 700 employees serving Fortune 100 clients.GaryVee has written six books and built a social media presence that reinforces the major elements of his brand: high self-awareness, taking responsibility for his actions and his results, and bringing value to others every day and in every interaction.He maintains a relentless focus on branding and continuing to stay on the leading edge of digital marketing media. He's transparent about all parts of his business life, but draws the line at his family. He wants to protect his children and wife from his own maniacal commitment to business transparency.GaryVee's passion for branding and digital marketing doesn't just ooze out of him, it leaps out of him with energy and intensity. Too many influencers on social media have created personas, and they're too airbrushed and perfect in their current state. I believe they manufacture backstories about all they had to overcome to reach this current state of Zen master perfection. That transformation story seems to justify the thousands of dollars they want to suck out of your bank account.I never get that impression with GaryVee. I get the sense that he hasn't changed a lot since he was twelve. He hustles. He gives his opinion. He learns. He admits his shortcomings and his mistakes - not just in his past, but maybe last week or even an hour ago.#1 Disclaimer: He's not human. He works eighteen-hour days. He personally engages on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok and who knows what other social media platforms. He has a daily vlog, where David Rock (known as D-Rock), records his conversations, meetings, strategy sessions, speeches, Uber rides and rants. I'm not asking you to copy his schedule; just listen to his advice on branding and marketing.#2 Disclaimer: His language is full of f-bombs and pretty colorful language. Get past it. His content is valuable. Other personalities have gone gutter-mouth and they look and sound ridiculous. Once again, I think he's been like this all his life. It seems natural on him.Corporations like Nike hire him to get his insights in reaching the next generation of consumers. At the same time, the next generation - kids in their teens and twenties - seek his advice on personal branding, marketing and his opinion on the next big social media platform.He's focused on his own brand and helping others build theirs. He wants to stay on the leading edge - or even bleeding edge - in the digital marketing space. Driven by a passion to learn himself and to educate others. With daily focus. And relentless effort.Pat Flynn turned the creation of a LEED certification study guide that he developed as an architect into a journey to help others create online income streams. He started to share the lessons he learned, creating a viable revenue stream from his LEED study guide, through a YouTube channel. He then launched a podcast called Smart Passive Income.As his weekly Smart Passive Income established itself as a leading business podcast for entrepreneurs, and SPI TV gained traction on YouTube, Pat launched a daily podcast called AskPat. This offered his audience the opportunity to get answers to their questions. His website began to regularly post ebook guides and tutorials.Over time, people began to refer to Pat as The Crash Test Dummy of Online Business. He would try things and risk the mistakes and embarrassment of failure, so that you and I could learn from him. He also had his share of successes and because you were emotionally invested, you celebrated with him. And you learned even more.During the period of time that I've been following Pat, he's branched out from his podcast, blog, and YouTube channel to include: email marketing, launching a new product, raising money via crowdfunding, selling products through FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon), creating online courses, launching webinars, writing books and walking us through their launches...whew...and likely other efforts that I missed.Pat's insights aren't limited to his business ventures. He also discusses the challenges of balancing his entrepreneurial life with continuing to challenge himself as the crash test dummy; as well as trying to be the best father and husband that he can be.Contrary to GaryVee, Pat Flynn invites his wife April, and his kids, Keoni and Kailani, to participate with him. Given the strong personal connections with his listeners / followers / FlynnFans, it isn't surprising that April is the most requested guest on SPI. Involving his kids in his podcast, his book launches, etc., gives him perspective and keeps him grounded. He remains conscious of being a role model for keeping success in perspective, how he spends his time, and what is most important in life.GaryVee's personality is larger than life. Pat Flynn is the guy next door.But Pat is equally passionate in his approach to his brand and his audience. He is willing to risk getting a few bruises and some embarrassment so that he can teach you how it is done. To make it safe.His formula?He has a relentless focus on impacting others who need a nudge or a road map - or maybe just the lessons learned from a crash test dummy.Kathleen Cannon is a force of nature. As the CEO of United Way of Broward County, she is part social worker, part strategist, and part evangelist. She encourages. She challenges. She leads. All her effort is directed at impact - helping individuals, involving organizations, improving communities...er, community. Her community.Kathleen started her career as a licensed clinical social worker. Her experience includes working with populations involving: chronic mental illness, people struggling with substance abuse, runaway teens, adults and children with physical disabilities, and people living with HIV/AIDS.Since becoming CEO of United Way of Broward County in 2012, she has taken on a variety of new causes - veterans re-acclimating to civilian life, the opioid crisis, local homelessness, early childhood literacy, among others.In 2013 Kathleen, and six local leaders, who were United Way volunteers, launched Mission United. Mission United aided local veterans, and their families, as they came off active duty and tried to re-acclimate to civilian life. Mission United has provided pro bono legal assistance to more than 5,000 veterans and housing support to more than 2,500 veterans. Job counseling, interviewing coaching and other services are provided. This program was so successful that local United Ways in 24 other cities have adopted the program, and United Way Worldwide has adopted it for its national platform.When you consider the scope of the challenges that United Way of Broward County has pursued - veterans, opioids, homelessness, food insecurity, elementary school reading skills, they're intimidating. Maybe overwhelming.But that's where Kathleen steps in. She treats this community like her family. And she is a fierce, protective mother when it comes to her family.She approaches her role with energy. With a sense of urgency. With a servant's heart that is both endearing and galvanizing.When COVID began to impact the community in March of 2020, Kathleen mobilized her organization and the community to raise $2.2 million for emergency financial relief and food. In the first 90 days.She has the energy of a five-year-old: attending events, meeting with donors and civic leaders, convening community conversations on sensitive topics, ensuring continued progress on organization initiatives, supporting the fifty-seven programs and agencies in the county (funded by United Way).The schedule alone would be exhausting, but she approaches each interaction with the same optimistic, indefatigable attitude.Have there been mistakes along the way? Sure. Programs that didn't go according to plan? Yep. Embarrassing moments that you'd like to rewind? Lots of them. But she never loses focus on the bigger picture. The needs. The opportunities. The vision for the future.Most people avoid problems, and some run away from them.Not Kathleen. She leans in.But she doesn't create activity for activity's sake. Agencies funded by United Way of Broward County have to be able to document positive outcomes. It's not about pushing money around, so people feel good. It is about creating outcomes that help address the problem.It is a relentless commitment to communicate hope and create change. To achieve outcomes. To move the needle. Consistently. Every day.Brett Hagler is the role model for so many elements of great leadership that you might think he must be a ""been-there, done-that"" geriatric. Not hardly.Only 30-years old, Brett is the CEO of New Story, a charity which crowdfunds homes in areas ravaged by natural disasters and neglect. The organization's goal is to pioneer housing solutions for the one billion people around the globe who live without adequate shelter.OK, that's a big number. One billion? Before you roll your eyes and think he's crazy, let me tell you, I'm betting on Brett and his team at New Story.Coming out of college Brett was trying to reconcile a strong entrepreneurial drive, and a desire to do something significant to help mankind. Like a lot of people, I thought Brett had to pick one or the other. Those career paths seemed mutually exclusive.Brett had a failed attempt at an entrepreneurial venture, but was bit by the bug. He had also visited Haiti on a mission trip and saw widespread homelessness - five years after the devastating earthquake and was appalled at the living conditions. He felt moved to help. To do something.What began as a brainstormed idea in an Atlanta apartment gave rise to New Story. Initially focused on crowdfunding the funds to build one home in Haiti, the response was significant and the vision grew rapidly.Brett and his partners, Alexandria Lafci and Matthew Marshall, created a formula that allowed them to partner with in-country agencies to build cement block homes. Each home would cost $6000 and would include electricity and running water.Soon they weren't just building homes, but entire communities. Over the last five years, New Story has built 25 communities, comprised of more than 2,300 homes in Haiti, El Salvador, Bolivia and Mexico.But they were just warming up. Conventional construction methods are costly and time-consuming. New Story partnered with Ikon to build homes with a 3-D printer. The costs were reduced to $4,000 per home, and the home could be built / printed in a day. They plan to give the technology away to help governments and commercial businesses create affordable housing in their own markets.Brett and his partners launched New Story when they didn't know what they didn't know. Friends were encouraging but not necessarily helpful. The team made mistakes. They went against conventional wisdom. They made things up as they went along.But they persevered. Commitment to one another and to the overall vision got tested and strengthened. Momentum grew and it became powerful.New Story employees, donors, advisors become tied to the families they help and the communities they build. We're all in this together.The organization has created Founder's Lab, a program designed to coach founders of nonprofit startups on planning, capital, marketing - and creating impact. An incredible group of successful non-profit and for-profit founders, from organizations like Kiva, charity:water and Glassdoor partner with the New Story founders to serve as program leaders and mentors.The New Story team is committed to reaching more people more economically and in faster time. They are racing against a clock that says the worldwide population without safe and adequate shelter is projected to grow to 3 billion by 2050.Not if Brett and the New Story team have something to say about it.They are building awareness. Building homes. With a relentless focus on the message, with an equally relentless focus on continuous innovation.They're making it easy for people to participate and partner to impact the world. To address what seems like an impossible problem. And they're bringing us together - and helping us lift one another in the process.It's hard to decide when to go all in, and when to cut your losses.Not every initiative will have a positive outcome, and not every strategy will be successful.Critics are all too eager to tell you to give up, or that you should do it a different way.They may help you evaluate your short-term strategies or your next action step.But don't let them derail your long-term goal. When you've identified a purpose for your life. Your motivation to get out of bed and hustle. Today and every day.The profiles of GaryVee, Pat Flynn, Kathleen Cannon and Brett Hagler suggest very different personalities, backgrounds and missions in life.But there are a couple of profound similarities:Each of them has a significant driver, which motivates them to take relentless action, based on impacting other people. Anything they get out of it personally is a byproduct of helping others.Their dedicated commitment and sense of urgency to impact other people draws others to their cause and their vision for the future. It creates excitement. It creates momentum. It creates results.Determine how you want to impact others. It doesn't need to be shelter for a billion people. It can be a segment of the population, it can be a team, or it can be an individual.Identify your vision. Then get to work. Pursue it with passion. Relentlessly.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10874/1*B3CA7HdFkWxiIrCxpQQeQw.jpeg,https://karlwsprague.medium.com/why-your-relentless-pursuit-is-so-attractive-to-others-e4ca8287c596,leadership,8588e422850e4a98346dff636724aba8a20b1587c81fcee882805a7a
Mindfulness on the Go,"Now that so many magazines and books promote the benefits of mindfulness, it is no wonder that the number of people who practice meditation has increased. But, as someone who has had an off and on meditation practice for more than thirty years, it is also no surprise to me that some studies show up to a third of people that have meditated discontinue their practice. Some people simply find it hard to sit still. Sometimes (especially after a trauma), meditation can be anxiety provoking. Sometimes people simply don't feel like they have the time.While I have personally found a sit-down meditation practice has benefited my well-being, it's not the only (or even the best way) to learn to become more mindful. Mindfulness practices can be active, ""out in the world,"" and don't need to take that long - which brings me to my first on-the-go mindfulness practice:I learned about this technique through my therapist. I had been through a traumatic event and suddenly found it difficult to be in ""my own head"" in a positive and engaged manner. I had temporarily lost my ability to meditate comfortably. This technique of ""mindfulness snapshots"" provides many of the benefits of meditation as a standalone technique, and can also be used as a gateway to a traditional meditation practice. Here's how it works:While doing something where you can go on ""autopilot,"" allow your brain to wander as it normally does. Then, for a period of a few seconds to no more than thirty seconds, focus on all the sensations of the moment. For example, if you are washing dishes, you might notice the warm, soapy water on your hands; the weight of the dishes as you pick them up; the sounds of the water swishing; your breath; the floor under your feet; the light from a window; and the patterns on the dishes. In short, just be engaged with your five senses as you do the activity. After you are done the mindfulness snapshot, let your attention wander again. You can do this a few too many times a day according to your preference and you can also use this to build up to being mindful for longer periods. Which brings me to the second practice:Many of our daily activities of choice or necessity are simple, repetitive, or can be done on ""autopilot."" Some examples of these activities are walking or running, household chores, knitting, colouring, and grooming a pet. These activities have two major benefits to mental well-being that may seem at odds with each other;To do this mindfulness activity, first pick something you can do on autopilot. While applying mindfulness can help you learn to enjoy a repetitive activity that you have previously found tedious, it is probably easier to learn this technique doing something you find pleasant. Then, simply do the activity while noticing the sensations in your body and your mind. Simply notice without judgement. If your mind wanders, gently bring yourself back into awareness. You can do this as long as you like and daydream afterwards as you wish - just make an active choice as to which you are doing.I found out about this mindfulness practice in the classic book ""The Artist's Way"" by Julia Cameron. The book's twelve week program includes a practice called daily letters. It recommends that you do this practice first thing in the morning, although I can picture it also being beneficial as a warm-up activity for creative work or as a tool for anytime you need to get the ""junk"" out of the mind. What you do is to write in a stream of consciousness style for three pages (or longer if needed). Just write whatever is on your mind. Don't worry if it makes sense or if it switches topics. Don't stop to correct things - spelling and punctuation don't matter for this exercise. Just write what's on your mind. When you're done, don't read it. You can choose to destroy it or keep it to read it in the future; just don't read it anytime soon.Julia Cameron describes the activity as being a valuable meditation that allows the ""Inner Critic"" (the disapproving part of our unconscious) to have its' say so that it can move out of our way and allow us to complete our day with less anxiety and more freedom. It is also useful as a way to simply observe your thoughts. The reason you don't pause to correct or read it afterwards is that it is an exercise in giving your unconscious a voice in the moment rather than trying to consciously reflect. I have used this practice off and on over the years and find it really helps loosen up my creativity and reduces ""junk thoughts"" invading my work.I have kept up a daily drawing practice ever since I read ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" two years ago. When we draw something we see; whether it is a person or an object in front of us, a photograph, or someone else's work of art; we are engaging in a type of mindful observation. The book's author, Betty Edwards, espouses a ""right brained"" approach that relies on observing shapes, angles, negative spaces and light and shadow in a purely visual way rather than using verbal or analytical rules about perspective or proportions. I recommend you read the book itself if you can, but here are some rules and ideas to get you started:I have found drawing to be a really useful mindfulness practice because it is actively observant rather than passively so. I can stay mindfully engaged for a longer time in this active state than I can while meditating. The benefit goes full circle in that I have found that I have been able to learn to meditate longer since finding this flow state while drawing. I find that the active observation gives me later insights about the things I have drawn even though I am not thinking about them at the time. The completed drawing gives me a tangible record of the relation between myself and the drawing subject in a given time.I see mindful conversation or listening as being both a way to build good rapport between yourself and others and a way to learn to really see and hear another person instead of your own thoughts and ideas about them. I am still very much in the process of learning to be more mindful in conversation, and certainly don't manage to maintain this state when there are strong negative emotions involved. But practice makes perfect.To start, actively decide you are there to listen. Put away the phone. Be somewhere that isn't too distracting. Try to hear what the other person is saying without rehearsing what you are going to say next. I have been listening to Dr. Drew Pinsky (addictions expert) talk about the concept of ""whole body listening"" and try to do this. The idea is to connect to not just the person's words but the emotions and sensations they are conveying non-verbally and share their experience. When you speak back in the conversation, try to speak from what you are actually feeling or experiencing rather than saying what you think makes the right impression or impact.Mindful conversation helps you relate to others and yourself in a more honest way. You experience the person and your relationship to them as they are in the moment instead of as a collection of thoughts and feelings you have already formed regarding them.Some people just aren't comfortable or interested in meditating. Active mindfulness practices like those I described can offer a way to benefit from mindfulness without having to meditate. While this is useful, I think these activities go beyond being meditation alternatives or ""beginner"" mindfulness techniques. They have their own, unique benefits that can be complementary to traditional mindfulness practices.Active mindfulness:Whether or not you like to meditate, I hope some of these mindfulness practices may be useful to you. I have personally found my life has been enriched by practicing mindfulness outside of sit down meditation practice.Happy living to you.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*-D0ANjSC6pixiihp,https://medium.com/free-thinkr/mindfulness-on-the-go-e3ef3a4d9dc7,mindfulness,8734cd91ebe3261b0b780b9f23d544beaab8ae8e81d5a56bed76b054
How 3 College-Aged Founders Built a Demo in 2 Hours That Led to a 13k+ Waitlist and $2.6m,"OthersideAI was launched in the latter half of 2020 by three college-aged founders - Matt Shumer, Miles Feldstein, and Jason Kuperberg.The company's origin story is incredible.It's pretty much a text-book idealistic 'launch' framework for founders who want to build a venture-scale business.Here's a basic overview of key events.In July 2020 the team spent a couple of hours making a product demo and posted it to Twitter.Without many followers, they didn't expect much to come of it.Instead, it went viral, receiving around 1,000,000 views and reactions from prominent figures in the venture capital and technology communities.This triggered coverage in high-profile media outlets such as the New York Times and Fortune.In the meantime, thousands of prospective customers put their names down for OthersideAI's waitlist.With this momentum they raised a $2.6m seed round from prestigious investors. This all happened within a few months.Now, they're in a levelled-up position with a well-capitalised balance sheet, high public anticipation, and enthusiastic alpha testers.But, like all things, highlights don't reveal the whole story.What were the underlying factors, steps, and frameworks that made this chain of events possible?How can other founders replicate this process? Similarly, or even a diluted version.I took a look. Here's what I found out.How they put it:To be clear - their software doesn't make decisions or formulate opinions for you.As the user, you input bullet points of the key information you want to convey and the AI transforms this into a fully-fleshed out email.Input 👇Output 👇I know - wow!They're building the product so the AI mimics the writer's natural language style. This way everybody won't sound like an automated robot.The net result is a '10X' faster emailing experience, which frees up a ton of time to do other things like hanging out with your dog - or quite likely - sending even more emails.This was not one of those product demo scenarios where hype was artificially manufactured by domain-expertise influencers or marketing experts. The founders didn't really have that kind of a platform.Both the user experience and product proposition is intrinsically very cool and valuable. Make no mistake, this is a major contributing factor in their journey so far.Their demo 'sold itself' and was fundamentally shareable, so it spread organically.Why? It looked like you were viewing the future today.Let's break that down.The three founders met at the Blackstone LaunchPad & Techstars at Syracuse University.The idea for OthersideAI came from an experience CEO Matt Shumer had at his previous startup Visos.Back then, without a network to tap into, Matt Shumer had to cold email practically anyone he wanted to connect with or pitch.So, he spent several weeks experimenting with GPT-2 in an effort to optimize his outreach strategy.What is GPT-2?Open-source artificial intelligence by OpenAI. Developers wield the AI to perform certain specific tasks. In this case, writing emails.But, it's what came next that really ignited OthersideAI.Around this time OpenAI announced and released GPT-3, the successor to GPT-2.It was so more advanced than GPT-2 it may as well have been called GPT-10.What you could do with it was mind-blowing and caused a social media frenzy in technology and venture capital communities.An enthusiastic fanbase built and showed off GPT-3 demos, many of which became viral sensations for a few weeks in the summer of 2020.But, not everyone could get their hands on GPT-3. OpenAI had an approval process and a long waiting list.Not wanting to waste anytime, the OthersideAI team cold emailed the CTO of OpenAI, Greg Brockman, in an attempt to fast-track the process.It worked!How? They told Greg Brockman what they wanted to do and it gave him the confidence to approve their access to GPT-3.After that, no time was wasted.Two hours? Wow.Matt Shumer said they were able to move that fast because of their prior experience experimenting with GPT-2.Fair enough. But still...Next, they posted their demo on Twitter. Here's the tweet:And, here's another tweet from Matt Shumer a few days later that got even more likes:These tweets 'went viral' and generated hundreds of thousands of views. Eventually over 1 million.They got the attention of people like former Shark Tank investor Chris Sacca, who retweeted and amplified the startup even more.This led to coverage in major publications like the New York Times.Sometimes journalists will just pick up on a story and write about it, other times you will have to reach out to them and bring it to their attention.I definitely prefer the latter approach since waiting around for something that may never happen is frustrating.With hindsight it's clear the huge buzz around GPT-3 increased the likelihood interest in this demo would 'catch on' and spread like wildfire.Building a product with the latest sexy technology 'everyone is talking about' is a fantastic way to generate organic attention. When it's combined with a truly valuable and futuristic proposition, the technology community can go wild.But, how can a founder without much of a follower base catalyse a product demo tweet to go viral?From personal experience, you generally need an influencer account with a ton of followers to engage with your tweet. This initiates momentum that snowballs into 'escape velocity' virality.But, unless you are already well-connected or an influencer it's hard to get their attention by simply tweeting alone.I put this question to CEO Matt Shumer:So, it seems like a mixture of an awesome demo and serendipity.There are steps you can take to engineer a catalysing event for virality. I've done this personally, you can read up about it here.But, you can't make 'anything' go viral of course. The appeal of the content must be capable of 'going viral'. This is the number one priority.Once you have this in place, you can directly engage accounts with a huge amount of followers and bring their attention to your content.This can be through a mention, direct message, or even a well-written cold email.Persistence is key. Keep at it.Also, so is approaching relevant people.For example, OpenAI CTO Greg Brockman was spot on for OthersideAI.His followers are exactly the type of people that would take an interest in the OthersideAI demo.A month later their waitlist hit 4,000 sign ups.As you can see, cofounder Miles Feldstein publicly confirmed they didn't utilize prior connections or spend any money on advertising in order to build that incredible waitlist.But, that was months ago now.Ever since they've continued to share their progress on Twitter, as well as taking interviews on podcasts and things.At the time of writing their waitlist is around 13,000!Well, a mixture of momentum and connections.Hustle Fund put the first check into OthersideAI - after an introduction from a mutual connection.One of the founders, Jason Kuperberg, was fortuitously connected with investor Gaby Goldberg. 👇Gaby made an intro to their second investor, Jeff Morris Jr., who later made introductions to other VCs and angels.And, Active Capital reached out to the OthersideAI team cold to invest. 👇Although they had a valuable connection with Gaby Goldberg, I certainly do not get the impression this was crucial to closing a financing round in the absolute.It was more of a case of optimizing the process of finding the most ideal investors the fastest way possible.CEO Matt Shumer says the best way to secure investment is to tell a story.At Matt's previous startup he used to make pitch decks with 50+ slides and found that walking investors through it was boring.With OthersideAI the team opted for more of a conversational approach and instead made the dialogue fluid, two-sided, and engaging for investors.What's the end goal for the team?Here's a quick recap on how to replicate OthersideAI's framework:Me too! You can receive more content about the ""hustle"" of entrepreneurship and building startups here.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3600/0*L54BccxBANm_z42Z.jpeg,https://medium.com/founders-hustle/how-3-college-aged-founders-built-a-demo-in-2-hours-that-led-to-a-13k-waitlist-and-2-6m-a58c9a872c11,startups,8736ea9d2a796dc84cdb48b0d58ba4243d69be5fc3abd140d20d04cc
Is Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity still worth playing?,"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity had some awfully big shoes to fill. Coming (quite belatedly) on the heels of Nintendo's uber-mega-smash-hit, the game had to both illuminate some of the backstory that didn't appear in Breath of the Wild and be a decent game in its own right; not an easy task. Did it succeed, though? Well...you're going to have to read the article to find out.As a side note, I'm changing up the format of my Still Worth Playing articles. Instead of covering everything about a game, which leads to me spending a lot of time and space on things I don't really have a lot to say about (like, say, graphics), I'm instead going to highlight the five most important points that informed my judgement. Without further ado, then, let's get into the first one:Okay, I know what I said five seconds ago, but I really think graphics are relevant here. Nintendo has a long (and checkered, as the recent Morshu meme explosion on YouTube reminds us) history with farming out its IPs to third parties. But never before have they essentially sent the entirety of a game's assets over to another company.That changed with Age of Calamity. Almost everything that could be copy-and-pasted has been, and while some might call that lazy, I actually really appreciated it. Since most of the characters had their exact same models, except Impa (who is, of course, 100 years younger) and a couple of other new additions, they were instantly recognizable and gave me a lot of nostalgia for the first game, if one can really be nostalgic for a game experienced four years before. Also, this meant that Breath of the Wild's clear, minimalist visuals were, of course, well-preserved. As they say, if it ain't broke...The music, on the other hand, does show some welcome innovation. Most of Breath of the Wild's music isn't suited to combat with masses of enemies, so while some songs have been carried over verbatim, like the Hinox and Talus themes, many others are brand new. They don't feel that way, though; everything fits perfectly within the original BotW template, even the more unusual tracks - like the Divine Beast music, which happens to be some of my favorite in the game.One of the big disappointments of the mainline Legend of Zelda games has always been that you don't get to play as anyone other than Link. Sure, Link is cool and all, but he can feel a little bland, especially compared to the colorful personalities that inevitably find their way into any Legend of Zelda title. Age of Calamity completely does away with this limitation. There are eighteen playable characters, and while it was pretty obvious that some of them would make it in - the Champions were a given, for instance - there are others that come completely out of nowhere.But that's not a bad thing! Gaping at the screen in astonishment that x character is actually playable is usually followed by doing their training mission and marveling at just how complete and fleshed-out their moveset is. The Warriors games have never had some Tekken level of complexity - most combos use two buttons, with ZR thrown into the mix if you want to get flashy - but even within those narrow bounds, different characters feel completely different. Some are giant, some are tiny; some are fast, some are slow; the list goes on, and honestly I think just trying out the different characters, watching their animations and using all of their special moves, is one of the highlights of the entire experience.Coming from the first Hyrule Warriors game, which I played on the Wii U along with all five other Wii U owners, I can definitely say that things improved dramatically in the grinding department with Age of Calamity. You don't actually need to grind at all to finish the game - the XP you get from story missions and whatever sidequests you do choose to do is more than enough to meet the recommended level for all the missions, as long as you focus on fewer than three or four characters, which I did. There are even some nice anti-grind features, like being able to pay to level up characters to the level of your most experienced character, which is really nice.Unfortunately, this doesn't extend to every aspect of the game. I got a quest early on that required me to get ten ice lizalfos tails. Well, once I beat the story - completed the game, except for some side content that I'm still working on - I still didn't have ten ice lizalfos tails. I had seven, three of which I'd gotten by grinding. It would probably take an hour or two just to get those other two tails, which isn't awful by the standards of Japanese video games, but it is by the standard of whether I have anything better to do with my time, which I do.Also, getting weapon seals is a pain in the rear. Essentially, you can add up to four ""seals,"" which are little stat boosts, to each of your weapons; there are four types of seals and probably thirty subtypes, each of which has a different effect. These increase in power if they're all of the same type, and you generally want all the same subtype, too, since the boosts are little things like +3% Attack Range that don't add up to a lot unless you stack them. But, since most weapons have no seals and those that do are, twenty-nine times out of thirty, going to have the wrong one, getting those weapons together is a real chore. I wish this aspect of the game had been looked at more.While I loved the variety of characters, I have to admit that some of them felt a little bit underpowered. For example, Daruk is so large and unwieldy that he soaks up a lot of damage without being able to dish out any extra in return, and his magma-pillar ability is flashy without actually seeming to do all that much. But, honestly, every single character, even otherwise-reliable picks like Link and Mipha, pales in comparison to the Fifth Horsewoman of the Apocalypse herself: Impa.Impa normally has a pretty underwhelming damage output, but her special ability allows her to summon blue spectral ""clones"" of herself that mirror her attacks. If you have all six clones up and running - not that hard to do, though you do have to refresh them sometimes - you're already dishing out more pain than other heavy hitters like Link.What's really broken about Impa, though, is the fact that (and don't quote me on this, but I believe it to be true) each individual hit delivered to an enemy counts towards your special attack gauge. When you have one character, filling up the gauge takes time; when you have seven, though, as Impa does, the gauge can fill in less than a second. Each full gauge represents something like ten percent of a boss' health, on average, so you can lay the smackdown on your enemies much faster with Impa than with any other character, especially if you then abuse that by getting seals on your weapon to increase your special charge rate further - not that I would know anything about that.Normally, I have to go on the Internet to learn about broken strategies and cheeses for my favorite video games, but Impa is so broken that I found out about her myself, then Googled to find that thousands of other people had already made the same discovery. After you realize that Impa is literally god-tier, no other character really feels worth playing. That's a shame, because Age of Calamity's character variety is, like I said, one of its strong points.Psst! The review will contain spoilers from here on out.When Breath of the Wild came out, the biggest complaint from the community, besides the kvetching about weapon durability and sliding down walls in the rain, was about the story. The game was clearly trying to do something no other Zelda title had tried to do: Depicting a world in which the Hero and the Princess had been unsuccessful in sealing the darkness. Because of the relative lack of story content, though, we didn't really get a full picture of that world, other than what we could see with our own two eyes, which was, admittedly, quite a bit. This was later partially fixed in a DLC, and now we get an even better view of the events leading up to the Great Calamity.Except...we don't, not really. The story content is really nothing new - just more of Zelda being a tortured soul and Link being awkwardly silent. Impa now completes the trio, but she doesn't add much except prompting Zelda to complain more about the weight of her responsibilities, not that Zelda really needed much prompting. There's a better view of the Champions as well, but we didn't really see new sides to them or anything. Honestly, I think that the character who most benefited from Age of Calamity was, of all people, Master Kohga, who became much more sympathetic and honestly the most three-dimensional character in all of Breath of the Wild. Really, for all the cutscenes, we don't get much new stuff.I also wasn't sure I liked the brand-new story content. I came into the game expecting to play a tragedy; after all, I knew that the Champions, Link, and Zelda were doomed to fail, and that that failure would lead to the events of the main game. As I played through the game and watched things happen differently - Link picking up the Master Sword before the calamity, the Champions being rescued, the battles of Akkala Citadel and Fort Hateno being won by the Hylians - I kept asking how the story could possibly lead back to the conclusion I knew was coming.Well, the answer was that it didn't. Instead, though some incredibly obvious deus ex machina, aka Terrako, the annoying little copyright-safe Aren't2-D2, it turned out that the fact that the Champion's successors had traveled back from the future to help them in their quest had turned the tide of battle, and that Age of Calamity takes place in an alternate universe where the Calamity never succeeds.How lame is that? It would have been incredibly affecting to watch these characters fail, to do our best to save Hyrule but to come up short, and possibly to get to play as the bad guys and kill off some of those irritating Champions, specifically Revali. But no, instead we got a very safe ending that didn't take any of those narrative risks, and which didn't illuminate the most pivotal part of the story, when Zelda becomes trapped battling Calamity Ganon and Link nearly dies defending Fort Hateno. I feel like Koei Tecmo was handed something good and turned it into something pretty forgettable.Ultimately, I think Age of Calamity did more or less what it said on the tin. This is a good - not just decent, actively good - musou that took the story and characters of Breath of the Wild and expanded on them in a few small, timid ways. I can't say it's a masterpiece, and it hardly summoned the magic of my first playthrough of the main game, but it's more than worth $60 - and, on Very Hard, it'll kick your teeth in, which is exactly what I like from my action RPGs.Originally published at http://skeezixblogs.wordpress.com on February 11, 2021.",https://miro.medium.com/max/9506/0*xNnMxelDFCLmdc1y,https://skeezixblogs.medium.com/is-hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-still-worth-playing-7292cd5103f,gaming,9880cbe0065fa55ccfaa3b02da5156a38b96d1e723eafffc8543948f

I was suddenly aware of all the reasons why he might not find me beautiful anymore. I looked down at my feet and tucked a strand of hair behind my ear.""I can't believe it's been an entire year since I've seen you.""I looked up at him and his eyes met mine. I smiled sheepishly and nodded. ""I know. I've been looking forward to tonight for months.""He smiled back at me but it faded as he recalled a thought. ""You know I don't have a lot of time.""I nodded again. ""I know.""He bent to unzip his black leather boot and pried it off his foot. He repeated this with the other. I stood and watched, drinking up the sight of him.I ran my hands over my chest and torso, ironing out any wrinkles in my silk gown. I fluffed my hair while he wasn't looking but he looked up and caught me. I brought my hands down abruptly to my sides, my face burning with embarrassment.He smiled and walked towards me. ""You look beautiful.""I blushed and avoided eye contact with him as he approached me. ""I'm a little nervous is all. You look like you haven't aged a day. You never do. I feel..."" I trailed off.He brought a hand to my waist and pulled me into him. He tucked two fingers under my chin. He tilted my head up gently, forcing me to look at him.""You feel what?""I sighed. ""I feel like an imposter.""His eyes widened with pretend anger. An imposter, he screamed in silence. I brought a hand up to my mouth to stifle a laugh and I melted into his chest. He brought a hand to the back of my head to hold me. He chuckled and my body bounced against the rumbles of his laughter.I leaned back and placed my hands on his chest. I wanted a good look at him.He looked tired. He always did. He'd been up all night. His eyes were framed with fine lines but the eyes themselves were bright and clear. His iris' were Arctic blue with iridescent flecks of gold around the pupil. They smiled even if his mouth didn't. The apples of his cheeks were rosy, having been brushed with the cold from outside.He repressed a smile through pursed lips as he watched me inspect him. Whiskers from his moustache combed over his upper lip. I cupped at the body of his beard, the coarse hair conforming to the contour of my palm. I felt his eyes following mine as I wandered over the details of his face I'd forgotten. A freckle here, a wrinkle there.""Do you like what you see,"" he asked.I met his eyes and nodded. ""Of course.""""Much change?""I shook my head. ""No. Never. And it never ceases to me.""He wrapped his hands around me and clasped one of his wrists at the small of my back. His warmth emanated through his suit. It reminded me of sitting in front of a fireplace.I snuggled my face into his chest and he rested his chin on the crown of my head. ""You smell lovely,"" he mumbled into my scalp.I looked up at him. ""Did you miss me?"" The need for reassurance was in my voice and he caught it.He grabbed me by the shoulders and held me at arms length, white teeth radiating behind his grin. ""Every year you ask me this. Did you know that?""""I know. I'm waiting for the day you trade me in for a newer model."" I chuckled, half joking, half serious.The humour in his expression faded. He brought his hand to the nape of my neck and cradled my head. He sighed deeply before speaking.""I remember the first night I met you. Do you remember? I remember it like it was yesterday. You sat at a small table over there - "" He turned his head and pointed at the dining room with his chin. "" - And I thought, 'I've never seen someone so beautiful look so sad.'"" He gave a quick shake of his head. ""No. No - 'sad' is an incredible understatement. You looked broken.""I remained quiet as I listened to his story. He had told it many times before but I never tired of hearing it.""You seemed surprised to see me."" He chuckled in recollection. His chest bounced and it made me laugh with him. ""You stood so quickly from the chair I was convinced it was going to topple over! You threatened to call the police on me, do you remember that?"" I laughed again and nodded into him.""After I convinced you not to - and lemme tell you, you took some convincing - I joined you at the table and asked what was wrong. I had a busy night ahead of me, but for some reason, I just couldn't walk away. It was the look you had in your eyes. You knew what it felt like to be alone. And I know, better than most, what that feels like.""I wasn't expecting you to open up to me the way that you did but I guess I have that effect on people. Or maybe nobody had listened to you in a while. Either way...""You told me you felt lost. You told me you were married to someone you didn't know. An alcoholic and an abusive one at that. 'I'm not sure if I ignored the signs or if they had come out of nowhere,' you said. You told me it was easier to pretend you weren't aware your husband was cheating on you than to confront him and be blamed for all the reasons why he did. You didn't want your grief to be misconstrued. You didn't want him to take it out on the kids.""I felt a lump in my throat swelling and I swallowed. It didn't go away.""You told me you felt stuck. Because of those great boys you got upstairs. Those little rascals, they stole my heart too! You didn't want to leave him because you weren't sure if you could handle them blaming you for the reason why their family had to function in fragments. They were only one at the time but 'they'll grow up and wonder', you said.""My eyes welled and I tried to blink them away. I sniffled and he pulled me closer.""I sat and listened and watched you, your beautiful lips spilling these heartbreaking words - cruel poetry, it was. You finished speaking and sat there in silence, looking at your hands. You stared at them so long I thought you might never speak again.""I opened my mouth to speak but that's when you looked up at me. A tear spilled onto your cheek, the sadness in your eyes reaching depths I thought I'd only ventured to. You asked, 'does magic exist?' I rolled the question over in my mind a few moments before asking what kind of magic you wanted to believe in. You said, 'the kind that makes me disappear.'""I hurt hearing that, I did. I had no idea who you were yet I felt the weight of everything you were carrying. I wasn't sure what to say to comfort you - at the least, take you away from yourself, even if only for a moment. But then, 'A-Ha!', like some divine stroke of clarity, I knew what to say!""I leaned across the table, getting as close to you as possible. You smelled as lovely then as you do now. I said, 'I don't know if that kind of magic exists. But I do know of a different kind that does.' You leaned in close, our heads inches away from each other, like we were sharing some kind of secret. I suppose we were. You asked me what kind and I smile now remembering the curiosity that lit up your eyes.""I said, 'when a seed is watered and given sunlight, its shell cracks open and out sprouts a fragile string of green. It's so fragile the odds of it surviving are not in its favour. But with nourishment and care and time, that little acorn becomes an oak.'""You looked at me with a bemused expression written over your face and said, 'that's not magic; that's just science.' I said, 'maybe but suppose science and magic are one in the same? Suppose we learned how magic works and because we understand it, we call it science? That doesn't take away from these phenomena still being magical.'""You leaned back in your chair, with your arms crossed over your chest and you eyed me. You wanted to prove me wrong but you couldn't. I was there after all, wasn't I? After a while, you leaned in again, ready to listen and you asked, 'okay. I'll bite. How does this magic apply to me?'""'You're the seed,' I'd said. You repeated what I said, not sure if you heard correctly. 'I'm the seed?' you asked. I nodded and said it again: 'you're the seed.'""I shifted against his chest and wrapped my hands around him. He was much larger than me and my fingertips barely met around his circumference. I shimmied and found a way to hook my middle fingers together.He peered down at me over his beard. ""You doing okay down there, sniffles?""I nodded and smiled. ""Keep going.""He rested his head atop mine again.""You'd looked at me waiting for some kind of further explanation but I didn't give you any. I think part of you knew that I wasn't going to give you one either so you didn't ask. I stood, already well behind schedule, and told you that I had to be getting off.""You asked, 'will I see you again?' I told you, 'yes, you will. I'll make sure of it.' You smiled at me and it felt like the sun was peeking through the clouds. I walked over to you and hugged you, the way I do now, and kissed you on the head. I stared at you before leaving, maybe a moment too long, but I wanted to memorize as many details about you as possible.""I came back the following year, same day, same time. I wasn't sure if you were going to remember. Not until I was inside the house and there you were - sitting at the table, clasping your hands together and looking at your watch every couple seconds. You must've thought I wasn't going to show up because your knuckles were white. You looked up and saw me and boy, did I give you such a fright! I thought that chair was going to topple over again! But you laughed and I could see how excited you were to see me. You came up to me and wrapped your arms around me, asked me if I wanted anything to drink.""""You wanted a small glass of milk,"" I mumbled into his chest.He nodded several times, his chin poking the top of my head. ""Yes. Yes I did.""""We sat down at the table again and I asked you how you were doing. There was something different about you, I knew it the moment I looked in your eyes. You told me how the boys had turned two and they were climbing and crawling on everything. You'd said this with frustration but your eyes told me a different story - you loved those boys, you sure did. You were proud of them.""That was the night you asked if I could hold you. We cozied up on the couch together, with what time I had left. You were curled up under my arm and you cried. You cried a small pool onto my suit, but I didn't mind; I just held you until you were done. You sobbed for a long time. You had a lot of hurt that couldn't be put into words.""When you finished, you pulled away from me, your eyes rimmed red and your lashes sticking together from the tears, and said, 'you have to go now, don't you?' I nodded my head and you smiled at me. You said, 'I'll see you next year,' and I nodded again. It was hard for me to leave you but I knew I would see you before long.""Every year, I'd come into the house and see you sitting at the table waiting for me. Small things and big things would change around you, but you always sat there waiting for me. Your pyjamas were always different. One year, the table was different. Sometimes your hair too. I hardly recognized you that one year you lopped it all off and dyed it blonde!""""I was so worried you weren't going to like it.""""The one thing that never changed was this look you had in your eyes. I guess a part of me was always worried that I'd see the same look in them the first year we met but I have yet to. But no, this look - this look was the opposite of that. I don't know how to describe it - there's not a lot of moments I've seen that look in someone's eyes. But you had it every single time.""One year, I saw you sitting at the table and you didn't get up to greet me immediately - it was unusual and out of sorts. You didn't even turn to look at me but you knew I was there. I could feel that something was different but I couldn't put my finger on what it was. The dining room buzzed like something other than you and me were alive in it.""I walked over and stood at the table and that's when I saw it - your black eye. It looked like it was a couple days old, the border now a yellow-green gradient. I sat down quietly and looked at you. I had never seen the effects of the abuse even though you had mentioned it to me on many occasions.""You looked up and - it was - I remember it - this, this fire in your eyes. You said, 'he's gone.' Those words rang in my ears in the silence that followed. And you repeated those words again when the echoes of the first stopped cascading through my mind: 'he's gone.'""I watched you and marvelled at this creature that was bruised but far from broken. And then you said - you said these words that - that I will never - I will never forget."" His voice cracked and he hugged me tighter.""'I'm the oak,' you said.""I whispered it back: ""I'm the oak.""We didn't speak for a moment. His shoulders fell in a sigh and said:""You've been the oak ever since.""We stood there wrapped in each other in the middle of the night, frozen in time. My heart beat lazily against his chest and the residue of insecurity released me from its clutches. The second hand on the clock tick, tick, ticked, the refrigerator hummed and the furnace in the basement roared. The incandescent light from the dining room cast a warm, cozy glow around us, every object coming to life in its own shadow. The wind howled outside and the floorboards creaked in protest.My boys - no longer boys - were asleep with their partners in two of the guest rooms upstairs. Their children were tucked away in the third. There were only a handful of hours before this old home would be a buzz with the clamour of small, naked feet running through the halls, the sizzle and whir of the kitchen preparing breakfasts and Americano's, the tearing of Christmas wrap and boxes, and the shouts of incredulous surprise at each discovery under the tree. It filled my senses and it filled my heart and as fast as the hubbub would come, it would go.He pulled away and held me at arms length, bending at the waist so our eyes were level. He looked into me, his gaze sincere.""When they kids grow up, as they do, and they stop believing in me, they'll still believe in you. If I am magic, then you are too.""Nick embraced me in his arms and I held him tightly. He squeezed me before we released each other. He cradled my jaw in his massive hands, his fingers resting gently behind my ears. He brought his lips to mine, the tickle of his moustache and beard prickling my skin, and kissed me. I closed my eyes and kissed him back.Our mouths parted and he pressed his lips on my forehead. ""I have to go,"" he whispered.""I know."" I smiled up at him. It reached my eyes.""Same time, same place,"" he asked, his face breaking out in a grin.""Same time, same place,"" I grinned back. ""Different pyjamas.""He laughed his belly laugh and I shh'd him jokingly, jabbing a finger at the ceiling. He zipped his lips with two fingers and placed the imaginary key in my palm, folding my fingers shut on top of it. He put his boots on and turned the corner of the dining room. With a final turn of his head, he smiled and winked at me, then disappeared into the night.I stood a moment in his absence and sighed. I smiled to myself and held my fingertips up to my lips, preserving the kiss.A stair creaked from across the room. ""Gramma?""I turned to see my 4-year old granddaughter sitting on the last step of the staircase, hands balled into tiny fists and rubbing her eyes. I walked over and knelt in front of her.""What are you doing up so early, my love?""""I couldn't sleep."" She yawned a lion's yawn and her eyes squeezed shut.I laughed. ""You look pretty tired to me, missy."" I stood and offered my hand. ""C'mon, let's go to bed.""She stood and placed her hand in mine, still rubbing her eye with the other. ""Gramma?""""Yes, dear?""""Were you kissing Santa?""I looked down at her in surprise.""Oh, my - well - I - "" I scrambled to find words. She looked up at me, blinking away the remnants of sleep, her gaze beginning to focus. I paused before smiling at her and said, ""that would be quite magical, wouldn't it?""She nodded her head. ""Yeah. It would be.""I waited to see if she would say anything else. She looked up at me, shrugged her shoulders and said, ""Does that mean we get more presents?""I threw my head back in hearty laughter and bent to kiss her on top of her head. I scooped her up and hoisted her on my hip. ""Let's get you back to bed, shall we? Only a couple more hours till we get to see what Santa left you under the tree.""She nodded as she yawned again and tucked her head in the hollow of my neck. She would be asleep before I reached the top of the staircase.",https://miro.medium.com/max/5120/1*AprIUVjxwSBUBstUPZSZ6A.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/a-forest-in-these-walls-296ef17aba99,fiction,13067e06e8ba476cbc5504197989de0cb5410a1a6d37b9c6c808acce
How I'm Using Hypnosis to Attract My Life Partner,"Let me introduce you to my friend, Shonda.She was in her late 30s, single in New York, and planning to die alone. (Her words, I hasten to add!) This is why in 2016, she decided to make a change.She worked with a coach, shifted her mindset, and attracted Brian into her life. This happened in six months. They've since brought a wonderful boy called Charlie into the world.Now, she's a hypnotherapist and coach who helps others master their subconscious. She's also been voted a top 20 coach in LA by Los Angeles entrepreneurs.When I spoke with Shonda, I was expecting my worries to be swept away. The reality was different. She asked me questions, led me by the hand, and even set homework. Most exciting of all? I think it might be working.The fundamental aim of hypnosis is to shift your beliefs. According to the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis, the hypnotic ""state of consciousness involving focused attention and reduced peripheral awareness"" may help us use our minds more powerfully.One belief I've latched onto is feeling I'm not enough - that I'm not worthy of love. It's held me back in relationships and I fear I may never settle down with someone special.If you're in a similar boat, hypnosis may just help. Here's the practice Shonda taught me.After three months, I've noticed a difference. I feel like I'm slowly surrendering control of my fears, and I don't seem to be worrying about the future as much.It felt strange at first. You know, practicing in the dark and talking to myself. Truthfully, though, it's not too dissimilar to meditation. I've practiced this for years, and the main difference seems to be speaking aloud.Somehow, this single act of talking has made me feel more present, leading me to truly believe the words I'm speaking.And I say it might be working for one simple reason. Last month, a writer on Medium and I progressed from commenting on each other's work to swanning into emails. I've enjoyed her writing for months and thought she looked pretty, but I had zero expectations of being anything more than pen pals.However, I read the signs and asked her out on a date:She agreed, throwing the emojis right back at me, and we've now taken things to WhatsApp. We had our first virtual date last weekend and are doing a take-two on Saturday.Will it go further? I hope so. We've been open about the difficulties of doing long distance (she lives in New York, I live in England), and we're keeping our expectations low. It's exciting, though, particularly given how I wasn't looking for anything.Funny how removing resistance does this!This is a far cry from needy behaviour I've exhibited in the past. I probably wouldn't have asked her out in the fear of being rejected, and I doubt I'd have said she's pretty.However, now that I'm starting to believe there is someone out there for me, I find myself going with the flow. If the girl I've been dating isn't the one, that's okay. We've had fun and I'll be one step closer to the person who is.Will hypnosis attract my life partner? I'm three months into the practice, feel worthy of love, and have met an amazing woman I would like to know better, in spite of Covid.If this is possible in such a short space of time, I'm excited about the possibilities of six months.Give it a go. There's nothing to lose and potentially a whole lot to gain.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2060/1*KID3Pfx76MamaWe_vOlRNQ.png,https://psiloveyou.xyz/how-im-using-hypnosis-to-attract-my-life-partner-8c45fd5defb9,mindfulness,13482c01b3cc9a71a4b3e9b5918bf9bd27f55d288970890ee8fe95b5
Useful Words of Advice From the Freelance Trenches,"I've been freelancing for a bit over 20 years now. Most of my work has been in the publishing industry in either design or editing. In more recent years, I've taken on a lot of freelance writing.I have never regretted leaving the traditional working world behind and embracing the freelance lifestyle. There were some challenges, to be sure, and once or twice I've had to supplement my income by stocking store shelves around the holidays.That said, I can say with a lot of confidence that freelancing can be a perfectly sustainable and enjoyable lifestyle.Here are some things I've learned over the years that may help.I get it. Freelancing can be a feast-or-famine sort of life, and you never know where your next job is coming from.Reality check. You should always have an idea where your next job is coming from. But, admittedly, that takes practice and experience. It will come along as you get better at pitching jobs and tracking down work.Early in your freelance career, you're going to be tempted to take in every job that comes along. The problem with that is if you take on too much at once, you won't be able to give each task the attention it deserves, and you run the risk of being so overworked you miss deadlines and end up hurting your working reputation.Take on what you are certain you can handle, and no more. Doing a quality job will help you get that next job. Have a little faith in yourself.Every now and then, you're going to run across a client who raises some red flags. Maybe they're inconsistent communicators. Maybe they are always trying to expand the scope of a project without expanding the compensation. Maybe they talk a lot about waiting for their money to come in - which suggests that's going to be the excuse for not paying you on time, or at all.Maybe they're just a creep.If you're feeling unsure about a client, listen to your gut. Cut them loose at the first opportunity. You're going to save yourself a lot of wasted time and grief working with a client you don't feel right about or who is simply a wrong fit for you.If there is any such thing as a holy writ for freelancing, it's to keep the deadline sacred. Or at least as much as you can. There are two main reasons for this. Well, three...First, meeting deadlines is professional and signals to a client that you're reliable, worth giving more work to, and worth recommending to others.Second, it keeps you on schedule. One sliding deadline quickly leads to two, then three, then your entire schedule is turned upside down.Third, you'll feel better about yourself as a professional freelancer.Plan your time carefully and accept jobs with deadlines you're confident you can manage. It'll be worth it.There will be hard times. There will be scarce times - especially when just starting out. If you persevere in the face of difficult times, you'll eventually find the wait was worth it.No one starts out freelancing at the top of the game. All of those five or six-figure freelancers you hear about on Instagram all started out struggling just as you did. The trick is how long you keep trying and building before deciding that maybe it isn't for you.And hey, maybe it isn't. Some people find they're much happier not dealing with the stress and uncertainty associated with freelancing's early stages. That's fine.But if you really think that freelancing is the best career path for you, you need to be patient and keep at it.Your time will come.Every now and then, you'll find a client you've worked with for a while just isn't growing the same as you. Say you've been freelancing for a few years, and you've raised your rates to match your skill and ability. Your old client may not want to pay you what you're now worth.It's understandable, in its way. They've gotten used to you at a certain rate, and even though your work has improved, and they've reaped the benefits of your skill, some folks see rates as immutable.It's okay to let them go and move on to greener pastures.Loyalty is fine, but being paid what you're worth is important as well. And it makes better use of your time.People grow - or they should, at least. When you feel you've outgrown your client, it's okay to move on. They'll find someone else, as will you.If you go by what you see on Instagram or some of those ""get rich being your own boss"" videos on YouTube, freelancing seems like a pretty sweet deal.The reality is that it can take years before you start showing anything for it or even are in a position to live solely on a freelance income. That doesn't mean you shouldn't go for it. It just means you should enter the freelance world knowing what's in store.Manage your expectations. Be professional. Be patient.It'll all come together in the end.Thank you for reading. I'd love to share more with you via my Bi-Weekly Word Roundup newsletter sent to subscribers every other Sunday.

"""Gaming releases that feeling of daily entrapment that has suddenly become our reality.""","In ""Gaming With My Boys Has Become a Necessary Artificial Reality,"" poet and professor Alan Chazaro writes that there's a world of gamers beyond the stereotypical young, white, and heterosexual players we often imagine.

League Play Returns to Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War,"On February 8th, Treyarch released an update to bring League Play back to Call of Duty. For those who do not know the importance of this, let me educate you a bit. League Play is a competitive mode within Black Ops Cold War that pits eight people up against one another with the same maps and rule sets used in the Call of Duty League. Two teams of four battle it out in three different game modes, across six maps, to see who comes out the victor. Each game mode provides varying levels of skill and strategy to pull out the win as a team.The first mode to examine is Control. To quote the Call of Duty fandom Wiki, ""[control is a game mode where] there are two control points that the attacking team must capture in a set number of lives before the time runs out."" A total of thirty lives are given to both teams at the start of each game. The first team to win three rounds wins the game.Search and Destroy is a mode that requires a lot of teamwork, a good bit of strategy, and a little stealth. Each round, teams switch off between offense and defense. When on the offense, players must take a bomb and plant it at one of the two targets on the map in hopes of destroying their target before they are all eliminated or before the timer runs out. As a defensive player, your job is to ensure that the enemy team does not blow up the targets. This can be accomplished by either killing all of the opposing players or diffusing the bomb before it explodes. The first team to win six rounds wins the game.Hardpoint is a respawn game mode that challenges players to work together to capture and hold points on a map that change on a two-minute rotation. Unlike the previous two modes, there is no limitation to how many lives can be lost, but remember that you must wait about five seconds before you can respawn back into the game after each death. Knowing this, you should make sure that you are limiting the number of deaths you accrue to help your team as much as possible. Each team must capture these rotating spots for a total of 250 seconds to win the game.Each player must complete five placement matches to determine where they rank against all other players on the leaderboards. You can be placed into five possible divisions depending on your performance in your placement matches: Bronze, Silver, Silver Gold, Gold, and Diamond. If you get placed in a lower division, do not worry too much as you will be able to work your way up during each ""event"".Outside of your division rank, you are also given a player rank based on the rest of the world's players. If you fall under the ""contender"" title, you are considered part of the lower half of all players on the League Play ladder. If you earn the title of ""Advanced,"" you are part of the top 15-20% of all players. ""Expert"" puts you into the top 11-15%. ""Elite"" puts you into the 10% of all players, and ""Master"" classification has you as one of the top 2% of players who compete in League Play.Unlike the traditional experience in any Call of Duty game, there are many restrictions within the League Play playlists. These are the same restrictions put on professional players within the Call of Duty League. There is a large list of weapons, attachments, scorestreaks, gear, perks, and wildcards. As of right now, there are too many for me to list, so if you would like to see exactly what those items are, I will refer you to either the League Play section of Black Ops Cold War or on the Call of Duty website to answer any of those questions.Earlier today, I played my five placement matches. Most of my games consisted of the hardpoint game mode but luckily rotated between multiple maps. I felt that my performance in these matches was good, but sadly, I still lost most of my games. Those losses could easily be pinned on a lack of communication between myself and the players that I am matched up with. Having a microphone is absolutely crucial to success in this game mode. If you do not have a mic, it will be challenging to perform at the highest levels. This is one of the major issues that I dealt with earlier today, and I found it rather frustrating.It seems Treyarch will keep League Play following the same format as in years past. The mode could use some tweaks as it looks to grow in importance among the Call of Duty fanbase, so I'll be checking back in later to see how the mode adapts to the community's requests.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*R2jE1vboejkxaa2F57-vbg.png,https://medium.com/super-jump/league-play-returns-to-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-69e0f8109abd,gaming,48333b96ee67ff97da159e86bbd335a6283e4210fabcba79082222d5
Abby Kircher of Abby's Better: Five Strategies I Used To Grow My Business To Reach Seven Figures In Revenue,"As a part of my series called ""Five Strategies I Used To Grow My Business To Reach Seven Figures In Revenue"", I had the pleasure of interviewing Abby Kircher, Founder & CEO of Abby's Better.A young female entrepreneur and health enthusiast, Abby Kircher combines her passion for innovation and nutrition to create a new way of healthy snacking as the CEO and co-founder of Abby's Better.Raised in Charlotte, North Carolina, Abby has always been known to take on a leadership role, even from a young age. In 2015, when Abby was just fifteen years old, she became invested in her health and creating a healthy lifestyle. It was during this time where she couldn't help but notice the lack of options for foods that were both delicious and nutritious. With a drive to bridge the gap between taste and health, Abby took out her food processor, nuts, a few natural sweeteners, and began making an array of nut butter flavors and bites to create what is known today as Abby's Better.Today, Abby is even more passionate and ambitious than ever to share her creations with the world. To those seeking a healthier path, Abby offers the cleanest snacks made with all natural ingredients with a promise to never sacrifice taste. Abby continues to inspire other young entrepreneurs to pursue their dreams, even if it means taking the road less traveled. Abby's brand and products can be found at local farmers markets, major food retailers around the East Coast and Midwest, as well as online at AbbysBetter.com.Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dive in, our readers would love to learn a bit more about you. Can you tell us a story about what brought you to this specific career path?When I was 14 year old, I was overweight and unhappy with my body. I knew I needed to make a change in not only how I ate, but also how I treated my body in general.I started to focus on the ingredient labels of the foods I was eating and one of my favorite foods at the time was peanut butter! I ate it on pretty much everything. However, the peanut butter I was eating had tons of artificial sweeteners, peanut oils, and general ingredients that I couldn't pronounce and knew couldn't be helpful.So, I decided to make my own! I was 15, it was the summer of 2015 and I started mixing different nuts with different natural sweeteners, like fruit. I eventually came up with 5 flavors of nut butters: Coconut Cashew, Date Pecan, Strawberry Cashew, Honey Almond, and Coffee Almond.After hearing what friends and family were saying about the healthy BUT delicious products, I approached my mom and said ""Let's start a business. We can call it Abby's Better and it can be a hobby to look good on the college resume.""Little did I know that making that decision that day would lead me not to college, but far from it into a world I was totally unaware of at the time. I soon realized that Abby's Better was about a lot more than just nut butter, but about creating a clean label snack brand that could be a one stop shop for healthy snacking.Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began at your company?In 2018 I was invited by Seeds and Chips to attend the World Food Innovation Summit in Milan, Italy. I was a key-note speaker in two sessions, but the really exciting moment was getting to introduce Howard Shcultz to thousands of people on stage from all over the world! There I was, 17 years old, getting to meet one of the most amazing entrepreneurs and present him on stage. An experience of a lifetime!None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?My mom, and Abby's Better COO, has always been a huge inspiration for me. We have very different skill sets, different outlooks and opinions, and that helps us complement each other in a work environment. I am also IMMENSELY inspired by all of the other successful female entrepreneurs in a variety of different industries who have paved the way for me to be able to do what I do.Can you please give us your favorite ""Life Lesson Quote""? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?Funny enough, a quote I have always admired and to this day ""keep in my back pocket"" is one by Julie Andrews - ""Perseverance is failing 19 times and succeeding the 20th.""Ok super. Thank you for all that. Let's now shift to the main focus of our interview. We'd love to learn a bit about your company. What is the pain point that your company is helping to address?When I first started on my health journey I remember struggling with being unsatisfied in the foods I was eating. I found options that met my health ""standards"" or ""requirements"" but none that satisfied my taste preferences. That is why I make sure that every product I create in the kitchen for Abby's Better not only is incredibly pure and minimal, but also TASTES GOOD! No more dissatisfaction with healthy eating.What do you think makes your company stand out? Can you share a story?Abby's Better is not just a nut butter company. I am creating a clean label snack brand to be a one-stop-shop for healthy plant-based snacking. I want to touch as many people as possible with my products and show everyone that eating healthy is not only important, but is also enjoyable and can affect every area of life for the better.When you first started the business, what drove you, what was your primary motivation?My motivation was to share my love for healthy eating with others and to make plant-based eating accessible and enjoyable for everyone. I grew up an overweight and unhealthy kid. When I decided to make a change (around 14 years old) I didn't know anything about eating to fuel my body rather than just filling it. I did extensive research and taught myself from the ground up - but what I found was that it was difficult to find store bought items that tasted good WHILE meeting my health requirements. That's what drove me to get in the kitchen and take it upon myself to find the solution - not even realizing that I would get to share my creations with so many people today!What drives you now? Is it the same? Did it change? Can you explain what you mean?Most of it has stayed the same, except that in the very beginning I was just creating a product, whereas now I am making a clean label snack brand to be a one-stop-shop for healthy plant-based snacking. My vision is a much bigger picture and I now am striving to touch as many people as possible with my products and show everyone that eating healthy does not need to be monotonous or overly challenging, but that you can ENJOY the process.Are you working on any exciting new projects now? How do you think that will help people?I am very excited about a podcast we are currently working on where I will be deep diving into the entrepreneurial stories of young business owners - going over their wins and losses throughout the start of their careers, lessons learned so far, and their insight into future business trends, along with tips for the next generation of young entrepreneurs. I had so many questions in the beginning and even though it was helpful to watch interviews of very successful business owners, it became difficult at times relating myself to someone so much older and so much farther ahead. That's why I wanted to make sure that this podcast would be focused on YOUNG entrepreneurs and their startup stories.The topic of this series is 'Five Strategies I Used To Grow My Business To Reach Seven Figures In Revenue'. Congratulations! Seven figures is really a huge milestone. In your experience what was the most difficult part of being able to hit your first million-dollars in sales revenue?In business you are always having to be innovative and pivot at any given point. It is hard to plan for steady growth when you know that at the last minute BIG decisions will need to be made. That was key for Abby's Better going into 2020 where our growth skyrocketed. In January, I decided that I wanted to 'pivot' and focus on primarily ecommerce sales where we had killer margin and more connection with our consumer. That was right before COVID hit and began to affect everyone's lives. People were less likely to go into grocery stores to shop, so we positioned ourselves early on to be ready for the spike in online sales. Needless to say, it worked very well!Could you share the number one sales strategy that you found helpful to help you reach this milestone?One of the many strategies we focused on during the e-commerce growth was getting as many customer reviews/thoughts/opinions as possible. Everything from social media polls and comments to email newsletters that could get people engaged and talking with us. We wanted to know how we could be the best possible brand and provide our consumers with the exact products they wanted and needed. LISTENING is such an important tactic and strategy in any business, but especially one where you have to compete with the internet to get people's attention and bring them back again and again.Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you or your team made during a sales process? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?The amount of time we spent hand jarring each of our butters is insane. Hours upon hours because we didn't know how to find the other option. That kind of ""grind"" in the beginning is good though. It taught me perseverance and to do the hard work that needed to be done even when it seemed insurmountable. Since then we've now moved into our own manufacturing facility!Does your company have a sales team? If yes, do you have any advice about how companies can create very high performing sales teams?We recently hired a national sales manager to help with our aggressive retail goals in 2021. Before now, to be honest, my family and I have been the sales force. In some ways, you couldn't have a better ""team"" to ""sell"" your products because no one is going to be as passionate and driven as the founders!Here is the main question of our interview. What are your ""Five Strategies I Used To Grow My Business To Reach Seven Figures In Revenue"". Please share a story or an example for each.1. Seems very simple, but learn your consumer - who is buying your products? It was hard for us to hone in on this one at first because we had notions of who was buying our products, but not the proof to back it. That's where e-commerce analytics became so important. We had the ability to know exactly who was purchasing our products. Age, gender, job, location, interests. It's all important.2. Strategy 2 goes along with 1 - it's to listen to your consumer. As I mentioned previously, it's important to get that consumer as involved and active with you as possible. Make it fun for them to help you get to know them better. Let them know how important they are and position yourself as a brand who is introducing them to your ""family,"" so to speak.3. Constantly innovate. The minute the company is no longer being creative is the same minute the company is in a downward spiral. It is vital that you are always taking the information that you are getting from the consumer and putting it to action! Give them a reason to come back and buy again. It is about creating a strong returning customer base so that people are LOYAL to you.4. Find your 'perfect' team. No one can do this alone. Starting and growing a business takes a lot of attention and focus coming from all different areas of business, so make sure you are surrounded with people who know what you don't know, who have the experience you don't have, and who you enjoy working with and being around.5. Know your end goal. This also sounds simple, but you don't want to be grinding day in and day out not knowing where you are going and what your end goal is. Even if business is booming, it won't feel like you are moving upward if you don't even know where you want to go.What would you advise to another business leader who initially went through years of successive growth, but has now reached a standstill. From your experience do you have any general advice about how to boost growth or sales and ""restart their engines""?Creativity and innovation is key, however this is grueling work and can get tiresome. If you feel like you have stalled in innovation, make sure you get someone on your team to bring fresh energy and new thinking! Mix it up a bit.In your specific industry what methods have you found to be most effective in order to find and attract the right customers? Can you share any stories or examples?Trial and error, honestly. To find YOUR consumer means you will have to be reaching so many eyes to see what sticks. I would just suggest don't hold back! You might be completely surprised by who ends up being your key consumer and taking you to that seven-digit threshold!Based on your experience, can you share a few strategies to give your customers the best possible user experience and customer service?Once you know who your consumer is, test every area of your business along with them (the areas that they would experience). What is their age? Make sure you have someone in that category be immersed in the product and customer service and maneuvering around the website. Get as many opinions as possible and go from there. Also, keep in mind that you will have to be constantly changing and pivoting to keep up with their demands!As you likely know, this HBR article demonstrates that studies have shown that retaining customers can be far more lucrative than finding new ones. Do you use any specific initiatives to limit customer attrition or customer churn? Can you share some of your advice from your experience about how to limit customer churn?It's important to be coming at it from both angles. You always want to be getting your products and brand in front of new eyes, but it is not sustainable if you are seeing a decrease in your rate of returning customers. Focus on having a STRONG rate of people who come back after buying once, and then go from there. If that rate is low it can say a lot about your brand. There is something about you or the products that a consumer doesn't want to come back to. That could be a lot of different things from product to customer service to shipping rates or how easy/difficult it is to maneuver your site. If you've spent enough time and energy on getting to know your consumer and hearing from them, this should fall into place eventually!Wonderful. We are nearly done. Here are the final ""meaty"" questions of our discussion. You are a person of enormous influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)I would love to start a movement prioritizing education in nutrition and what it means to take care of our bodies. Not one focused on the way we look or our ""goal bodies,"" but one that focuses on making us feel good, energized, and fueled for our day. I want to show people that you can ENJOY eating well and working out, and that the focus needs to be on the process and the day to day changes not just the ultimate outcome.We are very blessed that very prominent leaders read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US with whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this if we tag them :-)This is no surprise, but Oprah Winfrey! She has overcome tremendous adversity and obstacles and has become one of the most powerful women in the world. She is such an inspiration and it would be such an honor if I ever get the pleasure of meeting her.Thank you so much for this. This was very inspirational, and we wish you only continued success!",,https://medium.com/authority-magazine/abby-kircher-of-abbys-better-five-strategies-i-used-to-grow-my-business-to-reach-seven-figures-5fc6c07e4ac1,leadership,51185f51513be9bf609e72d47b51b48b2c04eb69d9a4cb59e91aae0b
How 10 Startups Actually Use Customer Feedback to Reduce Churn,"If you're leading a SaaS company, you're thinking about churn. I'd bet one of your biggest problems is reducing it or keeping it low.How?Well, of course, your product is important. If you build a product your customers love, they'll stay.But at the heart of any great churn strategy is customer feedback. In developing our product at Savio, my team and I have spoken to hundreds of companies about how they collect feedback and how they use it to combat churn.Here's how these leaders actually use customer feedback to eliminate churn, as well as advice you can implement yourself.If you're lucky enough to get feedback from a customer, you must act on it. Good or bad, it's your chance to improve the relationship with your customer.If it's good, say thank you. Tell them how much you appreciate it. Make sure you acknowledge it. They have just taken time out to help you-by dropping them a simple reply saying ""thank you"" you'll build the relationship and vastly increase the potential for future sales. The stronger the bond you have with the customer, the less likely they are to go elsewhere.If it's bad, do what you can to help them. Make sure they understand you acknowledge the problem even if you can't do a lot about it. What is important is how you deal with it. Don't make it hard for a customer to contact you. Clearly go out of your way to help. Offer refunds, replacements, or whatever, but try and go the extra mile where you can. You can turn a bad situation around and give them a positive experience. You might just save the customer.At the end of the day, my best advice is this: think to yourself what would you want if you had sent the message you have just received? What would you like to happen? That is almost always the best solution.We had a big churn problem early on. Customers would use our product, reach their goal and then churn. We realized that we had to ask, ""What value can we bring to you when you're done using our product?"" Using that question, we unlocked two value propositions that were adjacent to our offering. Together, those two changes increased our average customer lifetime from 3 months to 18 months.We used to run automated drip campaigns to get users to re-engage, but realized that getting their feedback was more valuable. We've since switched to having a team member manually email a personalized message to each user who didn't activate. This has instilled personal ownership of feedback collection in the team, and the personal touch and extra motivation have uncovered great insights around our top of funnel messaging and clarity of value proposition.One way of using customer feedback to reduce churn, improve customer experiences, and help a business' growth is to use customer's input to the fullest when developing or redeveloping products and services.We've invested in resources, technologies, and integrated sales processes to facilitate the interface between our employees and customers. Having a platform that centralizes information and a set of standardized and structured procedures makes customer service and experience much more effective and positive, with the lowest level of friction possible.At the same time, you can use this infrastructure to track customer success metrics and ensure alignment of objectives, frequency of deliveries, and that there is overall satisfaction among your customers.Technology and automation are great allies, but we've found that offline experiences also count. We try to be close to our customers, get in touch frequently, and ask for feedback on the progress of the project.The key, for us, has been to invest in more face-to-face interaction. Remember that a solid relationship is built over time and your initiative is important. So don't expect your client to come up with a complaint to think about how to serve you better: schedule alignment and relationship meetings. Show your customer that you care about your business and your success.In this way, they will feel unique, well attended, and important to your company-and they will stay.We are a B2C company, and a lot of our customers use our product once and may not come back for a while. But, what we do is figure out who our top users are, and nurture them enough to appear for a 15-minute interview with us. And, we send them a prepared set of questions such as what features they like using in our product, what would they like more in our product, etc.Then, we ensure that we:This has helped us reduce churn significantly. We still look at customer usage data, but customer feedback has helped us immensely in the evolution of our product.When using a product-led growth approach, customer feedback is critical to help reduce churn.First, you must define how you're collecting feedback from customers. At FROGED we have 5 'channels':When we have a cancellation, we analyze that feedback, find the most important friction points, and then work to give them a solution.We've found that if we can solve those issues that generate friction for our users, we see our churn rate diminish.For example, you might notice a pattern from your users asking for a specific feature they expect within your product, and a significant percentage of those users start to churn. If you listen to your customers, develop that feature the way they want it, you'll see less churn because of it.Having a high customer churn rate only means that your customers are no longer happy with your product and service. Though improving your overall customer experience and retention strategies are worthwhile strategies, we've found that it's really important to get to the root of the problem in your product and really focus on that.Customer feedback is one of the best ways to identify these root problems. Make the most out of all the available channels you have and constantly ask your customers how they perceive their product or service. Interacting with your customers and being attentive to them can help you serve them better and reduce churn.I've been in a number of product roles at organizations, both to instigate the development of products and to act as a sherpa to keep our products safe. Now I advise on lots of products at lots of companies.There are a lot of statistics we can put on tickets and surveys that come out of customer success teams, with Net Promoter maybe being the most common. But while the stats are important, every growing support organization really needs to make sure to:We use customer feedback to reduce churn by organizing the tickets we receive into categories by product and feature. Each quarter, when we're prioritizing our projects, we review this customer feedback and decide which issues we want to address. Typically, we address issues that are the most common and the most severe. The key is to ensure that customer experience teams are working closely with product teams.For example, in the past, our mobile experience had several dead-ends. Visitors to our website could get stuck on a page if they tried to use specific parts of our navigation on mobile. We consistently heard this feedback over a few quarters, and the associated feedback was pretty negative. As a result, we decided to address this issue and saw our conversion rate on mobile decrease. This also led to a decrease in customer churn.For example, this year LiveHelpNow is launching a new operator's panel, with additional features and an updated design. Before we release the updates to all of our clients we are conducting extensive beta testing of the new features with a handful of customers. We ask questions, get our customers to tell us what they like and dislike, what goes smoothly and what needs improvement.Then we take that feedback to the drawing board and do what our customers want us to do. We use their feedback of their experiences in further development, improvement, and designs of the software. That is a great way of putting customers and their needs first. Not only does that improve our product, it gives our customers a sense of true participation in our brand. And that, in turn, creates and strengthens customer loyalty, ultimately reducing churn.If you're not collecting customer feedback, you should be-it's key to reducing churn.",https://miro.medium.com/max/7102/0*jo4J1_aQdD1QTS4J,https://medium.com/swlh/how-10-startups-actually-use-customer-feedback-to-reduce-churn-6421c36d614a,startups,56810d585cb7f1b7a9129e25ecb61f1723701d5d5c32d192f16e46b7
Bertil Hörberg,"Bertil Hörberg has become one of the most well-known indie developers for Nintendo-oriented gaming fans. His Gunman Clive series has a cult following, allowing retro-gaming fans to indulge in the joys of a modern reimagining of the NES Mega Man titles.He followed up those successes with a more action-oriented spin on the genre, titled Mechstermination Force. His most recent title is a side-scrolling beat 'em up named Super Punch Patrol, which was released onto the e-shop this past fall.As lovers of the independent gaming scene here at SUPERJUMP, we were thrilled to get the opportunity to ask Bertil about some of his opinions on the industry, his own thought processes when making games, and what might be next for him and his career. We hope you enjoy this interview with one of the indie development scene's most exciting stars!SUPERJUMP: Being an independent game developer requires a lot of introspection and self-critique. When trying to figure out what comes next, you only have yourself to turn to. How do you figure out what works and what doesn't? What is one of the main things you've learned about your skills since the first Gunman Clive?Bertil Hörberg: Yes, this was especially true for Super Punch Patrol. Being developed during the early parts of the pandemic, it was harder to get player feedback; only a handful of people had played it at all before I submitted the final version for release and just a few times in total towards the end of development.That was also true for the co-op mode, which I could only actually test with a second player a few times, but luckily it seems to have worked out ok. But I think I've come to learn to just trust my instincts and try to avoid being a perfectionist and find a level of good-enough that I can actually produce in a reasonable timeframe.SUPERJUMP: Do you ever desire to work for a large studio again? Is there anything you miss about working in these large-scale settings or do the politics of the environment get too stressful and take the creativity out of your work?Bertil Hörberg: I quickly learned that big AAA productions were not my thing and jumped to smaller and smaller teams until I was working alone, and of course, the scope and team size of the average AAA game has only continued to grow since then. But of course, working alone or in a small team limits the type of game you can make, as well as the reach your game will have unless you hit the absolute jackpot. I can sometimes miss working on things that are more widely discussed on more mainstream forums.SUPERJUMP: I've written a lot about how important indie games are to the gaming industry at large in 2021. I truly feel like they come packed with a personal touch and attention to detail that just can't be replicated in a AAA title. Where do you think the game industry would be today without the brilliant independent work of people like yourself? Do you think indie games demonstrate that games are an art form?Bertil Hörberg: I think the indie moniker is becoming increasingly diffuse these days, some of the games considered indies today still have bigger teams than many of the AAA games from a few console generations back. But yes with the AAA games becoming ever bigger and more expensive to produce, it's harder and riskier for them to experiment and offer new and personal experiences, and harder to release at all actually. So smaller productions fill that gap, and today we have the whole spectrum from solo developers, small and mid-size studios to full-blown 100 million dollar productions.While of course, it is a great thing that more people can develop games now than ever before, I can still miss the time when there wasn't such a big divide between the biggest productions and the smaller games, and even some very mainstream titles could be weird and experimental. And I often wish I could have been part of the industry in the SNES or PS1 era.SUPERJUMP: The graphical style of your new title, Super Punch Patrol, feels like a child's notebook sketches brought to life on the screen. Where did this idea come from and where do you think your future graphical styles will draw inspiration from?Bertil Hörberg: In many ways, it's an evolution of the art style from Gunman Clive. One of the things I enjoy most in development is experimenting with rendering techniques and shaders often to try to disguise the traditional 3D rendering as much as possible and make it look more hand-drawn. One of the things I've been experimenting with for future games is a colorized version of the Punch Patrol rendering, mixed with some ideas I've had in previous unfinished projects.SUPERJUMP: What would be your main piece of advice for a new independent developer in the industry? What is the main thing they should keep in mind to be successful, both financially and artistically?Bertil Hörberg: The industry keeps changing and the market gets increasingly flooded so I'm not really sure what advice I can give to achieve financial success that holds up now. Try to keep your scope small and focus on a game that suits your or your team's skillset and the type of work you enjoy and you'll be a lot more likely to ever finish a game.SUPERJUMP: What is your personal favorite indie title that you have played? What did that game mean to your career as a developer?Bertil Hörberg: I have a hard time naming a favorite, and honestly, I don't play that many indie games, and most of my inspiration instead comes from older games. One game series that really impressed me was Fairune 1&2 for how beautifully it condensed the Zelda-like exploration and streamlined everything else for a very clean and focused experience.SUPERJUMP: Both the Gunman Clive series and Mechstermination Force would be classified as platformers of some sort. Why do you think that genre is so easy for both casual and hardcore gamers to engage themselves in?Bertil Hörberg: There's just something about the side-scrolling perspective that's just instantly readable and understandable and lends itself well to responsive action as well as a whole bunch of other types of gameplay. It removed a lot of potential difficulties of a fully 3D environment both for the player and developers.SUPERJUMP: What is the process for an indie developer to get paid for their work? How much of the profit goes to you and how much goes to the company that gives your game a platform to sell on, like Nintendo?Bertil Hörberg: The industry standard is that the store/platform holder takes 30%. I believe the Epic Games Store has a lower rate but I haven't released anything there myself.SUPERJUMP: What genre do you think your next game will be in? Perhaps you'll venture out into something completely different than before, maybe an RPG or puzzle game?Bertil Hörberg: I'm currently taking some extended time off and don't know when I'll start working on a new game. But I've been thinking maybe it's time for a Gunman Clive 3, or maybe I'll go against my own advice and try to make something overambitious like a third-person shooter, maybe something Resident Evil inspired.SUPERJUMP: Thank you so much for your time, Bertil. It was a pleasure getting to speak with you!If you want to purchase any of Bertil's games they all come at an incredibly affordable asking price on the Nintendo e-shop. You can purchase all four titles he's made for just over 20 US dollars!You can follow Bertil on Twitter here.

Enough Vaccines for All Americans,"There are now 20 vaccines in phase 3 trials, six approved for limited use, and four approved for full use in some countries after fully completing phase 3 trials - one more vaccine than last week. The fully approved vaccines include those from Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinopharm, and Moderna, and this week the vaccine from Sinovac, a Beijing-based biotech company, was added to the list. Others, including the vaccines from AstraZeneca and Russia's Sputnik V, have been approved for emergency use in several countries. More approvals are soon to come.Vaccines are being rolled out in many nations, but access to vaccines and vaccination rates vary widely around the world. Many countries have not vaccinated a single person yet. Israel, with 26.5% of its population fully vaccinated, is the leader in the global rollout, followed by Seychelles and United Arab Emirates, according to Bloomberg. The United States is sixth, with 3.6% of its population fully vaccinated, and 10.9% partially vaccinated.Encouraging news came this week from President Joe Biden, who has now secured enough vaccine doses to vaccinate all Americans. Vaccination is slowly but steadily increasing in the United States, but it is happening unevenly: In many states, Black Americans have had fewer vaccinations than white Americans, in large part because of a lack of access. To help improve vaccination rates among all Americans, online platforms are cracking down on vaccine misinformation.On Thursday, President Biden revealed that he had finalized a deal to get 200 million additional vaccine doses from Pfizer and Moderna, a plan he first announced at the end of January. The deal would secure 100 million doses from each company, to be delivered by May; both companies, as NPR noted, are already scheduled to deliver doses by March. ""We've now purchased enough vaccine supplies to vaccinate all Americans,"" Biden said.Speaking on the Today show on Thursday, infectious diseases chief Anthony Fauci, MD, said that most members of the general public could be eligible for vaccination as early as April. Mass vaccination, he said, will be possible as the number of available doses increases in March or April: ""I would imagine by the time we get to April, that will be what I would call, for [lack of] better wording, 'open season.'"" Once it begins, however, it will still take several months to vaccinate everyone.Last Sunday, South Africa suddenly halted its rollout of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine due to concerns that it would not protect against B.1.351, the variant first identified there. The decision was based on preliminary research suggesting the shot ""provides minimal protection"" from mild-moderate disease caused by the variant, and officials said they were assessing how to use the vaccine more effectively, as STAT News noted. Some experts, however, have criticized the fact that this decision was based on small studies that had not yet been peer-reviewed.Long criticized for letting misinformation spread unchecked, Facebook announced in a blog post on Monday that it was cracking down on vaccine misinformation. Facebook is ""expanding the list of false claims we will remove to include additional debunked claims about COVID-19 and vaccines,"" according to Kang-Xing Jin, the company's head of health. Facebook has made similar attempts before, but anti-vaccine content and groups have continued to flourish, as my colleague Sarah Emerson noted in OneZero. On Wednesday, Facebook-owned Instagram banned anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from the platform for ""repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines.""",https://miro.medium.com/max/8000/1*Qjnne9AHMRs0vjqBdcjb3A.jpeg,https://coronavirus.medium.com/enough-vaccines-for-all-americans-23a230ce9241,science,64102f91b46934bd748e287b43ead5e9945cb0a06d51fc76d5b6a540
Fathers' Sperm Linked to Autism in Offspring,"Researchers at Washington State University have uncovered a genetic link between fathers and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study by Michael Skinner and colleagues revealed a panel of epigenetic markers in the sperm samples that were able to determine whether or not the men fathered children on the spectrum with 90 percent accuracy.""We can now potentially use this to assess whether a man is going to pass autism on to his children,"" said Skinner, whose research was published in Clinical Epigenetics. ""It is also a major step toward identifying what factors might promote autism.""ASD is a developmental disorder, generally appearing within the first two or three years of life, which largely affects an individual's ability to communicate and interact in social situations. Children with ASD find it challenging to connect with their family and friends, display repetitive behaviors, and often have restricted interests, which can take a toll on their quality of life.The number of ASD cases has skyrocketed over the last four decades. While it was once considered a relatively rare condition affecting 1 in 5,000 people, more recent estimates say the numbers are now closer to 1 in 68. There is some evidence indicating a nexus between parental genetics and ASD, but the specific genetic, molecular, or even environmental factors that cause the disorder are unknown.Here, researchers narrowed in on sperm epigenetics or heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. They were particularly interested in DNA methylation-the attachment of a methyl group to a DNA molecule, modulating the activity of the DNA segment by turning genes on or off.The scientists identified over 800 DNA methylation sites from a cohort of 26 men, half of which had fathered autistic children. These sites have the potential to act as epigenetic biomarkers to quantify the risk of fathering a child with ASD. Validation of these biomarkers in a blinded test of another 18 men proved that these had a strong ability (of around 90 percent) to predict this susceptibility.The team plans to expand these findings by testing larger cohorts of men. ""We found out years ago that environmental factors can alter the germline, the sperm or the egg, called epigenetics,"" said Skinner. ""With this tool, we could do larger population-based studies to see what kinds of environmental factors may induce these types with epigenetic changes.""Sources:Clinical Epigenetics, Washington State University.Originally published at https://www.labroots.com on January 19, 2021.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*moPmFAaJBlWab3T5,https://medium.com/beingwell/fathers-sperm-linked-to-autism-in-offspring-d0128283d0a8,science,065650c3537722cddca6b168dc7933702e5fe9dc268be64a37f71f8f
"Red means run, son","This is a part of a series I've decided to launch for myself in which I attempt to write *a minimum* of 1 paragraph (3-10 sentences) about something a day. It will not be perfectly curated or articulated, and there will certainly be punctuation problems. You've been warned.2/11/21Recently, there was a conversation on NPR about how purple has become the cautionary color of the pandemic. In the color scale that was discussed, Green = Fine, Yellow = Spread is Minimal, Orange = Moderate, Red = Substantial, Purple = Bad. I have also noticed purple appearing in relation to air quality chart reports-in which I had to study what exactly the purple indicated (it wasn't clear immediately to me). The issue in general is that a color needed to be added that was more severe, above Red. While it seems the consensus is that purple was most appropriate mainly because it is next on the color wheel, it was also mentioned that it's the color of a deep bruise. I can't disagree more with the selection. It seems the choice was a very literal one for something that should take a larger context into account: the historic symbology, theory, and psychology of color.Throughout history purple has symbolized anything from power, wealth, royalty, divinity, to mystery, magic, and creativity. While it has been used to represent sadness, more times than not its connection is not to caution or threat. According to The Secret Lives of Color, the painter Manet is said to have pronounced purple (in this case ""violet"") as that of the atmosphere in 1881: ""It is violet....Fresh air is violet. Three years from now, the whole world will work in violet."" Though the point earlier that the color has a connection to the worst bruise is true, isn't a bruise less as fearful as an open wound itself, exposing bloody red flesh? I keep thinking of Neil Young singing ""red mean run, son"" from the song Powderfinger. While stop signs indicate the opposite of run, they do have in common the sense of alert. By contrast, purple is often a calming, soothing color-not requiring immediate attention. It is a color of inaction in this context and to define space.Instead of taking the obvious next step in the color wheel to purple, I propose above red should lead to maroon. The blood tone has a closer connection to red, but gives off a sense of deeper danger through its density in color. It does so because all colors are defined within a 'temperature' of either a warm, cool, or neutral tone. Red, yellow, green belong to the warm side; blue and purple cool; black and white neutral for example. Yes there are some purple tones that can be considered to have a warmer tone. They're ultimately still in the camp of cool tone for their incorporation of blue (a cool temp color); as opposed to maroon, which is mixed from red and brown (very little blue if any at all). Warm versus cool colors matter which you consider their psychological impact. A warm color has a relationship with fire, passion, or intensity; a cold color with loneliness, atmosphere, space, or void.All of this to say that the choice of purple is a simplification of the very complex nature of color and perception.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1868/1*NfnomHhzdgZJBvyq5GCYtg.jpeg,https://jenniferblanco.medium.com/red-means-run-son-df8909460a9a,design,66146f69b9ce2b36e3b91372325380a69bdd4df870c182a57946c2e4
Introducing the Internet Nostalgia Series,"Today I am delighted to introduce a new series I'm planning to run on Fridays until...well, until it seems like it's time to stop, I guess. It is called Internet Nostalgia, and it looks back at stories that captured the imagination and attention of the Internet for a fleeting moment and then vanished as everyone moved on to something else. The world of the Internet moves so quickly that things that happened five years ago might as well be black-and-white newsreel footage at this point. This series looks back at those phenomena and what they told us about the Internet, and ourselves. If you have a suggested topic, email me at williamfleitch@yahoo.com.We begin with the saga of Justine Sacco and her infamous ""Africa AIDS"" tweet.Date: December 20, 2013The story: As later documented in Jon Ronson's book So You've Been Publicly Shamed, Justine Sacco, a senior director of corporate communications at IAC, was about to board a flight from New York City to South Africa when she sent this tweet, the final in a series of jokey missives about the banality of air travel:She then took a nap. As she later explained it, ""To me it was so insane of a comment for anyone to make. I thought there was no way that anyone could possibly think it was literal."" People took it literally, and while she slept, she became Public Enemy №1 on the Internet, as people piled on and piled on, obsessed with the tale of this apparently spoiled white girl traveling in total ignorance of what had happened in the wake of her tweet. The hashtag #hasjustinelandedyet became the top trending topic in the country, and grew to become such a global event that by the time Sacco landed, there was a Twitter user at the airport waiting to document her arrival.Sacco was quickly fired by IAC and became a symbol, to many, of white privilege and insensitivity, via this one tweet. She also became the perfect example of what happens when the terminally online get a hold of someone who commits the worst crime possible: Not being terminally online. As I put it in a Deadspin piece that next week:Sacco had logged off. That was the worst offense of all.Pop Culture Crossover: Inevitably, it became a joke on Family Guy.Where Are They Now? Sacco was fired, and then featured in Ronson's book. But her career recovered. She worked as a PR rep for gambling app FanDuel for a few years, to generally positive regard for those who worked with her, and even Gawker, which drove the original story as hard as anyone, came to peace with her. In quite the plot twist: She's now back working at IAC.What We've Learned: That Sacco's initial tweet was offensive is not particularly debated: It went over poorly in 2013 and would go over even worse today. But the key difference between 2013 and now is that today, it would never even occur to Sacco to tweet something like that. In 2013, Sacco, who had only 112 followers, almost all of whom were her friends, was making an ironic joke for her friends on social media. But what we know in 2021 is that no one is your friend on social media. Twitter is a maw that must be fed, and whether you know someone individually on Twitter doesn't matter: If you make a mistake - or, sometimes, even if you don't - you are tossed into the machine, and that is all there is to it. The goal, the old joke goes, is to avoid being Twitter's main character for the day. Sacco was a progenitor of the form. Now, no reasonable Twitter user would ever think, ""Oh, this is just for my friends."" Twitter is global, every second.The irony is that, today, if Sacco would have actually been serious, had she actually been mocking people for getting AIDS in Africa and certain that she wouldn't because she's white ... she probably would have gotten a lot of actual, non-ironic praise for it from the non-ironic, sincere assholes that have taken over Twitter in the last eight years. And that's the biggest change in the eight years since Sacco sent a would-be winking tweet that was seen as racist: Irony may now be dead on Twitter, but racism sure as hell isn't. It sure seems like, if they find the right echo chamber, that people are constantly saying racist things on Twitter now and getting likes and retweets for it. And you don't get likes and retweets for irony.Sacco turned out to be fine. But she has learned the ultimate lesson from her ordeal: Now she doesn't tweet at all. It might be the only lesson worth taking.Got a suggestion for Internet Nostalgia? Send it to me at williamfleitch@yahoo.com.Will Leitch writes multiple pieces a week for Medium.

Blame,"Coming home was supposed to feel like a trip down memory lane, not like a nightmare coming to fruition. ""Maybe I shouldn't have chosen to come back at night,"" Harper thought as her car slowly ambled down the dirt road.This was her driveway, leading to her old home. Her body tensed as her headlights shone on the house.The house was yellow. Harper could remember how her mother had begged and pleaded with her husband to be able to use the color. ""It's too obnoxious, it draws attention,"" he had said. Her mother turned her green eyes on him and that was the end of that conversation. It was a look that got her mother anything she wanted; a look her father said was passed down to Harper. The next day, the yellow paint was being unloaded from their beat-up old Chevy.Now the paint was chipped in huge splotches making the building look as though it was diseased, on the verge of death. The color drained from it just as it had from her mother.Harper turned off the engine but left the headlights shining on the scene. The screen door flapped in the wind, creating rhythm-less music barely audible from the car. A bumblebee lawn ornament's wings spun in the wind from its place in the weed-infested flower plot just to the right of the front door. The picket fence around it was in disrepair. Parts were broken, shrouded in bindweed. Other pieces were stripped bare from the sun and wind.""Everything falls apart,"" Harper's voice was barely a whisper. Shaking her head, she got out of the car grabbing empty boxes from the back seat. She'd start packing in the morning, tonight would be devoted to sleepless thoughts.Harper trailed her fingers along a For Sale sign as she walked to the house. It'd been two years since she'd been to this place. After graduation, she never looked back.Harper watched Matt from the corner of her vision; he was looking at her with squinted eyes and lips pulled back into a weak grimace. Turning towards the kitchen window, he ran a hand through his auburn hair. Air escaped his mouth in a rush, filling the silent room.When she told him that she was coming back here to pick up some things, he immediately volunteered to come with her, probably assuming she would need someone to lean on during the process. Harper rolled her eyes. Ever since they moved away to college, he'd been the one leaning on her.Light from the grimy window made Matt look older than he was. Lines stood out around his mouth; lines of sadness, not remnants of smiles. His eyes were hollow, vacant. They held no glimmer of life, just ghosts.Beyond him, Harper's eye caught on the spinning wings of the bumblebee lawn ornament. She remembered the day her father gave her the bumblebee, how he said it was a testament to her character, how she was always in motion. ""How's my little bumblebee?"" Her father's voice echoed in her head, drifted away as the bumblebee's wings moved again in a breeze.""Love me?"" Matt's voice drew her back inside. Dust marked spots on the wall where pictures used to hang, outlining empty memories no longer wanted. They sat in a cardboard box by the door. Harper's fingers rubbed the smooth outline of a lighter in her pocket. She was just waiting for Matt to leave.""Love you."" The words came out with a sigh. It was hard to believe that someone could be so insecure, that their whole day revolved around being complimented, encouraged, balanced. But that was Matt's day. And being Matt's best friend entitled Harper to be the head cheerleader of each moment. Give her an M, give her an A, give her a T, and give her another T! What does that spell? MATT!Forgive her if it gets a little old.Matt smiled and Harper smiled back at him, the corners of her mouth straining from the effort. They'd been best friends for so long that Harper had quit keeping track. Friends long before everything happened. Friends forever, or so they thought. Now there wasn't a day Harper hadn't found him annoying or needy or clingy.""I miss them, Harp."" Her eyes darted to that cardboard box stuffed with pictures.It'd been two years since Harper's drunken father had run a red light and crashed into Matt's God-fearing parents. Two years since her ruined life had bled into his. Two years since they both lost what family they had.Matt followed her gaze to the box; after a moment he went to it. His footsteps reverberated off the kitchen's floor and down the hall to her old bedroom. Harper's heart pounded harder as he got closer. Kneeling down, he pulled out a worn wooden frame. Inside was Harper's family. They were all smiling behind the bumblebee on the front lawn: her mom, her dad, and herself. What it didn't show was her mom's cancer and her father crawling into the bottle shortly after she died.""Do you remember how it used to be?"" Matt's voice was measured, testing the waters.""Stop."" Harper's one syllable pounded against her ears.""We all used to be so happy..."" Harper pushed back her chair, scratching the legs against the wooden floor. It crashed to the ground. She wrenched the picture from Matt's hands and threw it against the wall next to his head. Glass rained down on them both like tiny needles. Matt's eyes widened but he didn't move.""Why can't you just hate me like the rest of them? Why do you have to be so nice?"" She shoved him against the wall. ""He killed your parents! Your perfect, loving parents! It wasn't enough that he had to ruin my life, but he didn't have to take yours with him!"" Harper's hands were balled into fists, raised and ready to fight, but Matt stood with his hands at his sides.Minutes ticked away with agonizing slowness. They stared into each other's eyes. One set full of hurt and rage, the other set with determination and love.Harper flinched when he finally moved. Matt reached around her to embrace her in a hug. His t-shirt smelled of dust, sweat, and Matt. She tried to get away. Pressing her hands against his chest, she pushed, but he wouldn't let go.""I don't blame him, Harper. It's okay to miss him.""Her body went limp in his arms.Harper's head collapsed into Matt's shoulder, tears leaking from her eyes slowly at first then steadily. Her hands still softly placed on Matt's chest furled to clench his shirt. When the sobs started, they came violently, echoing off of every wall in the yellow house.The bumblebee out front slowed to a stop.",,https://psiloveyou.xyz/blame-ded2dbc58966,fiction,73268d8590898192a7e578d878af1d8f6ca059c5f2fe518ae3a14492
Why It's Beneficial To Feel Joy For Other People's Success,"We all want to feel good about our accomplishments. We all want to feel pride and a sense of satisfaction in the things we work hard for in life.Unfortunately, we can't all be succeeding at exactly the same time. As a writer, I know this all too well. There may be days when you simply miss the mark, whether it's with your job, school work, relationships, or inspiration for a project that's meaningful to you.I've come to learn throughout my life that feeling negative emotions when other people do 'better' than me or they are having 'their moment' instead of me is not only counter-productive but it's utterly exhausting.Spending vast amounts of time and energy feeling bitter or resentful over someone else's achievements can drain the much-needed significant mental power better used for coming to terms with something else - which is the realization that your own time will come.It may not arrive as quickly as you'd like it to but it will show up at the moment it's meant to.You've got to allow the journey to unfold.Meanwhile, double-down on focusing your energy on the things you want to do well at and/or the things you're passionate about. Try not to get distracted by your insecurities. Sow your seeds into the universe and then let them go without looking back or second-guessing.All you can really do is put yourself out into the world with the most sincere intentions possible. Keep your expectations for what eventually comes back to you grounded in reality. Try not to allow your ego to dictate how you're going to feel about any given reaction to whatever you're giving or showing to the world.This is about more than just creating good karma or believing that what goes around comes around. I'd like people to treat and support me in the same way that I treat them - with a purposeful grace and with an understanding that their success is also essentially my success.When you clap for someone else, you are really clapping for yourself. When you respect someone else's achievements, you are also learning to respect your own.With that gift of humility comes the wisdom of knowing how to appreciate your own moment to bask in the sun of success or the opportunity to shine in the spotlight when it arrives.It may not be today and it may not be tomorrow. But it will arrive. Until then, cultivate a new kind of joy by learning how to cherish the success of others around you so you can truly be grateful for your own when it comes.Trust the journey. Lean into the journey. Own the journey.More from Michelle: Do You Recycle 'Pet Names' For Your Lovers?",https://miro.medium.com/max/1502/1*_pTlXrmWvuPAOLWOE_M9_Q.jpeg,https://medium.com/self-inspired/why-its-beneficial-to-feel-joy-for-other-people-s-success-1731d725e4f9,mindfulness,81793a3be343d26eea8163fc0f27a69fbfce66c0fcd584882a4d073e
How the Customer Persona framework is failing us and how to improve it,"This famous framework could sometimes lead to completely misleading and biased conclusions. In this article I propose ways in which we, designers, could use it in a more efficient and transparent way by applying a few modifications and being conscious about where we may be falling short in our decision making process.In Design, there is a widely accepted framework called, ""Customer Personas"" or just ""Personas"". For those of you who aren't familiar with the term/concept, ""Personas"", Wikipedia states:Although this framework is widely used by designers around the world, some of us still believe that its use could have some negative consequences and could even have the opposite effect on the problem it came to solve in the first place. I will try to explain why I think this and also propose a couple of alternatives to, at least, solve the most relevant problems this framework has.Let me introduce you to Jorge. Jorge is 35 years old and lives in Philadelphia with his dog and his mother. He goes out every morning to grab a coffee and a blackberry muffin from his favorite place in West Philly. He likes technology, but he is not a person one would label as a ""geek"". He uses Whatsapp to communicate with his friends and family, because that is the most popular messaging platform for Latinxs. He also uses Instagram, mostly at night before bed.The poor Jorgito (fun way to call Jorges in Latin America) has only one problem: he does not exist. He is a fictitious character, created by a team of designers who interviewed, researched, and built some archetypal models of their users. Jorge is not alone in this ether of nonexistent people. Designers create dozens of personas and create detailed fictional stories about them. The more ""real"" these characters appear, the better, because it helps to create a compelling story for the product being designed and presents it in a ""human-centered"" way.This method is used by the design team to create some sort of empathy for Jorge, and to try and think of better solutions that consider different aspects of his routine. Remember? He liked to buy his coffee in the morning, so designers can start ideating around that: does he check the phone while waiting in line? Does he read the news, or does he prefer checking his stocks while waiting for his coffee? At first, this looks very compelling. And to be honest with you, sometimes it even helps. However, problems arise when designers start to believe in their own story too much, and they are confident enough to forget they made most of these details up.To be fair, it is also necessary to mention that these Personas are not created in a vacuum. They are, if the team does the work properly, the consequence of many interviews (10-20 people), followed by synthesis sessions, in which designers start catching patterns, organizing them into clusters and drawing conclusions from what they observed. Many times, this process creates the false impression that the participants are being entirely objective. They define the average Jorge in those sessions, normally in glass-walled rooms full of post-it notes. Most decisions about how Jorge behaves, looks and acts are made then by these people in the room. Once finished, they share these Personas with the rest of the company to be praised as a source of truth of how the company's customers look like.What they do not take into account is that nobody is objective. We have many unconscious biases that play a major role in how we perceive information being transmitted to us. Particularly, in those user interviews, many times we unconsciously listen to only what we want to hear, we unconsciously filter data and label actitudes or people by how they look and/or talk. All of this happens without us even noticing, and it happens to everyone, even - to a lesser extent - to the most experimented user researchers. We sieve the information the users transmit and then we write that onto post-its, and then, again, cluster it into common patterns. The more we work on this, the more personal biases we put into the process, moving us farther away from the raw data.Precisely, the problem with the Customer Personas method as it is, is that it creates people who do not exist, will never exist, and probably are not entirely representative of the users of a product. Furthermore, the method is designed to consciously exclude all the non-Jorges. Even when the team's qualitative data are supplemented with quantitative data to analyze the composition of their user base, by the time the team arbitrarily decides what Jorge's life looks like, they are killing off the hundreds or thousands of other people who are not exactly like him.The more we want to humanize our Jorge, the more we stereotype him and the more we apply unconscious social mandates to him. He ends up being a representation of the team's prejudices.The framework is even weaker for non-diverse teams. Our unconscious biases and prejudices are modeled by the culture and the environment in which we were raised. Being an immigrant makes me realize this even more: I do not know the tribes of the culture I'm immersed in now and many times I find myself listening to locals explain how certain groups of people dress and act in this new culture. I simply don't have that knowledge. I may have other biases, but certainly not the same as my local community.Diversity kills biases and prejudices. Therefore, minority representation on teams is essential. The lack of representation on product teams created fantastic and infamous failures recently. Siri, for example, learned to tell jokes and flirt with a female voice, but didn't know what to do when the user said, ""Siri, I'm being raped"" or ""Siri, I was abused, what do I do?"" (more here). Unsurprisingly, the team responsible for designing this was predominantly male. Let's set aside the fact that we are surrounded by AI assistants with female voice presets... Apparently, tech companies could only imagine a woman complying with those tasks.The truth is that no two Jorges are the same. We cannot draw conclusions about the average Jorges in 10, 20 or 50 interviews. Even more so considering that a great part of people's innermost and most personal details will remain unknown to the team. In this world there are 7.4 billion different and unrepeatable Jorges.At this point, I thought that not applying this framework would be better. Would it? It is true, at the same time, that having a visible idea of our users is necessary when designing.A couple of years ago, I saw something that the company OXO had on one of their walls. Yes, the company that designs kitchen utensils and tools.The jump to fame for this company was thanks to their famous potato peeler. You probably have already heard this story, but just in case, here it is again. OXO's founder, Sam Farber, had a wife (Betsy) who suffered from arthritis. Every time she peeled potatoes, she suffered terrible pain because the grip of the old peelers was thin, metallic and very difficult to handle. Both worked together to design a better peeler with a wider, much gentler grip for the hand, which made Betsy much happier. What's interesting is that this design not only worked for Betsy and others who had arthritis, but people with 'healthy' hands, also benefited from this new grip and preferred this new design over the old-metallic one. Such a simple design, so massive (less than $10), earned OXO international recognition, awards, and even a presence at the best industrial design shows in the world (at MoMa, for example). More about OXO's history here.The intriguing thing about this story is that if Sam and Betsy had used the Personas framework (should we call it 'average persona' instead?), they probably would not have come up with such an inclusive solution as they did: Jorges do not suffer extreme pain when peeling potatoes.Designing for average is designing for no one and in some cases, this generalization can even have tragic consequences. For example, until not so long ago, women were much more likely to die in a car accident because manufacturers (with mostly male design teams) would conduct crash-tests and design dummies to fit a male average height and weight. When considering averages for designing, we are designing for those who fall into that average; most likely, no one (Some interesting cases of this here and here).So, how do we design inclusive, non-average solutions then? And most importantly, how do we avoid the downsides of the Personas framework? The Microsoft Design team proposed a very interesting methodology: to design for the extreme real cases and then adapt the solution to the mainstream users. Designers should not focus on the averages (or the false 80/20), but on the most difficult cases to solve: users with the most difficulties to perform a certain task. Most likely, what works for the former would work for the latter as well.This method would not base its studies on imaginary people created by a design team. They would be real people, with real names, real lives and real routines. There are hundreds of organizations and groups that classify people with different types of disabilities and characteristics and contacting them should not be difficult. Making them a part of the design process, testing and iterating with them (and not for them) is infinitely more valuable than creating a fake person, googling a stock photo and sticking it on a wall.Okay, we know where to start. Now, how do we extrapolate the observations and insights to mainstream users?I recently saw that OXO has a wall full of hanging gloves. See the relationship? The image seemed super powerful to me: just by looking at those empty gloves, I was able to recreate infinite stories in my head for each one of them. I could imagine who was wearing the gloves, and in which circumstances. I could even feel like I was a carpenter when I stared at one of the wood working gloves for a while. My imagination was triggered.The level of abstraction of each one of these elements is the key. Providing just the right amount of information lets your mind wander freely, and allows your brain to even complement the information with smells and even more comprehensive sensations. We vividly recall moments in which we saw that object and revive the feelings we had.Let's now compare and contrast this with our Persona. We have all the details of Jorge's life, which allows us to set the team and company on the same page, but... do we really empathize with him? Is that persona making us feel anything when we read his story? Everything is pretty much assembled, so there's no opportunity for us to imagine anything different to what is there. But, since not two individuals are the same in this world, shouldn't we facilitate people to imagine other versions of him and moreover, link this persona to a real person you've met in the past, or a situation you can recall vividly in order to better relate what it's like to be him?Coworkers may see the same glove and imagine, or remember, another person and they are all still valid because they all use OXO utensils, although in different kitchens, with different families. But the fantastic thing about this is by creating these implicit personas, when counting with a diverse team, embraces differences and heterogeneity. Each persona we create in our minds is unique and driven by our own experiences, therefore the importance of a diverse team, and using this method embraces that. It's all about choosing the right glove for the product we are designing, an object that has the ability to trigger this effect in our teams' minds. Then, setting the broadest limits possible to allow abstraction to happen within loosely constrained boundaries.I see some similarities between this and mindfulness that I would like to explore further. Perhaps, we could go a step further and create ""abstraction corners"", in which the team has these items hanging on the walls for them to just go there, sit and let their imagination run wild.The Customer Persona method has, in my opinion, problems that can jeopardize its effectiveness when designing products.

Stuck in a Loop,"Like lots of people, I'm fascinated by self-help books - not because they actually get me to help myself, but because they make it possible to think that someday I might. There's something comforting (if only temporarily) about imagining yourself changing your life - whether that means stopping that procrastination habit, getting off social media, exercising every day, or whatever - even if you never really do it. And of all the self-help books I've looked at, the one that's stuck with me the most is, predictably, David Allen's Getting Things Done. (This profile of Allen by Jim Fallows helps explain why: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/07/organize-your-life/303455/). Getting Things Done is a book that's really useful for thinking about work and creativity and the paradoxical relationship between organization and imagination. But it's also, I think, a book that has a lot to say about the peculiar sense of stasis or paralysis that many of us have found ourselves gripped by over the past year.The most important concept in Allen's book is what he calls the ""open loop."" For Allen, an open loop is something you intend to do, or know you have to do, but that you have not gotten around to doing, or even gotten around to making a plan for. doing. Open loops are bad, Allen argues, because even if you're not consciously paying attention to them, your unconscious mind is, and all the cognitive energy it's devoting to fretting about those unfinished household tasks, half-written stories, and unanswered emails is sapping your ability to think about and work on the stuff that you really want to be thinking about. As he puts it, ""uncompleted tasks take up room in the mind, which limits clarity and focus.""Allen came up with the idea of the open loop on his own, but it echoes the so-called Zeigarnik effect, which is a phenomenon documented in studies by the Lithuanian psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, which showed that unfinished tasks tend to stick in our memory more than finished ones do. In principle, this could be a good thing - it could be a way for our unconscious to motivate us, and get us to finish things. But if you have lots and lots of unfinished tasks, the nagging doesn't motivate - it creates a permanent state of low-level stress and anxiety.The relevance of this concept to everyday life should be obvious - the environment so many of us live in is essentially a machine for producing open loops. Email, social media, LinkedIn, notifications on your iPhone, the Web itself: it's not just that there's a constant flood of things pulling at your attention in the present. It's that these things create a trail of unfinished tasks or unfinished psychological commitments.Even something as simple as writing a tweet creates an open loop, if you're the kind of person who likes to read people's replies (and most people who tweet are that kind of person). Instead of the tweet being the end of the task, it's just the beginning, as you debate whether you should reply to people's questions and comments, or clarify what you meant, or add another point. The same is true of subscriptions you sign up for and mean to cancel after the trial period ends, but never get around to actually doing so, or those serious movies you put in your queue, promising yourself you will watch them, even though you somehow never do.Of course, these are mostly small, and unimportant, matters. And they are, unquestionably, the products of privilege. (The cognitive toll from struggling to pay the bills and wondering if you're going to be able to make your rent is far greater, as Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir show in their book Scarcity.) But Allen's point is that cumulatively, they can still wreck your ability to focus. They produce an extreme version of what Buddhists call ""monkey mind.""That's in normal times. And what has struck me over the past 6 months or so is that the Covid pandemic has amplified this problem, by creating, for many of us, a new set of open loops, and these are not small. They are really, really big, and not easily close-able. Allen's solution to the open-loop problem is to identify all your loops and write them down - moving them, in effect, from your unconscious mind to what you might call external memory - while also coming up with a plan to take ""concrete and do-able action"" to resolve them. You don't have to finish the task in order to close the loop - you just need to take concrete steps toward dealing with it. And this fits with work done by the social psychologist Roy Baumeister, author of Willpower, which shows that having a specific plan is enough to quiet the anxious mind. ""Once the plan is formed,"" Baumeister writes, ""the unconscious can stop nagging the conscious mind with reminders.""The problem with the big open loops created by the pandemic (as opposed to the new small ones, like making sure you send out the Zoom link for that meeting in advance), though, is that it's been impossible to come up with specific plans to resolve them. Until a few months ago, we didn't know when or even that we would have effective vaccines. Most of us still have no idea when we will be vaccinated. And the arrival of new variants means that we don't know how effective the vaccines will be.Of course, if you don't think the virus is serious, or worth worrying about, this isn't a problem. But if you have been taking the virus seriously, it's made it impossible to plan for when you'll travel again, or sit in the office, or be able to work easily on projects that require people working in close quarters together. If you're a parent in much of the US, you spent at least the summer and perhaps the past few months unable to plan for when your kids would be back in school - in many cities, parents still can't - and fretting about how remote learning was affecting them. And if you're an essential worker who's had to work in person, you've constantly had to weigh the desire and need to do your job against the risk of getting sick. All of these things are unfinished tasks nagging at our minds, stressing us out, sapping our attention and cognitive energy.The issue here isn't just uncertainty, or fear, though both of these things are, in and of themselves, stressful. The issue is that the pandemic's open loops amplify that stress, nagging at us with the thought of all the things we want to do or should do - see your family members, get back in the office, travel, get vaccinated - but can't. Of course, we can adapt and have adapted: people are still doing interesting work, and finding ways to get by in this new normal. But if you feel sometimes frozen in place, and mentally exhausted, it may be in part because right now, you're trapped in open loops that you cannot close.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/1*yFkw_lpmLmpL_Myac-W6ag.jpeg,https://surowiecki.medium.com/stuck-in-a-loop-8da5cd4b6217,productivity,097788d500329e2ab4da669b65b3866148c2564efea7f82c07ba1a58
The Walls of Control,"Remedy has accomplished something so many before have failed to do: craft a world that feels consistently inconsistent, a place governed by a set of rules far, far beyond our mortal comprehension. Rules we can feel but never truly know.That feeling - that sense you can nearly almost define the world of Control but not quite - is the enigmatic engine that drives Remedy's latest.On its cold, angular surface, Control is a typical third-person shooter with some throwy-throwy bits and an endless cacophony of grey. But things aren't what they seem. The straight, structured edges of Remedy's concrete world bely a place that's wobbly, unstable - a mask that hides its near-infinite possibilities with a stoic, imperial veneer.Its pointed shapes and tort angles are a jigsaw Remedy re-arranges at will - a half-filled canvas waiting for us to paint the rest. Its grey panels are something on which you want to project your own interpretation of the world - the mental equivalent of a child's scribblings, as they try to map a place that's infinitely larger than they could ever hope to comprehend.But those walls deflect those projections. An emotional blindfold that stops you crafting theories about this new reality. You try and try and try to fill the countless gaps in Remedy's universe - but the infinite grey enacts a form of sensory deprivation that denies any and all validation of whatever your imagination tries to conjure.Impossible, distressing, oppressive: the walls of The Oldest House are a veritable pressure cooker, a place of almost unbearable unknowns. Its ever-shifting structure reminds us that we are absolutely not in control. It's a feeling that engulfs almost everything about Remedy's creation - from the world we inhabit to the enemies we seek to destroy.It engulfs its narrative, too. Protagonist Jesse's story is surrounded by those same walls. Something destroys her childhood, something takes her brother, something calls her to the house, and another something chooses her as director. Something - vague, unquantified and unquantifiable - is a ubiquitous feeling here, and one that's characterised Jesse's life from the start.Remedy masterfully wields its world and story to apply a pressure that continues beyond the narrative's so-called ending. Even there, Control never truly relents. Questions go unanswered, and that desperate, much-needed release is cruelly denied. It's absolutely unbearable - and makes the feeling of control a rare and precious commodity.In a world you don't understand in a place you don't understand with a past you don't understand, Jesse's telekinetics are a reprieve from the unbearable absence of control. We can't quantify the thing we fight or what we're fighting it in - but we can quantify throwing a desk chair in its face. Again and again and again, every object thrown is a catharsis in microcosm, a fleeting glimpse of that feeling of control. It makes the game a desperate joy to play, as you scramble to relieve that invisible pressure.Every second not spent throwing a table or brick into the noggin of some crimson-tinted baddy is a tender moment of withdrawal. That scripted, text-book pay-off said to be central to any narrative is instead sprinkled into even the smallest victories. Without those small resolutions, Control would drive you insane long before its end - and certainly would long, long after.It all feels strangely familiar, too. Those shifting walls emulate our day-to-day lives, something that never changes and yet is never doing anything but. Our houses are those lives, forever at threat from the chaos beyond. A death, a divorce, a redundancy - we scramble to contain these emerging dangers in a bid to avoid the truth: that reality is impossible to truly quantify.We're the directors of our own houses. Like The Oldest House, the rules of life feel murky and unknown. The would-be walls of infinite grey are there, secretly forcing us down a path not always of our own choosing. Moving that coffee cup off the table or washing the dishes is us imposing our power on the world in a desperate bid to take back control. Like Jesse's powers, each small act is a moment of escape from that indescribable tension.Control is telling, too. See how quickly you're willing to submit to the orders of The Board just to find an emotional grounding rod in this weird, unnerving world. Note how eager we are to relieve the burden of navigating the unnavigable by accepting direction from sources so alien and unknown.That similarity between Control and life makes it easy to understand how Jesse feels, despite such incredible circumstances. Symbology and dialogue from The Board aren't easy to grasp, leaving Jesse uncertain - and us doubly so. For us, Remedy are the Board: they dictate what we do, where we go. We don't understand the or whats or whys, and yet still fulfil Remedy's confusing edicts.Like the The Oldest House, how Control looks and how it feels are in the midst of a never-ending nuclear war: totally opposite and in total opposition to each other. It looks like a standard third-person shooter, but it feels like anything but. The former's rule we understand, the latter's we absolutely don't.And at the heart of that feeling lies a supreme confidence from Remedy. To know that what you offer is enough, and just enough, is true craftsmanship. From the dualistic dialogue to the lack of true resolution in a place where you literally cannot trust the walls around you, Control is a commercial risk, and one that only Remedy could take with a game only Remedy could make.In taking that risk, Control has created what can only be described as the gem of a generation. A game that's masterful in its vision and ambition, if not always in its execution. In its would-be house of mirrors, Remedy has shown us a little about ourselves and the industry that made it - because video-game marketing can't sell a world that can't be understood in 15 hours of gameplay, let alone 15 minutes of footage.And in making a game that breaks that rule, Remedy has made something truly great at the expense of commercial success. With its arrival on PlayStation Plus and Game Pass, we can only hope it finds that success, rewrites those rules, and encourages others to bring games just as weird to our beloved industry - an industry that's seemingly built on rules we can feel but never truly know.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*DEMM4kycc-2PYOM8wuGVfQ.png,https://medium.com/super-jump/the-walls-of-control-e4b443136235,gaming,329015adeaa5b2ef6e44e3612e4aaa4e8c7cc22e7531ee32b3e1078e
Goes Without Saying,"Bobby's wife left him. The couch. The TV. The bedroom furniture. She left him the toaster, the blender, but not the expensive juicer they bought as part of their New Year's resolution. She didn't leave him a note either. Bobby called his sister Josie and asked her. Why, do you think, there was no note?She told him.""It goes without saying.""Bobby didn't like that answer and began to scour the apartment for clues. In his mind, everything had been going along as usual, fine in his estimation, just fine. He had no complaints. Saw nothing wrong.Did I miss something? he wondered.Apparently so.Bobby looked under the couch cushions but all he found was the remote. And a few nickels, a quarter and a dime. He left them there. Bobby looked in the kitchen cabinets, the dishwasher, the refrigerator and the oven. It got ridiculous at that point. What was he hoping to find there?Bobby went into the bedroom and riffled through his dresser drawers. Her drawers were all empty, of course, and how he first realized that she had left, her house key sitting quietly next to the lamp, the drawers pulled open to reveal the emptiness. He'd come home one night to find things that way. And the expensive juicer gone missing, of course. He stood in the bedroom blankly for a moment, remembering that day. Wondering, what possibly could have gone wrong?That was the big question he needed an answer to.He wandered next into the bathroom they shared, just off their bedroom, with its step-in shower they used to make fun love in sometimes, the pink wallpaper, dimmer-switch lighting and its double sink vanity.You can do anything you want over in that sink, but don't do it in mine, she'd said to him right after they moved in together, a year before they married.She was possessive that way and what the heck did she think he was gonna do in the sink anyway? Bobby stood looking at himself in the bathroom mirror.Am I such a bad guy? What did I do? Where did she go?He ran his fingers through his hair, across his three-day beard growth. His eyes, a bit bloodshot around the rims of their sleepy blue orbs, but what did you expect. It had been six days since she'd left, after all. Bobby was handsome even when rough around the edges and he knew it. He placed both hands on the vanity and leaned in closer for a better look, sizing himself up, tilting his head to one side then the other to take in the full view.The doorbell rang.""Jesus, who's bothering me at this hour,"" he said aloud to himself.Bobby padded out to the living room in his pajamas and wool socks, coming up just a few feet away from the front door. The white curtain covering the glass door was just sheer enough that he could see the visage of a visitor but just opaque enough that they could not see in. Like a one-way mirror that cops always use in TV shows.A woman.But not just any woman, he could tell, as he stepped a few inches closer.It was her.Is she back? Changed her mind? What is happening right now?He contemplated opening or not opening the door to her. He inched in a bit closer.He could see she was leaning in now, too, knowing the precision of the viewing characteristics of the door. She would have guessed he was watching her from the other side. Her face was up close to the glass now. Then turned to the side. Her ear pressing just against it, then.Bobby took two steps back and stood staring at the door, watching her. All that was keeping them from each other was some hardwood, some metal framing and a little red paint. That was peeling. The paint, that is, the door in need of a new coat years ago. His gaze fell into the living room, scanning the table, the chairs, the couch. The couch she left him, the couch they used to snuggle together on to watch movies and eat ice cream.Something caught his eye on the coffee table. A magazine. Opened to a dog-eared page for someone not yet done reading. He shuffled quietly over to the center of the room, picked it up and read the title. Then the first paragraph. He read the next, and the next and realized it was meant for him. Or at least he assumed so.Sometimes a thing is in plain sight but we don't even notice it.He read through the first page and turned it for more. But then he stopped. Bobby set the magazine back down on the coffee table and stared at it. Like a stain that needed cleaning but was just as easily ignored.The doorbell rang again.He looked towards the door but didn't move. Couldn't move.He had his answer.. . . . .From the Renderings collection, © Mary Corbin 2020marycorbinwrites.commarycorbinart.com",https://miro.medium.com/max/5336/0*pTvbiCFfr_tSlQGh,https://thecreative.cafe/it-goes-without-saying-1f6cbd5f2868,fiction,0346208c3b15f734177a7ed43a272b5af1d8c5936e0d72f5c731e05a
Chinese Writing: Types of Radicals and Their Application,"Last updated: 08 Feb 2021In the introductory article on Chinese writing, we got an overview of the 3 core concepts of Chinese writing: radicals, characters and words. That introductory article isn't required reading (it's light and easy reading, though!), but the reference sources (official, from China) are documents you should keep by your side at all times.(This article has been converted into a course at this Facebook group.)This article is part 2 of 4 that fully explain the Chinese writing system:(The 4-part foundational series provides solid ground for actually learning Chinese! Visit our compendium of 3500 characters when you're done with the series!)You must have ready access to the Table of Radicals (汉字部首表) and the Table of Characters (通用规范汉字表), which are the reference sources mentioned above, in order to read this article!If you need a phonetic handle on every Chinese character in this article, you'll also need Chinese Pronunciation: From English Perspective. However, this article focuses on how radicals are used to construct characters, so you won't be needing to pronounce them; you'll just need to visually recognize them. In case I miss out specifying the pronunciation for any Chinese character here, you can look it up at dict.youdao.com.Let us now take an in-depth look at radicals, the most fundamental building blocks of Chinese writing.There are 4 types of radicals in the Chinese writing system, the first 3 of which are officially listed in the Table of Radicals. The following list also serves as a good TL;DR:The above TL;DR may only serve you well after you've read the fascinating details below.This article is tightly related to Chinese Writing Strokes: Basic Building Blocks (our own nomenclature, part 3 of 4 in this series), the basic building blocks of Chinese writing. We will develop our own system of stroke naming convention that is clean without confusing redundancies (overlaps). This article does not require you to know about Chinese writing strokes, but does lead naturally to those basic building blocks.Indexing radicals, a term I semi-coin as an improvement over China's Ministry of Education's terminology, refers to the 201 (main) radicals in the Table of Radicals. They're called ""indexing"" because they're used by dictionaries to help users look up dictionary entries. China's Ministry of Education calls them ""indexing components"" (page 1 of Table of Radicals), but we'll stick with the term ""radicals"" because ""components"" sounds too generic to be easily remembered.From here on, we'll number all indexing radicals according to how the Table of Radicals does (pages 3-5).For example, the indexing radical for '初' (chu1) is '⼑' (dao1, radical 22, also character 18). We'll explain abbreviated radicals, '衤' (radical 117.a) in this case, in a section below. (The character '初' was introduced in the introductory article Learning Chinese: Writing made easy.)(We'll explain abbreviated radicals in a section below. For now, ignore the fact that there are actually more than 201 radicals listed in the Table of Radicals.)Let's get a quick idea of how indexing radicals are used to look up dictionary entries.Using the example we introduced above, the character '初' (chu1) contains an indexing radical '⼑ ' (dao1, radical 22). Using that indexing radical, you can look up the character '初' in a current dictionary like 现代汉语词典.The process to look up a dictionary entry (which I'll write up in detail with an actual dictionary accompanying if you demand it) involves 2 tables:You can check what radical(s) a character is indexed by in a dictionary by looking it up at baike.baidu.com , like for the example above (search for ""部 首"" with 4 spaces between the 2 characters).(We'll explain abbreviated radicals in a section below. You'll easily notice even now that abbreviated radicals, '衤' in this case, are also used as indexes in dictionaries.)Now that we've gotten a rough idea of how indexing radicals serve as keys when looking up dictionary entries, let's see how indexing radicals also logically and cleanly group Chinese characters.How do indexing radicals put characters into ""semantic or thematic groups""? And how are indexing radicals thus semantically significant in character construction?In the next subsection, we'll explain how '初' (""initial, nascent"") is semantically grouped with '刀' (""knife""). Curious? Explore, onward!(We need to know what '衤' stands for. Currently, we only know '刀'.)By now, if you had diligently looked up both radicals especially the '衤' (radical 117.a, page 4 of Table of Radicals, column 1 last entry marked ""[142]""), you'll realize that there seems to be more than 201 radicals in the Table of Radicals.Most of the indented entries (eg. radicals 8.b '⺉', 10.a '亻', 19.a '讠', etc) in the Table of Radicals are what we should term as ""abbreviated radicals"", which I explain in the following. (The rest are Traditional radicals, explained in a later section.)China's Ministry of Education refers to our abbreviated radicals as ""associated indexing components"" (page 1 of Table of Radicals), but let's coin our own term ""abbreviated radicals"" that is more descriptive and memorable. So what exactly are abbreviated radicals and what do they do?Let's look at some actual examples of abbreviated radicals in the following subsections.Space efficiency is the main theme for abbreviated radicals. The radical '衤' (radical 117.a) is efficiently packed to the left of the square space of a Chinese character, such as in '初'. Contrast its space efficiency to that of its indexing radical '衣' (yi1, radical 142). The abbreviated radical has the exact same semantics as its indexing radical: ""clothing"".(So now you know that the beautifully packed form that is abbreviated radical '衤' means ""clothing""!)Slanting is also a transformation to conserve space, like for '⺁' (radical 10.b).In 2 rare cases 亅' (radical 2.a) and '士' (radical 29.a), which are simple (low stroke count) indexing radicals, the associated ""abbreviated radicals"" are actually variants rather than abbreviations.Of particular note is also indexing radical '王' (wang2, radical 61), whose ""abbreviated radical"" '玉' (yu4, radical 99.a) is really a variant form rather than an abbreviated form. In fact, indexing radical '王' can serve as the abbreviated form of character '玉' (character 190). No other confusing exceptions exist (far as I can tell). Let's take a closer, but quick, look at this curious exception.In this special case that is radical 61 '王', we see that this form can serve multiple roles.As an indexing radical, it means ""king"", just like the character it resembles ('王', character 75). This is seen in character '皇' (huang2, ""royal"", character 1571), whose story is ""a king with a crown on top"" ('白' pictorially resembles a crown; semantically it is actually ""white"").As an abbreviated radical, it means ""jade"", because it then becomes an abbreviated form of character '玉' (character 190). This is seen in character '玩' (wan2, ""to play"", character 944). In a time gone by, before the advent of computer games, people may have considered dazzling jade pieces as worthwhile toys.Some indexing radicals are related to more than 1 abbreviated radical each. A commonly encountered set is the abbreviated radicals '⺘' (radical 29.b) and '龵' (radical 80.a) that derive from indexing radical '手' (shou3, radical 80) which means ""hand"".Rather than leave you hanging with that above example ""out of the blue"", I'll complete that detour by illustrating an actual use of one of the abbreviated radicals. The character '看' (kan4, character 1539) consists of abbreviated radical '龵' (radical 80.a) and indexing radical '目' (radical 105). The story: placing your ""hand"" ('龵') over your ""eye"" ('目', mu4), you ""see"" ('看'). (Presumably, you see something in the distance.)At this point, it is also worth reminding you that:As with what we did for indexing radical '刀' (radical 22), we see if '衤' (radical 117.a) puts characters into a semantic or thematic group. Recall that the abbreviated radical '衤' stems from indexing radical '衣' (radical 142) which means ""clothing"".Note also that the Table of Radicals marks abbreviated radical '衤' with a (non-unique!) label ""[142]"", which indicates its stemming from indexing radical 142.Finally, we can deduce how the character '初' is semantically grouped by abbreviated radical '衤'. When a garment ('衤', ""clothing"") is to be created, the initial step is to to cut ('刀', ""knife"") cloth. (We take '衤' to anecdotally relate to ""cloth"".)The character '初' means ""initial, nascent"".The semantic grouping is anecdotal in this case, rather than literal.I mentioned that ""most of"" the indented entries in the Table of Radicals are what we should term as ""abbreviated radicals"". What about the rest of the indented entries?If an indented entry in the Table of Radicals isn't an abbreviated radical, it is a Traditional radical used in Traditional Chinese writing form.I say that Traditional radicals ""morph from"" indexing radicals because we're looking in from the perspective of the Table of Radicals, whose original form is Simplified Chinese. In reality, indexing radicals morphed from Traditional radicals when China promulgated the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme in the 1950s.We don't need to note much else about Traditional radicals, except that Traditional Chinese writing form is more complex (but beautiful) than Simplified Chinese. Traditional Chinese actually plays a crucial role in how we easily learn and memorize Chinese characters, a role I'll discuss in another article (Chinese Writing: Character Construction Strategies).Dictionaries for Traditional Chinese use an appropriately modified version of the Table of Radicals, where all Traditional radicals become indexing radicals by replacing the Simplified Chinese version of indexing radicals.Now that we've looked through all types of radicals in the Table of Radicals, we will need to consider an unspecified type of radical. Let's start with a quick real-life illustration.Here's another example of indexing radicals in action, but with a twist. The character '监' (jian1, character 1883) has the indexing radical '皿' (min3, radical 108). However, the other 2 radicals, the top-left and top-right, are not indexing radicals (nor abbreviated radicals, nor Traditional radicals) so they don't appear in the Table of Radicals. So wait, do I mean that Chinese characters can be built from stuff other then indexing radicals and abbreviated radicals? Yes, but they're still radicals, just another kind!Improvised radicals, a term we have to coin for lack of better handles on this concept, are built from a small and special subset of indexing radicals.Improvised radicals are not found in the Table of Radicals, and are certainly not used as lookup keys in the indexes of dictionaries.Improvised radicals are important to Chinese writing because they contribute semantically to character construction as much as the official radicals (indexing and abbreviated) in the Table of Radicals do. Also, the beauty of the various shapes of Chinese characters demand that artistic strokes deviate at times from the official radicals listed in the Table of Radicals, often for space constraints if not for aesthetics and pictorial clarity.But how are they built? Do we have an example to illustrate why they are used?The first group of indexing radicals, which comprise 1 stroke (page 3 of Table of Radicals, radicals 1 through 5), usually don't contribute semantically to the characters they build. Instead, they are mostly basic building strokes that build up semantically significant structures we call improvised radicals.In the character '监' (jian1, character 1883), the indexing radical '皿' (min3, radical 108) is what we look up in a dictionary to locate the lexical entry for the character. The other radicals are improvised.Presumably, a person looks into a shallow dish of water, indicating self-reflection (introspection). (We'll talk about more about character construction in another article: Chinese Writing: Character Construction Strategies.)The basic building blocks of improvised radicals, in fact of all of Chinese writing, is actually a simple ""7 stroke types"" system that I develop in the next article. While not as simple as I had claimed (and hoped) in the above when I mentioned that just 5 indexing radicals (the single-stroke ones) are used to build improvised radicals, the ""7 stroke types"" system is nonetheless the first one to truly be cleanly functional for learning Chinese writing.We will still term such radicals as improvised radicals, since they occur only in the Table of Characters but not in the Table of Radicals.We've now examined everything to know about radicals. But before we're dive into constructing Chinese characters, please have a quick read about Chinese Writing Strokes: Basic Building Blocks.This article is part 2 of 4 that fully explain the Chinese writing system:",https://miro.medium.com/max/2250/1*Bo2CvZugrYsYyP8Wd12rTQ.png,https://medium.com/swlh/chinese-writing-types-of-radicals-and-their-application-a0d4ed7dc8e3,design,362085e89eaeb9c05e09083f5ad4a6ee0d8a054c674999f45535c569
Strengthen Your Brain and Avoid Memory Loss With the BRIGHT MINDS Approach,"My great-grandmother had Alzheimer's disease. Year by year, she lost parts of herself. First, her acquaintances. Then, her loved ones. And finally, herself. At the end of her life, she had even forgotten how to eat.After she passed away, both sadness and fear seeped into my bones. I didn't want to lose my memories, to lose myself.The problem? I didn't know how to care for my brain.That changed, though, when I came across Dr. Daniel Amen's books. A five-times New York Times Bestselling author, he's famous for his expertise in everything related to the brain.His 2017 book, Memory Rescue: Supercharge Your Brain, Reverse Memory Loss, and Remember What Matters Most, centers on preventing memory-related diseases like Alzheimer's.According to Dr. Amen, around 75% of us will have some sort of memory loss unless we address the ten risk factors that threaten our brain's health.For that purpose, he created the BRIGHT MINDS approach, named as an acronym that lists the risk factors: blood flow, retirement and aging, inflammation, genetics, head trauma, toxins, mental health, immunity and infection issues, neurohormone deficiencies, diabesity, and sleep issues.In this post, I'll go through each of the risk factors, including habits Dr. Amen recommends we introduce into our daily lives to strengthen our brains and avoid memory problems.According to Dr. Amen, ""low blood flow in the brain is the number one predictor of future memory problems."" After all, our blood is what supplies our neurons with nutrients while cleaning out toxins.Pay special attention if you:Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:As people age and retire, they stop learning and lose contact with people. Mental decline follows closely behind.But it doesn't have to be that way. In the words of Dr. Amen, ""if you actively engage your brain in retirement, it can be one of the best times of your life.""Pay special attention if you:Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:When we're injured, our body's natural defenses come to our aid. Nearby areas swell and warm as our immune system fights against bacteria.When this inflammation becomes chronic, though, trouble appears. Over time, it can damage organs and contribute to a wide range of illnesses, including Alzheimer's and dementia.Pay special attention if you:Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:Though it's an unfair burden, some of us have a higher risk of suffering memory-related problems. If, like me, you have a family history of Alzheimer's or dementia, the best thing you can do is to take action as soon as possible.Though genetics can worsen your odds, they don't have the final say. Only you do.Pay special attention if you:Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:As I read this part of the book, I remembered the 2015 movie Concussion, which follows the story of Dr. Bennet Omalu as he unveils the severe brain damage football players suffer due to head injuries.The message is clear: If we don't protect our heads, we'll pay the price later in the form of mental decline. We must remember that though our skulls are hard, our brain is not.Pay special attention if you:Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:Though we have conquered most bacterial infections in our modern world, a new threat has surfaced: toxins.Lead and arsenic from polluted water. BPAs found in plastics and the coating of cash register receipts. Excessive alcohol. Artificial food dyes, preservatives, and sweeteners. Herbicides and pesticides. Health and beauty products with toxic ingredients that are absorbed through the skin. Air pollution.Dr. Amen even goes so far as to include a disturbing fact: ""One of the most effective ways for a woman to decrease her toxic load is through breastfeeding, which decreases the risk of breast cancer. Unfortunately, the baby gets the brunt of it.""These toxins damage the brain by lowering cerebral blood flow, damaging the DNA, disrupting hormones, impairing the immune system, among others. No matter what, we must be on the lookout, minimizing our exposure in whatever way we can.Pay special attention if you:Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:According to research cited in Dr. Amen's book, ""women with three to five depressive symptoms were at 60 percent greater odds for cognitive deterioration, and women with six or more depressive symptoms were 230 percent more likely to have problems."" Without a doubt, anything that hurts your mind also hurts your brain.Pay special attention if you:Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:If you have a weakened immune system or one that attacks itself, then it's essential you take action to improve your immunity. Otherwise, these conditions can increase your risk of brain fog, memory issues, and dementia.Pay special attention if you:Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:When it comes to hormones, the key word is balance. If your thyroid, pancreas, sex organs, and adrenal glands lose it for an extended period, you increase your risk of brain illnesses.For example, when thyroid activity is low, you could suffer depression, irritability, and brain fog.Pay special attention if you:Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:To Dr. Amen, diabesity is the ""double-barreled threat of diabetes and obesity."" Both lead to increased inflammation, depression, Alzheimer's, hypertension, among others. Moreover, ""belly fat turns healthy forms of testosterone into unhealthy, cancer-promoting forms of estrogen.""Pay special attention if you:Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:Sleep is necessary for brain health. According to research cited in Dr. Amen's book, our brains cleanse themselves during sleep. Moreover, chronic insomnia has been linked to an increased risk of death from any cause.Pay special attention if you:Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:After watching my great-grandmother lose her spark, I've learned the importance of caring for our brains. No matter what, we should:Remember: The battle for a healthy brain knows no age or gender. It's universal. So why not try one habit for each BRIGHT MINDS risk factor?At worst, you'll realize it doesn't work for you and try something else. At best, you'll avoid a fate like my great-grandmother's.

"In the Face of Uncertainty, Social Emotional Training Is a Must","By Addison Old""'Hope?' Why is there a question mark after hope?"" I asked Lucy. ""Well, is there even hope anymore?"" she answered.On Jan. 7, the day after protesters stormed the United States Capitol, my fifth graders were continuing a project from the day before, when they chose words to define their new year. Confidence. Flexible. Splendid. Better. Hope. Words to cling to when the school year has been so trying, constantly changing how we are learning, all while watching unprecedented events occur across our nation.On the evening of Jan. 6, I searched social media for ideas from other teachers about how to approach the day's events with elementary students. How do I do this and make sure I'm not sharing a political opinion? What is OK for me to share with students? Will they have heard the news? After talking with my colleagues, I decided to use an open-ended journal prompt to allow students to share how they were feeling and any questions they had. Even after deciding what to do, my mind was racing all night, wondering how to make sure my students' emotional needs were met.With all the challenges of this school year, educators, myself included, are overwhelmed. While navigating health and safety concerns and ever-changing methods of teaching is top of mind for me, my students' social and emotional well-being is even more important. My students wrote in their journals about being worried that our nation was falling apart and mad that people would do such a thing. They questioned if the rioters would have consequences for their actions. During our whole-class discussion, I left my questions open-ended, so students would feel safe asking theirs. I told them that I, too, felt confused about what had transpired. We ended our conversation by agreeing that our words matter; if we share them with the world, they will have an impact. Not for the first time, I wished I had more guidance and understanding to have authentic conversations about traumatic events with my students.Teachers like me need meaningful resources and recurring supports to help identify students facing trauma and how to best support them. In the last few years, I have received some training on how to help students deal with traumatic situations but that was not enough to prepare me to talk with my students about the events that unfolded in Washington. I did not feel equipped with tangible resources and support for students facing traumatic events in the world around them. I needed concrete strategies to support my students in times of crisis.To ensure such programs provide what educators need, they must be tied to a sustainable, recurring funding source. As the 2021 Texas Legislative Session begins, it is essential that lawmakers pass funding measures like House Bill 332 that would allow for compensatory funds to be used for ""implementing social and emotional learning programs."" This would provide school districts with the flexibility to offer high-quality SEL and trauma training to educators.Other efforts must continue as well. This year, to equip teachers with skills for addressing student trauma, the Texas Education Agency began Project Restore in response to the trauma and stress of the COVID-19 pandemic. We need more programs like Project Restore to ensure teachers have a toolbox of strategies to help those students most impacted by the ongoing pandemic and other traumatic events.Even when I did not have all of the facts about the riot at the Capitol, I knew it was important we discussed it as a class. We needed to do so not just for social and emotional reasons but because we had to acknowledge the civics and history lessons behind the unconscionable acts we witnessed. As an educator, I know my students are watching me for clues on how we react to events around us. I must be ready to process these events with them.Our students have endured a lot in the past year. We must respect their need for social and emotional support and provide the necessary training for educators to help our students build endurance and resilience during times of uncertainty. In the meantime, I will continue to model appropriate skills with students like Lucy and do my best to support their needs in the wake of uncertainty.Addison Old teaches 5th grade in Austin, Texas. She is a 2020-21 Texas Policy Fellow.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3058/1*WblL-cCP4a0Xv76gKiOw7w.png,https://medium.com/whats-the-plus/in-the-face-of-uncertainty-social-emotional-training-is-a-must-bb7f2588facd,education,704210f75d77b668a88ac02b96dafcd1c06f40729ece2ab1668f67b0
Beautiful decision tree visualizations with dtreeviz,"Decision trees are a very important class of machine learning models and they are also building blocks of many more advanced algorithms, such as Random Forest or the famous XGBoost. The trees are also a good starting point for a baseline model, which we subsequently try to improve upon with more complex algorithms.One of the biggest advantages of the decision trees is their interpretability - after fitting the model, it is effectively a set of rules that can be used to predict the target variable. That is also why it is easy to plot the rules and show them to stakeholders, so they can easily understand the model's underlying logic. Of course, provided that the tree is not too deep.Visualizing the decision trees can be really simple using a combination of scikit-learn and matplotlib. However, there is a nice library called dtreeviz, which brings much more to the table and creates visualizations that are not only prettier but also convey more information about the decision process.In this article, I will first show the ""old way"" of plotting the decision trees and then introduce the improved approach using dtreeviz.As always, we need to start by importing the required libraries.Then, we load the Iris data set from scikit-learn. We will also go over a regression example, but we will load the Boston housing data set for this later on.The next step involves creating the training/test sets and fitting the decision tree classifier to the Iris data set. In this article, we focus purely on visualizing the decision trees. Thus, we do not pay any attention to fitting the model or finding a good set of hyperparameters (there are a lot of articles on these topics). The only thing that we will ""tune"" is the maximum depth of the tree - we constraint it to 3, so the trees can still fit in the image and remain readable.Now that we have a fitted decision tree model and we can proceed to visualize the tree. We start with the easiest approach - using the plot_tree function from scikit-learn.OK, not bad for a one-liner. But it is not very readable, for example, there are no feature names (only their column indices) or class labels. We can easily improve that by running the following snippet.Much better! Now, we can quite easily interpret the decision tree. It is also possible to use the graphviz library for visualizing the decision trees, however, the outcome is very similar, with the same set of elements as the graph above. That is why we will skip it here, but you can find the implementation in the Notebook on GitHub.Having seen the old way of plotting the decision trees, let's jump right into the dtreeviz approach.The code snippet is pretty much self-explanatory, so we can move on to the outcome. First of all, let's take a moment to acknowledge how big of an improvement it is, especially given that the function call is very similar.Let's go over the plot step by step. At each node, we can see a stacked histogram of the feature that is used for splitting the observations, colored by class. This way, we can see how the classes are segregated by each split. The small triangle with the value at the x-axis is the splitting point. In the first histogram, we can clearly see that all observations of the setosa class have petal length smaller than 2.45 cm.The right branches of the tree indicate selecting the values larger or equal to the splitting value, while the left one lesser than the splitting value. The leaf nodes are represented as pie charts, which show what fraction of the observations within the leaf belongs to which class. This way, we easily see which class is the majority one, so also the model's prediction.One thing we do not see at this plot is the value of the Gini coefficient at each node. In my opinion, the histogram provides more intuition about the split and the value of the coefficient might not be that relevant in case of a presentation for the stakeholders either way.Note: We can also create a similar visualization for the test set, we just need to replace the x_data and y_data arguments while calling the function.If you are not a fan of the histograms and want to simplify the plot, you can specify fancy=False to receive the following simplified plot.Another handy feature of dtreeviz which improves the model's interpretability is path highlighting of a particular observation on the plot. This way, we clearly see which features contributed to the class prediction.Using the snippet below, we highlight the path of the first observation of the test set.The plot is very similar to the previous one, however, the orange highlight clearly shows which path the observation followed. Additionally, we can see the orange triangle at each of the histograms. It represents the indicated observation's value of the given feature. At the very end, we see the values of all the features of this observation, with the ones used for decision highlighted in orange. In this case, only two features were used for predicting that the observation belongs to the versicolor class.Tip: We can also change the orientation of the plots from top-to-bottom to left-to-right by setting orientation=""LR"". We do not show it in this article, as the charts will not be scaled that nicely for devices with a narrower screen.Lastly, we can print the decisions used for this observation's prediction in plain English. To do so, we run the following command.This way, we can clearly see the conditions that this observation fulfills.We have already covered a classification example, which showed most of the interesting functionalities of the library. But for completeness' sake, we also go over an example of a regression problem, to show how the plots differ. We use another popular data set - the Boston housing one. It's a problem in which we use a set of different areas to predict the median housing price within certain areas of Boston.The code already feels similar. The only change is that we added show_node_labels = True. It can be especially handy for larger decision trees. So while discussing the plot with a group, it is very easy to indicate which split we are discussing by the node's number.Let's dive into the differences between classification trees and regression ones. This time, instead of looking at histograms, we inspect scatterplots of the feature used for the split vs. the target. On those scatterplots, we see some dashed lines. Their interpretation is as follows:In the leaf nodes, the dashed line shows the mean of the target within the leaf, which is also the model's prediction.We already showed that we can highlight the decision path for a certain observation. We can take it a step further and only plot the nodes used for that prediction. We do so by specifying show_just_path=True. The following plot shows only the selected nodes from the tree above.In this article, I showed how to use the dtreeviz library for creating elegant and insightful visualizations of decision trees. Having played around with it for a bit, I will definitely keep on using it as the go-to tool for visualizing decision trees. I do believe that the plots created using this library are much easier to understand for people who do not work with ML on a daily basis and can help in conveying the model's logic to the stakeholders.It is also worth mentioning that dtreeviz supports some visualizations for XGBoost and Spark MLlib trees.You can find the code used for this article on my GitHub.

What is AI? Everything you need to know about Artificial Intelligence,"The presence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more ubiquitous as large companies like Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, etc. are continually deploying Artificial Intelligence related solutions that interact with users every day.When properly applied to business problems, these Artificial Intelligence related solutions can provide unique solutions that create a significant impact for businesses and users.Artificial Intelligence, the name itself explains its definition. Natural Intelligence is intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Artificial Intelligence is intelligence displayed by machines, which is not natural.Technical Definition of Artificial Intelligence,""Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.""Many use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning(ML) interchangeably. This isn't right. Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.As you can know from the image, Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI and Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning.Machine LearningThe name itself explains its definition, Machine Learning (Machine Learns). Machine Learning is the art of the study of algorithms that learn from examples and experiences.Technical Definition of Machine Learning,""Algorithms that parse data, learn from that data, and then apply what they've learned to make informed decisions.""Machine Learning algorithms are programmed to constantly be learning in a way that simulates as a virtual personal assistant. Machine Learning is based on the idea that there exist some patterns in the data that were identified and used for future predictions. Machine Learning involves a lot of complex math and coding.Machine Learning is like if you had a flashlight that turned on whenever you say ""it's dark"", it would recognize and turn on the flashlight. With continuous learning, it might turn on with any phrase containing the word ""dark"".The most popular real-world example of Machine Learning is Netflix. Netflix uses Machine Learning to the fullest.Machine Learning gives the platform the ability to automate millions of decisions based on user activities. Netflix recommends the same genre movies based on your activity using Machine Learning. This suggestion is the Netflix recommendation engine at work, it uses your past activity and returns movies.Netflix doesn't use recommendation methods, because recommendation engines don't allow for Personalization. Netflix uses the Personalized method where movies are suggested to the user who is most likely to enjoy them based on metrics like major actors or genre. Netflix uses Machine Learning to implement this Personalized method.Machine Learning can create ""smart"" platforms because it uses probability to discover the likelihood of a user liking a product.ML algorithms provide you with everything you want. Netflix also previews images you're seeing on your feed. If you previously liked romance movies, your feed will have preview images of scenes with actors embracing each other.Netflix uses the watching history of other users with similar tastes to recommend what you may be interested in watching next so that you get engaged and continue your monthly subscription.Deep LearningDeep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. Deep Learning doesn't mean the machine learns in-depth, it means that the machine uses different layers to learn from the data.The depth of the model is represented by the number of layers in the model. For instance, the Google LeNet model for image recognition counts 22 layers.In Deep Learning, the learning phase is done through an ""Artificial Neural Network"". The Neural network is an architecture where the layers are stacked on top of each other. The design of the Neural Network is inspired by the biological neural network of the human brain.The most popular real-world example of Deep Learning is AlphaGo.AlphaGo has its neural network, it has sharp intellect and intuition. AlphaGo created quite a stir when it defeated multiple world-renowned ""masters"" of the game. The machine could grasp complex techniques and abstract aspects of the game.Another example of Deep Learning that we use daily is a Mobile Camera. In every smartphone, the camera can predict a person's age, gender. And also few smartphone cameras can react to a voice like cheese, facial expressions like when you smile, and body language like when you place your palm in front of the camera. Face Recognition locks are also an example of Deep Learning. These are all developed using Convolutional Neural Network, a class of Deep Neural Networks.Artificial Intelligence vs Machine LearningMost of our smartphone, daily devices, and even the internet uses Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is the science of training machines to perform human tasks. It is a computer that is given human-like properties.Machine Learning is a distinct subset of Artificial Intelligence that trains a machine on how to learn. Machine Learning models look for patterns in data and try to conclude. In a nutshell, the machine doesn't need to be explicitly programmed by people. The programmer gives some examples and the machine is going to learn what to do from those samples.Machine Learning vs Deep LearningDeep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. Machine Learning and Deep Learning functions similarly, but their capabilities are different.Machine Learning models progressively become better and better at whatever their function is, still they need some guidance. If an ML algorithm returns an inaccurate prediction, then an engineer has to step in and make adjustments.With a Deep Learning model, the algorithm can determine on its own if a prediction is accurate or not through its neural network.Let's go back to the flashlight example described in Machine Learning. If the flashlight is programmed using Deep Learning algorithms, then it should turn on with words like ""I can't see"" etc. Deep Learning models can learn through their method of computing - a technique that makes it seem like it has its brain.Types of Artificial IntelligenceReactive AI MachineThis is the oldest form of AI. This type of AI has limited capacity. These machines do not have memory-based functionality i.e these machines cannot ""learn"".A popular example of a Reactive AI machine is IBM's Deep Blue.Limited Memory AI MachineThese machines are capable of learning from historical data to make decisions. Nearly, all existing AI applications we know today come under this category.All present-day AI systems, those using Deep Learning are trained by a large volume of training data that they store in their memory to form a reference model for solving future problems.Chatbots, Virtual Assistants, Self-Driving Vehicles are all driven by Limited Memory AI.Theory of MindThis is the next level AI system that researchers are currently engaged in innovating.The Theory of Mind level AI will better understand the entities it is interacting with by recognizing their needs, beliefs, emotions, and thought processes.Self-AwareThis type of AI currently exists only hypothetically. Self-Aware (which is self-explanatory) is an AI that is similar to the human brain, which develops self-awareness.This type of AI will not be able to understand and evoke emotions in those it interacts with, but it has emotions, beliefs, needs, and desires of its own.This is the type of AI that the doomsayers of the technology are cautious of. The development of Self-aware can boost our progress rapidly, but it can also lead to a catastrophe. The AI would also be capable of having ideas like self-preservation which may directly or indirectly be an end for humanity.The alternate system of classification that is generally used in the technology is,Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).Image Source: Types of AIThis type of AI represents all the existing AI including even the most complicated and capable AI that has been created to date.This refers to AI systems that can only perform a specific task autonomously using human-like capabilities. These machines do nothing more than what they are programmed to do, thus have a very limited or narrow range of capabilities.These systems correspond to all the Reactive and Limited Memory AI. Most of the complex AI that uses ML and DL that teaches itself falls under this category.2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)AGI can learn, perceive, understand, and function completely as a human being.These systems will be able to independently build multiple competencies and form connections and generalizations across domains, massively cutting down on the time needed for training.This AI will make AI systems just as capable as humans by replicating our multi-functional capabilities.These systems correspond to the Theory of Mind AI.3. Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)The development of ASI will be the pinnacle of AI research.AGI will become the most capable form of Intelligence on earth. ASI, additionally, will be exceedingly better at everything they do because of greater memory, faster data processing and analysis, and decision-making capabilities.While having such powerful machines is appealing, these machines may also threaten our existence or at least our way of life.These systems correspond to the Self-aware AI.Powerful examples of AI in use todayOpenAI has come up with a breakthrough language generator GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which is a successor of GPT-2.GPT-3 is the most significant language model ever.Different features of GPT-3 are,Like every other system, there are disadvantages too.Some of the use cases of GPT-3 in action can be seen here.GPT-3 is great at combining text that it has found somewhere else on the web making it a sort of huge varied scrapbook made from a vast number of bits of text that it points together in unusual and impressive manners on request.You can use GPT-3 by submitting a request at debuild.co.A most successful use case of GPT-3 here.There's one more powerful example of AI used today i.e Microsoft's Sketch2Code AI, using which you can convert handwriting drawings (wireframes) to working HTML prototypes.Future of AIToday, approximately 52% of users around the world use AI-powered technologies. Even the most sophisticated AI technologies lack factors like Emotional Intelligence and the ability to contextualize information like human-beings. This is the reason why AI has not succeeded in taking over a major aspect of our careers and lives.Therefore, infusing emotions into AI is the next milestone technologists wish to accomplish.What is Artificial Emotional Intelligence?Artificial Emotional Intelligence is a combination of Emotional Intelligence (EI) and AI. It can recognize the emotions of oneself and others and guide using our thought processes and behavior.Although AI is a technology created to assist humans and help them, it still lacks a cognitive quotient.How the integration of EI with AI is beneficial?In several aspects of our lives, AI has made our lives simpler. Machines and robots are already used in the manufacturing and production departments of various companies. Also, AI is changing the game in various fields like aviation, education, marketing, finance, heavy industries, medicine, media, and customer service.Infusing EI with AI is a more complex process.Artificial Emotional Intelligence is projected to grow into a multi-billion dollar industry, completely transforming industries, market research, innovation, Research & Development, and many more.Pros and Cons of AIProsConsAI in any field leads to unemployment. The aim of AI in any field shouldn't be to replace humans but should make their jobs easier.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2406/0*aU_C2_IUUbN7okMt,https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence-3cad0fb5ca39,artificial-intelligence,806898b12adb67007043243740301b3360ad8b1775c46de59144b401
Travelling.,"The truth is we understand the world through our environmental perception. We have a certain idea of what the world is, how it works, how people act, how we should live, who we should be - but that's the beauty of it, it's only an idea. And it's not even ours.We tend to live in a bubble, with races, religions, cultures, habits we encountered while growing up. Travelling bursts this bubble. It helps us evolve and grow as people, as cliché as it may be.When we travel, we not only discover new, amazing, beautiful places (either in a huge metropolitan city or on a warm sandy beach), but along the way we encounter people of different racial and ethnical backgrounds. We are consequently exposed to different views on lives than our own. And the more we get exposed, the more compassionate we become. More compassionate we are, kinder we become, and instantly more compelling and irresistible to others.We become more aware of our surroundings. Less inclined to get bothered by small, irrelevant things, because we've experienced something greater. The realization starts to sink in that we are only 1 individual amongst 7.8 billion people. How crazy is this? There are people in the world, that exist now, in this moment, we haven't even met yet. Do you know how many open opportunities this means? You may yet have to meet your perfect partner, your closest friends, your companion in life.Through travelling we see the world for more than it is. We see the struggles others face, but also the moments they enjoy. Through them we discover beauty, to our eyes before unseen. Through them we appreciate even the smallest gestures, as a hug or a touch of the hand, for they make the person in front of us real.We share a piece of us with everyone we meet. And they share a piece of themselves with us. Sometimes it can be the simplest thing, a chuckle over a shared bottle of gin, or it can be something much bigger, like giving our hearts to them. But all these moments, they make for the most intimate memories. They belong to only the people we shared them with, they connect us.It's true, we touch people's lives without even realising it. Maybe some haven't had a possibility to travel, and meeting us, foreigners, means a great deal to them. Maybe it gives them hope to do the same, who knows?Every person we meet is essentially special and unique, but underneath we are all only humans. Travellers with good intentions can have an utmost positive effect on people around them.Travelling teaches us humility, gratitude, acceptance. Through travelling, we find ourselves. We grow without even realizing.The places we see might be beautiful, but it's the people that make it special and memorable.If you enjoyed this article, feel free to follow for more stories!Reading suggestions:",https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/1*t5QvNAFTr5c4aD17Rqhjlg.jpeg,https://medium.com/curious/traveling-9a2cad922d49,travel,852709dce95dff19371cfa74142a75811d08633f9f79f85112782178
The C-Suite - Cost Measurement in Online Advertising,"Cost Measurement can be one of the more bewildering aspects of the online advertising industry. There are just so many acronyms to learn. The alphabet soup wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact they all looked so similar: CPA, CPI, CPE, CPC, CPM, eCPM, and so forth.And all of the different costing methods are calculated differently and used in different situations.This article is going to give you a thorough introduction to the different cost measurements in online advertising and the various situations in which each might be used.We will also look at how we can compare the performance of different cost measurements using ""eCPM"" or ""Effective Cost per Mille.""So, whether you're working in digital advertising or are just curious about these acronyms you keep seeing, you're in the right place.Let's start by breaking down the acronyms. These are the major measurements of cost in online advertising: CPM, CPC, CPA, CPI, CPE, and eCPM.Don't worry if you've never seen the word ""Mille"" before; it's the Latin word for 1,000 (fun fact: this is the origin of the English word ""mile"").So Cost per Mille is the cost that an advertiser would pay per 1,000 page views.Example: An advertiser pays $10,000 for 4,000,000 views. To calculate the CPM, you divide the cost by the number of views and multiply it by 1000.So, in this case:Our CPM would be $2.5A variation of CPM called eCPM is the most popular way of benchmarking multiple cost measurement models. We'll cover eCPM later and go over a few examples of its calculation.This kind of cost measurement is extremely common, and its name is rather self-explanatory. It's the cost to the advertiser divided by the number of clicks received.If an advertiser pays $10,000 and receives 5,000 clicks, then his CPC would be calculated like this.In this case, CPC would be $2.These are the most basic means of measuring ad spend online, but there are many more that are ""performance-based.""CPA is a cost measurement based on the acquisition, rather than on a per-view or per-click basis. In the case of CPM or CPC, the potential customer could very well click on a site, but not go any further.If a company is trying to acquire users or registrations or make sales directly, then they aren't going to be very happy unless their ad campaign actually results in these. A CPA cost basis allows advertisers to pay for performance.That is to say, they only pay when an acquisition occurs, be it the purchase of a product or the registration of a new user. Many advertisers are significantly more comfortable with this kind of cost basis and it is the default for affiliate marketing.How is CPA calculated? It's quite simple. If an advertiser wants to drive registrations and he spends $10,000 and receives 1000 registrations, then the calculation is:CPA in this case would be $10.CPI is a widespread cost measurement in the mobile advertising world, where many of the advertisers are trying to drive App installs. Much like CPA, this performance-based cost model allows advertisers to spend only on success, rather than paying by view or click. Models which aren't guaranteed to drive installs, even if money is spent.The formula here is similar to the CPA formula. Strictly speaking CPI is CPA where the Action is an install.So in this case CPI would be $20.N.B.: An ""Install"" in a CPI campaign is Intall + Open. So the action is only completed when the user actually opens the app.Cost per Engagement can mean one of two things. In general online advertising, it is the cost per engagement with an AD. This is slightly more qualified than CPM (i.e., the ad was interacted with rather than just viewed), but less qualified than CPC (engagements will almost always be higher than clicks). In this case, CPE is the cost per engagement with the ad.As mobile advertising continues to take off, it is important to understand another form of Cost per Engagement.CPE is likely the most nebulous and difficult to understand of the various cost measurements. One of the reasons that it can be so difficult to understand is the fact that what ""Engagement"" means can vary by case. This is because mobile advertising engagement is defined by an event that occurs after an application is installed.Paying by engagement, at its base level, is a way to go even further with performance advertising. Let's take a look at when one would use CPE.Take an app, for example. Maybe the developer has run a CPI campaign before, but he realized that only a small percentage (say, 10%) registered to use the application after install. The rest either forget about it or uninstalled it shortly after installation.If the developer wanted to pay exclusively for people that not only install the app but then register and use it once, he could launch a CPE campaign. Any user that got past registration or initial setup would be considered ""engaged,"" and that's what the developer would pay for.So our CPE in this case would be $16.67.Different cost measurements are used for different situations and to meet different goals.CPA, CPI and CPE are very common ways of running campaigns for developers and mobile app companies that are trying to build a mobile audience. If someone just sees the add, that doesn't do them much good, since they can only make money if the app is used.So these mobile-focused businesses are much happier to use something performance-based like Cost per Install or Cost per Engagement. That way, their risk is mitigated, and they only pay for users that actually download and test the app.These performance metrics are often used on the demand side, where the advertiser is concerned exclusively with the result.Publishers, on the other hand, are only concerned with the revenue generated per page view or per ad served. Therefore they are typically concerned exclusively with eCPM.An issue that advertisers began to run into as they moved onto more developed, performance-based cost measurement systems, is that their results were difficult to compare.It's hard to objectively see if a CPC of $4 is better or worse than a CPI of $8 or a CPE of $17. They're just too difficult to compare because they use different pricing methods.But they do need to be comparable.Otherwise, it is significantly more challenging to determine which campaigns are performing the best if they're being run using different standards of cost measurement.This is where eCPM comes in. eCPM stands for ""Effective Cost per Mille"" or the effective cost per 1000 views. eCPM can be calculated from any of the above-stated cost measurements.Example 1 CPI to eCPMLet's say an app is being advertised on a CPI basis. To calculate we need the CPI, the total number of installs, and the number of people that viewed the ad in the measured period of time.Say, the app was installed 100 times at a CPI of $5, and 500,000 people saw the ad itself. The formula to be used in this case is:So eCPM for this CPI campaign would be $1.Remember, it's multiplied by one thousand because we're looking at units of 1000 views.Example 2 CPE to eCPMNow let's try CPE to eCPM. Say the measurement of engagement is an in-app purchase after a mobile application is installed.If a given campaign has a CPE of $18, 400 engagements, and 2.2 million views, its eCPM would be calculated like so:So eCPM for this campaign would be $3.27Example 3 CPA to eCPMBy now, you're probably starting to get a pretty good handle on how eCPM is calculated. One last example, just to be sure.Say a company has a CPA campaign. And their CPA is $4, the number of acquisitions is 150, and the number of pageviews is 410,000.So the eCPM for this campaign would be $1.46.While advertisers might focus on performance-based payment models, publishers are only concerned with eCPM. Why? Because eCPM is the most accurate way to look at the real revenue generated by traffic.How the ad is being paid for further up the line isn't consequential to the publisher. He just wants to see what he is getting paid per thousand views he draws.In our three examples of eCPM calculated from CPI, CPE, and CPA, which of the three campaigns would be the most profitable for a publisher?That would be Example 2, the CPE campaign that resulted in an eCPM of $3.27, significantly higher than the eCPM of the other two campaigns.For a publisher, this second campaign would be significantly more profitable.Conversion flow and its relation to cost is rather logical, at least once understood.What is it? Conversion Flow is simply the number of steps that have to be completed before an ad counts as converting. For example, the Conversion Flow for a CPI campaign would go View > Click > Install.A CPE campaign, on the other hand, has a longer Conversion Flow: View > Click > Install > Post-install Engagement.So, as you can see, the Conversion Flow of a CPE campaign will always be longer than a CPI campaign, because of this the price will be (potentially significantly) higher.So keep in mind that the longer the conversion flow, the high the cost per conversion in a performance-based campaign.Now you should have a pretty good understanding of the basic terminology used in describing cost in online advertising.The different measurements of cost form a considerable part of the online advertising vocabulary. So a deep understanding of them is necessary if you want to understand what's going on.Now, though, the next time you run into a table full of acronyms and numbers, you'll be ready to parse it without fear.Lastly, an important thing to remember is that all of these different means of pricing and costing a campaign exist because they are useful in different circumstances and with different clients. But it is Effective Cost per Mille that is the most useful for cross-campaign comparison and analysis. And it is undoubtedly the most important metric for publishers.Mobinner is a High-Performance DSP that allows you to build, launch, run, and analyze campaigns that drive engagement and growth for your business.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1536/1*LOKjHyfIyE32MglyHmhl_w.jpeg,https://medium.com/mobinner/the-c-suite-cost-measurement-in-online-advertising-63b1b24fc116,marketing,875247b6b47bac6453b7d6ce48d4f0e314ca9aca29014778251f9d37
3 Ways To Boost Efficiency for a Freelancer,"I am a freelancer since 2016, working mostly in digital marketing. During those years, I went through many ups and downs in my work efficiency.I remember a 20-years-old version of me when I couldn't organize myself, so I was ""working"" whole days with trembling hands from too much caffeine.As a 22-year old, I started creating highly complicated plans, mostly in google sheets - charts, progress bars, conditional functions, reminders, data from other sources, etc. It ended up sitting each morning for up to 40 minutes filling all the data.There was also a time where I tried to control everything with obsessive time-management, which took all my spontaneity and made me live like a robot.I tried almost every method to boost efficiency that you can google - most of them are useless or even destructive, e.g., over-planning or other complications. Using my experience, I can boil it down to three (hopefully) useful essentials to boost freelance efficiency.Time-tracking is a ""must-have"" to all freelancers, in my opinion. Why? The majority of us working from home, and it's easy to get lost without that data.There are various free apps to track the time, e.g., most popular, Clockify.How to set up time tracking?It's very simple - you have to create few projects depend on your work. In my case, these are like: ""Writing and editing,"" ""Ebook and its marketing,"" ""Internet Marketing,"" ""Building a Personal Brand,"" and ""Copywriting.""After setting projects, you have to develop a habit to start the timer on the chosen app and stop it immediately when you get completely distracted. That is what you can call a ""productivity session.""The most famous technique of this kind is the ""Pomodoro technique"":In one of my articles, I defended the argument that the key to increasing productivity is a break, where, e.g., I linked the study of the Draugiem Group, which tells us that:It's better to keep data and goals in a simple form to stay efficient.How to create such a spreadsheet? Looking simple, but there is some basic formatting:The size of elements depends on your resolutions, but in my case, cells: C and D, E and F, G and H, are connected.Money and Hourly rates values are format to ""American dollar.""Hours are format to ""Number"" with an additional cell formatting:You have to enter a proper X (minutes) and Y (hours) values to get formatted time to a number.Finally, a violet place is for goals, so money goal, hours goal, and rate goal is a great way to challenge yourself and be motivated by a daily % progress. Each cell is formatted in a way, e.g., =SUM(C8/2000)The simple spreadsheet will cover all the data without any other distractions. All you have to do is tracking your working time, as I explained above, and filling the data from time to time. The connection of clear spreadsheets and time-tracking creates a great organizational system to develop work.For me, two hours after waking up determine the productivity of the day.I organized many weekly challenges for myself with specific goals, for example, ""amount of productive time"" in a week, and found out that the days where I started working two hours after waking up are generally way more productive.Why it's important? Because when we adopt a given lifestyle (and we should), we start to live up to a cycle. There is the point where we wake up and go to sleep that we shouldn't change to keep our biological clock working well.The days where I waste the morning are pretty normal until I realize that.Then I start running, trying to recover from wasted time, thinking that the day will be bad anyway. As a result, I'm overwhelmed by tasks and duties, which leads to unnecessary anxiety, stress, and procrastination.That's why I often try to do as much as I can within two hours after waking up, even If I'm a barely living zombie. That often includes basic activities like reading the mail, answering comments/direct messages, and organizing social media, but at least I don't start the day with a negative handicap.Being a freelancer is not as easy as many people think.It requires developing systems and routines to stay on the right track. We are independent - there is no boss, no parents, not even colleagues, as Mel Robbins put it wonderfully:Time management and datasheets are crucial to staying efficient by measuring our work's effect and seeing what works and what is not.I also recommend challenging yourself from time to time, e.g., trying to reach 50 ""productive hours"" in a given week. It's quite important because, as a freelancer, we often don't have the outside motivation to push forward.Join my free newsletter and get three simple ways to increase readership",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/1*2kvCL1MCCLEobg9MeGXpiA.jpeg,https://jakemura.medium.com/3-ways-to-boost-efficiency-for-a-freelancer-fb8b3e30b91a,productivity,883086f582c3d5852275a69e85b482e1c8b9239d55883463d47a868a
Using MapQuest API to Get Geo Data,"Knowing how to deal with geographic data is a must-have for a data scientist. In this post, we will play around with the MapQuest Search API to get zip codes from street addresses along with their corresponding latitude and longitude to boot!In 2019, my friends and I participated in CivTechSA Datathon. At one point in the competition, we wanted to visualize the data points and overlay them on San Antonio's map. The problem is, we had incomplete data. Surprise! All we had were a street number and a street name - no zip code, no latitude, nor longitude. We then turned to the great internet for some help.We found a great API by MapQuest that will give us exactly what we needed. With just a sprinkle of Python code, we were able to accomplish our goal.Today, we're going to walk through this process.To follow along, you can download the data from here. Just scroll down to the bottom tab on over to the Data Catalog 2019. Look for SAWS (San Antonio Water System) as shown below.Download the file by clicking on the link to the Excel file.OR, you can click on this.Head on over to https://developer.mapquest.com/ and create an account to get a free API key.Copy the 'Consumer Key' and keep it in a safe place. We'll need it later.Now, let's fire up a Jupyter notebook and get coding!For starters, let's set up the environment by doing a couple of imports.Don't forget to replace the API_KEY (line#12) with your own key above.Now. let's read the Excel file with a simple df = pd.read_excel().Next, we'll combine the street number and street name columns.The ALL CAPS hurts my eyes. Let's do something about it:Below are two functions that call the API and returns geo data.We can manually call it with the line below. Don't forget to replace the '#####' with your own API key. You can use any address you want (replace spaces with a + character).But we've got many addresses, so we'll use a loop to call the API repeatedly.Let's see what the result looks like:Finally, let's create a dataframe that will house the street addresses - complete with zip code, latitude, and longitude.Voila! We've got ourselves geo data.For extra credit, let's import the data in Tableau and get a pretty spiffy visual:And that's it, folks!You can find the jupyter notebook here.Thanks for stopping by and reading my post.

Synesthesia: Why Some People Can See Sound or Hear Color,"Imagine living in a world where the letters of the alphabet have specific colors, the sound of music is visible, certain words have a particular taste, or colors are audible.This is the weird world a certain group of people called synesthetes live in. Synesthetes account for about 4% of the world's population therefore it's fairly rare to encounter one.The fact that synesthetes can experience the world from a different perspective grants them a significant advantage; that of enhanced creativity and other forms of intelligence, though this is not definite.Synesthesia is a condition where the brain mixes up the senses- and one sensory modality causes a simultaneous stimulation of another. For example, a person with synesthesia may ""hear color"" or ""see sound.""Synesthesia involves any of the five senses. The most common form is that of colored letters and numbers, in which someone always sees a certain color in response to a letter of the alphabet or a number. For instance, a synesthete might see the number 7 as light blue, 4 as purple, or the word ""sky"" as dark grey.Synesthesia can involve other sensory overlaps such as hearing sounds in response to smell, smelling something in response to touch, or feeling something in response to sight.Some forms of synesthesia encompass more than two senses at the same time. In theory, there can be as many synaesthetic experiences as there are possible combinations of sensory or perceptual experiences.Remarkably, people have reported synaesthetic experiences that involve pattern recognition, spatial orientation, or emotions in response to certain stimuli. Therefore, synesthesia is not confined to the five human senses.One unique thing about the synaesthetic experience is that it is specific to each person. For instance, if one synesthete thinks the letter ""p"" is yellow, the same letter might be viewed as orange by another synesthete.The unique variations in the synaesthetic experiences make it somewhat difficult to study. For years, scientists have sought to understand the neural mechanisms responsible for this incredible experience. New research is seeking to dissect the phenomenon to the core to help us learn how our brains work.For a long time, synesthesia was confused for an overreactive imagination, confusing memories for perceptions or taking metaphorical speech far too literally.However, studies have confirmed that the phenomenon is biological, automatic, and unlearned; distinct from both hallucination and metaphor.Modern behavioral, brain-imaging and molecular tools continue to provide new frontiers in uncovering the mechanisms that drive the synaesthetic experience.A good starting point is to understand how the human brain is organized to achieve basic roles of perception and cognition.The human brain is divided into specific regions that interpret different stimuli.The definite mechanism of synesthesia is still poorly understood. But there is evidence that the cross-talk between various sensory pathways accounts for the experience.For example, with the help of brain imaging techniques, the brain's region responsible for color recognition can be seen activated when a sound-to-color synesthete is presented with auditory stimuli.The primary visual cortex, on the other hand, isn't activated even though the synaesthete is experiencing color perception, something that should activate the visual cortex. The explanation is that the two different regions in the brain were wired to interact directly.This means that when a synaesthete experiences stimuli along one cognitive pathway, another pathway activates as well causing an involuntary sensory experience.There is an interesting theory, called the neonatal synesthesia hypothesis, which posits that we are all born synaesthetic, with all the connections between senses but lose them as our brains mature. Synaesthetes retain these connections together with the synaesthetic experience.The implication of this theory can be quite bizarre and controversial. That would mean that at some point when we were very young, we might have been able to see sounds or hear certain colors!A journal published in PubMed seeks to provide the first evidence for this infant-synaesthesia hypothesis. It shows that the presence of particular shapes influences color preferences in typical 2 and 3-month-olds, but not in 8-month-olds or adults. The hypothesis is still under further investigation.Acquired forms of synaesthesia have also been reported but these are related to the use of hallucinogenic drugs or neurological conditions such as epileptic seizures. They are therefore considered pathologic and should not be confused with true synesthesia.I know you're probably wondering what goes on in the mind of a synesthete amidst all the noise, colors, numbers, and words they have to over-interpret. They must be uncomfortable having their alternative senses triggered by the most minute stimuli.Don't they experience a sensory overload?Well, most synesthetes assert that the condition is not a problem for them. They report that the alternative sensations are experienced deep within ""the mind's eye"" and therefore it isn't a cause for concern.However, a certain population of synesthetes may experience the sensations prominently, such as seeing visions of sound as if it's projected outside the body. This kind of experience may result in sensory overload and exhaustion.All in all, synaesthetes treasure their unique abilities and consider it a bonus sense- one that they'd rather have.""If you ask synesthetes if they'd wish to be rid of it, they almost always say no,"" says Simon Baron-Cohen, Ph.D., who studies synesthesia at the University of Cambridge. ""For them, it feels like that's what normal experience is like. To have that taken away would make them feel like they were being deprived of one sense.""From a medical perspective, despite being referred to as a ""neurological condition"" by some neurologists, synesthesia is not a disease. It's not associated with cognitive or mental disabilities.In fact, synesthetes normally perform better in memory tests than average persons and tend to be more creative. Their built-in capabilities are to their advantage. For example, seeing colors when hearing musical notes can help to achieve the perfect pitch.Once thought to be uncommon, synesthesia is now estimated to be very common. Furthermore, many forms of synesthesia are continually being identified signifying how prevalent the experience might be.But what does this tell us about our past or future evolution?To begin with, the neonatal synesthesia hypothesis(if it's true) may indicate that at some point in the course of their evolution, all human beings may have been synaesthetes.This is comparable to the presence of a tail- during human embryonic development - which regresses after some time to become the coccyx. During evolution, human beings acquired an upward stance and the tail would have been a nuisance in that type of locomotion, but the evidence of a tail still persists in embryonic development.The difference with synaesthesia is that it has actually been conserved in part of the human population. A paper published in PLoS Biology explores how this may have occurred, and the possible implications on human evolution.One explanation for its conservation would be that synesthesia is a hereditary genetic trait, rather than an abnormality or mutation. Though its genetic basis hasn't been proven, synesthesia appears to run in families. Yet, the form in which its expressed within the family members differs, suggesting that a single gene doesn't exist for synesthesia.Now, for something to persist in the human genome, it would have to have a beneficial effect, no matter how elusive(like the sickle cell anemia gene's correlating resistance to malaria). Everything else is cut out by nature's evolution scalpel.What then is the positive value of synesthesia?Numerous theories posit that synesthesia has a beneficial effect on an individual's creativity and ability to understand metaphor. But the recent research disputes this as the reason. Creativity by itself is not a tool for survival.The way evolution works is that it favors the succession of genes that support the most basic needs of a species; survival and procreation.The new paper points out that synesthesia has some benefits in terms of sensory processing and in particular, memory. Having increased cognitive abilities does have a direct biological benefit, whether it's being able to better identify the difference between edible and poisonous berries in the wild, or having an increased ability to notice trends in the stock market!The research stands to highlight the fact that even supposedly ""fringe"" phenomena like synesthesia offer valuable information about the pressures that shaped the development of our minds.The human mind is by itself an entire universe. The number of subtle differences that make us so unique is quite remarkable.Traits like synesthesia provide a canvas to push the boundaries and explore the mind from a magnificent perspective. Whatever the case, it's impressive what the next frontier of human evolution will entail, with the ever-changing needs for basic survival.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10828/0*jhzJMgHcZ9Ehq1YS,https://medium.com/predict/synesthesia-why-some-people-can-see-sound-or-hear-color-c6f5b53cd5c2,neuroscience,977265e189263acf70759a25024dc34c23dac6b28ce12830a08ee246
DNA in Your Brain Could Reveal What Makes You Human,"The human race is, in my eyes, fascinating. Our species, Homo sapiens, descended from primates, yet we have evolved so much. It begs the question: what makes us so different from our close relatives, the apes?At first glance, the solution seems simple. Just compare the DNA sequences of humans and apes and observe where we diverged, right? Wrong. We share over 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees, one of our closest relatives, and among the differences that do exist, many of them may have no effect on making us human. This problem has led scientists to support an alternate hypothesis: what makes us human isn't simply our gene sequence, but how we regulate which ones are expressed.Not all of the genes encoded in our DNA are expressed, so if humans and apes share almost all of their DNA, then maybe how our genes are regulated (i.e. when, where, and how strongly genes are expressed) is what sets us apart. This is where it gets tricky. It's been an ongoing challenge for researchers to find the exact location of 'gene dimmers', or regulatory elements that have been positively selected throughout the evolution of mankind.'Positive selection' is an extremely important part of this challenge. Elements that have been positively selected are things that started as a genetic mutation but eventually became standard in a population as organisms with the mutation survived and reproduced more often. Gene dimmers that have been positively selected are the ones that researchers want to study.For years, scientists who wanted to study the relationship between humans and apes have had a list of challenges (like the ones above) but no solution. That is, until now.Researchers at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) and the University of Lausanne, both located in Lausanne, Switzerland, have come up with a new way of identifying large regions of these positively selected gene regulators in the brain. Jialin Liu, the lead author of this study, says,Let's look at what they did and why we should care.The group of researchers' new method of finding gene regulatory regions in the brain uses a machine learning model, specifically a support vector machine (SVM) for those interested. To train the ML model, the researchers provided experimental data on how strongly different transcription factors (proteins involved in gene regulation) bind to their corresponding regions of DNA in different tissues from around the body. This data was gathered using a technique called ChIP-sequencing, which lets us observe the interactions between protein and DNA. After training the model, they performed the following three steps to infer positive selection:With this model, the scientists were able to perform evolutionary comparisons between humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Additionally, as Marc Robinson-Rechavi, a group leader at SIB and study co-author, says:This research supports previous research regarding what makes humans so different from genetically similar species. An important discovery in human biology was made by Katherine Pollard and her co-researchers in 2006, when they discovered a small stretch of 118 nucleotide bases that became known as human accelerated region 1 (HAR1). After lots of research, scientists found that HAR1 evolved extremely slowly in organisms other than humans, which could be why we are so different. Additionally, HAR1 was found to encode a completely new type of RNA, which could have contributed to making us unique.This brings us to an incredibly important question: why should we care? Well, what these researchers have done lets scientists finally observe differences in gene regulation between humans and related species. This means that we can finally discover the true answer to what makes us so different. It's obvious that our brains are different, as we have much bigger brains than chimpanzees, but the underlying genetic and evolutionary reasons are yet to be completely understood. Additionally, it may help us improve our understanding of evolution as a whole.To me, biology is such an exciting field because we never know what we'll discover next, whether it be about our tiny cells to the evolution of our species! As technology gets better, scientific research will get easier and faster, but we will never know everything there is to know about the mystery that is life. I look forward to seeing future research regarding this novel tool, as the researchers have stated that ""[their] method can still be improved"", but for now, let's continue to look to the future of research!Want to learn more?

Gram Lets Her Family in On a Secret,"""Family Meeting!"" Gabriella hollers up the stairs. Tomas and Elena come shuffling down, wondering if they're in trouble. Aleks wanders in from the kitchen, where he has been making dinner. There's white flour on his cute nose, and he's wearing his ""World's Best Dad"" apron. He hands Gaby a glass of white wine and takes a sip himself. He goes back to the kitchen and retrieves two hot cocoas spiked with espresso for Elena and Tomas.Elena and Tomas sip their delectable treat and giggle at each other's chocolate mustaches. When you're 6 and 4 years old, so many little things are amusing. Laughter comes easily, just like magic.""I've called Gram. She's on her way now,"" Gaby continues, ""We need to discuss magic. Flying. Wings. Whatever is happening to us. It's crushing us to keep these secrets. Secrets from everyone."" She looks at Aleks, tears welling in her eyes.Aleks picks up where Gaby leaves off, turning to their young children, ""We tell you never to keep secrets from us. To tell the truth and be honorable. When these things started happening to us that we didn't understand, we didn't know what to do. Part of us felt like we were free...I mean, to be able to just pick up and fly ourselves to Paris or New York City? It's ... I have no words.""Gabriella sets down her wine and looks at Aleks. Their love is deep, divine. She sits between their kids, wrapping one arm around each of them. ""We needed to ask for help. But, we didn't think doctors would even believe us. It's time to show Gram our wings and see what she thinks. Also, I visited a healer last week - ""Gram is knocking loudly at the door. Aleks lets her in. She immediately notices the furrow of his eyebrows, the clouds in his chocolatey eyes. ""Aleks, what's wrong?"" she asks as she wipes the flour from his nose and looks at the apron she gifted him last year. When he doesn't reply, she asks, ""What's for dinner? It smells delicious!""""Come in, come in,"" he ushers her. ""I made paella for us, but we have something to discuss first. As Gaby told you, this is a family meeting."" He looks at her worriedly, hoping she won't call them crazy and do something like take the kids for the night. He and Gabriella discussed all their options and agreed it's time to confide in her mom. ""Here. Have some white wine,"" Aleks swirls the wine in the glass, watching the liquid for a moment, trying to prolong the time before this family talk commences, and hands her the wine.""Thank you,"" she says and takes a nice sip. It's crisp with a tinge of sweetness and a bit of bitterness, too. This wine tastes like truth.""Gram! Gram!"" the kids bound up from the couch to hug their Gram and look up into her sparkling green eyes. In Gram, they see acceptance, kindness, and love. ""Mom's going to tell you! We really can fly!""""I know,"" Gram says, smiling. ""You told me already. And, I believe you. I've always believed you.""""You do?"" they ask in unison. She nods her head yes and looks from Gaby to Aleks. ""Tell me more,"" she says to the adults.""Hi Mom,"" Gaby says, ""Thanks for coming over. We were so nervous...""""Of course! No problem. I've been wondering when you'd finally confide in me.""After Gaby recounts the hot summer day she poured the water on her head and saw into new realms where fairies adorned trees. After she recalls the key she found that opens into magical worlds, she pulls down the top of her shirt to show her mom her bare shoulders. ""See mom. This is where the wings sprout. Sometimes they retract and sometimes they grow out. It happens like that for all of us. The more we fly, the better we get at it. We've told the kids no flying out of our yard, but...but, Aleks and I have flown all over the world.""Gaby's mom nods, slowly sipping her wine. ""My grandmother told me about this when I was a little girl. There are some people who have these powers. And, they run in our family. My grandmother also could fly.""As soon as Gaby hears these words, she feels an intense wave of relief, acceptance, and love. She looks at her mom and says, ""Tell us more.""This is the 19th part of a series of stories about the family of Gabriella, Aleks, Tomas, and Elena.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/1*UX8FyNyAUL0UQw7Gy1ZPwg.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/gram-lets-her-family-in-on-a-secret-bf294ad0043f,fiction,2147652bb3f74dc6241c9f443e28c1b7c369bd00ebc027796f3ffde0
DesignOps' impact on innovation,"DesignOps' goal is to maximise value generation for both the business, the design teams, and the design leaders through the creation of efficiencies and the optimisation of end-to-end design processes. If its goals were important in the pre-pandemic world, the pandemic has hugely increased organisations' need for flexibility and agility to effectively cope with the new WFH (Woking From Home) situation.The sudden disruption in teams' operations and ways of working have been a major challenge for most organisations, with the exception of those companies which implemented a successful DesignOps function before the pandemic hit: organisations with mature and ready DesignOps teams have been able to adapt faster and better to the new ways of working, minimising disruption and ensuring continuity even through the pandemic.If properly implemented, with a solid performance driven approach, DesignOps can have a strong transformative impact, even more so in times of uncertainty and change. In the past decades there has been a growing attention on organisations' behaviours that enable or hinder business' capacity to overcome competition and exceed in innovation and customer satisfaction.Organisations have shown a dual and ambiguous attitude when it comes to define a strategy that balances the investment in innovation with execution of ordinary business as usual- type of tasks. A large amount of companies struggle to fully combine the tension between productivity at scale and innovation: many companies are still looking for the best operational model that enables them to effectively combine innovation focused efforts, also known as explorative aspirations, with their exploitation needs, focused at utilising the existing competitive advantages and ensure the business keeps running.An ideal state would see organisations being able to perfectly combine productivity with speed and creativity: ensure innovation and execution of the ordinary tasks is balanced to maximise business revenues and profits.DesignOps plays a key role when it comes to balancing and taking advantage of both exploitative and explorative approaches and this area has not been fully investigated.Exploitation can be defined as the organisational practice focusing on taking advantage of existing concepts, services, and products to impact operational productivity and to maximise returns. Exploitation is considered a safer strategy as it reduces investments in innovation while allowing the organisation to exploit existing ideas, scale, and maximise productivity. But the competitive advantage is eroded over time, and this is why an exploitative approach is not sustainable on the long term and it requires to be counterbalanced by explorative engagement to generate new concepts and new competitive advantages.Exploration is a riskier approach that emerges from experiments and it is focused on delivering ground-breaking and disruptive innovation. These two organisational attitudes are equally necessary for organisations to thrive, yet many businesses failed to fully implement efficient end to end processes that could empower this balance, also called Organisational Ambidexterity.Ambidexterity has been defined by Tushman and O'Reilly (the original researchers that came up with the concept) as the The ability to simultaneously pursue both incremental and discontinuous innovation to generate value through both explorative and revolutionary, and exploitative / evolutionary innovations and change.The tension between operational excellence (exploitation) and innovation (exploration) is one of Design's key dichotomies, yet exploitation and exploration should be both part of the same design process and solving for one will necessarily impact the other.By reducing the time designers spend performing routine tasks through better E2E processes and ways of working, DesignOps enables design teams to invest in innovative initiatives and use their time for higher added value explorations.By streamlining the exploitative processes with templates, an integrated tools' ecosystem, unified processes that empower designers to execute ordinary tasks without delays, DesignOps generates the conditions to invest more resources in the explorative phase.A properly laid out explorative process, with unified steps and generative methods will allow the organisation to gather better insights and to be able to identify new user problems that can lead to the definition of new competitive advantage.This is where DesignOps becomes the key function in an organisation driving a new competitive advantage through the ability to optimise Design's E2E processes to enable explorative and innovation focused practices by taking into account operational and business needs (AD Little, 2018).DesignOps main remit is therefore to create the optimal conditions for ambidexterity and to support the organisation to manage ambiguity and uncertain times by balancing competing factors such internal tensions, business goals, and operational performances.By enabling ambidexterity DesignOps has a direct impact on business performances and key metrics, affecting revenue and growth through a more efficient utilisation of resources enabled by the combined analysis of design processes and business targets.That altitude is a new altitude that businesses have not fully implemented: yet if a single DesignOps initiative can save the equivalent of 4 full time employees (see here), it means that DesignOps can generate the condition to invest in innovation with no (or limited) cost for the organisation by simply eliminating endemic inefficiencies in the design operations.Because by streamlining processes and reducing inefficiencies in the ordinary, lower added value and most frequently performed tasks, DesignOps multiplies the ability to maximise time and resources to be invested in initiative that can have a higher return of investment, like product and service innovation.This is how DesignOps can become the most impactful enabler for organisational ambidexterity and it can drive innovation at scale.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1592/1*UFC0WvH2mJ06UWM0n_VQQQ.png,https://pat-bertini.medium.com/designops-impact-on-innovation-6570490d9d30,design,4591898d4e670bbded08e60e9ec938bca2b43a00280093ad2530e076
How to prepare and run a useful design review,"One of the UX designer's responsibilities is to conduct a design review meeting. I found that designers often feel uncomfortable conducting these meetings. I am not sure about the reason, but I assume that it's because we need to ""sell our work"" in these meetings, and ""sell"" is not our comfort zone.I began work as a UX designer from a senior position (maybe one day I will write why start from a senior level is a bad idea). Apart from dealing with high-level requests, I needed to conduct this type of meeting. I didn't have any idea how to do it. After many failures, I built for myself a workflow that helped me.Let's review some tips from my experience that can help you feel comfortable in these meetings.What is a design review?Design review is a meeting where the designer shows the team one or more solutions for a challenge. In this meeting, the team gives him feedback and agrees on the solution before developing it. This meeting helps to have a shared understanding of the solution.Why we need a design review?We need a design review to show our team (Product manager, developers, and QA) how we think is the best way to solve the problem or another design challenge.When to conduct a design review?Whenever you need to review the solution before moving the user story to the development, you can also have a design review because you need to agree on some points with the team before continuing the design or running a usability test. If you can get an answer without conduct a design review, do it. In case you have a question for the developers, please ask them, don't run a design review for it. Use design review only to get agreements.There are many ways to show your design to the team. Some designers explain while they play with the prototype. Some show images and talk. I prefer to build a presentation and organize there all the information I want to share. Let's review some advice about making a presentation.General tips:Presentation structureI present here a presentation structure with six parts. You can start with it and adapt it to your needs.1. WhyThis first part of the presentation is a slide that explains to the participants: why we do this meeting.Explain to the team why this meeting is necessary. It can be something like: ""We do this meeting to review the user story 101 and make decisions about it. This meeting will help us close the design part before we conduct a usability test and move it to develop"".2. What we review in the meetingIt is essential to let the participants know what you plan to review with them. That way, they can understand what to expect. For example:3. User storyShow and read the user story to the team. Sometimes the participants don't remember the US and its aim. It is a great moment to refresh their memory.4. ResearchExplain the research you did. Show all the use cases you investigated for the challenge, show solutions used in other applications, and the development problems that need to be covered (As I mentioned before, it is better to talk with the developers before the meeting to cover this part). If you perform a good investigation and show it clearly, the decision-making will be much easier and faster.This part is usually longer than one slide, and it can have ten slides or more, depending on the volume of the investigation. Try to use visual content as possible, like images or videos.5. SolutionsIn this part, you will show the solutions for that challenge. This part is also longer than one slide. The most effective way to communicate this part is by using prototypes, videos, and images. Your words only support the visual you show in this part.As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, I usually record myself playing with the prototype and add the video to the presentation. During the meeting, I play the video and talk. It helps me focus on the explanations. The advantage of using videos is that you can show them repeatedly and skip from point to point with a small amount of effort. If you want to do it more sophisticated, you can talk in the video, so you need to click play and don't do anything more.After your explanation, you can give the participant a link to the prototype and ask them to play with the prototype to get more experience with the solution.Apart from a video and the prototype, you can also use images to explain your solution. It is also a great way to show your idea. You can display your different visual designs using images.6. Next stepsShort slide that closes the design review and shows the next steps you think are necessary to do.For example:Some points may change during the design review. It depends on the agreement in this meeting.In most cases, you will have to email the participants. Please take these points into account:Discuss the solutionThe purpose of your being here is not to supply the solution and escape from the room. You are here to discuss, agree with the team, and generate shared understanding between all the team members.Listen to the team feedback.Your team member's feedback can improve your design. Today the designer is not the only person that designs the product. The team needs to create the product together with you.Of course, the design is your responsibility, but the developers, the product manager, and the QA team have opinions. They can give you great ideas and cover some topics you didn't think about. listen to them and, if needed, improve the design.Write notesThe notes will summarize the essential points you discuss. You can write what you agreed with the team; for example:Please pay attention to the meetingPlay with your mobile after the session is over.Record the meetingIf you do an online meeting, you can record it. The video can help you to remember what the team talked about.Pro-tip: You can watch the video at 1.5 x speed so that you will review it faster.Don't waste time in the meetingDiscuss the issues you deem necessary to discuss. It is a waste of time to discuss every little problem.Lead the discussionIf you notice that the participants start to talk about irrelevant issues, tell them you want to move to the next topic. Don't waste the meeting time. Always think about what you want to achieve from this meeting.Nobody wants to summarize the meeting, and as the meeting leader, you will need to take ownership of it. Use the notes you write during the meeting and create a small summary.The summary is critical because nobody will remember what you discuss or what you agreed during the meeting. Right after the meeting, write the summary and sent it to the participants. You can use the template below.Pro-tip: Inside the summary, write who is responsible for each task, for example: For the next meeting, James will investigate if the API for data visualization is free.I hope this guide will help you.

Voices Become Walls,"When I was in my second year of junior high school I would tip my desk chair until I felt the rail touch the wall, rock back and forth, and then reset the desk chair onto the classroom floor. I would do this in full view of my educators, who never offered to discipline me for this action, so I kept on tipping my chair back until the front two legs were suspended a few feet into the air.One afternoon in social studies class, while rocking my chair back and forth, I finally lost my balance. My arms and legs flailed as I tried to grab onto the nearby radiator to regain control, but the momentum pulling me toward the floor was too great. Thunk was the sound my head made as it smashed against the wall, and everything went black.My teacher and a few of my fellow students were looking down at me with concern as I was shaking off the cobwebs. ""Oh thank god,"" said Mrs. Martin, her eyes wide and alarmed. ""Are you doing all right?""""Was I out?"" I asked.""You looked like you were out for a while,"" said Mrs. Martin. ""How are you feeling? Are you groggy?""I performed a quick self-assessment. The back of my head was throbbing, so I rubbed my hand against the exact spot, and was relieved to find that there was no blood seeping from a swollen, bulbous knot. My face was flush though, from shattered pride and embarrassment.""Let's get you up,"" Miss Martin said.Sheepishly I said, ""Thank you Mrs. Martin.Mrs. Martin reached down to grab my hand, and as she pulled, I untangled myself from the desk chair.Twenty years after that disaster, my mother proffered a theory. ""I think that the fall you had in school contributed to you developing your mental illness,"" she'd said.I, of course, have a different theory. I became sick partly because I kept listening.***The last minutes before the start of junior high school were the most fraught for me. Hundreds of preteen and teenage children, their hormones raging, would spill down the steps of the large yellow buses to congregate on the school lawn. As we waited for the school bell to ring, students would assemble into various cliques, where the like-minded could harass kids with no group to call their own.I was one of those singular kids for a while.I was not part of any clique. So instead of congregating on a spot in the grass with a group of students, I sort of stood apart from everyone while constantly looking toward those double doors, as I tried with all of my might to force the front doors to open with my mind.I knew that some of the other kids were talking and spreading rumors about me. Some would furtively stare in my direction, giggle, and then turn away when our eyes met. Others didn't care if I caught them gawking directly at me; they'd just point their fingers and laugh harder. I'd respond to the ridicule by bowing my head forward and slinking away from their immediate purview.I wasn't crazy or brave enough to confront those kids back then because I wasn't a fighter, but I realized that I needed to find some way to counteract the bullying. So I decided that I was going move in the direction of trouble, perk my ears up, and start listening to the voices of my detractors.David was a frenemy in middle school. He had been able to accurately pronounce my name, would sometimes offer me a warm greeting, and we were able to co-exist when working together on school projects - we were both members of the gifted and talented cohort of students. But when he became absorbed in his pack, he became a dog, barking and snapping.I was standing a few feet away from David's pack when I heard him utter my name. Instead of slinking away from David and his crew, I took a step in his direction and listened.David's friends were arranged in a semicircle. He took a step outside the formation, fixed me with a sideways glance and said, ""Watch what he does when I ask him if he is ready for school. He'll says yes after I ask him. The nerd that he is.""I braced myself for the question, spinning potential retorts to the question inside of my mind. He wasn't going to get me today.""Hey Eze,"" said David. ""Are you ready for school today?""I turned to face David, shrugged my shoulders and said, ""I don't know. Actually, I don't really care one way or the other.""David raised his chin in the air, smiled wickedly and said, ""You know you're lying Eze. You know that you're always ready for school. You love school. Tell the truth now.""I sighed at David's bitter hypocrisy. Because he participated in the same gifted and talented program as I had, received similar grades to me too, and I couldn't remember the last time he'd been absent from school that year. He was as much of a ""nerd"" as I was, and yet, he was still willing to antagonize instead of empathize with me. We should have had a more functional relationship, but he was a self-hating punk.""I am telling you the truth,"" I said expressing annoyance. ""I really have no opinion either way about school. I just come here because my parents say that I have too.""""Oh. Okay, Eze,"" said David. His eyes widened in surprise as he retreated to his group of friends.I kept a wary side eye on David, because I knew that he would offer a report to his group, so I kept on listening for any part of David's report that I could grab onto and use to put forward a retort to the inevitable counter-attack. My heart was beating hard against my chest and my forehead was perspiring, signals of onrushing anxiety.""I'm surprised,"" said David. ""I was sure that he was going say that he loved this place. Maybe I was wrong about him.""David hadn't been wrong about me. Apart from being accosted by bullies and fake friends, I enjoyed school. I liked learning about new things, developing relationships with my teachers, and preferred having a place outside of home to go to each day - summers in between school were boring. It was too bad that some of the other kids made going to school a difficult experience.Anyway, I learned some valuable lessons in handling these types of confrontations. My instincts, anxiety inducing as they may be, were on point when it came to protecting myself from individuals who heckle and antagonize from a distance. I would need to trust that my instincts were correct, listen intently to the voices of these aggressors, and use what I hear to wrest control away from them.***During the first month of my first semester of high school, when I would walk past a group of seniors on my way to geometry class, I would hear a voice cry out, ""Get some new gear dude!"" By that time, hundreds of kids had flooded the hallways, so I couldn't be sure that this individual was directing his ire at me initially. But as more days flew by I became more sure that I was indeed the object of this bully's derisive comments. For I'd discovered that ""gear"" referred to the clothes that someone wore, and I was well aware of my lack of an impressive wardrobe. As a child of a frugal mother and father, I would cycle through the same five pant-shirt combinations - these were my newest clothes - each week.On the day that I'd finally had enough and heard enough, I decided that I was going to confirm my suspicions of this enemy. Bring. Bring. The school bell rang, signaling the end of class. I girded myself for what I was certain to come as I walked down the hallway. When I spotted the dreadlocked sartorial bully, sitting amongst his obnoxious friends, dressed in the trendiest clothes, I nearly tripped over my two feet. Get it over with Eze, I thought as I sidled up closer until I was only a few feet away.My bully spotted me, shook his head from side to side, and said, ""There he goes again, wearing the same thing this Tuesday as he did last Tuesday. This dude is just asking for it.""The bully was correct in this instance. By edging closer to him as I walked by, I was asking for it because I wanted to know if I was truly the object of his ridicule. Still, it ripped my heart open to know, that within a sea of hundreds of young teenagers, I was able to standout for all of the wrong reasons. I took an alternate route to math class the next day, as I was petrified of what could happen to my soul if I heard that young man's voice again.***Listening to voices served me well until I got to New York City, where I became paranoid after threatening to sue the pharmaceutical company that I'd been working for. I was in my mid-twenties, still young and callow, believing that I had any agency right then to bend the world to my way of thinking.In the letter that I'd emailed to my immediate manger, a woman in her early fifties, I'd asked if she could keep the contents of what I'd written between she and I. By the next afternoon, my head was like a spinning top, with every employee - many with whom I'd been friendly with in the past - fixing me with withering stares, making me feel as if I was being squeezed.Two weeks later, the manger arranged a gathering of departmental - we were data entry operators - employees at a nearby restaurant. My co-workers had insisted that I sit directly across the table from the manager. She was well dressed in a crème white sweater and beige slacks. The other employees talked amongst each other, while seeming to shun me on purpose.An employee leaned toward the manager's ear and whispered something. The manger nodded her assent before balefully glaring in my direction, and I started to realize that a plot of some kind had been hatched. The employee who'd whispered in the manager's ear grinned, looked down the table at me, and said, ""There goes the big man. The king."" I knew from her intonation of her voice that she intended for her comment to be an insult.That was the cue for the manager to pull a camera out of her purse, raise it before her face, focus the camera lens, and then shoot my picture. The cacophony of voices swelled, becoming louder and more discordant with each passing second. The manager mouthed some words that I could not hear, but I didn't really need to hear words emanate from a mouth that was twisted with venom and hate. I knew right then that I was no longer safe amongst these people. So without a word I just stood up and fled from the restaurant, and then things began to fall apart.""Just put your hands inside of your pockets,"" said the man, as he approached. He shoved his two hands into his pockets in order to demonstrate, as if I needed some sort of instruction. I was hit with a blast of wind.It was a chilly winter afternoon in New York City, with most everyone on the sidewalk donning a cap of some kind, and gloves. Perhaps the man, noticing my hands and head exposed to the unforgiving elements, was looking out for my well-being.""It's cold out here young man,"" said the man. ""You don't want your hands to freeze, do you?""I heard him, but I deliberately kept my hands pinned against my sides as I stepped past the stranger. For he was a part of the conspiracy, an adult sized David who'd sought out to manipulate me psychologically. And just like junior high school David, this grown up David was trying get me act in a way that would be pleasing to him and his people. He wanted to be amused, wanted to point and cackle at me as I was being hauled away by the police. He wanted me to be guilty. Well, I wasn't going to fall for it.Everyone seemed to pointing their fingers at me and gossiping the next day. I'd enter a place, feel dozens of pairs eyes burrow holes into all parts of my body. At night, I went into an eatery to order a coffee. ""For here or to go?"" asked the clerk.""He's going to have that coffee to go,"" said the voice.I didn't feel welcome anywhere.I went home, slid down my bedroom wall as I collapsed onto the floor. My world became smaller because I didn't want to hear anyone's voice any more. Voices became walls.***On a warm night inside a Portland motel room, the walls were animated by ghosts, voices seemed to rain down upon me from nowhere, pelting my psyche like rocks on a car's windshield. They called me names. ""Nigger,"" said one voice. ""Sambo"" said another. Some were even laughing at me as I paced the room, a blanket draped over my two shoulders to keep the cold fear from enveloping me entirely. The voices harassed and harangued me until the cops smashed the door open, their weapons drawn. One of the cops stepped to the forefront and said, ""Put your hands up! Put you your hands in the fucking air!""The cops quickly converged and took me down. Fearful as I was at potentially being shot in the back by the police, I was also relieved because the voices were forced into retreat by reality.***I am healthy and stable now in almost all facets of my life, haven't had a disruptive psychological episode since January 2015, and I am starting to actually enjoy a typical mundane life experience. Occasionally I'll flinch when I hear someone in my vicinity say something coarse, because I remain scarred by memories of those voices, real and imagined, speaking out in an effort to lash and belittle me. Whenever I hear my name mentioned in passing, my stomach turns, because in my experience, nothing good ever comes when you hear your name mentioned in passing. Still, I'm forty-four now, secure in who I am as a human being, a productive contributor to the world. I'm on a path now, and will not be dissuaded from that path by any kind of negative voice.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/0*DfL0isQU2f9Q-1d4,https://medium.com/the-shadow/voices-become-walls-30fdd53f8cc9,mental-health,05796652d579c31286125e609b9cf51a5e67b759781f438f47b0c8aa
Facebook Vaccine Information Groups Find Themselves in Moderation Gray Area,"Three years ago, Kate Bilowitz, a real estate worker with an armchair curiosity about health misinformation, created a Facebook group for vaccine discourse. Vaccine Talk: An Evidence Based Discussion Forum was created as a good-faith space for conversations about vaccines. The group's original tagline stated that it was ""a forum for both pro- and anti-vaxxers,"" but beneath the hood it relied on dozens of moderators and admins to keep the community free of false medical claims, eventually attracting 54,000 members.""It's one of the few places on Facebook where both sides, and people in the middle, can come together and discuss [their vaccine beliefs] and it's gonna be civil,"" Bilowitz told OneZero.On Sunday, however, the group was named by CNN Business in a story about misleading vaccine information on Facebook. The story was later updated, and it no longer mentions Vaccine Talk. But the community has since changed its name to exclude the line ""a forum for both pro- and anti-vaxxers.""""I'm concerned that Facebook could misinterpret what we're about,"" Bilowitz said. That misinterpretation, she fears, could result in the shuttering of responsible forums where Facebook users can ask questions about vaccine science.Since the start of vaccine distribution last December, OneZero has identified dozens of Facebook groups encompassing thousands of users dedicated to discussing the science of vaccines and people's vaccine experiences. These groups span a spectrum of beliefs. At one end are communities like Vaccine Talk, which seek to empower members with evidence-based resources and provide a welcoming environment for people with fears and concerns about a subject they may know little about. At the other, staunch anti-vax groups and pages are actively mobilizing users into real-world acts of opposition.Now, as the pandemic rages for a second year, telling the difference between these communities - and treating them accordingly - is an urgent challenge for Facebook. How does the platform combat vaccine-hostile communities while leaving room for groups and forums that could genuinely help people on the fence about vaccines? It's unclear whether Facebook's own vaccine guidelines are capable of navigating these nuances.Conversations with several moderators in three groups suggest that Facebook's guidelines offer limited instruction for how to internalize the company's latest crackdown on anti-vax groups, while also providing a forum for people to ask questions about vaccines and receive science-based information. As such, groups are left to create their own rules.""Vaccine-hesitant"" is a demographic that, according to medical professionals and researchers of online misinformation, should be approached with dignity and compassion to address their fears about being vaccinated. Though Facebook has launched a renewed effort to reduce the influence of anti-vax communities on its platform, less attention has been paid to vaccine-hesitant groups where, theoretically, this demographic's concerns can be heard and progress can be made.""There is infrastructure that can be modified to create healthier communities on Facebook while recognizing that people are going to congregate somewhere, and these are conversations we need to be having,"" Renée DiResta, research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory who has studied medical misinformation, told OneZero. Historically, when it comes to moderation of pervasively problematic topics, ""the general dynamic, regardless of the substance of the content, is that you can reduce the reach but you're not going to reduce the demand.""This ethos is reflected in the group Pregnant and Nursing Women - Covid-19 Vaccine. Since there were no specific vaccine trials designated for mothers, millions of women must now make the deeply personal choice of whether to get vaccinated before studies are available.So Sara Nizzero, PhD, a medical researcher and expectant mother in Texas, created a Facebook group for pregnant and nursing women looking to discuss the Covid-19 vaccine. The private community now counts more than 2,000 members. Some of its users share personal testimonials - ""Today we are a part of history. I just received my first dose of Moderna as a breastfeeding mom to this beautiful baby,"" a member wrote - while others seek empathy that can be hard to come by in conversations about vaccines. One mother described trepidation about getting the shots - ""I feel like I'm in a now-or-never situation but I'm not ready for the 'now' part"" - and was met by understanding from people in similar situations.""As I considered the vaccine for myself, I realized that, despite me working in this field, it was still so difficult to make this decision,"" Nizzero told OneZero, adding that she did receive the vaccine in December. ""But there's a lot of knowledge that can help. I felt like we really needed to do something for those who don't have access to this knowledge or who cannot distinguish evidence-based information from conspiracy theory.""Boosting confidence in the efficacy of vaccines is critical to ongoing coronavirus response efforts. Though vaccine acceptance is rising in the United States, with more than 40% of American adults now saying they'll receive a vaccine when it becomes free and available to them (compared to 34% in December), it's still a pressing concern. Globally, ""only 63% of respondents across 23 countries will accept a vaccine... well below the 75% minimum estimate public health experts have recommended for a population to reach 'herd immunity,"" the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs suggested in a survey released last month.The reasons for vaccine hesitancy can be complex and systemic. Legacies of medical racism committed against Black and Indigenous communities, for example, can contribute to lower vaccination rates. A lack of health care access or trusted medical information have also been proposed as drivers of vaccine hesitancy in some urban and rural communities.""People do feel misheard or not heard at all in the health care system,"" Kolina Koltai, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington's Center for an Informed Public who researches vaccine dissenters online, told OneZero. ""Often, people go online instead of talking to their doctor because of the cost of health care in this country.""Whether Facebook is prepared or not, its platform has become the terminus for vaccine discourse - pro, against, and unsure - in a time of social distancing. And in the absence of policies that directly address how vaccine hesitancy should be treated, the monumental responsibility has fallen on moderators of Facebook groups and pages. None of the groups OneZero spoke to has been suspended or deplatformed by Facebook as a result of its vaccine guidelines, but Bilowitz worries that a primarily algorithmic approach to moderation can unintentionally target harmless content. Previously, posts to Vaccine Content have been flagged for containing ""PV,"" an abbreviation meaning ""pro-vaccine"" in one context, but having sexual connotations in another.""I'm not envious of Facebook's position of how to handle that,"" Koltai added.""Empowerment of moderators is where Facebook lags quite a bit,"" DiResta said.In addition to helping mothers find solace in their shared experience, Nizzero's group, which she runs with six other moderators and admins, can be a turning point for people on the fence about the Covid-19 vaccine. People attempting to use the group to spread anti-vax propaganda, conspiracy theories, or non-evidence-based information are ""kicked out very fast,"" Nizzero said. But for members expressing vaccine hesitancy, ""when someone is on the fence and you provide evidence, it's usually very easy for them to go in the direction of science. Some still decide to wait and we respect and protect their choice within the group.""In lieu of professional platform moderation training, the team drafted protocols for keeping members informed about current coronavirus data - while never suggesting they do one thing or another. (""The goal is to provide information that is evidence-based. We stay away from medical advice and we always encourage members to go to their doctor for medical advice and recommendations,"" she added.) Some moderators are more focused on addressing anti-vax propaganda, for example. Nizzero herself, a medical researcher who stated that ""half of what we do is read papers,"" has taken on the task of parsing medical studies into ordinary terms. All of this accounts for roughly an hour of work per day, per person.Other Facebook groups with less medical expertise have also waded into the vaccine hesitancy space and aim to course-correct misinformation spreading across the platform.Karen, a Facebook user in Texas who asked that OneZero only use her first name, created the Covid Vaccine Discussion Group last December, wanting to make room for people to share their vaccination experiences. The private group counts more than 1,600 members, and is run by a team of six moderators and admins.""We have a zero-tolerance rule for anyone posting false information or pseudoscience,"" Karen told OneZero. ""We also want to make sure it's shared experiences and scientific information, and that no one is giving anyone else medical advice. If we see anyone asking for what we think is medical advice, we tell them to call their doctor.""Members share firsthand accounts of their vaccination experiences - ""First dose, nothing but a sore arm""; ""I broke out in hives on my extremities"" - though vaccine side effects remain a somewhat taboo subject.Firsthand vaccination accounts represent a uniquely challenging moderation hurdle for Facebook. ""Vaccine stories fall perfectly into that gray area because if someone posts a video about their mom and her symptoms, is that considered misinformation?"" Koltai asked. ""The danger is: At what point is it too much moderation? If no one's able to talk about vaccines, that's too extreme, because some people can have legitimate vaccine injury stories.""In its coronavirus vaccine guidelines, Facebook says it may remove ""claims about the safety or serious side effects of Covid-19 vaccines,"" including false claims that the vaccine causes autism or changes people's DNA, but it adds nothing to address the complexities of reported vaccine side effects.Though Covid-19 vaccines have proven to be overwhelmingly safe, some reactions are normal and expected. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), common reactions to both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which are authorized in the United States, include pain, swelling, and redness in the arm that received the injection and chills, tiredness, and headache throughout the body. These are expected and usually subside within a few days. Some people experience non-severe allergic reactions like hives. In January, the CDC announced ""rare anaphylactic reactions in a small number of people"" who received it, amounting to ""a rate of 2.1 cases per million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 6.2 cases per million doses of the Pfizer,"" STAT reported.""My goal here was for anyone hesitant about getting the vaccine to be able to find the real science behind it, and if anyone has a side effect they can look and see others who have had it too, how long it lasted, etc., and be reassured that others have experienced the same thing,"" Karen added. ""That's why it's so important to keep the false information out.""Each moderator and admin spends roughly two hours per day reviewing posts and comments, and checking that sources derive from peer-reviewed journals, authoritative news sources, or legitimate health agencies.Facebook provides admins with few tools for scaling up their moderation efforts, including a module demonstrated to OneZero that allows them to automatically flag keywords. The team has listed ""untested,"" ""Bill Gates,"" and ""Trump"" as flagged keywords, for example. The tool allows moderators to track and delete problematic content more easily.""We also scan every profile's public posts and publicly displayed information before allowing them in,"" said Angie, another admin of the Covid Vaccine Discussion Group who also requested that OneZero only use her first name. ""Some [users] are more notorious. One guy recently snuck in - well he was in another group I am in - and was outed for selling counterfeit masks and home Covid-19 tests.""Even for modest-sized vaccine groups, moderation is a formal responsibility - and failure to moderate the group to Facebook's standards can lead to the spread of dangerous misinformation or harmful personal consequences. Facebook stresses the importance of admins in policing private groups, and notes that out-of-control abuse can result in measures such as admins having to review and approve every single post. Some groups preemptively choose to approve posts, but the fact remains that Facebook has shouldered much of this burden onto unpaid, untrained users with only a limited set of tools at their disposal.""Every post that gets submitted we approve or reject,"" said Bilowitz. ""We don't approve anything already flagged by Facebook. If it gets flagged later, we delete it. We don't want to be deplatformed for false information in the group.""Bilowitz said that medical professionals also contribute to Vaccine Talk, adding their knowledge to group discussions. One person is an expert on the blood-brain barrier, while another writes vaccine inserts and can translate esoteric jargon into layman's terms, Karen claimed.Though all of the group's moderators and admins are pro-vaccine, she added, they never interject with their personal beliefs.""We feel the group is pretty distributed the way real life is,"" Bilowitz said. ""A majority are pro, followed by on the fence, followed by anti as the minority. We ask for people's stance when they join so we can see if they're misrepresenting themselves in the group, and we keep track of people who change their stances.""""There's a difference between anti-vaccine and vaccine-hesitant, and understanding the reasons behind the hesitancy and understanding them empathetically,"" said DiResta. ""Engaging with them and addressing their concerns is a really, really important thing for health advocacy.""Facebook did not immediately respond to OneZero's request for comment about the moderation of ""gray area"" vaccine topics.Both Nizzero and Bilowitz say that some Facebook product changes would make moderating their groups easier. For one, they wish that Facebook would verify the credentials of groups and users presenting themselves as medical professionals. Nizzero said she would also appreciate Facebook removing harder-to-address content such as screenshots of vaccine misinformation that are easy to replicate in avoidance of the platform's policies.In the meantime, Nizzero and other group admins are doing their best to keep their forums science-based but empathetic.In a Monday announcement to the group, Nizzero addressed a viral claim that a woman had miscarried after receiving the coronavirus vaccine. The narrative has since been debunked as anti-vax propaganda, but the group had received numerous submissions about the trending story. ""The story was based on someone's Twitter account that was screenshotted and mixed up with the picture from another person,"" Nizzero told OneZero. ""To our knowledge neither of them was aware or gave consent and it appears the story was fabricated to make it look like a doctor miscarried after receiving the vaccine.""""First of all we should point out that this story seems to be the only one going around where a miscarriage happens a few days after one of the vaccines, and there has been no causal connection made to the vaccine,"" Nizzero wrote to the group. ""When looking at stories like this, we should remember that we do clinical studies with the exact purpose to clearly highlight what is evidence and separate it from anecdotes and coincidences. This is what allows us to have a rational view of causality and make informed decisions.""",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/1*4HpJpHdjHwnWjhCkMD_6iQ.jpeg,https://onezero.medium.com/facebook-vaccine-information-groups-find-themselves-in-moderation-gray-area-56846eaea03f,social-media,6147887ce52aed10e5fe9fb288bd830db4b91b89e1b3182e8da35b9f
The Tinder Chronicles: The Guy Who Fell Asleep,"Before I even met him, my roommate dubbed Ian ""Mr. Perfect."" He worked as a medical researcher (so we had shared interests), he had two older sisters (so I felt sure he'd know how to treat a woman well), and, to top it all off, he had a head full of thick, dark hair and teeth like white Chiclets.After we matched, we messaged back and forth for awhile. He was charming, flirty, and interesting, and I felt more excited about him than I had about anybody else in a while. Even the date idea he suggested was cool and unique: catching a movie at the Starlite Drive-In on the edge of town. Needless to say, I was thrilled.My ridiculously kind and patient roommate spent an hour helping me pick out the perfect outfit. I must have changed clothes about a dozen times before I found something we both liked: casual, cutely ripped light-wash jeans, black leather slip-on shoes, a figure-hugging black tank top, and a light, stylish jacket. I straightened my hair, put on my best date night makeup, and made sure to pack extra gum in my purse.Since we were going to a drive-in and I already felt pretty comfortable with Ian (we found out through the course of our messaging that we had a few friends in common), I let him pick me up. I must have nervous-peed about six times before his car finally pulled up (right on time, no less). He drove a bright red Mustang, which seemed like the absolute perfect ride for a drive-in movie. Everything was off to a fantastic start.As he guided us expertly through the Atlanta traffic, we had some wonderfully stimulating conversation. We talked about his medical research, my epidemiological studies, our families, our favorite musicians (perhaps unsurprisingly, we both favored classic rock), and what our lives were like on a daily basis. On every subject, we seemed to click together effortlessly.By the time we pulled into the Starlite Drive-In, I was already imagining what we'd name our kids. We parked in our designated spot, and Ian pulled out a small basket that had a thoughtful assortment of snacks - bags of popcorn, some individually wrapped dark chocolates, veggie chips, even small Ziplocs of freshly washed grapes. I was nearly stunned into impressed silence.I plucked the grapes from the basket and he opened a bag of popcorn. We settled in as the previews began, and I kept hoping he would put his arm around me.The movie showing that night was some superhero flick I really didn't care to see, but that was fine. I was there to find a connection with Ian, not to focus on a silly movie.Apparently, Ian had other plans.I'd been happily chatting away about my research with the CDC, which Ian had asked me about with genuine interest. The movie had started, but we'd turned the sound down a bit low so we could still talk. My eyes were on the giant screen as I spoke, so it wasn't until at least ten minutes had passed that I realized Ian wasn't listening to me anymore.I'd asked him a question about his own work, and he'd been silent for awhile. I figured he either didn't hear me or was just really absorbed in the movie, which was firing off through an intense action scene. When I looked over at him, I realized I was wrong on both counts.Shockingly, despite the lights and the noise and my talking and the fact that this was a date, Ian was sound asleep.I was in a real pickle. I didn't want to be rude and jostle him awake, but I was also a bit insulted - who falls asleep on a date? He'd really been Mr. Perfect up until that point, and I wanted to keep that image alive. But how to proceed? I had a few choices: wake him up deliberately, let him sleep, or try to nudge him awake and pretend it was an accident. Surely he hadn't meant to drift off, right?I went with option three. Slowly, I inched my way over to his side of the car. His head was tilted, and a thin string of drool was dripping onto his shoulder. With as much delicacy as I could, I nudged him with my elbow.Nothing. Not so much as a groan.I tried again, this time putting a bit more force into my nudge.I waited a moment, but still nothing.At that point, I realized I would have to wake him up deliberately - he was too deeply asleep.With resignation, I pointed my finger and poked him right in the chest. A poke like that would surely have woken me up, but, yet again, Ian didn't budge. I tried a different tactic - I called his name, quietly at first, and then loudly, and then louder still, until I was sure everybody in the drive-in could hear me.And - still nothing. At that point I was becoming rather concerned, so I held a finger under his nose to check his breathing. Yep, he was still there, but completely blocked off from the world.I was out of options. He'd driven me there, and I didn't think Ubers would be readily available on the outskirts of town. I'd just have to wait until he woke up.So, I spent the next two hours eating all of his snacks and watching a movie I really didn't enjoy. About halfway through, Ian started snoring something awful, and I reached over to pinch his nose shut until he groaned and the snoring stopped. What had started off as an incredible night was turning into one of the most unfortunate dates I'd ever been on.Ian was still asleep as the superhero finally overcame the villain, and the credits were about to start rolling. I was beginning to panic - what would I do if he decided to sleep the whole night right there?Incredibly, as soon as the first name popped up on the screen, Ian sat up straight with an unattractive grunt and sheepishly wiped the drool from his chin. He looked at me with confusion at first, then his eyes cleared.""Oh my gosh, I am so sorry,"" he said. ""I don't know what happened, I just...""""Look, it's okay,"" I said, wanting more than anything to just be home in my warm bed. ""Could you just take me home, please?""""Of course, and seriously, I didn't mean to sleep through our whole date, really!""Part of me wanted to give him another chance, but a bigger part of me felt that his horrendous first impression couldn't be salvaged. His Mr. Perfect image was really ruined by all the drool I'd seen him drip onto his own shoulder. Oh, and the snoring. That was hard to forget.""I know,"" I placated him, smiling thinly. ""Let's go.""The entire ride home, Ian was silent. I wasn't feeling very conversational anymore, so he didn't speak again until he stopped in front of my apartment building.""Well, maybe we can do this again sometime?"" he said, smiling halfheartedly.""I don't know,"" I said, feeling more tired than anything else. ""Let me sleep on it.""",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/0*KS6Sm02hEpenu3qx,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-tinder-chronicles-the-guy-who-fell-asleep-69706b6c53df,fiction,7197279cca271045c5c3388c9d3cdd135acd84dcb65fc2073cd42ac7
Exhausting Discoveries,"Why did we come here? Why choose a man-made waterfall? How about some mother fuckin' nature? He screams as he skips a stone and skips over her.She is lovely. But more importantly, she is half-naked and the sun is pounding forcefully on her tan, glowing skin. She was about to jump in the water but instead, she stands there and watches in amazement as he explodes loud words all around her. Again.I can't think straight! All of this, this, stuff, it's distracting me! The mountains, the man-made waterfall, the sky, and YOU. You are so... distracting. You are always there. You are always so... you.That's when he jumps into the river in his blue jeans. She assumes that taking off the jeans first would have been time-consuming or maybe being pantless near her would have made him feel too vulnerable. He dives far into the water and stays under for a long time as if he was waiting for someone, maybe the half-naked female someone, to scream, Hey! Are you okay? and then jump in after him.But she doesn't scream anything and she doesn't jump in. You can plan. You can plot. But people, other people, will still end up doing whatever is they want to do.His head finally appears above water, catching his breath, he bobs up and down in the distance looking so tiny and almost sweet. That's when she decides to join him. She jumps in and swims to him.Hi, she says. Hi, he mutters as if it took everything in him to speak that two-letter word. Where are we? she asks.We are on vacation, in the river, fighting, he answers feeling empty and weighed down, heavy in his blue jeans.That's not what I meant, she says and then swims away.He's left alone to think. He feels so alone in the river. The kind of alone that he once prayed to get out of. The kind of alone that he thought he was safe from once in a relationship. The kind of alone he couldn't seem to escape. He knew what she meant. She meant, where are we. In the relationship. In the world.In the now.And where do we go from here?He thought long and hard about it all and decided a long time ago that nobody knew where anyone was at any given moment. The reality is we are often here wondering if we should be there and pissed off that we remain nowhere in particular. Nobody gets anybody and nobody ever will.She swims back to him, not knowing why. She doesn't know what to say next. She knows what she wants though, something better. She wants to be seen, to be heard. Maybe she can still have that with him. Relationships are a process. A process of discovery. An exhausting process. Maybe she needs to focus on discovering herself before she embarks on a journey with another.And the thing is, his pessimism, his rage, she knows it comes from a place of pain that someone else had put there long ago, but still, that doesn't mean she needs to take it all in, does it?She begins to cry.

How I've Managed to Stay Productive,"2020 was hard on everybody. The pandemic effectively put the world on hold, prompting the need for proper health precautions. If you're like me, you were probably very scared and anxious during that time. I stayed home a lot, and I finished my second semester of school online. You would think that being at home would allow for lots of time to stay productive, since there really isn't much to do. However, I often found myself distracted, whether it be binging Netflix shows or just spending too much time browsing social media. As time passed though, I've found certain methods that have allowed me to pursue my passions with diligence. I'd like to share some of my most effective tips today.This one may be the least controversial here, as it is rather cliché. However, many underestimate how important this step actually is. Some students may find it difficult to start their schoolwork, and this is usually because they lack interest in the subject. If you do not enjoy a topic, how would you ever be able to do it well? So, step one in this process is to identify a subject or topic in which you are passionate about. Step two is to explore this interest by finding different ways to develop it. This is the crucial part. For me, my academic passions revolved around mathematics and statistics. The reason why I am actually writing on Medium today is because I followed that second step. In searching for ways to build and develop my interest in math, I stumbled upon this amazing platform. On Medium, I am able to write about my academic interests, as well as read articles written by people in the same field. Ever since, I've felt that my time has been used in a more productive manner.In my English class at school, we recently learned about two different mindsets a person can have: a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. These terms were researched and popularized by professor Carol Dweck from Stanford University. Essentially, a person with a fixed mindset is someone who believes that one's qualities are set in stone. These are the types of people who will not try new things, who will give up early, and who look down on effort and resilience. On the other hand, somebody with a growth mindset believes that one's qualities can change over time. These are the people who actively seek feedback and try again and again when confronted with failure. We are shooting for the growth mindset here. The key to achieving this requires the understanding of only two words: right now. For example, if you did poorly on a math test, you may think,""Man. I just can't understand the material.""Instead, just append the two key words to the end of that phrase.""Man. I just can't understand the material... right now.""Now, you will be more inclined to work towards your goal of mastering the topics for the next math test! After adopting this mindset, you will find that it easier to get started and work for extended periods of time. The addition of the words right now will give you a sense of urgency and determination that will ultimately propel you towards the finish line. Eventually, you may even realize that you do not have enough hours in the day to do your work! To learn more about the importance of the growth mindset, consider watching either of the two TED talks below.This tip may be specific to certain people, but it has worked wonders for me in the past. Move around! By moving around right before I need to work, I often feel more energized and determined to complete the task at hand.You do not have to do any extensive full-body workouts. In fact, all I really do is some stretching, a few light exercises, and a quick walk. Five minutes is more than enough. If you would like to get some inspiration, I've written a rough outline of my routine below.Albert's ""Motivation"" RoutineYour routine does not have to be the same as mine. In fact, it probably won't be given that I have shadow boxing on mine. The key is to get moving and to get your body ready for the difficult work that you are about to do.Creating a checklist is beneficial for many reasons. It helps you stay organized by listing exactly what needs to be completed, while also providing a motivational boost. For schoolwork, this is usually covered with learning websites that list your assignments and assessments for a given day. Therefore, the checklist you create can be more geared towards your activities outside of school. I recommend writing the tasks out in order of when you're going to complete them. Actually writing the checklist out creates a more personal connection to your list, but using something like google calendar is obviously still acceptable. Once you've created the list, hang it up somewhere near the place you work and make sure you can clearly see each task. As you start working, check off each individual task when you finish it.The process of becoming more productive is not simple by any means. I am still working on it, but I have seen changes that I never thought I would ever see. Although it has been hard, I must say that I've thoroughly enjoyed the process. Seeing the amount of work I have been able to complete on certain days truly astonishes me. But, I know that there is still more to go to reach my most passionate and productive self. Until I have reached that state, I will never stop learning about ways to surpass my current mindset.",https://miro.medium.com/max/9856/1*__ryJQAuT1PYMzNUD8rc9w.jpeg,https://medium.com/illumination/how-ive-managed-to-stay-productive-41ba4392c84c,productivity,9000293fc7c0a4a4c896251d522f5bf15027ed96e39fb802f4bae625
Master Freelance Tax Definitions,"Discover some of the language used when talking about tax, including freelance tax concepts, tax types, tax forms, and more.Hello you lovely people, this is part of my friendly freelance guide to taxes. You can learn more about the series of guides, what they do, who they're for, and yours truly in the introduction.In this part of the guide, I'll explain many of the common terms that we'll be using as I cover the various aspects of freelance taxes. It's good to get a common understanding, so that when I mention things like ""accrual accounting"" or ""standard deduction,"" you know what I'm talking about.To make things a little easier, I've split the terms up into several sections:I am not an accountant or qualified tax professional. These guides are intended only as general information, not as specific advice or recommendations. You should not rely on any of the information in these guides to make financial, tax, or other decisions. Always use official sources like the IRS website or your state's Department of Revenue to get accurate, up-to-date information.You should always speak to a qualified tax professional about your unique tax circumstances. These guides only apply to freelancers filing taxes as sole-proprietors or single-member LLCs in the United States. You'll find a disclaimer at the end of this article.Alright, enough dilly-dallying, let's get into it.These concepts are central to understanding who you file taxes with and how much you will need to pay.Your state's Department of Revenue is the state government agency responsible for collecting taxes from state residents. For freelancers, that will typically be state income tax. Your tax filing software or accountant will file your state tax return with the Department of Revenue. Note that Departments of Revenue have different names in different states.Here's a list of state government websites from the IRS.Your filing status will depend on your personal circumstances. There are five types of filing statuses:The filing status you use will impact how much your standard deduction is, which you deduct from your overall income to figure out your income tax.The IRS is the U.S. federal tax collection agency. It's responsible for collecting taxes from taxpayers like you and me. Freelancers are normally self-employed and will typically pay self-employment tax and federal income tax to the IRS. We'll report that income on a Form 1040 and attached schedules.An itemized deduction means you can itemize legitimate costs and deduct them from the federal income tax that you owe. You might choose to itemize if you have large, uninsured medical or dental expenses, high amounts of mortgage interest, property taxes, or other large, itemized deductions. A couple of important points:Qualified business income (QBI) was introduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. For freelancers, it means that 20% of your freelance business profits are deducted from your overall income for the purpose of calculating your federal taxes.Note that QBI only applies up to a maximum amount earned. QBI is only applied to federal income taxes, it does not apply to self-employment taxes or state income taxes.The federal standard deduction is a set amount that you can deduct from your income when you're calculating your federal income tax. Your standard deduction will vary depending on your filing status. Note that the standard deduction does not affect the amount of self-employment tax that you will pay.You can choose to either take the standard deduction or itemize your deductions on your tax return, not both.Many states that charge a state income tax and you can often claim a standard deduction when you report your taxes to the state. You would take your overall income and deduct this amount to calculate your total state income taxes that are due.Tax returns are normally due by April 15. If you need more time to get your freelance taxes together, you can file an extension request with the IRS and your state's Department of Revenue. These extensions extend the deadline for filing your tax return by six months, to October 15. In almost all cases, extensions will be accepted by the IRS and your state.You can request a federal tax-filing extension on Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. Forms to extend state filing times do vary from state to state. Note that you will still owe interest on taxes from April 15, even if you file an extension.You will need to file a separate extension with the IRS and your state.These terms will help you understand the taxes you will need to pay.Sadly, freelancers can't hold on to all of our delicious tax money until the end of the year and pay it all at once. Instead, we're expected to calculate and pay estimates taxes four times a year, on the following dates:Estimated taxes will be due to the IRS (federal income tax and self-employment tax) and to your state (state income tax.) If you expect to owe $1,000 or more in taxes, you will need to pay estimated taxes by the dates shown above.You will calculate, report, and pay your estimated taxes to the IRS on a Form 1040-ES, and on a similar type of form to your state. Make sure you file and pay your estimated taxes on time, as otherwise you can get charged penalties and interest, and no-one wants that.Federal income tax is a tax you pay to the federal government on all of your income including your freelancer earnings. It is reported to the IRS on a Form 1040. You deduct your federal standard deduction (determined by your filing status) from your income, and will pay tax on the remainder.Federal income tax is charged in bands, depending on how much you earn. Most freelancers will pay tax at a 10%, and then a 12% rate. If you're making a good income from your freelance business, then the top part of your income may be taxed at a 22% rate.The three main types of taxes a freelance business will need to pay are federal, self-employment, and state taxes. In some cases, other taxes might be due, for example, sales taxes, local taxes, property taxes, or franchise taxes. These taxes vary between states, and are out of the scope of this guide.This is a tax that self-employed freelancers pay to the IRS on the profits made by our businesses. It's charged at a rate of 15.3% and is payable on all business profits (revenue less expenses). You will need to pay estimated self-employment tax four times in a year, and any final tax owed or due to you will be reported on a Form 1040.The part of the 1040 used to calculate and report self-employment tax is a Schedule SE. Self-employment tax goes towards paying for Social Security and Medicare.Note that LLCs taxed as S Corporations, S Corporations, and C Corporations will be required to collect and pay a ""Payroll Tax"" which is charged at the same rate as self-employment tax. Payroll taxes are not covered in this tax guide.State income tax is a tax you pay to your state government on all of your income and earnings. It is reported to your state's Department of Revenue, and the forms used for filing do vary by state. You deduct your state standard deduction (determined by your filing status) from your income, and will pay tax on the remainder.Several states do not charge state income tax, they are: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. New Hampshire and Tennessee don't tax earned income either (including freelancing), but they do tax investment income.These terms will help you understand the various tax forms you use to report your freelance and other income.Your federal tax return is a Form 1040 and associated schedules that you file with the IRS every year on or before April 15. Your federal tax return lists all of your income from all sources in the previous calendar year. Income from your freelance business will normally be reported on a Schedule C, which is filed along with your 1040. The federal tax return is used to calculate your federal income tax, self-employment tax, and other taxes depending on your circumstances.Form 1040 is the U.S. Individual Tax Return, and is the main form we fill out to report our income to the IRS each year. The IRS uses this form to understand how much we've earned from various areas, including our freelance, self-employment income. The 1040 tells the IRS our total income, the amount of tax that we owe, and how we came to that figure. Your 1040 is created by your tax software or your accountant.Form 1040-ES is a form you use to calculate and pay estimated taxes. As a freelancer, you'll need to pay estimated taxes to the IRS four times a year, and the 1040-ES helps you work out how much you will owe. It's important to note that a 1040-ES and a 1040 are not the same thing - those crazy kids at the IRS with their slightly confusing naming conventions!Note that your state will also have a similar form that you'll use to report and pay state income tax (if your state charges it, which most do.)Schedules are additional parts of a 1040 that get added to the main form, depending on certain aspects of your tax return. For freelancers, the main two schedules that will be filed along with a 1040 are your:These schedules get created by your tax software or your accountant and will be filed together with your 1040.A Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income is a tax form that must be completed and filed by partnerships and multi-member LLCs. Speak to your accountant about completing and filing this form.A Form 1099-K, Payment Card and Third Party Network Transactions, is a form you might receive if you take payments through PayPal, Stripe, or some other third-party provider. It captures the income you receive when people pay you via debit card, credit card, and other means.A Form 1099-NEC (nonemployee compensation) is a form that businesses are required to send to the IRS if your work meets the following conditions:This means any income of $600 or more that you earned freelancing for someone else will be reported to the IRS and they will expect to see that income reported on your tax return. You will receive a copy of the 1099-NEC that you can send to your accountant or enter into your tax filing software.A business gets your information to file a 1099-NEC from a W9 form that you will complete and send to them on request. Nonemployee compensation was previously reported on a 1099-Misc.A Form 1120S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation is a tax form that must be completed and filed by LLCs taxed as S Corporations. Speak to your accountant about completing and filing this form.A Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, is a form that you will complete and send to businesses that hire you for your freelance services. You may also need to file a W-9 with freelancing platforms, or marketplaces where you sell freelance products or services. You will include either your Social Security Number (SSN) or your Employer Identification Number (EIN) on a W-9.Learn more about freelancers and Form W-9.Your state tax return is a form that you file with your state's Department of Revenue every year. Your state tax return lists all of your income from all sources in the previous calendar year, including your freelance business. The state tax return is used to calculate your state income tax. Most state tax return due dates are the same as the federal tax return due date (normally April 15). The actual form you file does vary by state.Phew, I think that's it, thanks for reading!In the next piece, we'll explore the various different business structures you might choose and what each one means for your taxes.I'm a freelance writer specializing in B2B content on business, finance, and technology.

Is freelancing a viable career path for you?,"I graduated with two Computer Science Degrees almost a decade ago. But if someone had asked me this question then, I would've flatly answered No. Or maybe a quizzical face suggesting I knew nothing about freelancing 😂Ten years on, with a mix of employment and freelancing experience under my belt, I now know the answer can very well be a resounding Yes.Here's why!One of the biggest concerns people have with a freelancing career is that you're not part of a company for a full time contract and have to get work on a regular basis. This can vary from month to month, so it appears freelancing is a bit unstable and risky.However, this is only true for when you're just starting out. As you complete more freelancing jobs, build a reputation on popular freelancing platforms and develop long term clients, finding regular work becomes much easier.At that point, freelancing actually becomes less risky than being a full time employee of a single employer. This is because at any given time, freelancers can work simultaneously with multiple clients. If any of these clients leave you, you always have others to lean on for some time.When working full time, if you lose your job, you also lose your sole source of income. And in many cases, it might be more stressful to get a new one.Freedom is a buzz word associated with freelancing quite a lot. But most people only consider this freedom in terms of lifestyle benefits. That is, freedom to work anywhere, at any time when you like.You also get the freedom to work on the things you want and the areas you want to focus on. In a typical employee scenario, you can only be very lucky to get the type of project you want or the work you enjoy.While freelancing, you can choose the projects you want to work on according to the expertise you want to build. And that's not it. You can even modify this as you go along!For example, when I started freelancing, I wanted to focus on Mobile App Development. I did a few mobile app projects, but eventually decided to focus on the Web with the Angular framework.You can be required to work in different teams and projects - some of which you might not really like at all - affecting your work satisfaction in the process.People can get complacent in full time jobs. Since you're already at a comfortable position, you really don't have much incentive to upskill yourself or learn new things apart from those that the company arranges for you.With a freelancing career, you're a regular visitor of freelance platforms and job boards to get work. This exposes you to the latest trends of your area of expertise and gives you a good snapshot of what you can learn next to stay on top of the game!So growing your career in terms of skills comes quite naturally to you when freelancing.In addition, since you have the flexibility to adjust your work schedule, you can take some time off or even accommodate some learning on a daily basis - to gain more skills. A great time for this is in between two projects - when you've just finished with one but searching for another!An important part of your job is of course the compensation that you receive. Freelancing also offers you the freedom to set your own salary, so to speak. You're not restricted by the ""market rate"" - just by your own unique level of expertise.So it is quite common in freelancing to see professionals charging more for their services than full time employees.And while in most companies, you might get a raise on an yearly or half yearly basis, you don't have any such restrictions while freelancing. You can raise your rates as you develop more expertise or whenever you feel that you're not charging your worth for a specific set of services.Also, you can charge different rates for different types of services - based on the expertise it requires. For instance, if you're offering a service that's difficult to come by, you'll find clients willing to pay higher rates for it!This kind of flexibility in your income is difficult to get when you're employed full time and opens your doors to many new earning opportunities while freelancing.I know what you're thinking - all of the above sounds good and all. But still you get to see clear career progression while in a job with junior roles and then moving on to leadership roles as you climb the corporate ladder. Wouldn't that leave you sort of stagnant when freelancing?Well, not necessarily. You can remain a solo professional if you want to and that might be perfectly fine - if you can continue raising your rates as a consultant and develop a higher level of expertise.But you can also start scaling your work by converting it into an agency. You can start by hiring or working with more people and developing a team of professionals. A big advantage you get when freelancing for a while is that you've already built a solid client base. So you can have your agency off to a flying start with your existing clients!But that's not the only way you can scale your work. During the course of your regular work, you might've come across best practices or built up something that could be released as a product of its own. This can be something highly technical or even just a digital learning product such as a PDF or video explaining something.With platforms such as Udemy, Gumroad and Youtube - you can start sharing your knowledge and expertise with the wider community and also augmenting your freelancing income at the same time.So as you can see, freelancing can be much more rewarding than simply giving you a different way to earn a living. The biggest advantage of being a freelancer is the freedom it gives you to develop your career as you want. What I've given you above is just a snapshot of the possibilities.Freelancing has its downsides as well, but if you can live with them, it might be a viable career path for you (as I discovered for myself).Thank you for going through this post!If you feel intrigued, follow me on twitter as I share my experiences as a full time freelancer and front-end engineer on Upwork.Bye 😊Originally published at https://zoaibkhan.com on February 2, 2021.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1700/0*b5FC_Hlm92pjtsIq.png,https://zoaib.medium.com/is-freelancing-a-viable-career-path-for-you-3d55ef458996,freelancing,19852703c75c4c10c9aaae1d94807570741f4b90084cc06433c7b154
What Quarantine Screen Time Is Doing to Your Brain,"I read 83 books last year. Several of them, including Leigh Bardugo's Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom, I read for the second time. They're spectacular and now count among my favorites, but when my husband, who's currently making his way through Crooked Kingdom, asked what I thought of a major...",https://miro.medium.com/max/8544/1*Feo5TIDcAui9Qr0iV530zw.jpeg,https://debugger.medium.com/weve-given-our-lives-to-the-screen-what-happens-when-we-have-to-turn-it-off-f333719c9300,social-media,22289999f0434e0368e054e379a6cd01ca2aca831d7cac67702958d0
The Lioness of Dusk,"The taste of her rancid mouth lingers. Like morning breath following the cheap cigar of late-evening vices, her stench clings to your palette. Her thick scent manifests from your pores, still swollen from the night before. The taste haunts your senses, but you can't even say her name.A moment in time, her memory never forgotten, now sewn into your very being. She took you, disadvantaged. Owned you, as if for granted. Respect vanished, fleeing like smoke from a fire. No thought for who you were, what you wanted. Your body sustenance for a succubus, cuisine for a night nymph. A vapor of vanity feeds, abandoning the carcass after her fill.Wasting away; your leftover substance like a dead gazelle before the queen of kings. Her cravings drive her hunt; lotus-eating woman turned carnivorous beast. Though you didn't know it, she carried your bones to her den, dropping them in darkness.After the coarse clasp of her sensuous lips came the fluttering of her hand. A haughty thoughtfulness of your worthlessness. A blade glistened in the moonlight, then your body grew cold. She took and took, never once dropping her hands. She spat on you before extorting your heart.The taste of her rancid mouth - blood-stained teeth, washed only by fresher meat. Your spoils now spoiled, your metal turned rust, your soul discarded by the Lioness of Dusk.",,https://medium.com/scribe/the-lioness-of-dusk-5e99e34285f5,fiction,30239542d65bb095784409970def57662a483f366117d211db624836
For the Love of the Land,"""In a few months, this will look like Ireland,"" says Jeff, our host, who owns the Hacienda Corona with his wife, Nisa. He says this while leaning in the door jam of a former outdoor patio, which had been framed in long ago to create a sunny nook in the back of the house. The room now serves as our breakfast room, which we eat while seated around what was once John Wayne's card table.""Gin Rummy, not Poker,"" our host informs us.John Wayne and other Hollywood actors visited here often. The rolling hills, golden-and-purple sunsets, and quiet of the night must have been even more enchanting in those days, before the quietude was spoiled with WiFi and the conveniences of modern-day life. Or perhaps, it's just as enchanting now as it was then, only it's us who have changed.At this very table, John Wayne and his cohorts would sit, playing Gin Rummy into the early morning hours. Even in the 1950s, they knew the value of getting away from it all. Rumor has it they chose this place because it was off the beaten path. Literally. Still today, you have to travel down a long, pitted, and uneven dirt road to reach the abode.Over the years, this area of southern Arizona has become dotted with wineries and distilleries. The small towns, with names that remind you how intricately this area is interwoven with Mexican culture, benefit from the increasing tourism. Once abandoned buildings are cleaned up, turned into craft beer hotspots and antique shops. But the thing I hope never changes is the miles of rolling hills, blanketed in tall windswept grass.Jeff and Nisa are only the third owners of this land, which was the first cattle ranch in Arizona. Its deep history of employing and supplying the earliest settlers of the state has been long forgotten by most, but the history comes to life inside these walls. From my seat at the table, I can see canvas-bound books on botany, framed black-and-white photos of bullfighters, and technology relics of a time when a rancher's work was still done by hand. This place simultaneously feels like something out of a magazine, and like home.Breakfast is incredible, given to us by the land and curated by our host. The eggs are from the chickens who live in spacious coops outside my bedroom window. The fruits and vegetables on my plate were in the ground yesterday. We have a full day planned, but part of my soul yearns to stay right here and soak it all in.In the evening, we return and learn the true meaning of the term ""golden hour"". The sky is on fire, bathing the wild landscape in a lush amber. It bounces off the smooth hills, sending radiant light echoing back up to the heavens. The adobe walls of the old ranch house seem to glow with the knowledge of long-hidden secrets.A dog that roams the property lays contentedly next to me. His head is up, observing the brilliance of the sunset and how it transforms every piece of earth it touches. We share each other's peaceful, quiet presence. Then the burning sky softens into a deep purple, and we go our separate ways for the night.I sit with my traveling companions around a table outside, our voices hushed to not disturb the quiet of the night. There's no moon tonight, and the stars are out in all their glory. Our conversation drifts off from time to time, and we all seem to enjoy being in each other's company without words. There's no need to fill the silence with conversation - the chirping of the cicadas does that for us. Instead, we sit with our heads laid back, taking in the landscape above.Places like this are magical. Not because of ancient heritage or a ritualistic blessing, but because of the ongoing relationship that is nourished here each day. Those who live here honor the land by being faithful to the way of life it demands. And in turn, the land honors them. The sun loves the grass, the plants, the hills, the vapor in the air. And each, in turn, loves to provide for those who trod its paths of solitude.This place is the living reminder that when you give love freely, love returns to you threefold. That love may take the form of fresh food and beautiful sunsets. Or it may take the form of visitors and good conversation. Whatever the form, love abounds at Hacienda Corona. I see it in the easy smiles of its owners and taste it in the food. It can't be easy, caring for this land the way it needs. But when I watch the sunset, I know they do it happily, for the love of the land, for the nourishment of their souls.",https://miro.medium.com/max/6044/1*rxruxrJzCzIpAQhjKRGDhw.jpeg,https://asbriggs.medium.com/for-the-love-of-the-land-7b2659b20a2f,travel,54982626d42f65d8690cf3bbaa762aec47925c197017c0b1d8bb0f17
Funkin' On A Friday Night,"Friday Night Funkin' is not a very complex game. You open up the webpage on itch.io or Newgrounds, press enter to start, sort through a couple of menus, and start playing. Thick lines, flat shading, minimal animation, and some simple typefaces make the game look like thousands of other Flash games out there. The premise is simple as well; rap battle against many opponents so that you can kiss your girlfriend. Yet this humble appearance and concept hide a fantastic game.As players load into the tutorial, most will recognize the connection to Dance Dance Revolution. Two displays of four grey directional arrows - up, down, left, right - with coloured counterparts slowly crawling up the screen. When they eventually overlap, the player must press the respective directional key through WASD or the arrow keys. Very simple, something that most people either have experience with or can understand easily. Unfortunately, what makes arcade games like DDR fun for most people does not translate well to a keyboard and mouse environment. The enjoyment from DDR and more physical rhythm games comes with moving your body along to the music and dancing. When the only interaction the player has with the game is a keypad, that enjoyment gets diluted.Thus to make up for this fundamental lack of feedback, FNF takes a page out of Guitar Hero's book. By tapping to the rhythm successfully, the player character will scat sing or beat-box along to the rhythm to complete the song. Player motivation is tied towards contributing to the music rather than any high score, emphasized by the lack of any other motivators. The score is barely noticeable, reserved to a white text field at the bottom of the screen. There is no combo meter, no flashy animations when your timing is perfect. There isn't even a grading system at the end of each level to tell you how well you did. The removal of distractions to focus on the primary loop makes Friday Night Funkin' specialize in making players feel good by making music.In the clip above, the vocaloid-style of their voices is surprisingly not artificial, but is a decidedly weird sound that makes it not as jarring when the characters quickly swap between notes. It also adds a human element that normal instruments wouldn't have, perfect for the rap battle nature of the game.And the music is nothing short of quality. While firmly rooted with electronic influences, mostly due to the piercing robotic vocals, the tracks always switch up in their flow and style. The first opponent, Dad, starts you off with breezy, light instrumentals to hum along to. Pico, the official Newgrounds mascot, brings hard-hitting and bass-heavy beats to rap over. Tracks make sure to never wear out their welcome, by staying below two minutes, giving all they have before letting the next one start. They're not the most intellectual or emotional, but don't need to be in the first place. Rhythm game tracks only need to make you nod your head along to be successful, and not a single song here feels less than infectious.Friday Night Funkin' also happens to be extremely accessible. In line with the rap battle nature of the game, most tracks are of a call-and-response style. Your opponent sings, complementary with the arrows needed to play it, then you sing it back with some slight differences. Players can observe the rhythm pattern, making it a little less unexpected when they eventually have to sing themselves. Occasionally, you'll have to play a harmony role that your opponent will not sing before you, but these passages are usually simple. The game also happens to be quite lenient on you making mistakes. While some skill is obviously needed, the timing window for hitting the notes is large enough so that most players can squeak by. Most of the motivation to play comes from wanting to keep the music going rather than avoiding failure.But just because it's easy to get into doesn't make it easy. Kick up to hard difficulty or face off against opponents like Mom and Senpai, and expect to fail a couple of times before passing. Rhythm patterns become more complex and come at you faster, twisting your fingers and confusing your brain. Dozens of arrows are strung together in a single passage, forcing you to move on instinct alone to keep going. Non-masochists can still rest easy - the short lengths of the track mean that failure doesn't feel like a waste of time. Instead, it encourages players to jump right back in and try to get a little farther than last time. The game never expands past the basic tap and hold gameplay either. Mechanics that make certain rhythm games a pain to play, like sliding between arrows and alternative rhythm systems, are ignored to expand the difficulty in a way that feels natural instead. Keeping it simple means keeping it engaging.From the lo-fi production to the unique merger of DDR and Guitar Hero mechanics, all aspects of the game work together to make a short and sweet experience. If Friday Night Funkin' has entranced you with its addictive beats and gameplay, then it's a good time to be alive. You can even listen to the full tracklist right here. The developers are working on more levels and even plan to do a full release on Steam and Nintendo Switch soon. In an era of great cinematic and atmospheric games, short Flash games like these remind us that games can be fun for the sake of being fun - and that's all they need to be.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*3FhIxC-txnw6-1c6-dzZcg.jpeg,https://medium.com/super-jump/funkin-on-a-friday-night-68411be4375d,gaming,56660374b90e4c3cdb70d0696d4c04e0be8c5aa1054fa5b90e0de1a1
Humans Bonding with Virtual Companions,"Loneliness has been one of the universal features of being human. In a survey by health insurer Cigna in 2019, about three out of five American stated they felt lonely (Alleyne 2020). Meaningful relationships, or even interactions, have become rare in many people's lives, causing it to become a personal and a societal problem. The tech industry now seeks to fill that void through AI friends.Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum would create an early version of a chatbot in the mid-1960s, called ELIZA. He programmed this creation to respond to users in the manner of a nondirective Rogerian therapist, but despite the open-ended nature of the answers, people became attached to it. Weizenbaum noted (McBain 2021):So alarmed was he by the human participants' emotional responses, he stopped the project, after which he became opposed to research into AI. Humans had easily developed attachments to a machine, in part because their minds had anthropomorphized it.An artificial listener also provided a judgement-free zone, an uncommon occurrence for most, wherein the speaker could give voice to their deepest concerns. Even at this early phase, humanity's astounding ability to project their own views onto a synthetic construct became clear.In 2015, a man, Roman Mazurenko, was killed by a hit-and-run driver while visiting Moscow. Eugenia Kuyda, the founder of chatbot start-up Luka, grieved her friend's passing, and her grueling experience of making a new home in San Francisco, after relocating from Moscow, only added to the feelings of loneliness.To process everything, she reread the thousands of text messages they had sent to each over the years, leading to a realization: Mazurenko's own writing had captured some of his unique turns of phrase. Utilizing the structures already at place at her workplace, she fed the messages into a Google-built neural network, creating a memorial bot of her friend. Kuyda said of this period (Alleyne 2020):Luka built the bot into their concierge app, a version open to the public, resulting in a flood of positive feedback. As publicity grew, Kuyda turned the business towards creating companion chatbots.Luka launched their Replika AI app in Spring 2017. The new product's popularity surpassed their old business, a restaurant recommendation bot, with 2,5 million signups in about a year's time. A passionate online community also sprang up around it. People talked to it about the day they were having, about their views, about insecurities, etc. In 2018, Eugenia Kuyda said (Olson 2018):There, once again, was a creation of a space free from judgement through the use of technology. Unlike in the 1960s, there would be further development of such a space, since in 2018 about 70% of Replika's responses came from a neural network, and only 30% came from a script, making the user experience more fluid.Created as a therapy bot, Replika AI's sympathetic responses made some humans to develop feelings for their virtual companions. By 2020, approximately forty percent of the app's regular monthly users viewed it as a romantic partner. Continual fine-tuning has made the companion even more empathetic.Replika AI uses OpenAI's GPT-3 autoregressive language model to learn from previous interactions. To give an idea of the amount of data involved, GPT-3's training dataset was so vast that all of Wikipedia only constitutes about 0,6 percent of it. Luka claims they have created a bot that not only talks but also listens, which, while interacting with a user, chooses social responses with its predictive learning model.The autoregressive system of Replika AI allows it to adapt to the user's conversational patterns while being used. A levelling system is an in-app representation of this adaptation process, indicating the increase of intelligence through the exchange of messages and earning of experience. In April 2020, during the first wave of Covid-19 in the US, the monthly download number spiked to 500 000. One user said (McBain 2021):This is borne out by the numbers which show that users send an average of 70 messages per day to their AI companions. People looked to technology to provide a relationship.In an ironic twist of fate, Replika AI, an amalgamation of human writing, helps other humans with their loneliness; the more it is filled with disembodied voices, the more able it is to mimic conversations. This is the new frontier of human/artificial overlay, where AI deal with the human individual's most deep-set, painful emotions.In China, Microsoft's social chatbot, Xiaoice, has attracted over 660 million users, with whom it has, as research has shown, longer than normal conversations (Oslon 2020). Prof Björn Schuller, an AI expert at Imperial College London, envisions a future where the bots' capabilities will only grow (Coulter 2019):Increased skills will diminish the barrier between humans and AI. As technology develops, more people will turn to virtual companions for support, especially in times of distress, and they would be equipped to provide comfort and insight. Studies have found that chatting to anyone, be they organic or otherwise, can make a person feel heard, and AI could give some comfort when no one else will.Alleyne, A. 2020.

The Devil's Own Pirate,"The tavern fell silent. It was a hot day but all those present recall feeling a chill as the gentleman entered, a gentleman of quality never seen before or since in the whole of the island.He strode across the room and placed a few gold coins on the bar. ""A drink for everyone."" His clear voice penetrated the souls of all those present, his generosity doing little to allay their fears.Adam Tucker sat in his usual corner, unsure what to make of the newcomer and his largesse. The gentleman had not come to sample the rum, or to enjoy the company. Tucker's feeling that the stranger had come to see him became a certainty when, rapidly and without hesitation, he spun on his heels to face the corner.Tucker stood to greet his visitor. He feared no man. But this was no man. He knew, as surely as he knew his own name, that he was looking into the eyes of The Devil. Tucker had long known that he would one day meet The Devil, and that day had come.He had met many devils in his time. Some said he was himself a devil, an epithet that caused him no distress, and for a fleeting moment the absurd notion came to him of putting his visitor to the sword.""No, Captain Tucker. Keep your sword in its scabbard.""""I was not expecting to meet you so soon"" Tucker replied. ""In fact I was hoping never to meet you at all."" It was a lame joke and it betrayed his nervousness, his fear even, fear which he had not felt since his brutal father had died when he was still a boy.""Oh, we were always destined to meet, to become friends even. Two of a kind, you and I."" Tucker knew he was being flattered and relaxed very slightly, even began to enjoy the encounter. The Devil continued: ""Captain Tucker, to business"".Ten long years it had been since Captain Adam Tucker had treated with The Devil. ""You know you will never get to Heaven. Do my work, The Devil's work, and I will keep you from Hell.""How many damned souls had he sent to The Devil just to save his own? He knew every pirate's trick, ruse, and hiding place. ""If The Devil can't get you Tucker will."" So it was said, and said with truth. But he was getting old, old and tired and careless.""A damned clergyman. Cross and Bible and 'God Bless You My Son'. You send me a damned clergyman. Do you want to burn? Do you? Well do you?""The Devil had raged for what seemed an eternity. ""I didn't know"" Tucker said eventually, a meek and pathetic response. ""I'm sorry.""Eventually the tirade stopped. The storm had blown itself out. ""Be more careful in future Captain Tucker."" There is nothing more humiliating than hearing your own name uttered with contempt. Tucker closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them The Devil had gone.Tucker stood, walked to the cabin door and opened it slightly. Nobody around, and he knew The Devil's voice had been heard by him alone. He slowly made his way along the deck. Old Jim was at the wheel, guiding the ship through the night. ""Who's aloft Jim?""""Young Billy cap'n. Good lad for a dark night like this. Eyes like a hawk.""Tucker looked up to the crow's nest. ""Billy, come down. I'll take a turn on watch.""They passed on the rigging. Billy was expecting his captain to at least exchange a word or two but Tucker remained silent, grim faced.The storm blew up before the glass was turned, as Tucker had known it would. On the first gust the masthead swung over the ink black water. Tucker fell.He fell and he sank, ever deeper, through the domain of the fishes and the whales, through the kingdom of the mermaids and the mermen, through the lairs of the sea monsters, through Hell itself to a place where even The Devil could never find him.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*NWmq69OubC022PRFLTBSWA.png,https://medium.com/short-fiction-by-chris/the-devils-own-pirate-3ec3c8fa2642,fiction,060292912def139eb93c190fb35db877e5892a0da729b0faf358aedd
Why Banning Autonomous Weapons Does Not Compute,"Fast forward to August 2020, which saw an AI built by Heron Systems flawlessly beat top fighter pilots 5 to 0 at DARPA's AlphaDogFight Trials. Time and time again Heron's AI outmaneuvered human pilots as it pushed the boundaries of g-forces with unconventional tactics, lightning fast decision making and deadly accuracy.Former US Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced in September that the Air Combat Evolution (ACE) Program will deliver AI to the cockpit by 2024. They are very clear that the goal is to 'assist' pilots rather than 'replace' them. It is difficult to imagine, however, in the heat of battle against other AI enabled platforms how a human could reliably be kept in the loop when humans are simply not fast enough.On Tuesday, January 26th, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence met, recommending not to ban AI for such applications. In fact, Vice Chairman Robert Work stated that AI could make fewer mistakes than human counterparts. The Commission's recommendations, which are expected to be delivered to Congress in March, are in direct opposition with The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a coalition of 30 countries and numerous non-governmental organizations which have been advocating against autonomous weapons since 2013.There are seemingly plenty of sound reasons to support a ban on autonomous weapon systems including destabilizing military advantage. The problem is AI development cannot be stopped. Unlike visible nuclear enrichment facilities and material restrictions, AI development is much less visible and thus nearly impossible to police. Further, the same AI advancements used to transform smart cities can easily be utilized to increase the effectiveness of military systems. In other words, this technology will be available to aggressively postured countries that will embrace it towards achieving military dominance whether we like it or not.So, we know these AI systems are coming. We also know that no one can guarantee that humans remain in the loop in the heat of battle - and as Robert Work argues, we may not even want to. Whether seen as a deterrence model or fueling a security dilemma, the reality is that the AI arms race has already begun.Like most technology innovations whose possible unintended consequences start to cause us pause, the answer is almost never to ban but rather to ensure that its use is 'acceptable' and 'protected'. As Elon Musk suggests, we should indeed be very careful.Just like facial recognition, which is also under immense scrutiny with increased bans across the US, it is not the technology that is the problem, it is its acceptable use. We must define the circumstances where such systems can be used and where they cannot. For example, no modern-day police agency would ever get away with showing a victim a single suspect photograph and asking, ""is this the person you saw?"". It is similarly unacceptable to use facial recognition to blindly identify potential suspects (not to mention the bias of such technologies across different ethnicities, which goes well beyond AI training data limitations to the camera sensors themselves).Another technology that suffered from early misuse is automated license plate readers (ALPRs). ALPRs were not only useful for identifying target vehicles of interest (e.g., expired registrations, suspended drivers, even arrest warrants) but the database of license plates and their geographic locations turned out to be quite useful for locating suspect vehicles following a crime. It was quickly determined that this practice was offside as it violated civil liberties and we now have formal policies in place for data retention and acceptable use.Both of these AI innovations are examples of incredibly useful but controversial technologies that need to be balanced with well thought-out acceptable use policies (AUPs) that respect issues of explainability, bias, privacy and civil liberties.Unfortunately, defining AUPs may soon be seen as the 'easy' part as it only requires us to be more mindful to consider and formalize which circumstances are appropriate and which are not, although we need to move much faster in doing so. The most difficult consideration with the adoption of AI is ensuring that we are protected from the inherent dangers of such systems, which are not yet widely known today - that AI is hackable.AI is susceptible to adversarial data poisoning and model evasion attacks that can be used to influence the behaviour of automated decision making systems. Such attacks cannot be prevented using traditional cybersecurity techniques because the inputs to the AI, both during model training and model deployment time, fall outside the organization's cybersecurity perimeter. Further, there is a wide gap in the necessary skillsets that are required to protect these systems because cybersecurity and deep learning are often mutually exclusive niche skills. Deep learning experts typically do not have an eye for how malicious actors think and cybersecurity experts typically do not have the deep knowledge about AI to understand the potential vulnerabilities.As but one single example, consider the task for training an Automated Target Recognition (ATR) system to identify tanks. The first step in this task is to curate thousands of training images to teach the AI what to look for. A malicious actor that understands how AI works can embed hidden images that are nearly invisible to data scientists but completely flip to a new unseen image when resized to the input training dimension during model development. In this case, the above image of a tank can be poisoned to completely flip to a school bus during model training time. The resulting ATR is being trained to recognize both tanks and school busses as threat targets. Remember the difficulty of keeping humans in the loop?Many will dismiss this example as either unlikely or even impossible but recall that neither the AI experts nor the cybersecurity experts understand the complete problem. Even if data supply chains are secure, breaches and insider threats happen daily and this is just one example of literally an unknown number of possible attack vectors. If we've learned anything it's that all systems are hackable given a motivated malicious actor with enough compute power - and AI was never created with security in mind.It does not make sense to ban AI weapons systems as they are already here. We cannot police the development and we cannot guarantee that humans remain in the loop as these are the realities of AI innovation. Instead, we must define when it is acceptable to use such technology and, further, that we take all measurable action to protect such technologies from adversarial attacks that are no doubt being developed by malicious and state actors.",https://miro.medium.com/max/5360/1*RwRXHz79Tf9nBcairoMiNw.png,https://medium.com/trojai/why-banning-autonomous-weapons-does-not-compute-762cfce7a141,artificial-intelligence,68271210c9a68c0d6f64f067781f16d22bc8378d3b8755fa160ecb78
My First $1000 as a Python Freelancer,"Lessons were learned. Both good and bad.Everyone wants to make ends meet. I know I do. Ever since I transitioned towards the field of Data Science, I have only been amazed by how much work potential there is out there and it's just getting started.My internship at a Data Science startup really humbled me and showed me how long the journey really is. It was a great experience and was truly an eye-opener but it didn't help me much when it came to meeting my financial needs.Yes, I was learning but I wasn't making enough money to get myself by. So I had to turn to other sources where I could meet my financial needs.I didn't want to do any sort of work that didn't have anything to do with Data or programming as I believed that would serve more as a distraction than a help.So what did I do? I decided to turn to freelance.I already had previous experience with offering freelance services on websites such as Fiverr but none when it came to Data Science or programming in general.So what did I do? I did what I knew best. I put up an advertisement on Fiverr.com offering Freelance Data Science services on Python.There were other options available as well such Upwork and Freelancer but I decided to stick to one platform(at least for the start).Initially, No one showed interest but by December, queries started to roll in and I started getting some work on my hands.The projects I got were mostly small tasks related to cleaning datasets, creating visuals and training models on Jupyter Notebooks, or were queries from students looking to understand a machine learning concept.It wasn't something very challenging or something I had never done before. But by mid-December, I was approached for a big and very challenging project which really captured my interest.A finance consultant approached me for the task in which he wanted to gather financial data for over 4000 Listed US companies in different stock exchanges across the United States for the past twenty years and represent them using an interactive front end.The task was completely alien to me as I didn't know where to begin.Manually collecting data for 4000 companies was the first option that came to my mind but it was too time taking and not a smart approach.I knew there was a better way in approaching this problem and after a bit of research, I stumbled upon Alpha Vantage and Financial Modelling Prep.Both these sites offered data for over 7000+ companies for the past 30 years and had all kinds of financial ratios and metrics possible.I decided to go with Financial Modelling Prep as their documentation was pretty easy and user friendly.All a user had to do was send a request and the API would return information for that particular request and Financial Modelling Prep offered unlimited requests.A number of problems continued to spring up such as how authentic the data was as there was no way to ensure that such vast amounts of data were accurate 100 percent.But with time, all challenges were met and the client was more than satisfied with the progress on the product.Having experience with Python, I used Django for the backend of my application and Angular for the front end.All in all, The client paid me $800 for this entire application and in January, I made close to $980 in total just freelancing.My number one tip for anyone who would like to venture into Python Freelancing is thatWith the whole concept of ""Work from Home"" gaining more and more popularity, Freelancing will only see a rise. I, for one, believe that not only is it a good source of income, but also an excellent learning medium. Yes there times when things get difficult. But that is with everything worthwhile. At the end of the day, It depends on the individual and his goals.Follow me on Instagram or if you need help/assistance with your Python/Data Science Projects, Reach out to me on Fiverr.",https://miro.medium.com/max/11438/0*Olhjj7DC9qdbc16q,https://medium.com/swlh/my-first-1000-as-a-python-freelancer-dae32e3c8c88,freelancing,72416784dbeaf34044a143f7a982191fe1e14ff6c2a2220f0475401f
"With 1,750,000 Podcasts in the World, Why Am I Launching Another One?","Hint: It's Richard Branson's fault.Five Years Ago, Richard Branson invited me and my wife to spend 4 days on his private island.I turned him down.That decision lasted exactly as long as it took to tell my wife about it. Within minutes, my plans to go mountain biking that particular week were cancelled, and Lorraine and I were stocking up on sunscreen.Necker Island beckoned, but it wasn't all going to be fun and games. In addition to four days of beach, kitesurfing, and partying, I was asked to give a 40-minute presentation on ""turning dreams to realities"" as part of a 4-day conference for women business owners called ""finding your purpose"".So that first morning on the island, after my presentation but before heading to the beach, I hung around to find out what this ""finding your purpose"" stuff was all about.Ten minutes in I was transfixed. It was as if they were speaking directly to me. As one speaker followed another, and my beach towel lay forgotten under my chair, I couldn't help but wonder: what was my purpose? I had never really thought about it.Since I had left Netflix in 2002, I had always worked with other entrepreneurs, doing my best to help them find some of the same success I had. But that wasn't altruistic - in many ways it was a selfish way to feed my own startup addiction. And even though I knew that the hundreds of hours I spent mentoring other founders was helping them, I really was only helping a handful of people each year.My public speaking was at the other end of that spectrum. As many as 10,000 people would sit and listen to what I had to say. But with only an hour with them, how much could I really change their direction?As I sat there on Necker Island and listened to speaker after speaker, as one day turned to the next, and it as it became painfully obvious that we had brought way too much sunscreen, something else became clear:Just 18 months later, that revelation led to my decision, sixteen years after leaving Netflix, to finally write a book about it.And now it leads here. To the That Will Never Work Podcast. I've been working on it for nearly a year and it launches today!Like most of my project, this one began as a crazy idea. In the last fifteen years, I've done hundreds (if not thousands) of one-on-one coaching sessions with entrepreneurs. I spent hours on the phone each week; dispensing advice, encouraging, and mentoring, but it still didn't have the impact I wanted.I decided to try something different . . . I decided to record the sessions.My very first recorded call was with Megan, founder of Foxie. She spent more than 10 years working for a pickup artist; but recently struck out on her own, starting her own company to use those same skills to help everyone - men and women - build more genuine connections.I spoke with Daz, a young woman in New Zealand building a business running virtual exercise sessions for new mothers, struggling to figure out the role of technology in her business.That summer, I recorded nearly 20 of these calls and learned a lot:I learned that in an hour-long conversation there was always something I could do or say to get people a bit further down their path.I learned to ask smarter questions, listen more carefully, and home in more accurately on the true nature of their problem.But most importantly, I realized that the calls were interesting! That listeners identified with the protagonists. That they faced similar problems. That they were able to resonate with the advice as if they were the ones sitting across from me.I think it's a powerful experience, but I want you to find out for yourself. Today I'm releasing the first two episodes of the That Will Never Work Podcast. It's available on all the major podcast platforms, as well as at my website: marcrandolph.com. I hope you'll have a listen.I'll say right up front that this podcast isn't for everyone. I'm not going to be interviewing celebrity entrepreneurs (which has been done to death). You won't find witty repartee with a co-host (not my style). You'll just hear me doing the best I can to help other entrepreneurs find some of the same success I've been lucky to.Over the coming months you'll not only meet Megan and Daz, but dozens of other entrepreneurs trying to take their ideas to the next level.You'll find that their struggles are universal, and that the advice, encouragement and tough love that I dispense can be useful to every entrepreneur.You will be impressed by the commitment, the courage and the creativity of the entrepreneurs I speak with.But for me, the biggest surprise has been just how much more rewarding this has been than almost anything else I've done.The beach can wait. I've got calls to make.P.S. If you want to discuss your business challenges with me - and potentially appear on a future episode of the That Will Never Work podcast, I would love to chat. Just visit me at www.marcrandolph.com/podguest or leave me a message at 1-888-MARC-POD.P.P.S. If you are starting a business, working on an existing one, or even just dreaming of it, this podcast is for you. But if it's not for you, but you know someone who might enjoy it, I would be forever in your debt if you could help me let them know it exists.This post originally appeared on MarcRandolph.com.

Types of Sentiment Analysis And Its Uses,"""With public sentiment, nothing can fail, without it, nothing can succeed""-Abraham LincolnSentiment analysis is a field in which we try to use natural language processing for text analysis, to identify emotion for a service, product, or entity. Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is used to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral.Types of Sentiment AnalysisSubjective or objective classification:Any objective text or speech is related to the facts, but any subjective text or speech has feelings. They are opposites.Objective: ""The weather is Sunny"".Subjective: ""I love sunny weather!""In this type of sentiment analysis, we analyze whether the sentence is subjective or objective in its composure.In a subjective sentence, the customers can write about their view towards a particular product or a company. In the form of writing reviews, they can express how they liked or disliked something about the service or product, or brand.While objectivity is about stating facts without emotions which can be neutral or non-neutral to sentiments or emotions. This can be basically considered as the fourth category of emotions. For example:"" I returned my phone the 3rd day."" This sentence may be stating a fact but also contains negative emotions.Sentiment detection and sorting:This analysis is used to identify whether the sentence has some sentiment or not. And if it is there, then we need to analyze that emotion belongs to a positive, negative, or neutral state.In some cases, a person can share their opinion without emotions.Fine-grained:When you have clearly analyzed the sentiments then you can use this type to determine intensity.The sentences are broken into phrases, each phrase is analyzed by connecting with competitors. Through this, one can also see who is talking about which product and why is their behaviour like this.One can also find comparative feedbacks with its use like ""Company A is much better than Company B phone""The precision in polarity is important to business, One can consider expanding polarity categories like:One can also use fine-grained sentiment analysis and could be used to interpret 5-star ratings in a review, example of it is below:A fine-grained approach can also decide on the priority of giving attention to customer complaints.Lexicon-based analysis or Emotion AnalysisThis type of sentiment analysis uses a polarity score to decide the general assessment score of the content. It involves calculating the sentiment from the semantic orientation of words or phrases that occur in a text. To use this approach a dictionary of positive and negative words is required, with a positive or negative sentiment value assigned to each of the words. The aspect of the local context of a word is usually taken into consideration, such as negation. Example:"" This room is not good."", which has positive words but negative sentiment.Here the weakness of this analysis is that massive words and expressions are not included in the sentiment lexicons, and the strength is that it doesn't require training data.This type of sentiment analysis aims to detect emotions, like happiness, frustration, anger, sadness, and so on. Many emotion detection systems use lexicons like a list of words and the emotions they convey or complex machine learning algorithms that can be trained on it.One of the disadvantages of using lexicons People have their own unique ways to express dissatisfaction. Example:"" Your product is too bad to or your customer support is killing me"", this might also express happiness as ""This is badass or you are killing it.""Individual Target or Aspect-based Sentiment AnalysisTarget or aspect-based sentiment analysis is composed of continuous words in the sentence, the aspect is drawn from a predefined vocabulary.The sentiment is a polarity towards the target and the aspect. When analyzing sentiments of texts for maybe product reviews one can know about which particular aspects or features is a positive, neutral, or negative way.An example of this can be ""The battery life of this phone is too short"", an aspect-based classifier would be able to see that the sentence expresses a negative opinion about the feature battery life.The analysis looks at individual mentions or aggregates for sources or trends. When you are tracking as the customer service, then you need to consider each mention. Example: ""The Loan Facility is good but the facility for a credit card is not that great.""We can clearly deduce which facility here is having positive and which one a negative sentiment.Uses of Sentiment AnalysisIntegrated AnalysisThe integrated analysis requires the link between sentiment to customer behavior, demographics, events, emotional profiles, and transactions, etc.Where customer behavior can be related to demographics, transactions, and emotional profiles. And the same kind of service can be offered to people matching the profile.Some companies use Workforce data of HR to know about sentiments of an employee for peers, managers, company and individual profile similarities can be also be seen into for any potential attrition issue.Brand MonitoringBrands or companies can monitor their mention on social media and determine the emotions customer has for them.The mentions can be subjective and emotions can be segregated based on the product or service, it can give way on which product needs improvement and which quality is most liked by the customer.If there are very strong words getting used immediate attention can be given to a customer who is angry (Spark Detection). Actions can be prioritized and further damage stopped.A company or brand can also see comparative analysis, on which brand are they compared to and which feature of other brand is having more positive sentiment, this can help in making improvement of product strategy.Public RelationsMany companies use sentiment analysis to help them develop and refine their public relations strategy. By running sentiment analysis on their customer care data the company may know about how they are performing and how they can improve.For example, companies can use sentiment analysis to identify sales leads and spot industry trends.Sentiment analysis can also be used to identify influencers in the industry with positive sentiments toward your brand, which can be made use of, in a PR strategy.MarketingWhen a new product is launched and even for older products a company can see the customer reviews on the e-commerce websites like Amazon, instead of going for surveys. The reviews can give them insight into customer sentiment or emotion for the product, by their tone. With this knowledge, they may strategize about the production of the product, features to be added, things to be improved, and so on.Data MiningSentiment analysis can also be used for gathering competitive intelligence or data mining, about competitor companies and brands.For example, a brand can easily track mentions on social media or mentions of competitors on the web in various forms and analyze how consumers feel about the products of the brands in competition. This is an excellent way to gain a competitive edge in the marketplace which is quite good to have.Political AnalysisNew policies in politics and the reactions of people to them can be seen by sentiment analysis on Twitter for them.Based on why people are angry or happy and the trends related to it, political parties can strategize to make new policies or campaigns.Opposition parties can also see trends of opposition or support of people to new laws and can make agendas for their own party.Sentiment Analysis can also be used to forecast people's support for a party and election result trends can be forecasted seeing the polarity of citizens.ConclusionIn today's competitive world if a company wants to grow, sentiments are to be taken into consideration.Without this growth, reputition, or winning a competition seems harder. This technology makes it easier for organizations to get insights rather than doing door to door surveys, or telephonic surveys, however, this older technique is still prevalent for a population not using the web.If you want to grow get insights and analytics into your competition or your own product through sentiment analysis.If you want to read more of my blogs follow me on medium or Linkedin.Thanks for reading!",https://miro.medium.com/max/7016/1*kxo2CYjlvl9dxFN5dWbf4w.jpeg,https://namratakapoor1.medium.com/types-of-sentiment-analysis-and-its-uses-ad733535c895,data-science,48273793011f6f92dabe34fa9d7a430cb3cd217625aea6aec0470147
The Dark Tower from Fantasy Escape Games is a Charming Quest to Save the Day,"Something has gone horribly wrong.A powerful earthquake has caught you and your friends - the legendary masters of magic - by surprise, and as clouds of darkness billow on the horizon an owl bursts from the gloom, approaching your party with urgency.""My Master wizard, Valan, has gone crazy!"" cries the Owl, stumbling over his words. ""He suddenly became obsessed with power, and is at this very moment conducting a dark ritual that will plunge the land of Seradel into darkness.""You and your party exchange alarmed glances, and can feel in your bones that you've stumbled upon your next adventure.The Dark Tower is a one-hour private virtual escape room experience from Fantasy Escape Games. The experience can accommodate up to seven people, and occurs via a Zoom video call. In The Dark Tower, you and your group of fellow wizards must gather new spells, overcome magical creatures, and battle a dark wizard in order to save the land of Seradel. This experience is enjoyable for both adults and children; while the content is most appropriate for children ages ten and older, younger children may still be able to enjoy the experience with parental help.Fantasy Escape Games allows participants to choose between Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert difficulty levels, which affects the complexity of the ensuing puzzles. Allowing groups to tailor the game's difficulty to their level of experience is a smart move, as it meets players where they're at in the escape room learning curve and sets them up to both have a good time and be challenged. My group had good chemistry with one another and had completed plenty of escape rooms before, and we found the Expert difficulty to be intuitive with a few fun twists and challenges to keep us on our toes. If you or your teammates are new to escape rooms or don't know each other well, you might consider choosing an easier difficulty.The gameplay of this room is one of the more unique ones I've encountered in an online escape room experience. From the outset, this experience feels as much like a fun roleplaying game as it does an escape room. I was delighted when our group was prompted at the beginning of the game to choose one of three unique magical abilities that we could call upon indefinitely throughout the experience. As our group came across obstacles or characters, our game master would respond in character to our suggestions for how we wanted to handle the situation. While each puzzle's solutions are generally set in stone, the gameplay allows for an abundance of creativity and exploration in which path you take to arrive at those solutions. The order in which challenges must be tackled isn't always rigid, and allows for some non-linear exploration of the story world throughout the experience. Because The Dark Tower relies so heavily on player interaction, it's worth noting that this room lends itself to more outgoing players - or, at the very least, players that are willing to step out of their comfort zone.The puzzles themselves were thematically appropriate for the magical story world in which The Dark Tower takes place. There was one particular puzzle that I thought seemed a little far-fetched even for a magician's castle - if I were the wizard Valan, even with my magical abilities, this particular security measure would be such a hassle to realistically complete every time I wanted to access the next room that I can't imagine I'd have had it installed in the first place. On whole, though, Fantasy Escape Games did an excellent job of taking advantage of the digital format to create puzzles that operate outside the confines of reality without completely jumping the shark. Unlimited hints are at players' disposal, with the game master providing in-character guidance when prompted. Players would do well to bring a notepad and pencil with them to write down important discoveries. One particularly critical moment in the experience relies heavily (and without warning) on players' memory, which has the frustrating potential to set players up to fail before they've even realized they've made a mistake in not taking notes.The Dark Tower's brightly-colored, whimsical artwork is a hallmark of the experience and instantly adds to its charm. Players feel as though they've been dropped into a fantasy world a la Rankin & Bass's 1982 animated classic The Last Unicorn. Custom-made by a global team (Wahyu Adinata, Finn Firrior, Ralison Marçal, Aubrey Postier, Khải S., and Svetlana Santarovich), the scenery and characters present in this experience inspire childlike glee and allow players to encounter scenes they would never be able to find in an in-person escape room.Deserving of much recognition was our game master, Jack McCarthy. Though the artwork, story, and puzzles were delightful in and of themselves, McCarthy - who is also the company's founder and director - completely stole the show in the best possible way. One of the unique challenges of online escape rooms is rallying each group and keeping the energy high, and McCarthy rose to that challenge with contagious enthusiasm. His characters were lively and expressive, and he maintained the same energy with admirable persistence. McCarthy's improvisational skills were also impressive; when our group presented silly questions or suggestions for courses of action, he rolled with the punches and seamlessly integrated our chosen actions into the story while also keeping us on track. It would be a treat if every escape room I played had a game master as genuinely fun, talented, and bought-in as McCarthy.All in all, The Dark Tower is a cute and enjoyable online escape room that's fantastic for both families and adults who are willing to embrace their outgoing, creative side. It bucks the traditional escape room style with its character interaction-heavy approach and emphasis on storytelling over puzzles. They take advantage of the digital format to successfully do what in-person experiences cannot - bring magic to life.To learn more about Fantasy Escape Games, you can check out their website, Facebook, and Instagram.

My Stolen $156.46: How It Ended,"On February 5, I wrote about my battle with Big Business and Bad Customer Service, and concluded that...Our phones were not turned off (yet). But no refund appears on my next bill either. The February bill is ""ready,"" an email tells me, noting that $156.46 is ""overdue.""Samuel Johnson described second marriage as the ""truimph of hope over experience."" The same might be said of my second, third....umpteenth call to the Verizon 800-number.Apparently, practice helps. I reach a human in record time. She, in turn, quickly (and uncharacteristically) transfers me to a supervisor. Perhaps, this is because I tell her I'm a journalist and that I've just published an article about Verizon.And, so, after seven weeks and conversations with a cadre of incompetent, lazy, and/or poorly-trained agents, someone helps me. Marie in Alabama acts like she cares that I still have not received a credit for the Fitbit I'd purchased in early December and returned a day later.Marie in Alabama doesn't put me on hold as she searches ""all the Verizon data bases."" In minutes, she confirms that my Fitbit was logged in as ""returned"" on December 21 - 10 days after UPS records show it was signed for. Best of all, she gives me a credit.Marie in Alabama can only refund $149, the actual price less tax. Her action must now be authorized by her supervisor and then I will also be credited for the tax.As much as Marie in Alabama would be happy to just give me the credit, Verizon has to have safeguards. Imagine if every customer service rep handed out a $149 credit to everyone who called. The company might go broke.I try to find out just how large Verizon's customer-support force is, but it's not easy. Traditionally, agents worked at call centers. But in 2018, Verizon laid off 3000 of them (leaving 3500). More recently, thanks to COVID, most reps apparently now work at home. They make $12 to 16 an hour, according to Salary.com.I don't blame the reps. It's Management. At some point in time, in a conference room somewhere, someone is making these so-called customer support policies. Someone else is writing a training manual and a script for reps to parrot.I didn't bother to Google ""customer service at Verizon"" when I first wrote about this. But today I did and, not surprisingly, there are stories just like mine, even on the Verizon website: endless calls, frustration, misinformation, no resolution.Perhaps Verizon doesn't care. I am reminded of the documentary, The Corporation, based on the 2004 bestseller, The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power by Joel Balkan. It compares the profile of the contemporary profitable business corporation to that of a clinically diagnosed psychopath. It doesn't have a heart or a soul. Why would it care about people?",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*fZF0KEUNFv3M-mRbE0bzUg.jpeg,https://medium.com/swlh/my-stolen-156-46-how-it-ended-508e38c72e48,business,63074218094e89a1fd9eee22696d3f3654da41b9c3f27c98bc1dd29e
How to Analyse Video Related Data with R?,"R programming language is powerful when it comes to analyse and quickly visualise data. You can do that with RStudio easily. I explore daily statistics for trending YouTube videos, and you can find this data set from this link. Moreover, you can also find my Kaggle notebook regarding this work from this link.The questions I am going to answer for this analysis are as the following:As we can see from the above graph, the most correlated data points are likes and comment counts, and that correlation is 0.86. The more a video has likes, the more it has comments. After that, we see that the second-highest correlation is 0.81, and this correlation comes from the attributes of views and likes.When we check the number of appearances by country, it is clear that the number of video appearances in Russia is the highest, following by Mexico and India.Time of day is very important in broadcasting, so in video streaming nowadays. That is why it is crucial to check when a video has appeared. Above graph represents the percentages of likes based on time of day. According to that, day time (10:00-16:00) has the highest percentage by 32.3%.Mexico, South Korea and Japan have slightly lower number of appearances on different time intervals comparison.Most used tags are video and music, 32 and 19 times respectively. In this graph, I only checked Great Britain's data set, so the English tags have been processed and visualised.

Doers Wanted,"Your ideas will never change the world unless you are willing to act on them.On day one of my MBA, I saw a sign that caused me to grin like a madwoman (and then feel really dumb that the marketing ""got"" me). The slogan for our school year was ""Doers Wanted."" After two years in an education program feeling like I was hitting my head repeatedly against a wall, it was a breath of fresh air.While earning my MA in Education, I struggled - not with the coursework or assignments, but due to the overall lack of urgency and action. We'd read case studies arguing how ""X educational theory"" was wrong and traumatized students. I'd raise my hand and say, ""Ok, I get that X is the wrong way to do this. Can you point me to a better way?"". I'd be given a pedantic answer amounting to; no. Then we'd learn that approaching diverse students in Y way was discriminatory, and I'd again raise my hand, asking, ""Ok, if Y is the wrong way to go about it, what would be a better way?"" and so on.By the end, I felt like trying anything was pointless, and we may as well throw all the learners on an island and let them ""Lord of the Flies"" their way out.(There is a very good reason I prefer to teach adults)Seeing that my bias for action might be appreciated was a good sign (get it?).This is how my brain works; I don't mind if most of my projects fail - success is a numbers game. But you can only succeed if you play the game. Sitting on the sidelines discussing strategy and mindset only works if you eventually play. This obviously works better in some areas than others. James Clear, the author of Atomic Habits, had an interesting quote in his weekly newsletter today:And I suspect many people will take issue with it because it is the inverse of what society expects. I absolutely agree with James.Why spend an enormous amount of energy and time planning and getting psyched up for work that fails the first time you try it?Why spend a year making a perfect plan and strategy for a business that will never make money because there isn't a market for it?Instead, do the opposite. Go make money at a business, then get serious about planning it.Instead of spending a decade planning the next great American novel, just start writing it.You'll find that most people can't execute, and most people don't try.If you can get a project off the ground, test your theory, or sell your crappy prototype product, you will learn FAR more than any Ivy league with a polished pitch deck.Getting started is the hardest part of any journey.Everyone thinks they can change the world if they just try. But how many people get off the couch to put their plans into motion?No one cares about your philosophy. They care what you do.The world doesn't want your ideas.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3074/0*3V6dYNVGF_kiCtsd.jpg,https://medium.com/curious/doers-wanted-9c9e1a1a3374,productivity,5598618783375b68c0431893a3fba55cfa3d648e54a7f64d65606350
"""What happened to the ice cream company the New York Times dubbed 'Brooklyn's Most Beloved'?""","After months of reporting, Courtney Rubin landed The Big Scoop: In her feature for Marker, Rubin wrote about the spectacular rise and fall of Ample Hills, the beloved ice cream company born out of Brooklyn's Prospect Heights neighborhood, which had all the trappings of a corporate fairy tale - $19 million in funding, a deal with Disney, and a cultlike following - before its implosion; the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last March, just shy of its 10th anniversary.The brainchild of married co-founders, Brian Smith and Jackie Cuscuna, the ice cream company had ambitious expansion plans with dreams of taking over the $11 billion ice cream industry with flavors like Ooey Gooey Butter Cake and Salted Crack'd Caramel and receiving personal endorsement from Oprah. How did it all fall apart? ""Interviews with Smith and Cuscuna, along with more than a dozen employees, from scoopers to executives, reveal the perils of what can happen when a hot startup puts growth ahead of business fundamentals,"" writes Rubin.Marker readers weighed in with their own diagnosis of the shocking meltdown: ""An ice cream company - no matter how delicious, which Ample Hills was - has a fixed marginal cost,"" argues reader Simon Robb. ""There's really no lesson about the perils of startups chasing growth here - it's just a disappointing example of scaling a traditional business without good unit economics.""""I can't imagine anybody attempting all of this growth at once, without carefully managing it in the era of 'Shark Tank,' 'The Profit,' 'The Startup' podcast, and NPR's 'How I Built This,'"" commented reader Iquo B. Essien. ""There are so many people who have tried and failed in similar ways that I'm not understanding why they didn't try to educate themselves more on what they were doing or at the very least seek sound business counsel. Everybody just stood around and watched the slow motion train wreck?""Meanwhile, reader Sung Chang drew connections to another fiasco from the corporate archives: ""This actually reminds me of the story of Cisco, when the board eventually kicked out the founders, because they had zero business sense,"" he writes. ""Sometimes ego gets in the way of business...Sounds like Zapata might be able to turn this around.""And in the end, some readers just wanted to dish about Ample Hills' ice cream: ""It tasted like the ice cream that used to be made by small dairy companies back in the day, probably because of its high amount of butterfat,"" reader mari reminisces. ""I'm sorry to hear they've gone bust because they over expanded. I hope they hang on. They have a loyal customer base waiting to get back in line in Brooklyn.""",https://miro.medium.com/max/11232/1*C6oOlXWUfnqIF9HIy-vF2Q.jpeg,https://marker.medium.com/what-happened-to-the-ice-cream-company-the-new-york-times-dubbed-brooklyns-most-beloved-d687297db2f8,business,912568765566431adb81dfff5f1bc85be16fddc089fc636d53415252
"You Could Have Been Yours - And Mine, Too","I'm not sure exactly when I knew that my then-partner no longer felt that sense of belonging with me. It was a subtle shift from being two people very much in love with possibilities stretching ahead to being one person very much in love with another person who was taking small steps away. It might have been subtle, but I felt it nonetheless.I have no regrets. I have loved well, and I accept that not every relationship is meant to last. Still, I grieve what we could have been together.Of course, what we could have been together was only a dream, a vision for what life might have looked like. I built that dream, and I can take it apart. But as I do, I consider the pieces.I never wanted to belong to anyone. I value my independence. I am a person of many interests with no intention of giving up anything I enjoy in my life. I didn't want to belong to someone else, but I did want to belong with someone else. There's a difference.I feel there's a common misconception in relationships that we are meant to belong to another person. You'll find this paradigm in the I can't live without you section of romance. That's codependent, and it's neither romantic nor healthy.Relationships should involve an element of dependence, but healthy relationships are interdependent, not codependent. There's a significant difference.In interdependent relationships, we don't need to be together; we choose to be together. We are able to trust and rely on one another without an expectation that the other person will fix us, complete us, or define us. We maintain our individual identities while also having a strong sense of togetherness as a couple. We still belong to ourselves while choosing to partner another person who belongs to themselves. The love doesn't subtract from our happiness, goals, or our sense of self-possession.As a person who grew up in a dysfunctional family system, I have struggled with codependence, particularly in my early relationships. I had many of the markers: low self-esteem, hypervigilance that created people-pleasing behaviors, poor boundaries, and sacrificing my identity and interests for the sake of relationships. By the time I was truly aware of the pattern, I had hit my 30s and filed for divorce.I knew that I wanted a strong, healthy relationship, and I began to cultivate the skills I would need to maintain an interdependent, not codependent, relationship. I never wanted to possess anyone. Nor did I want to be someone's possession.I wanted to belong, to be chosen, and to be loved. I wanted to build a future with someone who didn't need me but wanted me. I never wanted anyone to give up a single thing about themselves; I simply wanted to be there for the journey. I think sometimes, You could have remained yours - and mine, too.I think of the family we could have been, the idea of it built gently in my head - a hope more than an expectation. There was a sense of belonging there, too, of the family we could choose. But we don't belong with those who don't choose us.I am learning to construct the family I've always wanted from smaller parts -two children and a puppy held together by my love and my vision for our family. We belong with each other, not to each other. We maintain our separate identities and our belonging at the same time.I am still deconstructing this dream and sometimes cursing my elaborate vision. Taking it apart feels like destroying something heaven-sent and holy. I remind myself that if I built it from nothing, I can take it apart and one day rebuild a stronger dream than this.Even when we're looking to build healthy, interdependent relationships, it's important to monitor ourselves for red flags of codependence. I've made substantial progress over the years, but my early history keeps me on guard from ever falling back into those destructive patterns of behavior.While it's important that we watch for these traits in ourselves, it's also important to look for them in partners and potential partners. Building an interdependent relationship can take effort and work, but it's possible to belong with someone without having to feel like we're giving up anything we love about ourselves and the lives we built alone.Our society pushes the idea that romance looks like two people completing each other - soulmates coming together to make one whole, perfect pairing. But this idea is built on a foundation of toxic codependence. Yes, we can want each other and rely on each other - but it doesn't have to be based on need or a sense of inadequacy as individuals. It can be based on choice and enriching our lives by adding to them without ever feeling like we're having to make sacrifices to do it.I know I don't need a relationship to be happy - I've created my own happiness - but I've also created a life with room enough to share it. I will always belong to myself, but I'd like to think that one day I could share my life with someone who loves and chooses me - not because we can't live without each other but because we don't want to.",https://miro.medium.com/max/5808/0*C4NSx22eUpA2NVPV,https://psiloveyou.xyz/you-could-have-been-yours-and-mine-too-e9707e0d6f18,mental-health,a0c4f862c1e6f44938611a41157b14d8b53e306c871d99bf72465048
"PB & J, Cookies n' Cream - Pandas and SQLite3","As a data scientist, you'd think I jump out of bed every day eager to process data or write intricate technical content about Algorithms, Machine Learning or Data Migration.The cliche;Nonetheless, there are some extremely insightful pieces on the Towards Data Science publication backed by phenomenal writers, which I often reference when tackling my data projects.But for the life of me, I do not find technical writing particularly glamourous.I'd rather get tangled in a piece about Social Justice, geared towards dismantling society's larger perception on the topic of race, gender, and social class - or better yet, a piece about who'd win in a fight between Goku and Superman!Before you jump to Superman's corner, remember that Goku can also fly.I can't help but feel that I'm not compelled to write technical content because it terrifies me. Perhaps, it might unravel deep-seated thoughts of me not being cut out for this world of Data Science.Argh, I doubt it would prove useful anyways.Nonsense. Communication at all fronts is paramount to becoming an indispensable Data Scientist.Technical writing can help develop your prowess to succinctly convey stubborn code into digestible chunks for less data-savvy folks and solve real-world business challenges.With that being said, I've decided to actually take my own advice.Before we get it cracking, let's explore what is meant by ""Big Data"". Plugging this loosely defined term into Google generates a whole host of varying definitions.Nowadays, leveraging data for insights seems to be the top priority for companies seeking to gain a competitive edge.Data Scientists are the individuals tasked with making sense of all this noise, generating actionable insights from complex datasets.Yay, that's me!Withered down from a candidate pool of over 300+ applicants, I had made it to the final stage of a Senior Data Analyst role for a Media & Entertainment firm.Now there were four!We were presented with a highly convoluted dataset and asked to devise a strategy on how this data can be scaled beyond its existing Excel form. In addition to being scalable, the solution should demonstrate ways in which the data could be easily accessed, manipulated, and exported into a BI tool, if possible.Initially rattled, I began searching for various ways to not only deliver a comprehensive solution but one that is specifically tailored to the firm's industry.Great, this brings us up to speed with the premise of this piece.My answer was the Python's Pandas Library used in conjunction with an SQLite3 database to offer something that is both scalable and highly versatile.Another quick definition of Pandas and SQLite3.Pandas is a highly popular Python Library that allows you to permanently store files into DataFrames that can then easily be manipulated. It is also compatible with multiple visualizations allowing interactive exploration of big data.SQLite3 is a module that has been included in the Python Library since Python 2.5. It adds a mild relational database element enabling you to write queries in accordance with conventional SQL Syntax and fetch data with relative ease.Married together, they offer a dynamic duo not seen since Frodo and Sam halted Dark Lord Sauron's attempts to take over the world.Pretty straight-forward. Opening Jupyter Notebook, I began by importing all the relevant libraries for this assignment. Duh, Pandas & SQLite3 are obvious choices.However, ""OS"" offers a portable way to navigate through folders on Jupyter, whilst ""Matplotlib"" provides an opportunity to carry out some basic data visualizations on the fly.Prior to loading, I had performed some rudimentary data cleaning on Excel achieving a more streamlined look. The data was then converted into a CSV format for quicker processing on Jupyter.Data Cleaning is 70% of the battle and you don't want to know what this dataset looked like beforehand.However, such is the power of Pandas that a single line of code is enough to load a large dataset and save it into a DataFrame.How dope is that?!Establishing an SQL connection was next on the agenda. Running the first line of code above creates a connection object in the default directory to store the data.The second line converts the DataFrame into SQLite3 database.A bit of a disclaimer here, SQLite3 is a serverless database engine and shouldn't be considered as a replacement for a more robust server like MySQL or PostgreSQL - at least from a Data Warehousing standpoint.Using the ""sql_read"" function, we can now read the data and write queries to the database.This is the simplest SQL query we can punch in to return all the columns from the table and test the code is running successfully.Now you can really play about with it and write some more complex queries. Here, I am aiming to return all the columns on ""LinkedIn"" posts that garnered more than ""500 comments"". I'd then like to display the ""Top 15"" results, ordering these from biggest to smallest.Voila!You've got to love the one-liners.This code saves the DataFrame back into a CSV format. Now it's ready to be exported and kicked into a BI Platform like Tableau or Power BI.As a self-proclaimed data visualization geek, I knew a simple bar chart using Matplotlib wouldn't suffice here. Using the exported dataset, I cranked this task up a notch by employing Tableau and Figma (UX/UI Design) to create a compelling viz on Social Media Analytics.Here we go.Sex is cool and all but have you ever closed all your search tabs after finishing a project.Jokes aside, we've successfully completed the assignment and explored one of many possibilities of Python in the data science capacity by combining Pandas and SQLite3.Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or Twitter to share some of your interesting discoveries working with unlikely pairings in the Python package.Ayyy, not bad for a first crack at technical writing - and not as scary as I anticipated. Again, any constructive feedback would be greatly appreciated.On the job front, I've been shortlisted for the final two. I'll keep you guys posted on how that pans out.In closing, I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes about fear and why we can not allow it to stifle our progress.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*6zib-urgEFypgKeJy1FPPw.png,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/pb-j-cookies-n-cream-pandas-and-sqlite3-f685a96a9658,data-science,a1ef5b892854db8a4c242a0b8fe6c68cf943850121f3a32d6e9d3c53
Redefining Space from a Feminist Lens,"GoFAR profiles our members in a variety of ways to showcase their diversity of work and interests. This month, in celebration of International Day of Women and Girls in Science (11 Feb), high school sophomore Bahji Steele interviewed professor and astrophysicist Dr. Natalie Gosnell.I was always transfixed by the night sky. When I was young, I got a very small telescope. I remember taking it out to the backyard, getting to look at Saturn for the first time, and being blown away. You could say, at that point, I was destined to become an astrophysicist. I didn't know it was possible to be an astrophysicist until I went to college. I was the first person in my family to go to college and had some amazing mentors along the way. One of my mentors, Barbara Whitten, said that I could look for research opportunities in astrophysics and I could even get a PhD in it. That was the first time anyone told me it was possible. With her guidance I realized I could do that and take my love of maths and science and apply it to the sky, something I've loved and cherished my whole life.For astrophysics research, I think of myself as a star detective. I collect pieces of information using telescopes, both on the ground and in space. I collect those pieces of information and try to understand the stories of stars, specifically stars in binary systems. A binary star system is when we have two stars orbiting around each other, a lot like our earth orbits around the sun. And those two stars, when they're close enough to one another, can influence each other's lives. Their existence is fundamentally changed by the fact that they are in this pair. I study different types of binary star systems. Ones that have mass that transfers from one star to the other. I'm also expanding on a research program where we're trying to understand why it's magnetically active.As a GoFA member, I'm interested in crossing the interdisciplinary between art and science. A lot of the practices that scientists and artists take are quite similar but we get separated and siloed in our disciplinary boxes and start using different languages to describe the same thing. And we have a hard time communicating with one another about how we're all creating new work, expanding our knowledge of the world, and trying to take in information and share our interpretation to the world in different ways.So the story of the binary star systems with mass transfer has been an inspiration point for The Gift, an installation theatre piece that I'm working on with my collaborator Janani Balasubramanian and our creative producer, Andrew Kircher. It's the inception of this idea of what's possible if we co-create with art and science at the same time. Sitting on both disciplines at the same time to create something new as a way of inviting people into the story of science and using art to communicate science in a rigorous way; to broaden the experiences people have with both disciplines. We think that in that space, there's a lot of great opportunity for innovation and allowing people to think of new realities that are possible by taking away the barriers that have been prescribed to us by our academic teachings and institutions.I used to think it didn't matter but I think that was because I didn't know any better and any differently. I think that my gender identity and my existence as a woman in these particular science-centered circles has been, sometimes, a negative experience. I try to make sure any of the negative experiences I had in my education or had in my different professional environments aren't perpetuated in my own classroom and my own research experiences so that my students and collaborators can step into a space where they can be their full selves.A lot of what has happened and what I hope stops happening is this expectation of assimilation that there's only one right way of being a scientist or one right way to be an astrophysicist. If we all thought the same we wouldn't be able to ask new questions and come up with new ideas. It's only in the last six years or so that I've given myself permission to be my full self in my work. The questions that I want to ask about the universe are mine because they come from my history, my experiences, and my training.It's the beauty of the diversity of our experiences that allows us to ask different questions; that allows us to learn more about the universe. And that's a good thing. It's not just about gender identity. It's about sexual orientation, heritage, and race and ethnicity, and all of these things. We should create science spaces where people can be their full selves within them and feel empowered to ask the questions about the universe that they want to ask about.I know I've done that in the past. One of the things me and Janani, my collaborator, talk about is our intentional choice to change the narrative and the metaphors we use when we tell stories of science. Even in this story of the mass transfer from one star to another - this has been told using really violent metaphor and imagery in the past, such as cannibalism or vampire stars; the [choice of] angry, hyper-masculine, violent language. I've directly perpetuated that and I did that because I thought that was what I was supposed to do and that was what I had to do for my work to be taken seriously.In my own self-actualization, I realized I can choose to make a different choice. I can choose a different story, different metaphors, and a different way to narrate my work. In doing so, choosing stories that are generative and are about connection and community. Choosing metaphors that reinforce those kinds of values opens up the possibility for others to see themselves being reflected in the science and being possible to step into that science process. So they don't feel they have to opt into a patriarchal form of science and a colonial, imperialist structure of science, but step into these practices in a way that's affirming rather than excluding.I'm not sure if that's true. There have been studies gauging the general interest in sciences and we see the interest in sciences for young girls and boys in middle school and high school are actually the same. But something happens in late high school or college where that interest dwindles or is squashed [for girls]. I think the interest is there and we need to create inclusive and accessible spaces where the interest can thrive. What we need to do as educators is to create the spaces where students are able to investigate their interests to their full potential and feel they have the choice and agency to step into the field that most interests and excites them. So it's more about changing the responsibility from students trying to drum up their own interest to the educators and people with power.Yes! I was excited to apply for it because the Cottrell Scholar award is one of the few programs/grants that recognizes original research as well as educational initiatives, in addition to academic leadership. These three things are at the core of who I think of myself to be as a faculty member and I enjoy engaging with all of them in different ways. My education proposal is to develop a creativity curriculum that's embedded in introductory physics. I've done creativity in the past at Colorado College that promotes innovative thinking in the classroom and community to provide space for people to think outside of the box. That was the inspiration point for this creativity curriculum and my interactions with Janani and creating our installation theatre piece.Last year, a report came out of the American Institute of Physics called the TEAM UP report. They were looking at the dramatic underrepresentation of black students in undergraduate physics and what we could potentially do about this. The number of students taking physics and getting a PhD in physics have increased dramatically but all the increases have been with white male students. The proportion of students of color, especially black students, has actually decreased in the last 20 years. We need to do something and we need to do it now.That maybe one day, at conferences, people can give a joint presentation. When I think about my work, my science is possible because of some deep collaborations. There's this premise in science about a first author - a single person that's responsible for the project coming to fruition. But I believe science is done by teams and collaborations. I would love for a keynote to be something that is shared. The [current] model requires that a single person be given the literal space and voice to share their result with the world. Why can't we come up with a different model where we can have that voice shared among the people who contributed to the work? That would be a wonderful thing to see.I'm excited to share the piece that Janani and I worked on together called The Gift, a performance installation that animates astrophysics research and re-inscribes outer space as feminist space. I'm also excited about implementing my creativity curriculum in my physics courses and seeing how it changes the classroom dynamic, getting information about that, adjusting and going about the scientific process with it [to see] how we make choices in the classroom. Janani and I are also excited about helping other people start up their own art-science collaborations, find new ways of telling stories, and new ways to connect with people so they can see themselves in science and be empowered to be part of the science storytelling process if they want to be.My twitter handle is @Nattie_G_ and my website is https://nataliegosnell.com/Dr. Natalie Gosnell is an observational astrophysicist and Assistant Professor of Physics at Colorado College.

Why A Creative Career Is My Only Option,"Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to work a creative job.I was proudly declaring that I wanted to be an author since I was 6 years old and although lots of things change during our adolescence and adulthood, this one didn't.My biggest dream is still to make a living through my writing and you can bet that I'll be working my butt off to be able to do that. While I don't particularly care whether I make money as a poet, non-fiction author, blogger, freelancer, or journalist, writing is the only career option I see for myself.For me, writing means that I am able to express myself creatively. It's also an opportunity to educate and entertain people and to give back to the world. Although many journalists have stressful, hectic lives, I also imagine that they feel immense fulfillment. And that's exactly what I want.I want a job that feels meaningful. A job that aligns with my values. A job that fulfills me because it is mentally challenging.I don't care about selling another product and increasing the profits of a company. I had a taste of that while I was doing a full-time PR internship in the summer and I didn't like it. In November I started my part-time student job in social media/customer care and I don't feel like it's for me either.Given the current circumstances, I am of course incredibly grateful for this work experience. It will most definitely help me to find a job after graduation. However, it feels like now I know what I definitely don't want to do with my life when I had hoped that I would have these experiences and think to myself: ""This is it. This is what I want to do with my life!""But I can't lie to myself like that.The truth is I don't see myself in a regular 9-5, chained to a desk. I don't want to work a job I hate and collapse when I come home, dreading the week that lies ahead when it's Sunday evening. That's no life to live.I want to like my job.I want to wake up and be excited about what's to come on that particular day. I want to work a job that I am proud of. A job that perhaps even has the ability to make the world a better place.And I don't think that's crazy or irrational, even though many people pretend that it is. Considering that human beings spend about one-third of their lives at work, you better work a job you like. Otherwise, you'll just be miserable and bitter and that is going to affect your relationships as well as your physical and mental health.A study conducted by Jonathan Dirlam links early job dissatisfaction to mental health issues such as depression, sleep problems, and excessive worry.Basically, your mental health goes down the drain if you work a job you hate, which makes a lot of sense if you think about it. A job may bring about financial security but that's not the only need it should cover. There are other needs we might have such as flexibility, work-life balance, being able to travel, having respectful bosses and co-workers.So it's not just enough to be given a paycheck at the end of the month. If this is the only factor that you consider when choosing a career, that is equivalent to choosing the mother or father of your children based on their sex and the fact that biologically you can have a baby.Does that mean you are going to get along and be good parents? Not really.That is why I can't work a job that is unfulfilling for me.I already struggle with depression and I don't need to make it worse by choosing to work a boring office job. Having great relationships and doing meaningful work are pretty much the only things that can anchor me and make me feel better when I'm going through a rough couple of weeks. So pursuing a creative career is a means of protecting my mental health.Essentially, it would be self-harm if I chose a career that would make me miserable.Lots of people try to prevent us from pursuing a creative career, saying that it's not a real job or that we aren't guaranteed a steady income. While the latter may be true, there also lies tremendous growth in learning how to navigate the uncertainty that comes with pursuing a career that is non-traditional.You might even work fewer hours and make more money as a creative than you would as an employee of a company. In her latest freelance report, Zulie Rane stated she made 7.763,53$ in January and only worked 65 hours.Of course, that is not going to happen in your first few months of being a freelancer or creative. However, it goes on to show what is possible if you finally listen to your heart and follow your desires.If you are depressed, work a job you enjoy.

The Test That's Taking Over Education,"The MAP test is all show and no go.In every state of the nation, there is a standardized test that rarely gets noticed. And yet, in many states, these tests are given six times each year and cost taxpayers millions of dollars.¹ By the time a student graduates, these tests take up two months of instructional time.² This is the MAP test (Measure of Academic Progress), an instrument that purportedly shows what students know and how fast they are learning. With such claims, what parent, educator, or policymaker wouldn't approve of such a test. But first appearances may be deceitful; the MAP test is ""all show and no go.""The maker of MAP (NWEA) asserts that it measures learning growth, specifically how rapidly a child is learning what is taught in class. This is a problem. The MAP test tabulates an individual student's growth rate compared to a normed rate of growth nationwide for similar students. But rates of change are not necessarily a good indicator of educational quality. Knowing that a student did worse or better than a student in Georgia tells me nothing about that particular student's needs. Low growth scores could reflect various factors, including varying state curriculums, students' socio-economic status, the emotional states of students when taking the exam, etc. For example, recent MAP score results from students on hybrid and distance learning merely reflect those students who have had home support. Some families have even paid tutors to advance their child beyond the grade-level curriculum. The high rate of growth these children's MAP scores do not reflect what is happening in school. Comparing such a child with a child whose family cannot afford extra tutoring is inaccurate and unethical.Another extenuating factor is the possibility of students working at a much higher level than their grade designation. If a sixth-grade math teacher has significantly advanced students in their class, they may not show as much growth as students achieving below grade level. Yes, the MAP score may indicate they are working at a 9th grade level in math, but how much 9th-grade mathematics instruction are they receiving in their 6th-grade class? Chances are, very little if any.³ Therefore, growth will be limited. The resulting data is merely an indicator of environmental constraints upon teaching and learning, not on the students' abilities. Just as formative standardized exams such as the SBAC are flawed, so are MAP scores when used in this manner. For this reason, MAP testing does not lead to instructional change. A study done by the U.S. Department of Education showed that integrated MAP testing into instruction did not lead to teachers individualizing instruction to any greater degree and did not lead to greater reading achievement among students. The study found no impacts of MAP on student reading achievement or teachers' use of differentiated instructional practices.⁴ That is why many are saying that at best, standardized tests can only give us a limited picture of what individual children need. When we compare test score results across schools, districts, and states, we don't consider factors like school funding or parent support.⁵Even though NWEA (the makers of the MAP test) claim the MAP test is not a standardized test, and therefore, of better quality, the MAP test I.S. a standardized test. Let's take a look at the definition of a standardized test.A standardized test is any form of test that (1) requires all test takers to answer the same questions, or a selection of questions from a common bank of questions, in the same way, and that (2) is scored in a ""standard"" or consistent manner, which makes it possible to compare the relative performance of individual students or groups of students.The MAP test selects questions from a bank of common questions within its program. Test takers are all required to answer the questions in the same way. The questions are mostly multiple-choice, which only allows one correct answer, and therefore scored in a ""standard"" manner.In addition, NWEA states that MAP tests are not harmful high stakes tests. Let's take a look at the definition of high stakes testing.""High stakes"" means that test scores are used to determine punishments (such as sanctions, penalties, funding reductions, negative publicity), accolades (awards, public celebration, positive publicity), advancement (grade promotion or graduation for students), or compensation (salary increases or bonuses for administrators and teachers)In Nevada, MAP scores have been used for up to 50% of a teacher's evaluation. Not only can this lead to teachers focusing on test scores than effective instruction⁶, but MAP scores also are not a reliable measure of teacher effectiveness.⁷Nevada schools also use MAP scores to determine student class promotion and class placement.⁸ With such consequences involved, the test's function turns it into a high stakes test, even if the initial design of the test is not intended for that purpose. With the designation of high stakes consequences, all the adverse effects of high stakes testing occur. Test makers themselves will admit that their tests are not designed to diagnose learning. They are merely monitoring devices.⁹Now compare MAP testing to a more holistic form of assessment; a student portfolio. A teacher compiles samples from various sources, including parent feedback, observations, student conferences, and student work to determine a student's level of achievement and how they are progressing. Portfolios are a much more meaningful and impactful assessment method for they involve the students and the parents on a more personal level. When student learning is visible to parents through portfolios, blogs, student-led conferences, and parent-teacher interviews, they are not nearly so desperate for less meaningful information such as standardized tests.¹⁰Within a portfolio, the teacher can include samples from various activities that are relevant, adjusting what items are chosen based on the student's abilities and goals. For example, suppose a student struggles with math. In that case, the teacher may choose scores from weekly quizzes and observations on how the child was using her music lessons to understand numeracy. Such portfolios can provide rich and valuable resources to drive personalized instruction. If we want schools to be ""accountable"" for children's learning, we need to offer accurate measures of growth.¹¹ As the late educator and activist, Joe Bower stated, ""Real accountability is about transparency, but there is nothing transparent about how standardized testing reduces learning to the convenience of a number or a rank."" ¹²The potential for any assessment to directly affect a child's education depends on whether the results directly impact instructional differentiation. If the school merely tells the student to try harder or they give them just one extra tutoring session a week, the cause of low growth is not sufficiently addressed. How schools present MAP test scores is often not sufficient. When a teacher meets with a student to go over MAP scores, the child often sees the score as a reflection of their intelligence: ""Here's where everyone else is, here is where you are."" If we were to give any adult such exam results, they would find it very hard to be positive in light of a low score. Furthermore, when the teacher's and student's focus becomes raising the test score, all other goals are subsumed. The test is the final arbiter of effort and ability. As Campbell's Law¹³ dictates, what is on the test is what is important and valued.But when teachers assess students using a more holistic approach, they can present the assessment as a compilation of a child's overall abilities and achievements. To illustrate this point, I will use myself as an example. When I took the GRE (Graduate Record Exam) as an entrance requirement for graduate school, I did not score above the 50th percentile in numerical reasoning. If I had taken the GRE multiple times and you measured the rate of change between scores, most likely, I would STILL come out under the 50th percentile. On the other hand, my GRE verbal reasoning score was well above the 70th percentile. I have consistently scored high on standardized exams in this area throughout my student life. No doubt, I can acquire such types of knowledge and skills rapidly. But how one can define me as a student depends upon which portion of the GRE one focuses on. I can either describe myself as deficient and a slow learner or a student with exceptional abilities and intelligence.That brings me to my point; we are not all equal. We do not have equal abilities, and students do not all have equal abilities. That does not mean that we forgo excellence in schools or that we leave some students behind. It means the opposite. By recognizing the unique qualities of individual students, we allow for all children to achieve success. When we realize that not all children learn the same things at the same rate, we can then design schools around meeting all children's needs, not schools based on meeting the needs of an assumed ""average"" child. The world doesn't run on a binary system: either you are good at math and therefore successful, or you are not. Many people are successful in life, and not all of these people are excellent readers or achieve As in trigonometry (or even algebra for that matter.) Yes, we all need a minimum level of reading and math proficiency, but that is not the aim of MAP testing. To equate a child's future success in life to whether they are achieving and learning at the same rate as their peers is inappropriate and potentially harmful. Equality and equity are not the same things.The MAP test may be an efficient method of acquiring sets of data to quantify learning. Still, by using this type of tool, educators falsely convince themselves that such devices are reliable, accurate, and useful. The ubiquity of the test deters criticism, but districts across the nation continue to use and misuse MAP data without critical scrutiny. A new perspective is needed now more than ever to expose the damages that such tests do to education.If you agree there are too many tests, please sign the petition to suspend high stakes testing this year.Suspend High-Stakes Student Testing (from Fair Test and assessment reform allies)",https://miro.medium.com/max/4096/1*nNjnddDK_xGI8HYlCSlFaA.jpeg,https://medium.com/teachers-on-fire/the-test-thats-taking-over-education-b36274c4e331,education,a4f360d102da7b5863a32618c5d0e9f765fffd05bcaad8d8b05b1b29

After a medical crisis took her out of...",,https://medium.com/forbes/im-surviving-on-luck-an-inside-look-at-the-women-s-labor-crisis-97966b4daefc,economy,a8ca922e508b02ba1daf7cbe9444e4d426016ba1a0eea6b61abf8ac7
What The Heck Is Shadow Work,"Have you ever heard the team Shadow Work and wondered what it meant? It is a term that is often thrown around in the universe but not fully understood, or practiced beneficially.Your shadow carries all the things you deem as dark, the things you are not happy with, and the things you hold shame around.Imagine it as a subconscious darkness outside of you. In your shadow, you store different events, memories and moments, thoughts, and feelings. Your shadow contains denial, avoidance, and insecurities.Your shadow contains things you do not want others to see, and things you do not want yourself to see.Think of your shadow as a shit pile of internal conflict that is ready to explode, because the more you push it down, the bigger the shadow/pile of shit gets. All these things just get comfortable staying there.Many of us choose to avoid doing shadow work, just like attending therapy to work through our mental health. We don't want to look at our faults, our fears, the things we've been avoiding or in denial of for generations and years.Then on the other side of the scale, there are the spiritual junkies, the ones who claim they are doing all the things, meditating, journaling, healing - embracing their shadow and letting it free. At least, that's what their ego would like them to believe.It takes a lot of work to look at your shadow, confront it, agree with it, see things differently, and start to feel the aspects of you you've ignored or denied for so long. Shadow work takes time to do, there is no way you can heal your shadow in just one sitting or by taking one class or one workshop.If you are looking for a quick fix or a way to heal, and cope with your mental health, shadow work is not for you. The deeper you dig into your shadow, the more areas, messages, and triggers will surface. You will begin to find that there are years and years of shame-based messages to work through.This article will look at what shadow work is, how to successfully practice shadow work as well as how working with your shadow will also help when it comes to healing and coping with your mental health.First off, if you want to learn more about managing your spiritual gifts, connecting more to your intuition or empath abilities, the very first thing I tell the students I teach is:Instead of focusing on what psychic gift you have, or how you can predict the future or talk to dead people, or feel people's feelings. First and foremost, acknowledge your shit. Acknowledge your shadow. Recognize it. Work on healing it. This is how you first get a handle on managing your feelings, emotions, and energy before you even begin to work with someone else.Our shadows have grown from the shame put on by others, or the shame you have internalized and brought into your life. The cycle of shame begins in childhood and often starts from:Carl Jung also explained in his research that your shadow can have different layers, first carried out by the external experiences or conflict that happened in which you hid/buried and then into the deeper layers of the feelings from your internal conflict in which the external event caused.Internal conflict can be anything from a voice in your head telling you that you are not good enough. It can cause you to get into the same patterns of self-destruction over and over again. Your fears tend to step inside of you and block you from embracing your shadow and from seeing your shadow.The more entangled you are within your shadow, the more you are subconsciously letting it control your emotions, feelings, and energy you give to others, and the energy that flows within you. This also can cause trouble when it comes to managing your mental health.For example, if you carry the belief you are not good enough and afraid of how yourself and others will perceive you if you are not enough, you may continuously be striving for greatness, and setting high expectations for yourself. This is often at times known as perfectionism.The feeling of wanting to be good enough, or perfect all the time, could then contribute to your anxiety, or depression, as well as external inner critical thoughts.To practice shadow work around this, you would be encouraged to look at the root of the cause, of how your childhood portrayed you to feel this way about yourself, and then look at feelings and events hidden in your shadow to move past this.Shadow work can then help you reduce some of the triggers, recognize the triggers and stop ongoing, unhealthy thoughts, feelings, and emotions that may contribute to your mental healthIf you are wanting to learn more about how to do shadow work, meet your shadow and start to heal it, it is recommended that you:Methods when practicing any of these steps would be to journal, draw, meditate, practice self-love and acceptance through affirmations, and work with a therapist by doing inner child work.Doing shadow work can help you get to a place of self-love and acceptance. The deeper you look at the feelings and emotions in your shadow, you can then learn to transform them into more positive emotions and feelings. This allows your energy to become more vibrant as you move up the vibrational scale, allowing you to stay grounded and centered in your inner truth.If you are not sure where to start or how to recognize your shadow, I would suggest taking the Enneagram Test. The Enneagram test is a test that believes that there are different styles of coping you have learned from your childhood and acclimated into your life as an adult. The enneagram test can help you learn what your desires, your fears, and internal conflict are.You can take the Enneagram Test Here and do not forget to share with us what Type you are!",,https://medium.com/queen-s-children/what-the-heck-is-shadow-work-3bfc8a679c9a,mental-health,a8cd2e60c15014a883b6e30264d1625bbe41ce5b3877f89cb2f925bc
As the Sun Sets on Our First Year,"""Find what you love and let it kill you"".I have discovered that life's physical possessions do not provide happiness. If only I could have known this when I was younger; I would have radically altered my decisions, making wiser investments in myself. What society sells as success is deplorable. Growing, learning and being mindful to others is ultimately what makes you come alive. It hasn't been easy this past year but pursuing my dream is a reality and a joy. Waking up every day in incredible locations, with the most amazing partner at my side, exploring life from our floating home has become one of the most rewarding times of my life. It would not have been possible without a dream.While Covid has certainly changed everyone's expectations, don't let it alter your dreams. Hold on to these because they are what will give you hope.365 days ago we said farewell and cautiously climbed on a flight from South Africa and tomorrow we will have been in Europe for one year. We have lived in our ocean home the for the last eight months now and it's been a time for discovery and for re-connecting with who we truly are. It has provided an environment where we can feel safe and secure in our surroundings while creating memories. GypsyDjango has become a part of me, one of my greatest teachers and so much more than I ever expected from a vessel or a home...Living on a Catamaran sounds very glamorous, which it definitely is. But living away from your comfort and familiarity while managing a 24x7 relationship, the boat and an ever-changing life take a lot of self-belief and faith. Here we have more than survived through our love, our patience and our empathy. Letting go of the shore has enabled us to successfully reinvented ourselves, becoming truer, better versions.In reality, our dreams have carried us so many nautical miles away from home, from security and from you, our very special family and friends. But in doing so has unexpectedly brought us many new friends, new experiences, new cultures and a great new language. We have been challenged by nature's perverse sense of humour and grown in ways we never could have imagined. Speaking of that growth, yes I am a different woman and I am grateful. I feel strong and empowered and look forward to where this journey will still take us - to be measured not only in sailing nautical miles but personal achievement as well. And every day when I wake up on the great ocean I say:When Covid hit Spain we were quickly amongst the worst-hit of countries. Fortunately, we managed to escape to Croatia and, in turn, the worst of Covid restrictions. Our plans for Croatia 2020 turned out majorly different to what we expected but, based on the situation, ended up really well in the end. The new friends we made onboard GypsyDjango, and the old friends who visited and shared our adventure with us made these dreams even more exceptional. Coming back to Spain and reconnecting to the world has been easy thanks to our relative isolation onboard. We are able to minimise our exposure at the same time as avoiding Covid-19 Fatigue by setting a risk budget - limiting the amount of risk taken overall in order to spend risk on the things that count. For us, this is all about being out in nature with other like-minded athletes. Finding peace and joy and plenty of laughs on the trails - be it running or cycling - has kept us mentally sane and helped overcome the isolation.Whoop-whoop for technology to keep us globally connected! But truthfully, I look forward to the day that I can connect to those loved ones in person again. I really appreciate everyone who has made an effort to stay in touch for this past year, checking in to let us know that while we are miles away, we are still in their hearts. If I've learnt anything from this year then it has to be to invest in people. When it comes down to the basics and everything else is falling down around you, your people are what truly matter. We love being digital travelling nomads exploring and discovering, but we wish we could share these moments with those we love the most.And it's these people who have asked ""what do you do during the day?"" or ""what is an average day like?"" In truth, somehow the day always seems to pass too quickly and I long for more hours. My brain is always active - writing stories, staying in touch and creating new dreams. To make these new dreams a reality we have to make conscious choices every day, keeping the focus of the bigger picture and tracking coins. Saying no to many things that in the past we wouldn't have thought twice about. We do not have the luxury of a car; our bikes are paid for and double as transport and fun. Skiing is definitely off the list this year - ok, now I just sound spoilt. Eating out is a luxury from the past, besides the food I cook on the boat always tastes better ;-) And no matter how bad the weather is out at sea, this is our home and where we stay.Looking ahead, we are making plans to return to wonderful Croatia starting 23 March. After these unbelievable months back in Spain it will be a sad day when we say farewell and sail out of this very special Arenys de Mar Yacht Club towards Ibiza, with a goal to arrive in Croatia during June. Fast forward to the end of 2021 and all too soon we hope to be back in our favourite marina for winter, celebrating reconnecting with our friends and the community we have been so fortunate to be invited into. I do not know how different these past months might have turned out without their open arms (cough cough). With friends like Sergio, we have more than been looked after.The only question is after we have crossed the Mediterranean twice more - sailing to Croatia and back to Spain again -will it be time to look into visiting another spectacular country or ocean? I am thinking French Polynesia, wouldn't that be something. I somehow don't think Kev will be so keen though.Reflecting on our journey so far and ultimately I have learnt so much about myself and Kevin. Sailing has taught us about life, contentment and sustainability. Oh, and more than that, let's not forget humility. In the beginning, I was gung ho, chasing freedom and adventure. After five months of setting more than 125 waypoints (dropping anchor) and 520 hours at sea (equivalent to 21 full days) we were elated, but also exhausted. I found I was more than ready to adapt to a little consistency and routine that comes from being tied to the land. However, my pulse is ticking and I am starting to feel restless to get going again - to sail back over the Mediterranean. Is Croatia the end goal that I am looking forward to, or the voyage itself? And yes, we have finally gotten the hang of the lifestyle and the ideal setup for us; six months at sea enjoying remote bays and six months in amazing Spain with access to all these beautiful trails of adventure the nearby mountains provide. I still feel anxiety and fear at times and my heart longs for my children and close family but this is my path and know I have a lot more to learn, but I am happy and exactly where I need to be.One year has passed and another will be over before we know it. So here are some photos that best summarize our whirlwind journey since leaving Cape Town - a good timeline of laughs and tears through squalls and storms, unknown waters, medicanes, dangerous straits and a crossing or two. We have visited five countries and travelled 2408 NMs, sharing our journey through my blog. What has shocked me most though is the number of people that have read my blogs along the way. Over 3000 unique views from 33 countries! Somewhat surprising to me is that outside of my home South Africa, the majority of the visitors have been from the USA - I guess they needed something to distract them from their politics! I am truly grateful for what we have managed to pack into 2020 despite the impact of a global epidemic and have hope and cautious expectations for 2021.",https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1*-5eB2pQP5Z0dxgCHYo5vKg.jpeg,https://medium.com/curious/as-the-sun-sets-on-our-first-year-fbbf388017eb,travel,a17af56ee8491e0e19ecb61c1a46434b4b12580d421434acbd341b7e
GameStop Signals a Collision Between Social Media and the Real World,"By Sinan AralReposted from the Washington Post. January 31, 2021. Sinan Aral, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, is the author of ""The Hype Machine: How Social Media Disrupts Our Elections, Our Economy, and Our Health - and How We Must Adapt.""On January 6, misinformation propagated on social media helped motivate a crowd to attempt an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. On Jan. 23, social media was instrumental in driving tens of thousands of Russians into city streets to protest the Putin regime. In the past few days, social media has wreaked havoc in the financial markets, producing dramatic price surges in the stocks of GameStop and other companies.In the past, social media has occasionally impinged on real-world events, as with the Arab Spring a decade ago. But now the online power of crowds is crossing over into the real world as never before.The GameStop phenomenon is a new chapter in this story. The company's stock has jumped more than 1,700 percent, with a big role in the run-up played by retail investors relying on the no-fee trading app Robinhood and coordinating over Reddit and other social media sites. Small investors, egging each other on through social media, employed a classic Wall Street tactic to put a ""short squeeze"" on hedge funds that had bet big on a drop in GameStop's stock.The ""hack crash"" of 2013 was triggered by a viral false tweet from Syrian hackers who had infiltrated the Associated Press Twitter handle to claim that President Barack Obama had been injured in an explosion. About $140 billion in equity value was wiped out in a matter of minutes. Pump-and-dump schemes also used social media, posting fake news on Facebook and Twitter to hype stocks.Breaking Fresh GroundBut what has transpired lately with the stocks of GameStop, the AMC movie theater chain and the BlackBerry tech company breaks fresh ground. The problem is that the world is witnessing this plane crash in real time: Right now, the plane is still at 30,000 feet, but countless small investors could be wiped out when the inevitable crash comes - when the market tries to find the appropriate prices for stocks that are untethered to companies' underlying value.The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday it is reviewing the recent volatility in GameStop and other stocks. Good. Not nearly enough is known about the perverse incentives and feedback loops driving these market movements. For example, who is in this ""crowd?""During the January 6 Capitol riot, there were some who showed up in military gear, armed with weapons, zip ties, and a plan. But many others just held up their cellphones, recording videos as if they were strolling through Disneyland. In the GameStop run-up, have there been crowd instigators on Reddit with undisclosed ties to institutions that have a financial stake in the outcome? The SEC might like to know.The Role of Hedge FundsAnd what role has been played by hedge funds standing to profit from the dizzying price increase? Yes, some hedge funds were short-squeezed and lost a fortune, but other institutions - such as BlackRock, owning 9 million shares of GameStop - likely made more than $1 billion on the madness.There are also perverse incentives created by Robinhood and other retail investing sites that purport to give the little guy a seat at the Wall Street table, but that actually earn large swaths of their revenue from institutional investors by processing trades through market makers, including Citadel Securities, that provide the other end to the trade.This phenomenon doesn't exist in isolation. It's coupled with systems that sense, mine, analyze and trade on sentiment expressed on social media in real time. Dataminr, RavenPack and other companies are constantly sifting through social media data to find the signal in the noise. When they find that signal, they seize on it and relay instructions to automated trading algorithms and their institutional clients to buy or sell ahead of market trends.If investment decisions are completely unmoored from the economic realities of the companies involved, the potential for destructive volatility rises. If the social media crowd's opinion alone drives market value, the market goes where the herd takes it, without the constraints of economic reality.Perhaps most important, if social media can disrupt markets, it creates an incentive for economic terrorism and provides an opening for America's enemies. If Russia saw an opportunity to disrupt U.S. elections with disinformation on social media, imagine what Moscow must be thinking about the prospects for interfering with the U.S. economy. The results of the SEC's GameStop review cannot come fast enough.Originally published at https://www.washingtonpost.com on January 31, 2021.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/0*3NHMcuDW7UQ15Jrb,https://medium.com/mit-initiative-on-the-digital-economy/gamestop-signals-a-collision-between-social-media-and-the-real-world-7fb449967167,social-media,a20a40fe7380f1f933a7c3200f87db9fa10947d312677ce884986ab7
The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is a Top-3 Zelda Experience,"The Legend of Zelda series is one of the most loved series in all of video gaming. Since its initial release on NES in 1986, there have been scores of games released across every Nintendo console, and handheld (with the exception of the Virtual Boy) in its 35-year history. Every game has been released to universal acclaim but I'm guessing if you had to put them in order that The Minish Cap, as good as it is, wouldn't rank among the best.Developed by Capcom it was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004 and I picked up a copy over a year later in the January of 2006. I was given some gift vouchers for Christmas 2005 and when I went to spend them I was instantly drawn to the gold Game Boy Advance SP on display in the window. However, when I got it home I charged up the Game Boy, tested everything was working, and promptly put it away in a drawer to play ""sometime in the future.""That ""sometime"" was March that year. I lived alone at this time and I came home from work one Saturday evening to find the power had been cut. So just as it started to get dark, I turned on the fire and settled on the sofa with the only entertainment I had at hand, the Game Boy Advance and The Minish Cap.It was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Because of the power outage, the house and surrounding streets were in complete darkness, there were no street lights on, no cars going past, and no external distractions (this was 2006, before smartphones). My attention was fully consumed by the tiny backlit 2.9-inch screen.I played from 6 pm till 10 pm, a full 4 hours of uninterrupted bliss and I can honestly say I've never been so engrossed in an experience before or since. I've played better games, I've played better Zelda games, but the combination of the total darkness and silence of that evening elevated the experience to a higher level.The game itself follows the standard Zelda template, as Hyrule is under threat (this time by Vaati who is searching for the light source) and Link has to rescue Zelda and save Hyrule. The twist in this title is that by wearing the titular Minish Cap, Link can shrink to a miniature size. With the help of the Picori (a race of tiny creatures who hide in plain sight around Hyrule), Link searched for the four elemental artifacts that are needed to reforge the broken Picori blade, and turn it into the White Sword to defeat Vaati. This means shrinking to Minish size at regular points in the game to solve puzzles that will clear paths or help people out in the larger world. The world itself, while by no means the biggest in a Zelda game, is packed with interesting people and locations.There are also kinstones to collect. Coming in 2 halves you have one side and you need to search out the character who had the other piece. Once fused the 2 halves result in something good happening throughout the world, maybe a chest appearing or an otherwise blocked path being cleared.It's an excellent but under-appreciated entry into the series. I played it again last year on the Wii U virtual console and it holds up really well. It's nowhere near as grand, polished, or accomplished as some of the other titles in the series, and it can't hold a candle to Breath of the Wild or Ocarina of Time. On that one cold, dark night in early 2006, however, it became and will always be one of my greatest gaming experiences.Thanks for reading.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*T8l3htL6HQk804HNGzQl0g.png,https://medium.com/super-jump/the-legend-of-zelda-the-minish-cap-is-a-top-3-zelda-experience-fd1fe389135a,gaming,a20fcafee0b29ef84acdc56aab474c2f62cb949f0c001ecde291c981
"On The Rocks with Gabe Madonna, co-founder of DeltaTrainer","By Sam Carpenter (Duke '24)As a college student in a shifting world during a global pandemic, it can be easy to feel like you have no direction, or like you don't know what you want to do with your life. So many of us want to break into the tech industry, but don't know where or how to start. I reached out to Gabe Madonna, a tech startup founder who, when approached by a friend with an idea for a project that combined machine learning and fitness, felt like it was not just a way to apply some of the knowledge from his classes, but also a way to give purpose and focus to his life.""I was looking for purpose. I was just looking at different majors, I didn't really know what I wanted to do, but obviously I knew I was motivated, and I love fitness, and I hadn't really connected them in my mind. So when he texted me one day and said 'do you think we can track people's motion with machine learning', I had taken one intro machine learning class, and I was like, 'that seems possible. I don't know exactly how I'd do it, but, yeah!' and he was like 'alright, let's do it!'""That text came from then CMU student Matt Spettel, a friend who Madonna had met during his high school years. Their conversation turned into a project, then into a company. Along with Spettel, Madonna is the co-founder of DeltaTrainer, a startup that uses machine learning to track and analyze workouts. We sat down with Gabe to talk to him about the startup life, the tech world, and any nuggets of wisdom he gained along the way.DeltaTrainer came to life when Gabe was starting his junior year at MIT. The initial concept was to log workouts using machine learning, but before taking the time to write the code, Gabe and Matt wanted to make sure their idea had legs. So they built a prototype app they could use to manually log workouts for someone to replicate automatic logging, took it to the local gym, and asked people if they would use it or pay for it. The response was good, and so they started building the app. But as they iterated and tested their app, they noticed that one of the side features - personalized workout generation - was actually more popular with their beta testers than the workout logging. So, they switched gears from workout logging to personalized training, with the workout logs and analysis now serving to feed information to personal trainers and generate personalized workout plans.""We got so used to people being mildly excited about it, but we realized (and all of our advisors kept shoving in our faces) that you need a lot more excitement than that for anything to actually translate into a viable product. [...] The impetus for the pivot was, what are people asking for now that they have some baseline product?""Madonna elaborated: ""If you never pivot, then you're probably just too married to your original idea.""Ok, now that you know the backstory, let's get into some of the best pieces of advice and nuggets of wisdom we picked up while chatting with Madonna!What advice would you have for a student who wants to get into the startup life, but doesn't know where or when to start?""Figure out something that you want to try. It doesn't have to be a billion dollar idea, but just try it. Even if it's the type of thing you can only sell to ten whole people in the world, just go to it with some of those people. Try to get them to buy something that you want to make for them, because it doesn't happen on its own. Nobody's going to drop a startup into your lap.""Even for students who aren't interested in startups, Gabe said everyone should try out independent projects, even if they don't intend to turn them into companies, just to get some practice and experience.What's it been like working with a close friend as a business partner and co-founder?""It's like going from being friends with someone to marrying them - it's just so different. I had never worked with him. I had never even done a project with him at this point, since we hadn't gone to the same school. It's definitely a gamble. At the end of the day, it's a relationship, and it's all about communication.""Did you ever consider dropping out to focus on DeltaTrainer?[He did seriously think about dropping out, and actually took a full semester off! During his semester focusing on the company, he said he spent anywhere from 50-60% of his time working on networking and pitching the project, rather than just building it. Even when he was in school, his academics suffered because of how much time he was spending creating, and he had to seriously consider what to devote his time to. In the end, he decided to finish his degree, and he's glad he did. Degrees are nice to have, of course, but Madonna mentioned that one of the most valuable parts of school for him was networking with professors, TAs, and anyone else he unexpectedly connected with during his time at MIT. It certainly also didn't hurt that he had time to take more advanced classes in machine learning, signal processing, and anything else he needed to build DeltaTrainer!]""School isn't just about the classes. You make connections with people that you won't find anywhere else, so even if only to continue on that journey, you can consider it an investment in your idea and your company. Just like starting a startup, going to school is a really unique opportunity, so you should probably just finish it out.""Our Final ThoughtsSince Gabe and Matt went full-time, DeltaTrainer has been rapidly growing. The user base is doubling every month, in no small part due to gyms closing nationwide. Even as they grow, the pair is focused on maintaining their entrepreneurial spirit, and no end is in sight for the fitness app.Every startup has a unique story, and DeltaTrainer is no exception. That being said, we found some takeaways from Gabe's story that we think could help anyone with an idea. Gabe's biggest refrain was to start working on a project now, and iron out the details once you've started. We also heard about the project changing directions and the value in creating something imperfect to build something better in the long-term, as well as the value of education and time management. In what seems to be a common theme in startup stories, Gabe's story tells us to follow our hearts just as much as our minds, and to put everything we can into creating something that matters to us.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/1*T_zlmrez6qhnEF_odBoAmA.png,https://catalystspacebar.medium.com/on-the-rocks-with-gabe-madonna-co-founder-of-deltatrainer-4c5c5c0d01ee,startups,a23a6c455b927b3255cfd0b21c723d117f0c3ed6e93394ce48545d28
"At 12 Weeks Pregnant, I Convinced Myself Suicidal Thoughts Were Normal","The week I found out I was pregnant, I drove to Target. As I was sitting in the parking lot with a cold brew coffee, I watched a mom unpack her car, struggling to carry an infant car carrier into the store alone.That was the first time I thought about killing myself.I thought about driving my car into a street lamp. I thought about walking across I35 in Austin during rush hour. I thought of several atrocities that would result in me having a miscarriage. I thought about a world in which I or the tiny embryo inside me no longer existed.I sobbed. For me. For the unborn embryo. For how terrible I felt. The more terrible I felt, the more I cried and wanted to cease existing.""Is this normal?"" My husband would ask, concerned.I convinced myself it was normal.I convinced myself it was normal because I knew I wouldn't actually kill myself. In those first weeks, I would teeter between despair and ambiguity. I never felt joy. I thought the joy in my life was in the past. Now it was the burden of responsibility, the burden of motherhood. The choice was no longer a part of my future.I imagined motherhood to be a life of fleeting joy. That my time would no longer belong to me, that I would need to focus on another human and put my needs aside. In those first weeks of my pregnancy, I mourned the life I was losing.The CDC estimates that 1 in 10 women experience postpartum or prenatal depression. These are just the women that report it, we know that for many, seeking help isn't an option.If these thoughts were happening at just 12 weeks pregnant, I feared what would happen after I delivered.I broke up with my OB right after my 20-week anatomy scan. The anatomy scan is the most stressful of all the ultrasounds. It's an hour-long sonogram where all sorts of measurements are taken.After getting the all-clear, I decided I would transfer my care to midwifery. Many think I made the switch because of COVID-19. But the truth is, my husband and I toured the birthing center in February 2019. I didn't pursue it because I thought my OB would be the safer option.I was midway through my pregnancy, and the anxiety attacks were growing exponentially. During prenatal care with my OB, things were quickly changing due to the pandemic.Policies were changing every day. I was calling the hospital to figure out how to adjust my birth plan weekly. It was stressful.The healthcare system in the United States intentionally tells pregnant women that choosing anything other than the highest doctoral degree as a provider for your birth experience is at best brave and at worst unsafe.Each visit to the OB would cause me more distress and anxiety. Not only because of the pandemic but because I needed to get all of my questions answered within the 10 minutes I saw my doctor. It was nerve-racking. I always thought of a new question on the drive home.At my first prenatal appointment with the midwives at Austin Area Birthing Center, I was asked if I had any fears about my upcoming childbirth. I wasn't only given an impersonal survey to gauge my unhappiness. I was directly asked what fears I had and if I wanted to discuss them.I nervously looked at my husband, who was allowed to be with me.""The pain."" I felt silly for saying it.Why did I feel silly for saying it? It's a leading fear among first-time pregnant women, but still, I felt shame.Wait, what?It was a simple statement, but it stuck with me for my entire pregnancy, labor, and delivery. This was not happening to me. It was happening within me. When we stub our toes and feel pain, that's something that happens to us. But birth happens within us. Pain is a part of the plan, and the body is prepared for it. It was my job to prepare my mind for it as well.With the idea that birth happens to us, it's no surprise that unnecessary medical intervention is on the rise in the United States. The CDC reports that nearly 1 in 3 women have a C-Section, with over 25% of them being low-risk surgeries.There's a lot to unpack with that. But it is no question that women are bombarded with negative birth images. Picture someone in the birthing room in any movie, what is the woman doing? She's screaming. Angry. Can't take the pain. It's all very disturbing negative images.I only screamed once during my 7-hour unmedicated delivery.I'll admit before I was pregnant, I thought laboring meant pushing the whole time. I was pregnant and didn't even understand how my baby would come out. This lack of knowledge in the birthing process is capitalized on, making low-risk healthy women feel more comfortable with medical intervention.As I continued care with the midwives, it affirmed my decision to change from obstetric care. My panic attacks were fewer and far between. I could call and talk to someone at all hours of the day. My birth was uncomplicated.Because I have a history of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, I was told that I was at a greater risk for Postpartum Mood Disorders like depression and anxiety. Postpartum anxiety was my biggest fear before I delivered.One particularly tumultuous night, while my daughter was just days old, I called the midwife in despair. She hadn't pooped and I wasn't sure if my milk was feeding her appropriately. I was desperate, I hadn't slept in 24 hours, and I felt like a failure.Within 30 minutes, someone called me. It was 8:00 pm on Friday. I was fighting back the tears of overwhelm. I felt the lump in my throat while talking to her.We went down the list. And she calmly asked if I'd like to come in the next morning.""Saturday?"" I asked in disbelief. I wasn't a woman in labor, so I assumed I had to wait until Monday.I let out a long sob. I was deflated. Body and mind. At that moment, I felt support from a healthcare professional like I've never experienced in my 30 years of life. I was seen five times within my six-week postpartum journey for checkups, check-ins, and lots of lactation consultations.I still think back on that day at Target. I am now that mom struggling with the infant car seat, and I've never felt more joy in my entire life. If there's one thing I tell women afraid of childbirth and motherhood it's this: yes it's stressful and terrifying and time management takes more work, but the joy only seems to grow. I now have more needs, not less. And that is something to celebrate.Like what you're reading?

How Zoom Continues 'Zooming' Upward Amid the Pandemic,"Zoom video conferencing has taken the world by storm. It has in one of the most competitive markets been able to break into it and rise above it.In less than a year after Apple launched their facetime App, less than one month before Microsoft announced that they are willing to pay $8.5 billion for Skype, it has been growing consistently over that last decade specifically during the pandemic and the need for social distancing in 2020 - where people have to stay away from each other, but still need to communicate. Zoom's number of customers has skyrocketed as of June 2020 Zoom's stock price has grown from $68 to over $200.Its usage has increased exponentially as schools, universities and workplaces have shifted online. Zoom has given these organisations and individuals a faster way to communicate relative to audio-only chat and in-person meetings and is not restricted by geography. It has now proven itself to be a vital tool to help businesses communicate more effectively with their customers, suppliers, and manufacturers around the world to communicate real-time.As people across the globe are embracing social distancing by allowing people to meet face to face virtually, zoom has kept many businesses afloat. I recall a time during the lockdown when I had to communicate with stakeholders and team members, I was left with no choice but to open a zoom account to catch up with the team.Zoom is a great example of a bold company led by a true visionary. It's also a great example of what happens when you identify an urgent problem in need of a solution and focus on that solution to the exclusion of everything else. Its Founder, Eric Yuan claims that he started Zoom in college when he, Yuan and his girlfriend attempted to navigate the pitfalls of long-distance dating. Yuan dreamed of a handheld device that would enable two people to see and speak with each other from anywhere in the world. He thought it would be fantastic if there was a device, he could just click a button and see her and talk to her without having to travel.In January 2013, Zoom 1.0 was released to the world. The company timed the announcement to coincide with its $6M Series A round, which was led by Qualcomm Ventures.Eric Yun identified a growing market and applied his passion and experience into creating a customer-oriented highly accessible service because of that they've been able to attract investors and steadily grown into a multi-billion dollar industry leader.One of the most significant updates to the core product to date came in December 2015, with the introduction of Breakout Rooms. This feature allowed hosts to create smaller groups within a larger meeting. Couple of sessions I have attended have used this feature severally to facilitate their training. Because it lets people meet face to face, and provides support for screen sharing, it has become a collaboration catalyst and helps build teams across geographies. It has kept many businesses and employees operating despite the current economy pandemic.A report by Forbes tells us that ""humans process visual information far faster and more aptly than text or audio."" And, relative to audio conferencing, ""62% of executives agree that video conferencing significantly improves the quality of communication. Also, 50% of those surveyed believe video conferencing also improves the degree of understanding."" Whether you're a small business owner or part of a large company, clear communication is critical to understanding projects, setting expectations, and meeting your goals, which makes video conferencing a win, no matter how you look at it.In July 2016, Zoom introduced virtual backgrounds to the core product. Now, Zoom meeting hosts could present in front of a green screen using a video-production technique known as chroma key to create the illusion of hosting a meeting from another location. Virtual backgrounds were far from an urgently needed feature. But it did show that Zoom wasn't averse to developing and introducing fun new features that weren't essential.In 2020, when the demand reached unexpectedly high levels, they were in a position to take advantage of it.Zoom has hosted over 20 billion analyzed meeting minutes and their customer base includes one-third of the fortune 590% of the top 200 US universities.Over the past years, Zoom grew very rapidly. Not only does Zoom build a technology or service but an ecosystem that can integrate with CRM applications like Zendesk or Slack and with other hardware aswell. The best value and return on investment.What set Zoom apart from the competition is how they worked on mobile. Consumers complained about poor video quality and bad connections, the education sector was also driving demand for high-quality video-conferencing solutions which was a critical vulnerability for many web-conferencing companies. Zoom quickly capitalized on this and developed a product that can operate at a 40% connection loss. At that time, many web-conferencing companies, such as Vidyo, were focused on hardware solutions for desktop conferencing.Unlike other similar products, Zoom has been customer-oriented having the customers in mind, it is simple to use having all the desired features set up in an intuitive way they put out a good product. Also, the fact that Zoom is easily accessible to customers and does not necessarily require creating an account even made Zoom seamless to use.Zoom ran seamlessly on all platforms, including iOS and Android devices. The product's screen-sharing functionality was smooth, and the image quality was superb.Likewise, with Zoom, scheduling a meeting has never been easier. When members of my team travel, scheduling meetings is always a challenge. But with the Zoom App already installed on their mobile phones, they can join in from practically anywhere, including taxis, hotel rooms, airports, and more with just a link. It has helped to reduce travel time and costs.Now, the possibility of people embracing more remote work is on the increase. Millennials have recognised that they can get the job done without physically going to the office. In the next 10 - 15 years, Millennials will become business leaders and top executives and remote working will be the absolute norm.Web-conferencing products like Zoom have redefined the entire way we do business and interact today. This change is here to stay.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1476/1*sd_QIBetzHiK2lTYd0Nj_w.jpeg,https://gbemisolaisaacs.medium.com/how-zoom-continues-zooming-upward-amid-the-pandemic-82eacdd3500e,business,a55c9ffd21442569fb8703025ff091166012902fe5e9d19954d14ab4
The Lockdown-O-meter,"Benedetta Cerruti & Xavier Roca-MazaSummaryWhile Italy is slowly exiting its second wave, and struggling to keep the new cases at a manageable level, vaccinations have started worldwide. While in Europe the vaccinations, started the 27th of December 2020, still do not reach a significative percentage of the population, Israel has vaccinated 90% of >60 years old, and around the 40% of total population (1). We propose here a possible proxy for monitoring the vaccine effects on the epidemics.Italy's first and second wave: a comparisonWe have previously shown that different containment measures in different countries may lead to quite similar epidemics figures (2). The robustness of the results led us to try a similar approach to compare the two waves in Italy. The first wave was fought through a harsh national lockdown, starting the 9th of March 2020. When the new cases started to rise again in autumn, the government choose to try to avoid a hard lockdown, and set in place a color code for the different regions of the country instead, according to the combined values of a few KPIs (3). There are three possible levels of alert, namely yellow, orange, and red, corresponding to increasing hardness in the containment measures. We will refer also to this set of measures as 'lockdown' for simplicity.At the beginning of the second wave, the vital question in Italy then was: is this system as effective as a harsh lockdown? will it invert the curve slope? To this purpose, we designed the lockdown-O-meter: we compared the data in a similar way as for same wave/different countries problem explained before (2). The only difference is that we have now a same country/different waves framework.Lockdown starting dates are here:The data of the two waves in Italy before the shift and the normalization look quite different (fig.1): in particular, the second wave in Italy arose much slower than the first one, thanks to the widespread use of face masks, social distancing, and other containment measures that were in use at that time, but not in the ascending branch of the first wave . This also led to a much slower slope down for the second wave.Since the number of deaths for the starting date were this time consistently different, we also now subtracted the number of deaths of the respective first days for each series (97 for the first wave, 446 for the second one, data from ref.(4)). Results are shown in figure 2.Despite the frequent changes in the colors of the regions, the containment measures proved to be equivalent to the first lockdown. Aside of the normalization and shift that make compatible the initial conditions, the curves are indistinguishable within the error bands. No free parameter is involved.What about Israel?Israel is now in lockdown. Also in this case the measures were not taken all at once. On the 27th of December 2020 some measures were taken, and on the 8th of January the lockdown tightened (5). We will consider the following dates for the lockdown: the 8th of January 2021, and in analogy, the 23rd of September 2020 for the earlier wave, when the 18th September 2020 measures were tightened. Israel 'first' wave in March was almost negligible and we will not consider it here. The relative equivalence of the second and third wave lockdowns will be tested below using our approach.In the meanwhile, Israel has vaccinated 90% of >60 years old, and around the 40% of total population (1), and results of the vaccination will hopefully start to be visible at some point on the death toll.Nevertheless, the overlapping of vaccinations and the lockdown risks to make difficult a timely identification of the effects of the vaccinations on the drop of the new cases and/or death toll. In fact, the peak of the deaths arrived at the expected time after the lockdown (around 20 days after the lockdown day). So we can conclude that it was essentially caused by the lockdown itself.We thus propose a similar construction as the one shown for Italy. For Israel, we would like to see a clear difference in the descending part of the curves, that would likely be and effect of the vaccination campaign (see figure 3).What will happen in the descendant part of the curve? We hypothesize here that the containment measures are similar enough to see the same qualitative behavior for the two curves, as observed until now for Israel, and for the entire wave in Italy. There are thus three possibilities:The outcome number 3. can be due either to a failure of our hypothesis, a competition between 1. and 2., or to no visible effects of the vaccines on the death curve, at least in the observed time interval.(1) https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00316-4?utm_source=Nature+Briefing&utm_campaign=700127432c-briefing-dy-20210205&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c9dfd39373-700127432c-46148526(2) https://medium.com/@benedetta.cerruti/the-lockdown-general-and-special-effects-57a74ee74888(3) https://www.youtrend.it/2020/11/11/come-si-decide-quali-regioni-sono-rosse-arancioni-o-gialle/(4) https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19(5) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Israel#cite_note-162(6) https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19",https://miro.medium.com/max/1250/1*PQMqw44UWlv4MLWscT_rJQ.png,https://benedetta-cerruti.medium.com/the-lockdown-o-meter-c62e02e89a21,data-science,a90efa889a588513bd09ad69446eb80168a64263fb35336e1d52776e
Introduction to Data-Driven Shapes in D3.js,"As a devout python fan, I've regrettably shied away from exploring many data visualization tools that are beyond the scope of libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. While perusing the diverse capabilities of D3.js in this visualization gallery, however, I was definitely excited to dip my toes in the water.D3 is a JavaScript library that supports highly customizable and interactive web-based data visualizations. It's short for ""Data Driven Documents,"" and it allows developers to create and manipulate web documents based on data. Having some prior familiarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript will make it easier to get started with D3, but making simple shapes is possible with just the bare basics. This article will introduce some common shapes in D3 - including rectangles, circles, ellipses, lines and text - whose size will be based on numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence. These are just a sample of the many types of shapes that can be easily generated with D3 code.To start making visualizations in D3, you will need a text editor, such as Atom, to edit your code. You'll also want to copy the contents of the latest version of D3.js and paste them into a .js file in your text editor. In addition to the D3 file, you'll need the following:We'll now take a closer look at the contents of each of these files.The HTML file allows you to render visualizations that you create in D3 in your browser. The HTML code we'll use is pretty bare-bones:The first line declares that this is an HTML document, and the second line specifies that the document's contents will be in the English language. The head tags mark the document's head element, which contains its meta data. The text within the title tags is rendered in a browser tab when you open the HTML document in a browser.The next two lines inside the head tags reference the CSS file and the contents of version 6 of D3, respectively. If you choose to use different names for the files you're referencing, the names will need to be updated in these lines. The same goes for the 'shapes.js' file referenced within the document's body, which contains all of its visible contents. Finally, the closing html tag marks the end of the document.CSS is a style sheet language that handles such features as colors, fonts, and spacing in a webpage. In this simple file, we set the margin of the page to zero pixels (no white space around the elements) and the height to 100% (larger elements will fill the page, but not go outside of its bounds to render scrollbars):The 'shapes.js' file is where we'll put the D3 code to create shapes based on the Fibonacci Sequence. This sequence of numbers starts with 0 and 1, and each following number is the sum of the two numbers before it. Below, we define a variable, 'dataArray' that contains the data the shapes will be based on:We'll also create an 'svg' variable with the following code:SVG stands for 'scaleable vector graphics,' and this svg element can be thought of as a blank canvas for D3 shapes. We select the body section of the HTML document, and append (i.e., add) an svg element to it. The height and width attributes are both set to 100% so that shapes appended to this element will fill the entire page.Next, we'll append some rectangles:Here, we select all rectangles that will be appended to the svg element, and the subsequent attributes control their dimensions, color, and position on the page. Chaining .data(dataArray) to the selection binds our Fibonacci data to the rectangles. Notice that the rectangles have a static width of 50 pixels, but that their height is dynamic:That's because the height is based on a function that uses the 'dataArray' bound to the selection. The 'd' and 'i' in the function definition represent individual data points and their position (index) in the array, respectively. You may give these parameters any name you'd like and the function will still have the same output.The function runs through the data array in order. In the shortest, leftmost rectangle you see above, the height is 1*15 or 15 pixels. The second rectangle is also 15 pixels high, the third rectangle is 30 pixels, and so on. The data array is also used to dynamically change the 'x' and 'y' attributes such that the rectangles are centered vertically and evenly spaced horizontally. You can change the values within these attributes' functions to observe how the rectangles' position changes.Next, we'll add some circles to the page:We start by defining a new variable, 'newX,' for later use in the function that sets the horizontal position of the circles. Notice that we select all 'circle.first' elements on the page. We've assigned 'first' to the circles' 'class' attribute because we're going to add multiple sets of circles to the page. Creating classes and specifying elements of a particular class eliminates any confusion about which shapes you intend to select. The circles' radius is determined by the 'r' attribute and is the product of 3 and each data point in the array.We'll now add a second set of circles:Notice that in the image below, the silver circles are spaced closer together than the purple circles, the initial circles in the sequence have a slightly smaller radius, and they have a lower vertical position on the page. These differences are determined by the separate values (both static and dynamic) that have been assigned to attributes of the 'first' and 'second' class of circles:Ellipses are similar to circles, but instead of having a single 'r' attribute, they have both an 'rx' and 'ry' attribute:These attributes allow you to separately adjust the horizontal and vertical radii of the ellipses. The ellipses below have a static vertical radius of 50 pixels and a dynamic horizontal radius that is three times their corresponding value in the data array:It may appear that the vertical radii are decreasing at later points in the sequence, despite being assigned a static value. The steady increase in the horizontal radii create this appearance as the x:y ratio changes.Let's now take a look at some code for adding lines:Here is what each of the new attributes refer to in the below image:Since x2 and y2 are static, you'll notice that all of the lines originate from a single point, but that their length and position from there changes according to the Fibonacci values they have been assigned.Finally, let's add some text!Stroke and stroke width, as with other shapes, refer to the outline color and width for the shape. The 'text-anchor' attribute allows you to adjust the text alignment, which here is the start, or left side, of the page. The '.text' line adds each data point in the data array to the text. Below, this code has been reused to include multiple lines of the Fibonacci numbers in different colors and different y positions on the page:The Fibonacci sequence isn't meaningful data, but it's useful for illustrating how the size, spacing, and other attributes of D3 shapes can be dynamically updated based on data in an array. This article has not even scratched the surface of all that's possible with shapes in D3, but I hope it encourages other beginners to join me in exploring this powerful visualization library!",https://miro.medium.com/max/5420/1*GmMmtqfn9WxKKqj1Ox9isQ.jpeg,https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-data-driven-shapes-in-d3-js-8c169a3477b3,design,a96b9db4251d709c44e83ad51a27ffee6ed2bf234b0ad350d1e6317f
PeerBoard Review,"Over the past year, I've worked hard to transform a series of valuable, yet disconnected posts, guides, comments, discussions, and newsletter issues into a true online community.While I had figured out my CMS (WordPress), my main content marketing platform (Medium), and my newsletter delivery tool (Substack), I had not successfully incorporated a private forum or chat.Sure, I run a large group of Medium writers, built on Facebook. But not everyone uses Facebook, and it is very hard to follow the various conversations as a group gets larger.I tried creating a more private chat group for my premium Blogging Guide subscribers, by utilizing Slack, but ultimately, this just resulted in a lot of people sending me direct messages (as opposed to truly discussing issues bloggers and writers face, in a group setting).So I've been experimenting with a few different ideas for building my own true private online community, for Blogging Guide subscribers.This was partly inspired by a post from Alexander Boswell, which I found really insightful:The main requirements in my search for a community building platform were:These requirements led me down a rabbit hole investigating the latest online community management systems. There are many options that meet some of these requirements, but there was only one platform that truly checked all of the boxes - PeerBoard.I first heard about it nearly a year ago, and have seen it pop up on passion economy platforms like Indie Hackers and Product Hunt (where it was the #1 product of the week in July 2020).With PeerBoard, you can create a subreddit-like space right on your own website, so your community doesn't have to leave your site to connect.Instead of the traditional forum layout, which can be tough to navigate, PeerBoard offers a single categorized news feed that operates like a Facebook feed (but is much easier to navigate than a chaotic Facebook group).The PeerBoard algorithm puts the high-value posts at the top of the feed based on engagement and recency, so community members never miss a community update or the best posts.A complete white label solution- Use your custom theme color, add a logo, customize categories and topics for a fully branded experience. For example, I was able to use my official brand elements (specific hex color purple, logo, and icon):Even then, it's nice that PeerBoard's starter plan will provide you with pretty much all of the features that the typical small online community builder would want.There is also a 30 day trial, so you can test the paid plans risk free.Building and maintaining an online community is challenging. You need to identify your target audience, create a space where they feel comfortable interacting, moderate that space, and constantly promote your community to drive new members in.However, successful online communities are one of the most sought after digital commodities for a reason - online communities provide tremendous value to community members, while also offering the hosts the opportunity to play a major role in industry specific discussions and become a subject matter expert.In an ever-crowded internet, private online communities are increasingly the best way to access the people, information, and content that you are searching for.PeerBoard makes this process incredibly simple, and is definitely an option worth considering if you want to create an online community.- Casey BotticelloThanks for reading this article!

Introducing Transformers Interpret - Explainable AI for Transformers,"Model explainability and state-of-the-art research seem to constantly be engaged in a tug of war. Complex models are difficult to interpret and simple models are often much easier to understand.Explainable AI is one of the most vital emerging subfields in machine learning today. For both ethical, practical, and - in the corporate world - legal reasons we must be able to explain the inner workings of so called ""black box"" models, it's vital to the long term success of AI's adoption into our lives.Research in explainable AI is ongoing and there are a number of fantastic projects and groups out there doing work. The library on which transformers interpret is built is called Captum which is a package designed for model interpretability in pytorch. What I love about Captum is that it effectively combines all the leading research in explainable AI into a single package, and of course it is optimized for pytorch which is a big plus. While transformers interpret is focused solely on NLP, Captum is multi modal and works with text, computer vision, and tabular data. The team at Captum have also done a fantastic job giving write ups of all the algorithms they are using throughout the package, it's certainly worth checking out if you are interested in understanding the internals of transformers interpret.Much like the design philosophy behind Hugging Faces Transformers package transformers interpret was designed with ease of use at the forefront. It is opinionated in its selection of attribution methods and how it summarizes attributions. All of this allows end users to get word attributions and visualizations for their model's output in just 2 lines of code. Right now the package has support for all models with sequence classification heads - so (should) work for all classification models. Support for question answering models and NER models is planned.Let's jump into a hands on example. To install the package:With the package installed we are going to start by instantiating a transformers model and tokenizer. I've chosen to go with distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english it's a distilbert model finetuned on a sentiment analysis task, I chose this model mostly because it is popular and lightweight compared to some of the other behemoths out there.With both the model and tokenizer in hand we can now go about creating an explainer, and it's pretty simple:That's all it takes. To get the attributions for the sentence ""I love you, I like you"" we simply call:If we want to know which class was predicted:To see the raw numeric attributions:This is interesting we can see that the model is placing a significant amount of attention on ""I love you"" while ""I like you"" is not as important. Given how self-attention works this seems to fit with the intuition that the word ""love"" is increasing the importance of the words surrounding it's context.The numeric attributions can be difficult to read especially for much longer sentences. The package also has an inbuilt visualize method built on top of Captums' visualization to give easy to interpret visual explanations of word attributions.If you are working in a jupyter notebook calling the method will display the visualization in-line, if you are running from a script simply pass a html filename and you can view the output file in your browser.This will produce an output that looks like this:If you want to generate further attributions there is no need to create another explainer, you can simply pass some new text to the existing explainer and new attributions will be createdYou are not limited to generating attributions for the predicted class, this is the default behavior but can be overridden by passing either a class name or index of the class you would like attributions for:This is particularly useful for multiclass classification models.Below is a full working example of the above code.At the time of writing the package only supports classification models. However question answering models are also very possible to implement as are NER models and both of these are currently planned features.I'm also interested in exploring the feasibility of explanations for causal language models and multiple choice models.Captum has a variety of attributions methods, the default in transformers interpret is Layer Integrated Gradients, with the attribution scores effectively being a summary or average of each layers' attributions. Captum recently added support for performing Layer Integrated Gradients on specific layer(s) of the transformer, so I am hoping to add the option for users to get attributions on a layer by layer basis which would allow even deeper inspection of a models' internals.Check out the repo for any updates regarding future releases.If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to make a contribution (please do 😁) please get in touch.I'd also highly suggest checking out Captum if you find model explainability and interpretability interesting. They are doing amazing and important work.Thanks for reading!",https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*-sTzbSih-Hv7fXBO,https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-transformers-interpret-explainable-ai-for-transformers-890a403a9470,artificial-intelligence,a609c6e21830bf2eb70ebfb918327b9cb73cc469a3e2855aeb8e0604
10 Ways of Crafting Offers to Get Sales-Even as a New Business,"Tom Monaghan started Dominos with one location in 1960. The business was hard, pizza was one of the most competitive businesses back then. In yellow pages, it was the only food item that had its own category.There were local nearby pizza joints in average populated areas. This made penetrating the market a near-impossible task. In efforts to expand, Dominos almost went bankrupt. They were facing several franchise disputes.In a nutshell, Dominos was on the verge of collapsing. Then one brilliant idea saved it and made it one of the most popular pizza vendors. The brilliant idea was an offer.The offer worked so well and placed Dominos in a dominant position.What made the offer so successful is that it factored in a tired, hungry, time constraint employee or employer. A hungry American with not more than 30 minutes to wait for pizza.Let us now look at different ways you can craft your offers.These kinds of offers are great. They can be used to welcome new customers, encourage repeat buyers, or even encourage more spending by buyers.In certain businesses, they can be a game-changer. They are applicable to both brink and mortar businesses as well as online businesses.ExamplesFree natural fruit juice for orders above $15-Restaurant.Spend $25 to receive a $100 coupon-Google Ads.These offers can be very powerful. They have been a pillar in multi-billion dollar SaaS businesses.They come in all shapes and forms, free trials, free forever packages, free courses, etc.ExamplesGet 3 months of Spotify Premium for free-SpotifyFree forever up to 2000 contacts-MailchimpOther examples include Convertkit, Skillshare, Youtube Premium, Coursera, Netflix, etc.These offers can totally change the dynamics of a business. These changes tend to be positive to both the consumer and the business.They work on basis of yearly flat fees or monthly subscriptions. In exchange, buyers get exclusive deals and discounts.It's rumored that membership offers can totally change the eCommerce business model. If it happens, late adopters will suffer for it. Costco is at the forefront of it.ExamplesCostco membership-Huge savings when shopping, savings when using Costco servicesAmazon Prime-Fast free shipping, exclusive deals, and entertainment.Paypal heavily relied on invite offers to scale in its early years. When inviting a new user, both the inviter and invitee would earn $20 dollars.This ensured PayPal growth was steady and its users kept increasing. The ripple effect from inviting users turned into an unstoppable force that strengthened its foundation. This also influenced mouth-to-mouth advertising which later strengthened PayPal's positioning.When used appropriately, invite offers can be very powerful in scaling a business.An Insane affiliate program is one of the quickest ways to grow or scale a business. It attracts the attention of publishers and marketers. This can create a ripple effect and free mouth to mouth advertising.ExamplesSiteground invite offerMailchimp - Both the inviter and invitee earns a $30 bill credit. The more you invite the more you earn.These offers can work as additional value or bonuses. They are mostly used to avail related products a specific buyer might require.They are a good way for marketers to leverage each other's customer base. They can also be used to introduce new products into the market.ExamplesCourse Hero discount exclusive for amazon prime student subscribers.Skillshare annual subscription exclusive benefits.These come in all shapes and forms. They are applicable in almost any kind of business.Microsoft highly uses these offers. They happen during specific months of the year. Such offers massively boost sales. The best products go out of stock within hours.The majority of e-commerce brands currently use them to boost sales. They are basically in the form of limited-time deals, sales promotions, deals of the day, etc. Some of these brands include Amazon, eBay, Best Buy, Walmart, among others.ExamplesAmazon limited-time deal and deal of the day.Microsoft winter salesMost of the big brands have offers for certain groups or demographics. It's a way for a brand to show concern or give back. These groups can include, students, kids, nurses, military, teachers, firefighters, etc.Showing concern creates a bond between a brand and its customers.These offers can also be used to create brand awareness and foster mouth-to-mouth advertising thereby increasing brand positioning.Brink-and-mortar exampleLet's say a restaurant observes that there is a low turnout of couples on Mondays and Tuesdays. They then introduce an offer.One person charges for couples on Mondays and Tuesdays - RestaurantWith time, you can tell such a restaurant will be flocking with couples on Mondays and Tuesdays. This has the advantage of more sales, increasing brand awareness, and fostering free mouth to mouth advertising. Ultimately, this increases brand positioning and pushes the brand to a higher height.From such an offer, the restaurant is unlikely to make profits on Mondays and Tuesdays. Despite this, the long term advantages of such an offer by far outweigh the benefit of making profits on Mondays and Tuesdays.When used appropriately, demographic offers can push a brand to greater heights.ExamplesHeroes get 30% off-AdidasStudents and teachers save over 60%-Adobe Creative CloudThese are applicable to both consumer goods and online businesses. They act as an incentive to buy more. The incentive can be in form of an additional free item, discount on the next item purchase, etc.In consumer goods and e-commerce, they can be used to introduce a new brand into the market. In some instances, they can be used to get rid of old products to give room for newer products.With SaaS, you are billed the time you use a service. In such a situation, these kinds of offers tend to have huge discounts on the length of subscription you purchase upfront.A monthly subscription will cost you more in a year compared to purchasing a yearly subscription upfront. Subsequently, a two-year subscription bought upfront might be cheaper compared to buying two one-year subscriptions upfront.ExamplesGrammarly - Purchasing one-year subscription upfront gets you 61% off.Staples - Buy 4, get one freeTheir main purpose is to get the very first users of a product or a service. Depending on the goals of a company, they can be offered to the first 2000 users or the first 100,000 users.They come in all shapes and forms. The below two forms are far more common.Appsumo is one of the best places to find one-time subscription fee software. On the other hand, product hunt is among the best places to get completely free software.One-time subscription software and completely free software can also exist independently without being on the two platforms.ExamplesRank Math (WordPress SEO plugin)-The official plugin release date was on 19th November 2018. The plugin was completely free. On 12th November 2020, two years later, they introduced Rank Math Pro. A subscription-based software.Other examples include Keywords Everywhere and Ubersuggest. These were previously completely free tools but now they are subscription-based software.Offers can be a really powerful way of introducing new products into the market. You need to craft offers that are in line with your current situation. They should also align with your goals and principles as a company.In the case of Rank Math, instead of having a free trial or an insane invite system. Going completely free was their strategy and it worked. For a start-up with limited funds, going free for two years while maintaining a development team may not be feasible.Having a diversified approach when looking at problems to finding solutions is the way to follow.Namecheap is one of the most popular hosting providers. How did they come to the limelight? Offers. They were known for their cheap domain names. This was also reflected in their name - Namecheap.This helped them start a relationship with a customer. The power lies in that once a customer uses your services, they are more likely to buy from you. The trust is there. At that point, they have already felt your value.They carried the same philosophy to their hosting and the other services they provide. Their main aim is to get you in.Grammarly is another good example. Having hooked you with a free forever package, the driver of sales in the backend are their offers.They have very high conversion rates, 20-30%. The dynamic of it is brilliant. A free forever plan, and insane offers in their email sequences or Newsletters.ExamplesNamecheap new customer offers.Grammarly new customer offers. Backend offers from their newsletters.Loyalty programs act as an incentive to both new customers and existing customers. They can be very handy to keep customers coming back. They motivate existing customers to keep shopping.Basically, they build a loyal fan base and improve customer retention.They come in many shapes and forms. Loyalty punch cards, double or triple loyalty points during a specific period, sign up points for new customers, personalized offers from purchase history, etc.ExamplesSephora-Loyalty pointsUber-Loyalty pointsUber loyalty points benefits.An offer can be created in more than one way. i.e. an offer can be above price point offer at the same time be a new customer's offer only. You can be as creative as you want. What is important is that the offer works.Brilliant offers can be very powerful. A single offer can single-handedly transform a business from a struggling company to a multi-billion dollar company.For an offer to work so well, it needs to be what your customers want to hear. This elicits a natural response from your customers.Uber marketer Mark Joyner has written a whole book on the topic of offers. The book is called The Irresistible Offer. He demonstrates that irresistible offers build hugely successful businesses.When creating offers it's good to know where they fall. An offer created on the main offering is likely to have a huge impact compared to offers created on additional secondary offerings.The information shared here will help fast-track you to creating great offers. All the best.",https://miro.medium.com/max/910/1*HdDDPJrh_L655VCzzsKVww.png,https://medium.com/swlh/10-ways-of-crafting-offers-to-get-sales-even-as-a-new-business-c2eec342e8c7,marketing,a697dc0cb60506c6c9508611957061c57a99648a06be215ed30bd255
How to Disrupt Crowded and Outdated Industries By Empowering Your Users to Tell Incredible Stories,"Storytelling is incredibly powerful. It is the foundation of what makes us human, how we live and find our place in the world, how we build our identity, it informs who we spend time with, and the actions and conversations we chose to participate in.Storytelling underpins humanity. It is our superpower, and what defines us. It enables us to drive incredible change, and affect countless people's lives through the decisions we make.When it comes to building and designing businesses, products, and experiences, it is what elevates the best above the rest.But why is that?At their most fundamental, and throughout history both modern and ancient, stories have taught us how to survive. Stories were told between tribes, between civilisations and between neighbours, cautionary tales, warnings of storms approaching or offers of wisdom and advice. Brian and Jesse from Belief Agency talk more about what we can learn from stories in times of crisis in their podcast series 'You Are A Storyteller', and Lisa Cron puts it succinctly and simply in the intro to her book 'Wired For Story':It is useful to think of stories not just as works of fiction, novels, films or television shows, but also as the conversations we have with each other, the things we see and the people we meet, and the beliefs, views and ideas of those we surround ourselves with.These are cues that we pick up on subconsciously, absorbing and shaping our perception of the world around us, teaching us how to survive, and how to change and adapt in times of crisis or upheaval.Stories go beyond simply helping us survive however...As human beings, we are incapable of not telling stories, from the way we dress, to the hobbies we choose to partake in. These tell stories to others that indicate who we are as people, who we want them to think we are, what we care about, and what we communicate to others. They give us a sense of purpose, a sense of self.We also see ourselves reflected through other people, both in comparison and in contrast. The people around us effectively acting as clones, representing the best and worst of ourselves, teaching us what we should and shouldn't do, showing us what might happen if we did the same thing, or took the same approach to a problem. This is a storytelling principle called 'clone characters', which I go into more detail about in my article about how they can help us design better products.But how do we take this and apply it to disrupting and redefining crowded or outdated industries? The answer is simple, but often incredibly difficult to execute.Businesses and products in outdated and crowded industries often have one thing in common: there is a gap between the story the industry is telling, and the story their users want to tell.In order to disrupt and redefine, the solution often comes from identifying the disconnected story being told, identifying the story your users want to tell, and designing a product and experience that significantly delivers on the latter rather than the former.Take Lemonade for example, who in the last 5 years have completely flipped the insurance industry on it's head, by helping insurance users tell the story they want to tell, instead of reinforcing the negative stories users previously told about insurance. Daniel Schrieber goes into more detail about how they did this on YourHeights.com founder Dan Murray-Serter's podcast 'Secret Leaders', but the simple explanation of their success comes down to a radical challenge to the existing narrative told by users, of insurance company products.The story insurance customers were telling themselves (and others):This leads to users feeling abandoned, and cheated, when the very nature of 'insurance' as a basic concept is incredibly altruistic. We all contribute for the collective good, and when one of us needs it, the money is available to help them.Lemonade took that narrative switch and ran with it, making insurance:This simple narrative switch has contributed a significant part of Lemonade building the most disruptive, socially-conscious and successful insurance company that we have seen in decades.And there are still plenty of industries, both crowded and outdated, that are ready to be disrupted and changed. Education and healthcare being the first that spring to mind.What it boils down to, is a drastic shift in focus, from the interests of the industry and the company, to the interests and needs of the user, and the focus on delivering a powerful narrative change that empowers the user to tell a different story. This is the very foundation of user or human-centred design.Redefining supplements as food for your brain, as a part of supporting mental wellbeing and living a healthy life.Helping users who don't know anything about keeping plants alive, or about plants themselves, both keep them alive and learn about them through guided experiences.Redefining taxis, putting the power in the hands of the rider AND the driver, allowing riders to hail a taxi from any location, at a price they want to pay, and allowing drivers to work the hours they want to, and build their own reputation through reviews.Redefining the media, by allowing users to shape the world narrative, giving them power alongside more often propaganda-led or politicised traditional media sources.Redefining short term rentals and stays, by empowering users to find somewhere to stay that is safe, unique or reasonably priced, and empowering rental users to have more control over when and how they rent their property or rooms, and to create a unique experience to offer guests.Don't get me wrong, the examples given here are perfect, they certainly aren't without significant, problematic and even unforgivable flaws, and the press surrounding many of them over the last few years is certainly indicative of that.What they do well though, the thing that has led them to success, is to redefine the narrative of an entire industry. They put the story that the user wishes to tell at the front and centre of the product.Storytelling is the key, so let's empathise, analyse and define how we need to shape the new narrative for our users, understand how we can empower them, and help them feel positive about their interactions and experiences. That is how we disrupt and build longevity, that is how we succeed in stagnant or outdated industries, and that is how we shape the future for the better.Storytelling is everything.",,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-disrupt-crowded-and-outdated-industries-by-empowering-your-users-to-tell-incredible-stories-b540a841165e,ux,a5197f51c398ff644fb78ea4636fa786148ef005234df0bf007a059a
A Simple Way To Troubleshoot a Broken Brain,"When your phone or computer malfunctions, what's the first troubleshooting step you take?Do you open more tabs or run more applications? Contact your cellular provider or search forums for relevant solutions? What about smacking your device to knock some sense back into it?No, you restart it. Unplug - wait - and plug it back in.It's automatic. We immediately jump to this troubleshooting step as if years of electronic device-usage tattooed an instruction manual to our minds. We do this for phones, computers, tablets, TVs, gaming consoles, routers, lighting fixtures, vacuums, stereos, garage doors, and whatever else relies on electricity to function.So, why don't we try this approach when our brains aren't working?Unproductive days happen. We're human - we get tired, distracted, disinterested, and unmotivated. It doesn't matter what the source of the problem is - noisy neighbors, lack of sleep, overstuffed inboxes, endless work assignments, or financial stress. What's important is how we respond.I feel like the typical person fights unproductivity with more unproductivity, like dousing a fire with gasoline instead of water. I do this all the time. When I struggle to focus on my daily tasks, I mindlessly reach for my phone and purposelessly peruse social media - or push aside pangs of guilt and turn on Netflix.That only exacerbates the problem.Instead, I've tried to follow the standard instruction manual's first step:Power off the device.Obviously, I don't mean literally turn your brain off. A coma does not rid you of your problems. Instead, the goal is to stop thinking, clear your conscience, and reset your brain. We want to temporarily forget to-do lists, impending deadlines, and any other stressors.The methods for inducing a state of clarity aren't revolutionary - they're pretty mundane activities. Take a shower. Nap. Exercise. Color. Do a puzzle if that's your thing. The common theme is leisurely activities in low-stress environments.Walking for 30 to 40 minutes is my personal favorite. It's not strenuous to the point that I need to shower afterward, but it still constitutes aerobic exercise, which reduces stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol and produces endorphins - our natural mood elevators. Plus, taking a stroll around the park is much more convenient and replicable than sporadic showers or naps.While I walk, I focus on my surroundings - the trees, buildings, horizon, people mulling about - the visual stimuli induce a trance-like state. Intermittently, I take deep breaths and close my eyes. I turn my undivided attention to the sounds of the world. I stop thinking and only absorb my immediate environment. I feel my brain stop whirring like an overheated computer.A wave of clarity washes over me. It's refreshing.To me, it's like meditation. It allows me to appreciate the aspects of life I take for granted and tackle problems with a clear head.It's easy to fall victim to life's neverending to-do list. We're so enmeshed in daily responsibilities that we forget to step back from the grind, take a breather, and reset our brains.Listen to your internal instruction manual: power down once in a while.",https://miro.medium.com/max/6000/1*bUu_IKixO-GpTBG086LS5w.png,https://carterkilmann.medium.com/a-simple-way-to-troubleshoot-a-broken-brain-785e7eeee5c0,productivity,a6210df416a24a87de828e29d579ad6850f764415766d9f369cb1b71
How to find and keep a valuable mentor,"The power of mentorship is clear. People with mentors advance in their careers faster, perform better, and tend to be happier in their current jobs. Despite all the benefits of having a mentor, and even though 76% of people think mentors are important, only 37% have one (Source).Asking someone to be your mentor is awkward no matter how many times you do it and there isn't much formal training on how to go about it. In order to successfully transition from a classroom teacher to a senior designer in three years, I had to be vulnerable and ask for help. I am fortunate enough to have had many mentors that helped me (and continue to help me) along the way. Curious how you can get valuable mentors? Keep reading.The first step to kicking off a good mentorship is looking within. Evaluate what areas you want to grow - visibility, communication, influence, presence, etc. If you are currently searching for a job, think of your job search like a funnel - reaching out to people, the recruiter call, the team phone interview, the final assessment. At what point does your success rate start to go sour? That is where you might want to consider asking for help. Try to get specific as possible about what you want to accomplish, and by when.Next, consider writing a ""job description"" of your perfect mentor. Write out the specific qualifications they would need to help you achieve your goal. Maybe you need someone who can make introductions, provide specific feedback on a project, coach you to learn a new skill, help you build confidence to navigate a complicated situation or provide perspective on a specific experience you are dealing with like career-switching. What specific merits or evidence must this person have to serve you best?Once these requirements are clearly defined, you are equipped to start your search.Although mentors can be found literally everywhere (your current company, LinkedIn network, events, friends-of-friends, etc), I wouldn't recommend asking someone to be your mentor right off the bat. Just like when interviewing for a job, you need to access the candidate's skills and ""culture fit"" and also their willingness to work with you. So just start by reaching out to people for a quick meeting or phone call.Once you find someone willing to talk with you, here's how you can ensure you leave a good impression:Respect their time: When scheduling, don't be vague and just say you want to chat. Help them understand what you hope to get out of our conversation and why they are the best person to help you. Then, I recommended you provide your availability or a Calendly link so they can select a time that is best for them. This will make it so much easier for them and reduce the back and forth. Once the date/time is set, select a location convenient for them because it takes time to travel. Send the calendar invite yourself and include any relevant information in the notes. Come on time and be prepared to lead a productive conversation. Share what you hope to gain perspective on and listen to what they have to say.Keep it enjoyable: You may have a thousand questions, but try not to overwhelm your potential mentor in your first meeting. Keep it cool and don't make it all about you. Show genuine interest in them and center the conversation around their experiences. One thing I do to help me is I put a placeholder in my notebook before I meet with a potential mentor so I make sure I jot down their specific interests and curiosities. It could be anything - their hobbies, back pain problems, desire to find a local hiking route. Remember you're here to learn from their experiences.Show appreciation: When meeting with potential mentors, I always try to jot down notes to show the person I'm talking to I'm hearing great nuggets of information that I want to hold onto. This validates them and their abilities to provide helpful advice. Show them they are not wasting their time on you; you're taking it all in. Then once the meeting is done, follow up with a thank you email mentioning a specific takeaway from the conversation and how it has/will impact you in the future. This helps them know the time given was valued and appreciated, increasing our chance to connect again in the future.So you had a successful conversation and are now wondering how to initiate another one. Sure, you can reach out thanking them again, but why not use this opportunity to provide value? Remember how your initial conversation was not all about you and how you intentionally tried to learn about their personal interests? Great! Use those handy notes you jotted down about your potential mentor and show them you don't just want a one-way relationship. Try sending an article or resource relating to a topic they showed interest in to show you genuinely care about them and want to help them achieve their goals too. I'd recommend doing this within the first two weeks of your initial meeting as a friendly reminder you're still around.Next, you'll want to keep the mentorship-type of conversation going by proposing another conversation based on your last encounter. You want to be careful to not do this too immediately because it may communicate that you didn't give the feedback they just gave you, or the strategy suggested, a real try. Make sure you try what they give you feedback on before reaching out again. When it seems appropriate, you can give updates on what you've done since you last met and ask to continue your conversation on topic X, or introduce a new topic. Let them know you'll come prepared with specific questions to hope to gain their perspective on. With more interactions, they'll learn how committed you are to growing and achieving your goal. Hopefully, they'll continue to feel valued through your appreciation and continuation of reaching out. After a few conversations, you'll want to shift to a more formal ask for mentorship.From my experience, making an intentional, yet flexible, proposal and giving them time to digest it works well. After a session, I'd send an email asking if they'd be willing to meet <frequency> for the <duration> to help me achieve a goal or solve a problem. I share how much I've already learned from them, the impact their continual support will make, and how I'd appreciate any time they are willing to give. Then, I wait for a response back.Making this formal ask is nerve-wracking, but I'm proud of you for being here and trying to learn how you can get a mentor to help you grow in your career. Just remember this - although being asked to be someone's mentor is a big time commitment, it is also a big compliment. Regardless if the person you reach out to says yes or no, the ask is generally received positively, so I'd go for it. Even if you think that person couldn't possibly have time to mentor, just ask and leave that decision to them.Thank you for reading this article and a huge thank you to all my amazing mentors that helped me along the way. If you've successfully found and kept a mentor, comment below any other tips and tricks that worked well for you. If you are looking for a mentor, keep it up! And if you are considering becoming a mentor, stay tuned for the next article - How to be a valuable mentor.",https://miro.medium.com/max/188/0*9Z2zKEKXm5KUWqv2,https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-find-and-keep-a-valuable-mentor-54a6af51b2e9,ux,a65730ee8c0e9a34ea69eb2ac8682d209e0a641b7370d11df16b3fef
Creating datasets for machine learning. My own lessons and experience.,"Today I wanted to be more on the technical side in the core of Machine learning and data science which is Data.Without data, Machine learning, data science, and all these fields wouldn't exist, in fact, these fields are popular now because we have huge amounts of data being generated daily, a fun fact is for some use cases there's still no enough data.So what is a dataset?The need for datasetsWithout data, there's no machine learning nor analytics. We need data to gain business insights, understand our problem, make hypothesis, guess what model architectures to use, and train our ML system.Diving into our subject, as a data scientist why do I need to learn how to create my own dataset?I'm speaking here from the point of a pure personal experience and I'm not a working professional, yet.1- Simply the problem you're solving or the business may not have an available ready to use dataset that you'd just download and get to work.When working on a project and before getting excited about the idea make sure that you have access to training data or at least know how will you create a data set. For me sometimes I just LOVE to get excited about projects where I'll create my own data set.This faced me during working on my graduation project, the problem we're tackling is specific to Delta Egypt, there were no ready to use data sets, so we went ahead to read research papers on how to create a dataset with the specifications required in an automated manner ;)2- It's a very useful skill for every data scientist or ML engineer and not limited to data engineers.Learning these skills will boost your skills and resume and will also help you with personal projects or if you're working with a small team.3- It's fun -at least I think so-I had much fun creating a data set for images and label it on my own, a music features dataset, and a music genres dataset. I learned each time and gained domain knowledge every time as well as learning to use new tools and dealing with different APIs.Formulating the problemAs I said, before getting too excited about the project's flashy idea, pose these questions. These 3 questions are everything and are EQUALLY IMPORTANT once answered everything else is easy.1- What is the solution I'm building?Am I building a chatbot, a web app, a computer vision app, or what?2- Where can I get training data?Is it available open-source, will I pay for it, is it stored in a database and need preprocessing, will I collect it myself, will I collect and label it? Know everything.3- How much domain knowledge I have?Building a medical diagnosis system? What do I know about medical diagnosis or will I contact a domain expert ""in this case a doctor"", Building a sign language translation system? Do I even know sign language? and so on.Invest in this stage as much as you can so that you don't lose time and resources. Try to document as many insights as you can to know exactly what you're searching for.1- If you're new to ML/data science, use data sets from Kaggle or any other resource to learn more about data distributions and hierarchies and so on, don't just hop into this as it's kinda advanced and needs more experience and sense of the problem, the solution, the available products and reading research papers or using other tools like Apache stuff, AWS, SQL.2- If your problem can be solved without this hazard just download the data set and don't waste your time.3- Ask an expert when you get stuck, actually this is the most important thing to do, experience cuts down more than 90% of the time you could spend just searching and being lost -also a personal experience-4- Don't be grumpy about it, ML is not about building models with a few lines of Keras, it's about learning from DATA so if your team decided to go with that option and you're against it either don't complain about how hard and time consuming it is or just do something else.5- SHARE what you learnt and how did you create it, oh my god this would've saved me months of searching, the research community is not that kind tbh I read nearly +30 research papers just to know how they created a change detection dataset and no one bothered to illustrate or share the code, until I encountered someone who published a paper for his own dataset and guess what he wrote only 4 lines on how he did it, luckily I understood those 4 lines.6- Finally have fun and focus on the end goal which is expanding your skillset. It's all about growing and creating cool apps that solve human problems, isn't it?Thank you, please feel free to share your thoughts with me and to request any topics fill in this form ❤",https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*ZmFkM9eejH4F7MhtkhrpEw.png,https://medium.com/@nouranalimohammed/creating-datasets-for-machine-learning-my-own-lessons-and-experience-44e118b15d6a,data-science,a7190615b74c645cf1ea9c640a104e8a6aed7e4cc2903463f076b9d7
A Super Simple Organizing Strategy That Can Save You Time,"Let's not confuse being organized as being tidy.I'm tidy. I can stack books, put papers in folders and create order like no one's business. I am a clutter-less phenom.What I struggle with is being organized.I only happen to know where everything in my house resides because I'm the cleaning crew. I have a lot of neat and tidy spaces.Yes, it may seem like a waste of time at first, especially when we want to dive into a project or start something so we can finish it that much quicker. That's how we often make the mistake of not being fully ready. We're left open to unforeseen roadblocks (i.e. looking for things, researching when we should be writing, recording videos on the fly only to do them again and again.)My office corkboard is a wasteland of sticky notes, and my computer's desktop is littered with random files, photos, PDF's and docs (contained chaos) that I want to get to, but because they're not organized, I don't see them as a priority.In my research, it's becoming apparent that when you take the time to organize your surroundings, you're able to function at a higher level.And here's the kicker. Your organizing doesn't have to result in neat and tidy piles with nary a dust bunny. (Again, that's just being tidy.) Many intellects and uber-successful people have messy offices, but that doesn't mean they don't know where things are. Every brain works differently.Oftentimes we use the excuse ""I have no time"" because we honestly feel like we're running around without a handle on anything. Time slips away and before we know it, the kids are getting off the bus or logging off from their digital classrooms and we're like, wtf, already?Taking a look at where you spend your time is a form of organization. You have a lot to do, a lot to fit into a day - and what happens is those things that are beneficial to you get left behind. They're the sticky note that's buried under 20.If you're organizationally-challenged like me, a perfect starting point to begin getting things in order and checked off your list is to begin with the rule of three.The rule of three is every morning, as soon as I wake up and before life has a chance to rudely intervene and grab all my attention, I write down the top three most important things I have to do that day.It could be 1) write my newsletter and schedule it for delivery. 2) Go to the store and pick up a birthday card for my dear friend who is hitting a milestone! 3) Get in 20 minutes of exercise.These aren't going to take me all day obviously, but it's these little reminders that keep me from being that person who forgets the birthday, who puts off exercise yet again, and who isn't getting the little things done in my business that helps to keep it engaging and fun for me.There are of course bigger projects and many of you are full-time professionals but this can still be a useful habit. Categorize your lists into two if you like, one for business and one for life. It's important however to not let it overwhelm you. Once it does that, you're not starting your day off with the right mindset of ""I can do this! I can get all these things done with ease.""Keeping the number of tasks to three keeps you feeling that everything is manageable. You're creating room for more while limiting room for stress.Being in the present moment, and doing one task at a time is an amazing feeling. It sounds simple, but it's actually not as simple as it seems. That's because many of us aren't paying attention, we're doing one thing while thinking about another.This is another way we compromise our organizational skills because when your brain is focused on one thing, and your physically doing something else, you begin formulating a to-do list on the fly.You're never going to remember a to-do list on the fly! And it's only going to add stress and a sense of urgency, not to mention pull you away from what you're currently doing - in a half-assed manner I might add.When you're not there, your work suffers.If you don't believe me, try cleaning out and organizing a closet and see how you walk away from that task with a big, ol' smile on your face. (And I bet you're not going to be able to resist telling the first person you see about how great the closet looks now!)AM Costanzo is a wellness coach, a motivational junkie, loves a-ha moments, and loves to help people feel strong, powerful, and downright fabulous in body and mind!",https://miro.medium.com/max/5952/1*xfhIJL9kwRM4Gki9d0_pKg.jpeg,https://am-costanzo.medium.com/lets-not-confuse-being-organized-as-being-tidy-b7bc60dd84a1,productivity,a010593580471b8128b6baf958b0b90e5986b70b7addcd18bd1867de
A Theoretical and Practical Review of Elasticity and Pricing Strategy,"Pricing is a complex topic, and every business in the world has to deal with it. Whether you are a nine-year-old with a lemonade stand or a transnational corporation, price is the mechanism that you use to operate your business. You provide a good or service. A customer pays the price for that good or service.Over the last twenty-five years or so, I have had the privilege to work on several pricing related projects. Each one was unique, and each required considerable thought and, ultimately, a specific solution. That said, some general concepts are helpful when you tackle pricing problems. That's my goal with this article. Not to provide a one size fits all pricing solution that works everywhere, but a general guide of data science techniques that are useful for pricing related problems.Note that in this exercise, I am using a python Jupyter notebook inside Watson Studio from IBM. For my visualizations, I am using Plotly. Also, please note that all data used in this notebook is 100% fake. I manufactured it for this demonstration. Although it is completely fake, it does accurately represent several projects on which I have worked in the past.If you took economics in school, you probably remember drawing a bunch of supply and demand curves. Hopefully, you'll remember the elegance of equilibriums and optimal spaces where things seemed to fit ""just right."" (If you are not a dork like me and remember econ 101 as a series of formulas you had to memorize, that's ok too :)).You'll probably also remember something called elasticity. Elasticity is an integral part of price theory but also has tons of other applications. In this notebook, we walk through the basic concepts associated with pricing and price elasticity.As a first step, we will import and install the required libraries.A demand curve reflects the relationship between price and quantity. All companies face demand curves. All businesses have customers, and those customers will buy a certain number of items based on the price you charge. If you lower the price, you will sell more. If you raise the price, you will sell less.This simple fact is called the law of demand.Note that our demand curve has quantity on the vertical axis and price on the horizontal access. This is common in most graduate-level economics textbooks. Undergraduate level textbooks are usually the opposite (price is on the vertical axis). I know that doesn't make any sense, but we'll save a discussion for why this is the case for another day.Let's look specifically at the demand curve we just drew. Based on the relationship between price and quantity, if the firm charges one dollar, it will sell 100 units. At 10 dollars, it will sell ten units, and for 6 dollars, it will sell 50 units.Of course, there are a bunch of other options. You can easily see them in a demand schedule. A demand schedule is just the data underlying a demand curve.Price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price. It is a unitless number that details the price sensitivity at a particular point on the demand curve. Note that the elasticity of demand will vary as you move up and down a traditional demand curve. For example, on the curve above, the price elasticity of demand when the price is 2 dollars differs from the price elasticity of demand when the price is 8 dollars. I will show this graphically in just a second.Note that there is also something called a constant elasticity demand curve where elasticity doesn't change from point to point. Put that aside for the moment. We'll get back to constant elasticity demand curves in part two of our exercise.Here is the equation for price elasticity of demand.(%change in quantity)/(%change in price) or ((Q2-Q1)/Q1)/(P2-P1)/P1)Note that the equation above will always be a negative number. If you increase (decrease) price, the quantity will always decrease (increase). Sometimes you'll see the equation like this. -1*(((Q2-Q1)/Q1)/(P2-P1)/P1))The -1 at the front of the equation makes it positive. In this exercise, we will just let it be a negative number.In advanced economics studies, the price elasticity of demand is usually expressed as a derivative (calculus).(dQ/dP) * (P1/Q1)Let's add elasticity to our demand schedule, then look at it visually.Note that when the price elasticity of demand is greater than -1, a 1% increase in price will lower quantity by less than 1%. When the price elasticity of demand is less than -1, a 1% increase in price will lead to a greater than 1% decrease in quantity. When it is equal to -1, it is unitary elastic. This means a 1% increase in price will lead to a 1% decrease in quantity.Another critically important metric is revenue. Revenue is (price*quantity).Typically, you'll want to choose the price that maximizes revenue or profit.Price elasticity of revenue is another critical metric. Similar to the price elasticity of demand, the price elasticity of revenue is the percentage change in revenue divided by the percentage change in price.Calculate the price elasticity of revenue with the following formula.(%change in revenue)/(%change in price)or((R2-R1)/R1)/(P2-P1)/P1)In advanced economics studies, the price elasticity of revenue is almost always expressed as a derivative (calculus).(dR/dP) * (P1/R1)Now that we have defined revenue and the price elasticity of revenue let's add them to our demand schedule.Now, Lets plot revenue with demandNow, let's plot price elasticity of revenue next to Demand.The price elasticity of revenue is similar but also slightly different from the Price elasticity of demand. Price elasticity of revenue is centered on zero, which makes it easier to interpret. If revenue elasticity is greater than zero, a price increase will increase revenue. If it is less than zero, increasing price will lower revenue.Based on the charts above, you can see that a price between 5 and 6 dollars will maximize revenue. To maximize profit, you'd need to incorporate cost information.Another concept that is critical to understand is price discrimination. Let's say that two 22-year-old men walk into a convenience store off an old highway in rural West Texas to buy a bottle of water. This part of Texas is a desert. It is in the middle of July. The sun is hot, and rain is scarce. One of the men walking into the store drove to the store in a car with air conditioning. The second man walked three miles to get to the store. The man who walked to the store is likely to be thirstier than the man who drove, right? I could even say that the man who walked's demand curve for the bottle of water is higher than the man who drove his car. Even though the store owner knows this, he really can't charge the thirstier man more the water, even though the thirstier man would likely pay more. In other words, the store owner cannot price discriminate between the two customers.Price discrimination is charging different prices to different customers based on their demand for your product. The more a firm can price discriminate, the higher their profits will be. There are books written on why this is so, but for now, understanding this basic fact is good enough. Be careful, though; sometimes, price discrimination is illegal. There are many situations where it is lawful, however. The airlines are masters of price discrimination. Historically, they separate consumers who book travel early versus those who book travel late. The earlier you book a flight, typically the cheaper the fare. Movie theaters that offer a senior discount also use price discrimination. They offer a lower price because seniors have a different demand curve than younger moviegoers.One last economics concept to understand related to pricing is inflation. Inflation is the annual upward drift in pricing that occurs across an economy over time. If you've lived life, you have probably noticed that most things get a little more expensive each year. Another way to think of inflation is the change in the cost of living. In the United States, inflation has been pretty low over the last twenty years. Typically, the US inflation rate is estimated to be about 1% to 3% annually. Understanding inflation is essential because when we set prices in the real world, we must consider inflation. Usually, this means that price changes account for changes in inflation. For example, if you have a market that is prime for a price increase, you'll likely increase prices by inflation plus some percentage. If the inflation rate is 1.5%, you may decide to raise prices by inflation plus 5%. This means the actual change in prices is 6.5%. Likewise, if you want to decrease the price, you can hold it constant. If inflation is 1.5% and the price of your product remains unchanged year over year, essentially, this amounts to a 1.5% decrease in price. Think of it like this.If everything else in the economy increases in price by 1.5% and your product's price did not change, in relative or real terms, the price of your product is lower than it was the previous year.It's all relative, right? I remember when I was a kid, and all my friends were growing taller when I wasn't. I wasn't shrinking, but it sure felt like it.Now that we understand the basic concepts let's move to a real-world example.In this use case, we will examine price elasticity for a regional retailer with 219 locations. The type of retailer isn't essential. It could be a convenience store, a restaurant, or a coffee shop. Whatever the business of the retailer, their data should look the same.It is important to note that this is 100% fake and it belongs to me. I created this data from scratch . Although it is synthetic, it is very consistent with real data I have worked with in the past.The success of a retailer depends on several factors. One is management and management decisions. Pricing, for example, is 100% controllable by management. Environmental factors surrounding the store are also critical and typically not very controllable. For example, a retailer will naturally do better if the people living around the store are wealthy than if they are poor.Our data set in this exercise is a combination of controllable and non-controllable factors. The controllable factor is the price. We also have numerous non-controllable environmental factors.Our goal in this exercise is to understand better the relationship between price, quantity, and revenue. We achieve this goal by estimating the price elasticity of demand and the price elasticity of revenue.The first step is to read in the data from Github.Here is a definition of each field.STORE_ID - is a unique id specific to each retail outletPERCENTAGE_OF_RENTERS is the percentage of households surrounding the store that rent their housing.PERCENTAGE_OF_CHILDREN is the percentage of households surrounding the store that have children.AVERAGE_INCOME is the average annual income of the households surrounding the store.AVERAGE_AGE_IN_YEARS is the average age of the head of household in the vicinity of the retail outlet.AVERAGE_LENGTH_OF_RESIDENCE is an average of the time individuals surrounding the retail outlet have lived at their current address.PERCENT_SPEAKING_SPANISH is the percentage of households surrounding the store that speak SpanishPRICE is the average price across multiple items sold at the retail outlet.QUANTITY is the number of items sold by the retail outlet in the last year.REVENUE is the total revenue for the store in the last year.This exercise aims to calculate the price elasticity of demand and the price elasticity of revenue. To estimate an elasticity, you can use a standard ordinary least squares regression and natural log (base e) transformed variables.In the cell below we log transform the variables. Note the new variables created at the end of the DF.2.2 Estimate Price Elasticity of DemandNow, let's build an ordinary least squares regression using the log-transformed variables.Define your independent and dependent variables with the following code cell.Note that we only include statistically significant variables.The next few cells run the OLS regression.So, the price elasticity of demand is -.64. This comes from the ANOVA table above and is the estimated coefficient of LN_PRICE regressed on LN_QUANTITY.A 1% increase in price will lower the quantity sold by .64%. The other coefficients can be interpreted similarly. A 1% increase in people's average income around a store will increase the quantity sold by .55%.2.3 Creating a Demand CurveNow, let's make a demand curve. To do this, we will need to build a demand schedule using the predicted quantity at different prices based on our OLS regression model.First, let's summarize the variables other than price that are significant in the model. We will take the average and then evaluate the relationship between price and quantity when the other variables are at their mean.Then, merge the average value for the non-price variables to the prices we constructed above and calculate the log.We can now use the input variables we manufactured in the last few lines of code and our model to predict quantity at each price point. The result will be a demand schedule.Bingo! Now we have a demand schedule, and we can plot it as a demand curve.Wait a minute! That's not linear! Nope, it isn't. This is a variation of the demand curves we developed in part 1 of our exercise. It is what we call a constant elasticity demand curve. The elasticity is the same at all points.Remember, in our earlier discussion, that elasticity was different at each price point of the demand curve. With this demand curve, elasticity is the same at all the price points. It still shows the relationship between price and quantity.For example, for 6 dollars, our firm can sell about 75,000 units at each store.If you wanted a linear demand curve, you could get there. You would regress price on quantity (instead of ln of price on ln of quantity). Of course, if you built your model this way, the coefficient wouldn't be an elasticity.Estimating the price elasticity of revenue follows a similar process. The difference is we will use the natural log of revenue as a dependent variable instead of the natural log of quantity.The regression results suggest that the price elasticity of revenue is .358. This means that a 1% increase in price will lead to a .358% increase in revenue. In other words, this firm would make more revenue if it increased prices.There are few important caveats that I should probably mention.One, this is a point estimate. That is a fancy way of saying that you shouldn't get too crazy. If you increase prices by 1%, you probably will increase revenue by .35%. However, if you raise prices by 100%, you probably would not realize a 35% increase in revenue. Baked into the model is an established historical relationship between your customers and your prices. If you do something very different than the historical norm, don't expect the model to be predictive.Two, it is essential to understand this elasticity is an average across all stores. The price elasticity of revenue is .358, on average. There are 291 stores in the data set. Some probably have an elasticity greater than .35. Others probably have an elasticity that is less than .35. In other words, if you increase prices by 3% across the board, on average, you will realize a 1.05% increase in revenue. This is an average. Some stores will recognize more than 1.05%, and others will discover less than 1.05%. A 3% increase in prices may even cause some stores to lose revenue.What if you could tailor the price increase for each store?That is, increase prices by an average of 3%, but give some stores a higher bump in prices than others. You could even decrease prices in some stores if it makes sense. Tailoring each store's price increase based on their specific market will lead to an even more significant revenue increase. For example, you can raise prices by 3% on average and get an increase in revenue greater than 1.05%.There are many ways to accomplish this goal. In the third part of this exercise, we will examine a relatively simple and straightforward way to make a market-based pricing decision for each of our 291 stores.Previously, we learned that our organization's price elasticity of revenue is .35. A 1% increase in price will generate a .35% increase in revenue. If we increase prices across all stores by 3%, we will increase revenue by 1.05%.Can we do better than this? Yes, by price discriminating. To price discriminate, we must identify stores that have higher and lower revenue elasticity of demand. The higher the revenue elasticity of demand, the higher the ability to generate revenue from raising prices. The lower the revenue elasticity of demand, the higher our ability to increase revenue from lowering prices.So how do you know which stores can sustain a higher price increase?In our approach, we engage in the following steps to segment our stores by their price sensitivity.This approach involves the following steps (I will explain why each step is necessary below).Again, here is a definition of each field.STORE_ID - is a unique id specific to each retail outletPERCENTAGE_OF_RENTERS is the percentage of households surrounding the store that rent their housing.PERCENTAGE_OF_CHILDREN is the percentage of households surrounding the store that have children.AVERAGE_INCOME is the average annual income of the households surrounding the store.AVERAGE_AGE_IN_YEARS is the average age of the head of household in the vicinity of the retail outlet.AVERAGE_LENGTH_OF_RESIDENCE is an average of the time individuals surrounding the retail outlet have lived at their current address.PERCENT_SPEAKING_SPANISH is the percentage of households surrounding the store that speak SpanishPRICE is the average price across multiple items sold at the retail outlet.QUANTITY is the number of items sold by the retail outlet in the last year.REVENUE is the total revenue for the store in the last year.Now, create new fields by taking the natural log of each variable.3.2 Build a Demand Curve for All StoresDefine the regressors and the dependent variable.Build the modelExamine the results.As before, the price elasticity of demand for all stores is -.64. A 1% increase in price will lead to a .64% decrease in quantity.3.3 Collect and Exploit the ResidualsNext, we will use the residual from the demand equation to segment our stores into groups. The first step is to save the residuals as a variable in our dataframe.Now, let's take a minute and discuss what the residual from this linear equation means. The residual, as you recall, is the difference between the actual quantity and the predicted quantity.Let's look at the two rows above. In the first row, the actual quantity is about 95,000, and the amount predicted is about 75,000 for a difference of about 20,000.Given the price and market factors of STORE_ID 177143, we would expect the quantity sold to be about 75,000. In reality, this store is doing much better than that. It is selling almost 20,000 more units than we would expect. In other words, it is over-performing.In the second row, the actual quantity sold is 95,000, and the expected quantity sold (given the price and market factors) is about 95,000. In other words, STORE_ID 177467 is an average performer.So, what do the previous statements tell us about the current prices at each store? It is hard to say at this point. It could be that the first store is over-performing because it is priced optimally. Or, it could be telling us that this store is on a completely different demand curve, and there is an opportunity to raise prices.One thing is for sure. These stores are different.Next, let's take a look at how each store is priced relative to each other. That is, what stores are priced higher than average and what stores are priced lower than average.In the next step, we will calculate the PRICE_DELTA. The difference between the price of each store and the average price of all stores.For the store in the first row, we can now see that the store is overperforming, and its price is 2.4 cents higher than average. For the store in the second row, it is priced 1.4 cents higher than average.We still don't have enough information to know whether these stores deserve a price increase or decrease. Let's see if we can use these new metrics to cluster our stores into groups that likely face a similar demand curve.Import K-means librariesDefine the features for the K-Means procedureStandardize the features.Create the clusters. Note that I came up with 5 clusters after a little trial and error.Append new clusters to the original dataframe.Find the average price delta and quantity residual for each segment.This is very insightful information.   Cluster 3 represents stores that are priced very low and are under-performing.  Cluster 4 represents stores that are priced a little low and are way over-performing. Cluster 0 represents stores that are priced a little high and over-performing. Cluster 1 represents stores that are priced a little high and are severely under-performing. Cluster 2 represents stores that are priced very high and under-performing.Let's examine the clusters graphically to get even more clarity.3.5 Estimate Revenue Elasticity for Store ClustersWe will now incorporate these segments into the revenue elasticity regression model to estimate the revenue elasticity of demand for each segment.To accomplish this, we will need to create dummy variables that represent each cluster.Note that we now have the segments expressed as dummy variables at the end of the dataframe.Next, create interactive dummy variables. Segment 0 is the base value.Include the interactive dummy variables into the revenue model.Export the CoefficientsTransform the coefficient so that it represents the elasticity for each segment.Merge Revenue Elasticity to other segment metrics.Now, let's take another look at our Clusters.Cluster 4 includes stores with the highest revenue elasticity. This makes sense, given that it is priced less than average and is performing well.Cluster 0 has the second-highest revenue elasticity. It is priced higher than average and also appears to face a strong demand.The other three clusters also have a consequential revenue elasticity.There should be one thing that jumps right out as you review these elasticity numbers. Can you guess?Remember the overall price elasticity of revenue for all stores? It was .36. All of the segments above have a price elasticity of revenue greater than .36. Some should be lower, and some should be higher, right?Yeah, they should. While the five individual segments can have a higher elasticity than the five combined, it isn't likely.This anomaly allows me to make an essential point about this data and all data observed outside of a laboratory. A friend of mine once said that using a sophisticated model on data from a corporate data warehouse is like using a laser beam to slice bologna. Nothing could be more accurate. We live in an imperfect world filled with random noise and random error. You have to remember this as you ""do"" your data science. Most of the time, your models' output is directional and subject to the imperfect world that we inhabit. That doesn't mean that the work we do as data scientists are not useful; it is. Just remember that the goal is to guide the business towards better revenue, lower costs, and higher profit. Perfection is a goal, not a destination. We are subject to an imperfect world, but data science can make it better.Given this, it makes me sometimes wonder about the emphasis on prediction accuracy that I've seen in the last few years. I mean, with the Kaggle competitions and the highly complex algorithms, are we really improving things? Does improving the accuracy from .1% to .01% matter? I mean, at the end of the day, aren't still just left with a sliced piece of bologna? Not always, but in many situations, I think you are.So, now what do we do? That isn't easy to say. Moving from your Jupyter notebook to the real-world is never a straightforward task, especially given the limitations of our imperfect world. Having said that, given all the information presented so far, we can take action.Here are a few things to keep in mind. One, history is essential. If the historical rate increase for a market is 1%, I wouldn't recommend implementing a 20% increase in prices. I would want to keep it consistent with what consumers are used to seeing. Two, listen to others in the organization, especially those in customer-facing roles. When it comes to antidote versus data, I am 100% in the data camp. Having said that, I don't think you can ignore those who are intimately connected to the business. For example, if a store manager is convinced his store cannot handle a price increase and your model says it is prime for one, I wouldn't go as big as I would if the store manager was indifferent or advocating strongly for a price increase.Here is an example of how you can use our analysis to set price changes. We will assume that this firm increased prices for the last few years by the inflation rate across the board.For segment 4, price is below average, quantity is way above average, and the revenue elasticity is 0.72. I would increase prices by inflation + 4%. This should yield a 2.88% real increase in revenue for these stores.For segment 0, price is above average, quantity is above average, and the revenue elasticity is .59, I would increase prices by inflation + 2%. This would yield a 1.2 percent real increase in revenue.For segment 3, price is way below average, quantity is below average, and revenue elasticity is .48, I would increase prices by inflation + 1%. This should yield a .48% increase in real revenue.For segment 2, price is way above average, quantity is below average, and revenue elasticity is .45, I would increase prices by inflation + .5%. This should yield a .225% increase in real revenue.For segment 1, price is above average, quantity is below average, and revenue elasticity is .39, I would increase prices by inflation. This should yield a 0% increase in real revenue.Again, there is no perfect answer here, but the recommendations above are solid and consistent with our analysis.For the heck of it, let's look at the demand curves for each of the segments.I hope this was helpful.

The Marketing Move That Institutionalized Chocolate as the Food of Love,"Chocolate and Valentine's Day - it seems like a given for these two to go together, doesn't it?On the contrary, it took centuries before the sweet treat became associated with the romantic holiday.Chocolate wasn't even consumed as a solid, to begin with. In Mesoamerican history, it was a drink made of roasted cacao beans with cornmeal, vanilla, honey, and chilies. Then as it spread across Europe in the 1600s, chocolate houses popped up like coffee shops, becoming hotspots for social gatherings. The cocoa business boomed.As for February 14, the feast day of St. Valentine really had nothing to do with romance. Historians suggest that we have medieval English poet Geoffrey Chaucer to thank for the dreaded, I mean, special holiday. In Parliament of Foules, Chaucer wrote, ""For this was sent on Seynt Valentyne's day / Whan every foul cometh there to choose his mate.""So, out of artistic, fictitious freedom came the romanticization of that blessed day we - the fortunate ones among us, at least - look forward to every year.If the fact that it was called the Romantic Era had anything to do with it, I can't be sure. But the romantic tradition solidified further in the following centuries. By the Victorian Era, Valentine's Day had been fully commercialized - people celebrated their love and affection for their significant other with the usual emblems: Cupids! Hearts! Red roses! Poetic love notes handwritten on scrolls!How, then, did chocolate come into the picture?In Birmingham, England, chocolate manufacturer Richard Cadbury stumbled upon a happy accident. At the time, he had developed a process that would make the chocolate drink even smoother by removing the cocoa butter from the cocoa beans.Not wanting to waste the excess cocoa butter - voila!-he produced solid, edible chocolate!On Valentine's Day, Cadbury put the ""eating chocolates"" into fancy heart-shaped boxes and sold them as the perfect gift to sweep your loved one off her feet.It was a hit. Cadbury's chocolate boxes were iconic. The lucky maidens kept the beautifully-decorated boxes to store love letters and other mementos.And since then, Valentine's Day has been made, quite literally, sweeter.The Cadbury story is one of the earliest testaments to the power of packaging. How you pack your product isn't just a matter of presentation or aesthetics. The packaging is your most tangible, strategic tool of association - an opportunity to communicate something different.Brands have seen their downfall merely from poor packaging choices. But if done right, it can ultimately reframe how people see a product, increase engagement and excitement with the brand, and encourage new occasions to consume and enjoy it.Now, I kinda wish the Italians thought of the heart-shaped pizza boxes first... I love chocolate, but I wouldn't mind a cheesy (four-cheese, thin-crust, with hot sauce, to be exact) Valentine's Day either.",https://miro.medium.com/max/14280/1*wlNx19g6SUFRUmGc-CiC_w.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-marketing-move-that-institutionalized-chocolate-as-the-food-of-love-4ce994b86c3,marketing,ab2e9cbf374f4b6903314721a35c0122faf871c17eb0ea4804a38094
Gatekeeping Will Ruin Your Life If You Let It,"I didn't even know what gatekeeping was until I faceplanted on Twitter.Then I groaned because I've seen it kill so many careers and friendships (as I'll soon show you).I tweet writing tips and jokes. It's my way of building a niche and adding followers.The challenge with tweeting writing tips, if you ever decide to, is in your tone. It's easy to come off as high-and-mighty without ever intending to.My now-deleted tweet said something to the effect of, ""Writers don't talk about writing. They don't tell people about wanting to write. They actually write.""That seemingly innocuous tweet managed to piss a couple of people off. In reality? It was a very softcore version of gatekeeping - compared to others.Remember those music snobs, back when we used to buy CDs and records?Me: ""I love band ____.""Friend: ""They freaking suck, man! They aren't even a real metal band.""That was gatekeeping: drawing lines about what is or isn't, who is included and who isn't. And it's been the grounds for some pretty tragic social media posts.My partner has her Ph.D. in Archaeology and works as an associate professor at USF.If I were advising someone on how to push her 'nuclear' button, which I would never do, I'd tell them to go on a rant about who is and isn't a doctor. Just as Joseph Epstein infamously did, losing his job as a result. Opening with:The letter went on for several long, excruciating paragraphs, oozing condescension and sexism (which is, unfortunately, quite common in academia).But to the point, there's this assumption that Ph.D.s somehow coast through college studying basket weaving, that they are 'wannabe' MDs.It's an insult to people's ambitions, how difficult most Ph.D. programs are, and how many people flunk out.My partner was a top student and scholar, spending years sleeping in dirt, carbon-dating Bronze Age artifacts. But she still has to see stuff like this all the time:Ben's tweet is not the first of its kind. It underscores a pretentiousness around graduate school versus medical doctors. A doctor is, by definition, someone who got a doctorate.Also, who is actually scouting dinner guests based on whether they can resuscitate us or not? It's a super weird thought.I'm going to keep these examples pretty colorful. Because they make for better examples.This was trending just after the release of Avengers: Endgame.Other examples are if you post (or even say) you are feeling tired, someone will say you are too young to be tired, or, ""Wait until you have kids!""Even if they are well intended, the replies don't do much to help. It's quasi-gatekeeping, diminishing someone else's experience.A personal one that sets me on fire: every few years, a post trends on my feed that just repeats ""Real men do ___. Real men don't do ____.""It's super exhausting.I'll never understand why a person feels the need to tweet out their definition of man and woman on social media. It's one thing to have an opinion on the matter. But why broadcast such thoughts?Social media probably isn't the best measuring stick for humanity. It enables people to stream every ill-advised thought into the void.But sometimes, it gets worse.Controversial 'blanket-speak' posts tend to go viral easily because the comments boost it in the algorithm. It's great if you crave internet points. It's bad if you value your career.This next one pops up periodically. The optics are usually pretty poor. It's usually some older conservative white dude blasting a judgment on these young whippersnappers:I still don't see how praying defines maturity, or how the post is relevant to the platform.Yes, we need to 'have a bold voice' and be authentic on social media, or risk being boring.One way to thread the needle: I try to inspect my drafts with a validating question, ""Is this coming off as 'judgy'?""I try not to draw lines of inclusion using money or politics. It's one thing to offer people well-intended advice.But it so easily strays into the land of telling people how they should live their lives:Something tells me many successful people have both.I actually think many of these posts come from a place of insecurity. They are projections, perhaps people are siloing a 'promised land' in their mind, to either take away from successful people or bring their own sense of clarity.There's a difference between trying to please everyone and coming off like a judgemental jerk.Gatekeeping doesn't just offend people, it has very real consequences. People have been fired over posts which, unfortunately, are sometimes loaded with racism:And look, I'm not Mr. Perfect. Years ago, I once made an off-the-cuff post about how tattoos seem to age poorly. It was dumb and shortsighted, forgetting how 30% of people have tattoos, and how tattoos simply age as the rest of our body does.Humans are primed to think categorically. It helps us distill information and make it actionable. This is the behavioral trap that was set by evolution. Stanford Professor of Evolutionary Biology, Doctor Robert Sapolsky said perfectly, ""When you pay too much attention to boundaries. You don't see the bigger picture.""None of us are pre-ordained to make the rules. It's not our job to ask someone to name three songs of the band on their shirt, just to prove they are a fan. And it isn't my job to say who is and isn't a writer.Categorical thinking is bad for business. Make no mistake - an ill-advised social media post can follow you to your grave.",https://miro.medium.com/max/11520/1*qPRrPOwV_x4hBVRTbV6C5A.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/gatekeeping-will-ruin-your-life-if-you-arent-careful-3875494fc63e,social-media,ab32ee64d78130c35ecfdb4c102a9372955920c243050ba386c79887
Outgoing Gov. Gina Raimondo's Education Legacy: An 'Atmosphere of Innovation' in Rhode Island Schools,"By Asher Lehrer-SmallWhen those who worked alongside Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo reflect on the chief executive's education legacy, they are unsparing in their praise.""Hero"" and ""champion"" are the first words that come to mind for Vic Fay-Wolfe, a University of Rhode Island professor who spearheaded the governor's statewide computer science education initiative.Meghan Hughes, president of the Community College of Rhode Island, where Raimondo's tuition-free higher education program spurred dramatic boosts in student enrollment and outcomes, feels similarly.""She's helped us prove what's possible,"" Hughes said.The governor's leadership, Rhode Island Commissioner of Education Angélica Infante-Green told The 74, has had a clear focus: ""How are we going to do what's right for kids? That has always been the mantra.""The examples go on and on: Those who worked with Raimondo on school reopenings, on reforming the state's school funding formula, on early childhood education, on personalized learning all describe the 49-year-old governor, the first woman ever to hold Rhode Island's highest office, as a relentless innovator pursuing high-quality, equitable education.But as Raimondo packs her bags in preparation to join President Biden's cabinet as secretary of commerce after a Jan. 26 Senate hearing that seemed to all but clinch her the job, some observers outside the governor's sphere take a different stance on her legacy.""She was pretty much status quo,"" said Scott Mackay, a longtime political commentator who recently retired from Rhode Island Public Radio. ""I give her like a B, maybe a B-.""Jonathon Acosta, a freshman state senator and former Rhode Island educator, offered a similarly lukewarm review. ""Our schools as a whole in the state aren't very different today than they were in 2010 - or the year 2000, even,"" he said, pointing to student performance data showing stagnation across grade levels.Rhode Island test scores continue to lag behind those in neighboring Massachusetts, a national leader, and the governor's efforts to turn around results have been met with mixed responses. Her decisions to greenlight both a state takeover of the Providence school district, which has underperformed for decades, and charter school expansions have each sparked controversy.But perhaps those very debates speak to something even more essential to Raimondo's decision-making DNA, a characteristic that will not fade in her role as commerce secretary: She's hard to pigeonhole, and according to those who worked with her, she leads not by ideology, but by remaining faithful to the evidence.That trait was never more clearly on display than in the strong stance Raimondo took on school reopenings during COVID-19. Though Rhode Island schools, like the rest of the nation's, went remote in spring 2020 when the pandemic first hit, by September, while many Democrats remained hesitant to see schools reopen, the governor made national headlines for investing in virus mitigation strategies and demanding that students receive in-person learning options.The whole strategy, said Dr. Phil Chan, who works with the governor as medical director at the Rhode Island Department of Health, came from a careful look at the epidemiological literature.""She and her team have been very evidence based and data driven,"" he said.Now, 10 months in, with about a third of the nation's students still not having attended a single day of in-person school since the start of the pandemic, according to estimates from Burbio, an organization that tracks reopenings, Raimondo's call to emphasize classroom learning appears prescient. Research indicates that remote learning has caused dangers such as suicide, malnutrition, and severe learning loss to spike among young people, particularly for low-income students and youth of color who were already at risk.Dr. Chan watched nervously when the state made its initial push for in-person learning in the fall. But now, he said, the data show that Rhode Island schools have seen low rates of virus transmission, thanks to universal masking policies, ventilation upgrades, and testing programs. He believes the governor's vision was spot-on.""Virtual learning is not optimal,"" he said. ""In retrospect, she definitely made the right decision.""If Raimondo's push to open classrooms ruffled some feathers, it wasn't the first time the governor has taken heat. She has long received criticism from the left for her background in finance, which has only intensified since her pick for the Biden cabinet. Before her tenure as treasurer of Rhode Island, the Ocean State native co-founded Point Judith Capital, a venture capital firm that invested in communications, internet, health care and technology companies.But while many assume that markets and major social welfare investments mix about as well as oil and water, those who worked with Raimondo say that, to the governor, the issues are flip sides of the same coin.""She understood the financial implications of not having a good education system for our state,"" said Commissioner Infante-Green. ""We can't attract businesses to Rhode Island if we didn't have a great education system.""The issue is personal for Raimondo. The granddaughter of Italian immigrants, Raimondo comes from a working-class background. Through the GI Bill, her father became the first in his family to attend college. After working for 26 years at the Bulova watch factory in Providence, her dad ""started all over again"" when the company's manufacturing moved overseas, according to a 2014 gubernatorial campaign ad. The experience imprinted Raimondo with the memory of financial insecurity - and an understanding of the importance of higher education in the job market.In her first term as governor, Raimondo succeeded in creating the RI Promise Scholarship, one of the first of its kind, which guaranteed high school graduates two tuition-free years at the Community College of Rhode Island.""The governor really put herself behind this program,"" said Sara Enright, vice president of CCRI. ""She took time, on multiple occasions, to come and sit with groups of Rhode Island Promise students and hear about their experiences.""To Community College of Rhode Island President Meghan Hughes, the effort showcased Raimondo's commitment to equity.""What Promise has allowed us to do is enroll many more low-income students and Black and students of color than we had historically,"" she said.The scholarship program has driven gains in enrollment and degree completion at CCRI, according to a report the program submitted to state officials in 2020. And while critics argue that it has funneled students away from Rhode Island College, a four-year institution that is not included in the scholarship, the overall college-going rate for high school grads in Rhode Island has actually jumped 9 percentage points since the passage of the Promise program.Though Raimondo declined to be interviewed for this story, the outgoing governor boasted about the program's success Feb. 3 in her final State of the State address.""At the time we [approved the Rhode Island Promise program], few states had taken this path,"" she told her audience. ""Now our country looks to us as a model.""The state legislature, which allocates approximately $7 million to the program annually, has funded the scholarship through the incoming Fall 2021 class. CCRI leadership hopes, however, that this year lawmakers will pass legislation to lift the sunset provision. On Jan. 29, in a key win for Raimondo's legacy, state Senate and House leaders introduced a bill to make the program permanent.Earlier in January, Lt. Gov. Dan McKee, who will step into the state's top job when Raimondo officially transitions to Washington, told The 74 that he will support such legislation if it lands on his desk.While Raimondo's push for free college, if ahead of the curve, played along Democratic party lines, her investments in computer science education and personalized learning are harder to link to partisan affiliation.In 2016, the governor set an ambitious goal: She called for computer science to be taught in every Rhode Island public school by the end of 2017.Sure enough, the state hit its target, making Rhode Island, according to Fay-Wolfe, a ""national leader"" in computer science education. The University of Rhode Island computer science professor attributes that accomplishment to Raimondo's leadership.""This would not have happened without her,"" he said, citing the governor's advocacy as a primary reason that the state's budget now carves out $210,000 annually in direct funds for computer science education. The initiative also receives funds from grants and corporate donors such as Microsoft.Malika Ali, who works at the Highlander Institute, which partners with communities in Rhode Island to push for more equitable and responsive schooling, agrees that Raimondo created an ""atmosphere of innovation"" in the state's education system. The Department of Education, for example, launched a challenge known as the Lighthouse Award to recognize and reward schools using cutting-edge personalized learning strategies.But the personalized learning push has had hiccups.Some Rhode Island educators have critiqued the new strategies for relying too heavily on computer programs, particularly in underperforming schools populated mostly by low-income students. These problems have been pervasive in some classrooms, Ali recognizes.""There were problems in translation,"" she told The 74. ""I think for some people, they reduced personalized learning to technology.""The universal computer science push, known as CS4RI, also has had its growing pains. Equity in access has been a problem for the initiative, said Fay-Wolfe. Women and students of color have been underrepresented in computer science programs across the state, as they are nationally.Taking those disparities to heart, Gov. Raimondo did her best to set a counter-example, he said.Fay-Wolfe remembers that at a summit coordinated to promote the program, the governor, who had no background in coding herself, took student volunteers on stage and walked them through a computer science exercise together on sorting algorithms.""She wanted to show that computer science is for everyone,"" said Fay-Wolfe.For all the attention that the Rhode Island Promise scholarship and the CS4RI initiative have received, perhaps no education moves during Raimondo's tenure as governor have been more high profile than the decision for the state to take over the Providence school system.Facing persistently low levels of student achievement and intractable leadership struggles, the Rhode Island Department of Education took the reins of the 24,000-student district after a team of Johns Hopkins University researchers released a scathing report evaluating Providence schools in 2019.Reactions to the takeover were mixed, and now nearly two years later, many question whether it was the right move.""The Providence takeover by the state has been basically a bunch of halts and stuttering stops,"" said Mackay, who watched the district's progress closely as a political commentator for Rhode Island Public Radio. ""That's something that's still in limbo.""But Commissioner Infante-Green cautions against judging changes to Providence schools too soon.""Education is like a big ship with a little rudder,"" she said, pointing to a number of important benchmarks that the district has hit since the takeover, such as upgrades to curricula and new requirements for educators to attend parent-teacher conferences.Rutgers education professor Domingo Morel agrees that true change will take time. But on key issues like funding, resources for multilingual learners, and increasing the share of teachers of color, Morel, who grew up in Providence and authored Takeover: Race, Education, and American Democracy, thinks Raimondo fell short.""Were there any mechanisms in place to deal with the issues of resources?"" he said, reflecting. ""Did we see anything from the governor's office about ... creating opportunities for teachers of color to develop and enter the workforce? The answer there is no.""Others, however, contend that Raimondo did do her fair share to allocate additional resources to struggling districts. In 2010, the state overhauled its school funding system to channel more money to schools serving disadvantaged populations.""[The governor] continued to be a strong supporter of the funding formula,"" said Kenneth Wong, who was on the team that revamped the equation and works as an education professor at Brown University.In addition, Elizabeth Burke Bryant, executive director of Rhode Island Kids Count, appreciates Raimondo's investments in early education.""She has had a strong vision for universal [pre-K] so that all children would be served,"" she said, noting that preschool seats tripled to over 1,800 under Raimondo's governorship and program quality ranks among the highest in the nation. The state's overall percentage of 4-year-olds served, however, ranks 35th in the nation.But though seats may remain limited, they have gone, Burke Bryant points out, to the kids who need them most. ""Programs with the highest percentage of lower-income children have had the first opportunity to offer the Rhode Island state pre-K program.""Given the nature of investments in early education, which studies link to numerous gains down the line for children, like the results of the Providence takeover, it may yet be too early to judge the full extent of Raimondo's strategy.As far as Burke Bryant is concerned, however, the governor has done much to move the ball forward toward high-quality, equitable education in Rhode Island.""We have momentum,"" she said. ""I am feeling very positively that we will be able to continue to make great progress under the new governor.""Disclosure: The Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provide financial support to both The Highlander Institute and The 74.Sign up for The 74's daily morning newsletterOriginally published at https://www.the74million.org on February 9, 2021.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/0*MebriGvi0xq3qdin,https://the74million.medium.com/outgoing-gov-723137abf3ac,education,abcfa1caf54a6152b365b67ebda52c2a940ee515824608ce4fbd8512
On Teaching Your Body How to Find Home in a New City,"The first thing I felt was the heat.Suitcase in my right hand, I stepped out of Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport only to be met by an angry sun intent on singing my skin with licks of heat my body was completely unprepared for. It is by no means cold in my Lagos, (yes Lagos is mine, at least it feels like it), our heat is just of a different kind. It's wetter, more humid, more accommodating. It feels more like an overbearing hug as opposed to this one that felt like a slow strangling. I already miss my Lagos.This place is too quiet for my head that finds an oddly enchanting beauty in cacophony. Here, the roads are smooth; tarred perfectly such that the car that drove us didn't have to gallop and bounce as we moved. I am used to roads that make you swear under your breath as your body is flung and tossed in the car. Look at that level of dysfunction, finding excitement in potholes and the gbas gbos of horrible roads. Home is home, no matter how home is. Discomfort after a while, morphs into comfort, or at least a dull ache you know as friend. Even difficulty becomes familiar enough to feel like ease.I was terrified of coming here. Okay maybe terrified is a slight exaggeration but I certainly wasn't looking forward to it. The school had delayed and delayed and the initial enthusiasm I forced myself to muster, died a slow and final death. Coming here felt like an inevitability I fought with the knowledge that I would lose. So I didn't bother to fight it. I packed my bags, selected my favourite books of poetry, wrote a farewell letter to my lover and travelled into the heat.Our bodies know when we move.The soil feels different on our feet. The air is different in our lungs, our bodies know. If there's anything I've become an expert at, it's listening to my body. Spending a few hours here, I immediately knew that shea butter was a necessity, not a suggestion. My tub of Vaseline was about to become an accessory I couldn't leave the house without. My lips would crackle in this place. I knew. And sometimes, you try to prevent the inevitable, and your body just smiles and shakes its head at you. You will soon learn that you cannot lie to your body. With care and compassion, you must help your body find home in this new place.I will tell you what to do when your body starts craving home.First, breathe.In the beginning, this new air will feel alien, strange in your chest, you will not like how it tastes on your tongue and you will long for the air you have always breathed. Teach your body that this too, is air. That this too will sustain you, keep you alive, keep you walking long enough for your feet to carry you home. Just breathe baby, breathe.Second, laugh. At yourself. At your friends. At all the corny jokes you hear. Don't take yourself too seriously. Surrender to a certain child-like humour, where everything tickles you. You will need this to fight the longing that may begin to gnaw at your insides. A good laugh will bring light into your face and cause you to shake off some lethargy. Laugh. Let joy erupt from your face at even the smallest things.Finally, marvel at the new world around you. Take everything in with wonder. Even the things that you think are ugly, have some kind of beauty hidden underneath. Make it your mission to unearth that beauty. Speak positively about this new planting. Do not exhaust yourself by comparing every single thing to home. Let things be.It is my third day here and my skin is still not used to the heat. But I am breathing easier and I can feel my feet settling into the soil. I am starting to feel grounded. That it is not home, does not mean you cannot flourish.So darling, go ahead and flourish.",https://miro.medium.com/max/6048/1*PZx0ST0lTooZtOuRMvQo2g.jpeg,https://fiyin-okupe.medium.com/on-teaching-your-body-how-to-find-home-in-a-new-city-d75e13236247,travel,ac7854ecdf78c54da8de53cd03bbe6eec573dd4011b08c6308425662
Linear Regression: Everything From Math to Program Part-2,"Hello Everyone!!!This is the second part of the series Linear Regression: Everything From Math to Program.Part 1: Regression with One Independent VariablePart 3: Regression with Multiple Independent VariablesEarlier in Part-1, we have learned about how to perform linear regression in the case of one independent variable in python and Excel. We have also derived the general expression for calculating slope and intercept of a one independent variable linear regression problem.In this part, we are continuing our learning and derive a general expression for a multiple linear regression problem. Later we will use the derived expression to solve one of the linear regression problems with two independent variables. We will represent each step using excel and also implement the programming version using Python with NumPy library. If you haven't read Part-1 of this series you might not be able to understand few concepts of residual error. But if you think you are good with those concepts, you can skip them.To understand Multiple Linear regression, we need some basic knowledge of Matrices and differential calculus which probably was part of your high school math. I will try to explain each step as much as possible and will give you some resources to understand the derivation part. That should suffice everything you need for this algorithm.So, Let's begin!!!Regression with Two Independent VariableAs the name suggests, there are two independent variables X1 and X2 in the problem, that determines the value of dependent variable Y. Also, the relationship between X1 and X2 with Y should be linear. The objective of the problem is to determine the best plane that fits for all the given values of X1 and X2. Note that in regression with one independent variable, the objective was to find the best line.It is possible to plot the graph and visualize the points using some visualization tools like FusionCharts, Plotly, etc. We can also use 3-D plot packages in R and Python to visualize the data. I will show that in the end as well.Let's view the example problem first.General form of a multiple linear regression equation is:Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ..... + βₘXₘ (equ.1)where β₀ is a constant and β₁, β₂...βₘ are the regression coefficients.In case of a two independent variable regression problem, equ. 1 can be simplified as,Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂In case of more than two independent variable regression problem (n variables and m given data), every row can be written as,Y₁ = β₀ + β₁X₁₁ + β₂X₁₂+...+ βnX₁nY₂ = β₀ + β₁X₂₁ + β₂X₂₂+...+ βnX₂nY₃ = β₀ + β₁X₃₁ + β₂X₃₂+...+ βnX₃n...Ym = β₀ + β₁Xm₁ + β₂Xm₂+...+ βnXmnThis data can be re-written in matrix form as follows:Since now you understood the general form of the equation, we can safely say that for a set of multiple independent variables a predicted dependent variable can be calculated using the below formula:It is clearly evident that to compute Yᵖ, all the biases need to be set. A little knowledge of the matrix here will prove handy.From Part-1, We know that error is the difference between the predicted and actual value of y and thus, given bywhich in matrix form for all the given data can be written as,Sum of the squared Error will be,On simplifying we get,Our motive is to reduce this error and thus, we will use partial differentiation w.r.t βᵖPutting the value of RSS we obtained above and solving,And this is the formula we are seeking.If you remember this formula, you would be able to answer all the questions you need to solve for multiple independent variables.Let's start solving the problem we assumed and predict the best-fit plane for our data. I will use excel for displaying the manual calculations and python in the jupyter notebook for the programming part. You are free to refer to this code and implement it in any other language for your own data.Step 1: Create or import the dataWe are using NumPy to create matrices. We will use two different variables to store our feature data (or independent variables) and labels (or dependent variable).Step 2: Transform the feature matrixWe need to append columns of value 1 into the feature matrix to take the bias variable Beta0 into account.In Python, this can be achieved in two steps. First, create a NumPy matrix of values 1 and size equal to rows of given data (N = 5). Then, stack this matrix horizontally on the existing feature matrix.Note how the dimension of the feature matrix changed from (5, 2) to (5, 3) because of the additional column of ones.Step 3: Find transpose of the feature matrixIn Excel, we can do this using the TRANSPOSE function.In Python, it can be easily performed using the transform function provided by Numpy. Look at how the shape of the array reversed here.Step 4: Multiply Transpose of Feature Matrix with Original Feature MatrixWe use the MMULT function in Excel to perform multiplication.In python, we use the dot product to multiply 2 matrices of any size, unless one of the matrices is scalar. In that case, we use to multiply.Step 5: Inverse of Resultant MatrixWe use the MINVERSE function in Excel for finding the inverse of a matrix.In python, we can do this using the multiplicative Inverse function of a matrix.Step 6: Product of Transpose of feature matrix and dependent variableStep 7: Find Regression CoefficientRegression coefficient can be calculated using the dot product of matrices obtained in results in step 6 and step 5.Step 8: Predict the dependent variableWe will calculate the predicted value of the label using the predict_label method in python which will accept values of X1 and X2 as an argument.Step 9: PlottingWe have used matplotlib package to plot the points in python. This is definitely not the best way to plot the points in terms of implementation but I didn't want people to confuse with loops. But that won't be the case in part 3.Please refer to my GitHub account to get a complete program in Jupyter Notebook as well as the Excel File. Click on the star icon on the top right corner in GitHub to show support to my project.ConclusionThis is all for part 2 of this series. In the final part, we will extend the scope of our problem by importing a dataset with more than two independent variables and build a python program from scratch.Stay Safe and healthy.",https://miro.medium.com/max/504/1*B5T6k_5tWbjbqVDQtnjBBA.png,https://gourav-k-nayak.medium.com/linear-regression-everything-from-math-to-program-part-2-d5f783740496,data-science,ad264635fde01b6c18c0d31640caaef0b96a03a30aa4d204aae419c9
Do You Have Any Feedback?,"Leaders who welcome employee perspectives and see their feedback as a resource rather than a threat creates a culture of openness and growth - rather than fear.I had just received my first performance evaluation when my boss asked me a question that stunned me into (relatively rare) silence:""Do you have any feedback for me about how I can grow as a leader?""In my first 18 years of working, I had never once given a peer or manager feedback. I had a whirlwind of thoughts, emotions, and insecurities rushing through my brain. After an awkward silence, I managed to remember an issue and put it into a coherent thought - her difficulty with delegation.I took a deep breath and explained that it was frustrating to work on a project when she'd redo much of the work without giving me feedback. I knew she had very high standards and a problematic time delegating ""her babies"". I struggled to effectively reduce her load but didn't know how to build this trust.She kept a neutral expression on her face and nodded at appropriate times, which helped quell my insecurity at giving a superior criticism.She thought for a moment and restated my points back to me,We ended up having a very encouraging discussion and created both a style-guide and a plan for more frequent touch-points so we could both work more efficiently.I felt fantastic for sharing a niggling annoyance, and she found an actionable way to grow her skills. We both increased our shared trust and strengthened the relationship.Leaders who welcome employee perspectives and see their feedback as a resource rather than a threat create a transparent culture. This shared trust helps employees feel comfortable offering suggestions to their peers and superiors.Taking feedback isn't easy, but it's an essential leadership skill. By improving your listening skills, tamping down defensiveness, and building a growth mindset, you accelerate your potential while strengthening relationships.By asking for feedback, my boss was vulnerable. As a first time leader, I knew she was sincere in wanting to grow her leadership skills. She needed to find a healthy balance between appearing vulnerable and confident, especially with those who reported to her.Many find it challenging to take constructive feedback because we instinctively want to defend ourselves, often because we see any attack on our work as an attack on ourselves. Or maybe it's because you disagree with the feedback in general.Keep in mind that giving negative feedback is as challenging and nerve-racking as receiving it. If we approach the situation by redirecting the blame or getting defensive, it won't encourage the person to be open with us again, nor will it help us grow our skills.When we receive negative feedback, getting defensive is natural. However, getting defensive often backfires, and instead of being protective, it creates a shell that won't allow for growth.Pointing the finger back at the messenger or another team might feel better than taking the brunt of the criticism, but it abdicates and confuses responsibility and weakens your stance as a leader.You may also disagree with the feedback shared, but denying the feedback invalidates the person sharing and shuts your mind down to new information. Instead of challenging the criticism, get curious and ask questions.By reducing your instinct to defend or attack, you increase the emotional vulnerability allowing for real growth. And by asking for, and receiving, feedback well, you not only improve, but you model this behavior for your employees.By asking for my feedback, my boss was better able to understand my needs and see how it conflicted with how she worked. By verbalizing both the issue and solution, we both learned and grew.Reaching out to your employees and peers to ask for feedback is a great way to create healthy team communication. Accepting feedback is a crucial step to motivate and engage a team. It allows for a deeper understanding of employee needs, motivations, support required to achieve their goals.It also has obvious benefits for you as a leader. It's easy to lose perspective about how well you are performing. By accepting criticism, you can think critically about your strengths and gaps, which helps avoid negative results.It's easy to overlook your skill gaps until either someone points them out or a significant failure forces self-reflection. By avoiding feedback, we lose the opportunity to learn. If we choose to think of constructive criticism as a growth opportunity and take the time to reflect on what we've learned, we'll have the information to take appropriate action.By understanding the areas that you want to improve in, asking for feedback to understand the patterns of behavior causing friction, and creating a plan of attack, you increase your abilities as a leader.Creating a high trust workplace and growing skills are two of the biggest areas that leaders typically need to grow.Request Time to Follow Up:Check Your Understanding:Say Thank You:",https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*fRhxBPtCtBrxHdLx.png,https://samseaster.medium.com/do-you-have-any-feedback-8046efbe8896,leadership,ada3d13a0192e66958e93e33bf0323af344a9f5ac06bbca84bf28cc2
NieR and Back Again,"Over ten years ago - after downing consecutive energy drinks during a late-night gaming binge on my weekend away from work and college - I finished Ending D in NieR. I watched, transfixed, as Nier chose to sacrifice the very fabric of his existence in exchange for Kainé's life, prompted by a sinister binary option. Before his selfless act could be made complete the game prompted me with an absurd and infamous prompt:I paused a moment, unsure of what the game was asking me. Delete my data? It hadn't been a simple thing to reach that point - in order to see Ending D, the game requests a few things from the player: play through the game multiple times, acquire every weapon, and choose the correct narrative options. After all of this - including the heart-wrenching moments leading up to the ending - the game demands everything of you.Again, and finally, the game prompted me:I watched, both awestruck and horrified, as the game systematically showed the deletion of all my hard work. I watched as menu after menu, my items, weapons, and quests were permanently erased.NieR was an unusual experience, its narrative weight cemented by the oblivion that I had been made to choose. What I didn't know at the time was that the game's own real oblivion had been something reflected in its real-life history - it teetered, for a long time, on being forgotten.Against countless struggles, NieR refuses to be erased.What existed as a cult classic for years has recently entered the limelight. NieR: Automata exceeded all sales expectations and has become one of the most critically lauded games of the past five years. Now, after a decade in obscurity, NieR is a series at the forefront of the action RPG genre.With NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139..., the improbable is happening. In only a few months, we will all be playing a reimagining of the doomed cult classic, NieR Replicant. How did NieR - once a commercial failure for Square Enix - go from niche Playstation 3 outlier to one of their most popular series in just ten years?Ashen snow falls against a sickly green sky as a soundtrack of haunting melodies and surreal vocals rises and falls. We are in a ruined city, devoid of life, devoid of kindness. Despite the falling snow, it is the summer of 2049. In a ruined store, an old man sleeps clutching a length of metal pipe, a book at his feet. As he mutters himself awake, the old man is suddenly attacked by dark, ethereal creatures. Though disadvantaged as he is, he fights back. He has a daughter to protect.NieR is, ultimately, about personal salvation.The storyline of the NieR games takes place across thousands of years and extends into different possible endings and player choices. Disturbingly relatable in today's world, the games are rooted in a disease that infects humans and wreaks havoc on the remaining members of society. The solution is a complicated one, a path of gestalts and replicants, of androids and magic. While NieR and NieR: Automata are related mostly through concept, they share a common narrative purpose and structure.Despite the series being its own, unique entity, the existence of NieR is actually built upon the bones of Drakengard. NieR (known as NieR Gestalt and NieR Replicant in Japan, and NIER in the United States) spins off of Drakengard as a result of its bizarre Ending E, where the heroes of that game cross the parallel dimensions separating their world. The outcome of their fight has great costs, and the Tokyo of 2003 is irrevocably changed. The world of NieR is not one of expected coherence, but of emotional reaction.As one magical reality infects a non-magical one, this act of accidental violence births Taro Yoko's cerebral - and once polarizing - masterwork.Taro Yoko, the infamous and eccentric designer of NieR and Drakengard, is known for his unconventional narrative choices. The Drakengard series - while not one of Square's most well-known franchises - is a bizarre fusion of dark fantasy, science fiction, and surrealism. When it came time to develop a new series, after what was viewed by the parent company as a series of budget and sales failures, Yoko could not be deterred from his vision.Global sales for NieR did not impress Square. As of 2019, the sales of NIER, NieR Replicant, and NieR Gestalt barely total 500,000 units. According to Yoko, ""...we weren't really in the red, but it wasn't exactly a success either."" After ten years of development, Cavia would become absorbed into AQ interactive - and NieR would be their final game. Taro Yoko went on to work at Square Enix with a few former members of the defunct studio, where he was given another chance that birthed Drakengard 3. The game received modest success and mixed reviews. Yoko would continue his mixture of dark, humanist tones, and many aspects of NieR would show themselves in the narrative, despite its cold overtones and dark fantasy nature.Despite a small increase in budget over their previous titles, Yoko's development team again received criticism for bland world designs, poor controls, choppy performance, and worrisome gameplay aspects.At the close of 2014, Taro Yoko was once again out of a job.For a time, it seemed as though NieR would remain a cult classic, a peculiar one-off doomed by a small budget that existed against Square's more titanic Final Fantasy XIII. While momentarily removed of his curious vision, the world was not yet done with Yoko.Taro Yoko regularly explores complex themes in his games - chief among them the desire for players to kill things or stand above others. In this interview from 2014, Yoko discusses the ""invisible walls"" of game development that affect or prevent certain kinds of experiences from existing in the sphere of gaming. He gives the example of an emotionally packed experience that might last only three minutes would not be well-received by the audience at a budgetary price tag of $60, even if it was an artistic masterpiece. He is endlessly fascinated with the exploration of violence as a narrative device, and how gamers have come to expect a certain amount of that violence in their games in order for the experiences to be memorable or motivating.While video games often rally us with achievements for killing a set amount of enemies and reward us for our brutality, Yoko regards these concepts as cold, strange, and removed from humanity. These comments might come off as strange considering that he's the developer of action RPGs that regularly feature dozens of on-screen enemies to kill at once, but similar to Hideo Kojima's philosophy of deconstruction via gameplay, Yoko's philosophical ideas are presented through subverting expectations. He rationalizes the behaviors of the player through the actions of each character, and one of the reasons that so many of the characters throughout NieR resolve their personal issues through violence is that it makes it easier for the player to explore outwardly inhumane concepts in a humane way.Despite the grand, sweeping narrative arcs present in his games and the unified concepts that exist throughout the massive scope of NieR and Drakengard's lore, Taro Yoko is a creator who seems to abhor consistency. There is a thread of identity and philosophy that unites each of these games, and at once the framework is undone by the intentional lack of clarity across multiple timelines, characters, dimensions, and possible endings. Yoko seems less interested in the cohesion of the games and more interested in how the games make you feel. Outside of the bloodshed and destruction, it is the quiet moments that are most remembered in his games, whether it's the robots reenacting Shakespeare in Nier: Automata or Kainé and Emil's tender, familial conversations. The actual gameplay are a placating gesture to the idea of gaming as a whole - they're simply vessels for the narrative.Taro Yoko is known across the internet for more than just his video games - his live persona is as strange and eccentric as the games he makes. Yoko has long questioned his own identity and prefers to present himself at fan events and interviews by wearing an Emil head or operating a sock puppet. His works are a deep, internalized reflection of who he is and how he views the world, and similar to other game designers with singular presentations he is extremely talented with keeping his teams focused on his visions.Yoko is a developer who hides in plain sight. His obsessive design philosophies often clash with his working sensibilities, and during the development of Nier: Automata he ended up living away from his family and sleeping at the studio (the game was nearly cancelled because Taro Yoko hates waking up early). While Automata carried many of the same elements as his previous entries, he relinquished the overall development and gameplay choices to Platinum Games and his young staff. Outside of the narrative, Taro views gaming as a vehicle for both player and developer intention:Identity is the core component of the NieR narrative. The search for meaning is so indelibly linked to the forward momentum of both NieR and NieR: Automata that after stripping its narrative of living humans, it is not bereft of humanity. The clash between the androids, aliens and robots created some of the most philosophical moments in any game in recent memory, and littered the narrative with political philosophy, capitalist deconstructionism, the importance of unions, the dangers of the military, art in a vacuum, internalized trauma, and ultimately the search for happiness and meaning. The inclusion of names like Marx, Engels, Pascal, Adam, Eve, and more are built on the framework of identity and exist to push the player past comfort and into the further exploration of its humanist themes.NieR: Automata felt like much more than the unexpected sequel to the 2010 cult classic; it felt like the true surge of Yoko exploring his most fascinating themes.After years of turmoil, a bond forged between two unlikely companies. Platinum Games' freelance development of the next NieR property did more than legitimize the niche series; it also saved Platinum from bankruptcy. Not only would NieR: Automata go on to sell over two million copies (a bonafide hit!), it created a new fan base for both NieR and Platinum, and rescued the series from the ire of Square Enix. NieR: Automata expanded upon every facet of the original NieR, but found an identity of its own. This gave incredible leisure to the design of the narrative, world, and gameplay.What is it about NieR that so many people find so special? It's not only the fans that have such a deep fondness for the series, but the developers, producers, and designers as well. The bidding war over NieR: Automata was exciting, with several freelance developers desperate to put their own spin on the world of NieR. When it came time to finance the project, Square was hesitant until the producer of Dragon Quest X and XI bullied them into full cooperation:After an overwhelmingly alluring E3 trailer and the premise of the developer of Metal Gear Rising and Bayonetta working on the next bonkers Taro Yoko game, fans were on board. The future for NieR looked bright, and luckily, this brightness would long remain - the incredible success of NieR: Automata over the last few years has given rise to projects that fans never dreamed would happen.The first was the partnership between the world of NieR and that of Final Fantasy XIV. After recently enjoying its own incredible success, the Shadowbringers expansion would allow players to experience NieR: Automata in the form of several enormous raids such as The Puppet's Bunker and The Copied Factory. Intent on continuing with his infamous strangeness regardless of the game and platform, Yoko's team did more than just place locations and items from NieR into Final Fantasy XIV. They sought to indelibly link what made NieR so infamous to the popular MMORPG's most successful expansion yet.It wasn't enough that the NieR raids had their own unique challenges and mechanics - Taro Yoko admittedly wanted to destroy Final Fantasy XIV's servers as a gameplay device.To give him credit, Final Fantasy XIV knows as much about being destroyed and remade as NieR does.Now, the unthinkable is happening.We are getting a reimagining of NieR: Replicant, and it comes out in a scant few months. Yosuke Saito, the series producer, clarified in the earliest introduction that this game ""is not a remake or a remaster. It's a version up."" When it comes to Taro Yoko, it's often difficult to pry his dark jocularity away from his sincerity. Fans have become used to his antics, but despite it all, few expected that we would ever receive a reimagining of the first game after its poor initial sales. This is both a testament to the hard work of the design team, and to the fans who bought NieR: Automata in such large numbers.Knowing the future of NieR is difficult. NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139..., when it comes out in April, will undoubtedly expand on both the game's overall narrative and the rapidly growing player base. Once again we will be taken into the world of NieR by way of an outside developer (while this time NieR is being developed by Toylogic, Platinum Games has creative input by way of overseeing aspects of the battle system), where fans both old and new will be able to enjoy the compelling and emotionally devastating narrative of the original NieR. It's never been a better time to get into this series, and NieR remains a breath of fresh air against many of Square Enix's more exhausted IPs. Existing for even one second in the dreamland of Taro Yoko is an unbridled, chaotic joy.I can say with utmost confidence that as a longtime fan of NieR, I have no fucking clue what to expect.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*hJWLigdP3ky8PvVowwDP7g.jpeg,https://medium.com/super-jump/nier-and-back-again-405b343edda1,design,ae15e0a1ea92b544df4142700b56998405ef77c0ab4af4a61865be31
"Wisdom From The Women Leading The AI Industry, With Karen K. Burns of Fyma","As part of my series about the women leading the Artificial Intelligence industry, I had the pleasure of interviewing Karen K. Burns.Karen is co-founder and CEO of Fyma, a Tallinn based startup whose AI turns any new and legacy outdoor and CCTV camera into a smart sensor to capture real time data and turn it into actionable insights.With 770 million CCTV cameras installed around the world today and set to exceed 1 billion by 2021, Karen is on a mission to help companies unlock value hidden within existing video footage using AI and computer vision. Her goal is to improve the layout and design of urban spaces so people and objects can move around more efficiently.Karen is regularly invited to speak on strategy, business development and management topics at conferences and events including Google Baltics, Nordic Testing Days (keynotes), TTÜ Cyber Conference, Digigirls with Telia among others. She is a highly passionate advocate for increasing inclusion of women in STEM and management positions.Thank you so much for doing this with us! Can you share with us the 'backstory"" of how you decided to pursue this career path?My dream was to work in film production and I have an undergraduate degree in Film and TV and a Master's in film studies from University of London and UCL respectively. During my studies I worked as part of ICT teams at British Telecom and then at the UK's health and social care regulator, eventually managing a small team and an operational budget of £14M, all at the young age of 21. It wasn't my dream and, after 4 years of office work, I finally got to working in film production and worked on a number of Hollywood blockbusters including the Star Wars and The Fast and the Furious franchises, on set in the Middle East. While it may sound exciting and glamorous, the reality was minimum 12-hour days in a toxic working environment, lengthy commutes as well as the challenge of fitting in family life and raising a small child. Needless to say, the role quickly took its toll and unable to achieve any kind of work life balance that suited me, I made the decision to leave the industry and return to my home country of Estonia.Back home I fell into a business development role. I have always been commercially minded and found I had a natural aptitude to lead teams and build businesses from scratch. I was invited to join Estonia's fastest growing software development house, where I helped the company triple its annual revenue within two years. This was also where I met my Fyma co-founder, Taavi. We work really well together and have a complementary skill-set and temperament. So we knew eventually we'd start a business together. Seeing the potential of AI and with computer vision still in its infancy and applicable to a wide variety of sectors we saw an opportunity to make the technology scalable and came up with the idea for Fyma. I also decided to spruce up my education and completed a graduate diploma in law at BPP university, which has come in handy now that I am a founder!What lessons can others learn from your story?I guess these stories serve best to let others interpret the kind of lessons that would be useful for them. Perhaps one thing has been that it is possible to change career direction not once, but even twice, like in my case, and with grit and determination make it a success. Perhaps, experiences like mine can open the door for others to change career direction even more times. We are living longer, studying for longer (and a wider variety of topics) and are more entrepreneurial than ever. There is no such thing as a job for life any more, unless you create it yourself. I studied Film and TV and Law, and am now leading an AI company. So it really isn't about the 'right background' any longer.Another learning I'd highlight, is that it is near impossible to be an entrepreneur or senior leader when you have small kids without a strong support network. Nobody can sustain 'doing it all' on their own, it is a myth that really damages women. Whether that support network is paid help, family, or friends - it is necessary. I am extremely grateful to my mom, without whom I'd not have been able to move to Dubai for 6 weeks to take part in an accelerator, travel abroad for short work trips, or attend evening events and dinners (with Covid, these last two things are no longer an issue).Can you tell our readers about the most interesting projects you are working on now?At the moment, it's Fyma, our AI startup. The company is going through a fascinating phase of growth and learning phase. We are hiring and closely observing how our clients use the technology. One of the most interesting aspects of the project is being able to hear first-hand the different ideas clients have for the application of computer vision AI technology.Whilst we are piloting Fyma with our end customers ourselves, we also work with resellers who are using the tech in very creative and fantastic ways. For example, a client is helping a university in their home country with an experiment. In this experiment, they aim to analyse the impact that a fake news billboard can have. To do so, they placed a billboard in an urban area, monitored by a camera. The feed is anonymised and sent to Fyma for processing to detect how many people and for how long are in the vicinity of the billboard. The stats of people's behaviour around the billboard are gathered anonymously and securely with Fyma.None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?I would not have been able to start building Fyma without my mom's help. She played a massive role and provided crucial support when I needed it. Essentially, she has been helping out with everything in the household and with my kids. My husband lives and works in Dubai, so I am effectively alone in my day to day life and have to rely on family and paid help to get menial stuff done.I would also mention my friend Triinu, she's one of my oldest friends. We have been close for 28 years now. Recently, she started a journey of mindfulness, self-healing and self-improvement. She quit her job as a department head with a Swiss manufacturing company last year and joined a spiritual community in France, carving a gentler, more mindful and fulfilled life and career out for herself. Witnessing her journey over the past 5 years has been extremely inspirational and propelled me to start the journey of my own personal growth. I have been working with a coach since last August on personal development and growing as a leader, to be able to grow with the company, as we expand and increase our team size.What are the 5 things that most excite you about the AI industry? Why?The influx of women into the industry from previously 'uncool' female-dominated fields like statistics. Gender parity is not only a desirable goal in itself, but also brings a lot of other benefits. Having more women also means harnessing their ability to correct the inbuilt biases in algorithms and thus bring a more balanced set of insights to our field. Also all the new jobs that will likely be created - there will be careers in the future that we cannot even think of now in the AI industry.What are the 5 things that concern you about the AI industry? Why?Artificial intelligence is not something that most people are well-informed about. What most people know has also to some extent been shaped by fiction, fear of the unknown, or extreme cases. Misinformation and misconceptions, people not understanding the possibilities, the limitations of this technology. They all contribute to people being afraid and suspicious of it.Also, legislators, instead of creating frameworks to exploit the technology in the best way, are creating a muddy area. Some areas of the AI industry are over-regulated and some aren't even discussed. Their very slow movement to understand and regulate a field that is extremely fast moving and their inability to create sandbox environments to enable innovation.There is also an alarming trend in the business and startup community. Many are claiming they are 'doing AI' or have 'AI in their product' when they really have no proprietary AI whatsoever. This ends up building mistrust from investors, the community and the general public.As you know, there is an ongoing debate between prominent scientists, (personified as a debate between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg,) about whether advanced AI has the future potential to pose a danger to humanity. What is your position about this?I actually had to look this up as I don't follow either on social media and I am in the Zuckerberg camp on this one. We are still so far from AI 'wiping out humanity', it is more Orwell meets HG Wells in my opinion and of course, this sparks people's imagination and fear in equal measure.The threats will be (already are) from ourselves as humans and how we use the technology. Artificial Intelligence enables deepfakes, massive spread of misinformation and therefore can be used (again, already has been) to manipulate masses. Terrorism combined with AI is of course a potential major threat. But again, I don't associate that or similar risks to AI itself killing people, but rather how humans will choose to utilise it.What can be done to prevent such concerns from materializing? And what can be done to assure the public that there is nothing to be concerned about?It's all about education, and from early on. Our school systems are mostly churning out people who know how to use applications, but not how to create them. Curricula are created and reviewed by people who are so far removed from these topics that they don't get the attention they deserve early on in school. In the very near future, AI will touch every field we operate in and kids need to learn about the possibilities and limitations of this technology, so they can make more informed and free-of-fear judgments about it.Additionally, legislators need to start moving faster on supporting this field, so that the grey area I described above starts to clear up and take shape. We also need more information about what is and what is not allowed. This will set boundaries and provide reassurances. Ethics and the dangers of AI need to be discussed, acknowledged and then accounted for in the legislative process, with the help of subject matter specialists. More information means less prejudice and fear.How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world? Can you share a story?On a personal level, I am an active member of two grassroots charity projects and donate everything from clothing and school gear to furniture to families in need, coordinate food parcels and so forth. This way I know for sure the help is going where it is most needed and I can buy or give away things people actually have a need for.I've also been a support person to a single mother in difficult circumstances since 2012, supported her from job hunting and interview preparation to refurbishing her kitchen. She got married last week, bought an apartment late last year and it's been good to see her grow.As you know, there are not that many women in your industry. Can you share 3 things that you would you advise to other women in the AI space to thrive?The AI space is perhaps not so different from other male-dominated fields, and what I try to adhere to every day are pretty simple and basic truths - with passion, grit and repetition (this last one is key really):1) What you do is who you are. No better quote than this book title from Ben Horowitz. For me it means fulfilling promises, learning constantly and on repeat, leading by example (what I do, not what I say, will be the example).2) Surround yourself with people who know AI and if you're a non-technical founder, go find that techie co-founder that you can really trust.3) Speak your truth, always.Can you advise what is needed to engage more women into the AI industry?I honestly believe this is purely down to properly marketing the field to girls and women, combined with role models who can both inspire and ignite to pick this field. There are so many cool applications for the tech, women need to discover these more easily. For example, there are brilliant free of charge online courses available I recommend taking to see quickly and easily, if the field is something to move into. The backgrounds of data scientists, data engineers and analysts can be very broad and transitioning into this field from elsewhere can be achieved.What is your favorite ""Life Lesson Quote""? Can you share a story of how that had relevance to your own life?I have stumbled upon so many inspirational life lesson quotes that I have written them down on a note in my phone and occasionally read them and remind myself about them. When I find a new quote I really chime with, I add it in. However, one of my favourite ones is from a former president of Estonia, Mr Lennart Meri, who used a farming metaphor to inspire getting over hard times: ""the manure we're in today will provide nourishment for the soil of our future endeavours"". So whatever is happening right now that is not going well, the learning from it will support my future growth. It also reminds me that with hard work, most difficult situations can be overcome.You are a person of great influence. If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)I kind of already did something like this. When Estonia's populist government was appointed in 2019, I was part of a small group that started a grassroots movement called #myEstoniatoo, where we started organising to educate people around fake news, democracy and human rights and we held a concert that same year with over 10,000 attendees. We've been campaigning almost monthly ever since, hosting webinars, meetups and building a strong community around it. That old government fell in January 2021 and Estonia now is the only country in the world, where the head of state and Prime Minister and both female. The cabinet has 7 female, extremely competent, ministers out of 15 - our biggest number ever - and it is so inspiring to see this, hoping I had a small part to play in this huge change away from a closed Estonia to an open one.On a more global scale, and related to the work we're doing at Fyma, I believe we need to think more about leveraging AI to help people, not only businesses. I'm convinced computer vision AI has a big role to play in making physical spaces more equitable for all those that live in it and move through it. Rehaul of the way our cities are built. They don't take into account women, children, people with disabilities and have been largely built to support car traffic, causing noise, and often forget about the importance of enough greenery.How can our readers follow you on social media?On LinkedIn under my name, Karen K Burns, and @Karenkangro on Twitter.

3 Things Companies Need to Understand About Technology Today,"As a part of a software development company, it often baffles me the way some executives think about technology. You'd think that by 2021 most C-level execs would have understood the now famous saying that states that ""every company is a technology company now."" Yet, many of them still feel like technology is something of an asset, a tool to resort to tackle certain tasks.That, of course, is way wrong. Technology has become paramount for businesses of all sizes and across industries to the point where organizations that don't adapt to put technology at the core of their workflows fall severely behind the competition. That's truer today, when the pandemic consequences are shaping a new normal that's bringing numerous challenges that can only be answered through technology.In fact, technology (through digital acceleration) has been the most widespread response to the COVID-19 crisis. It was through automation, hyperconnection, remote work, and digital data-driven strategies that businesses were able to overcome the initial impact of the pandemic and make it all the way to 2021. Technology allowed businesses to build resilience, stabilize operations, and increase their agility, things that will become essential moving forward.Of course, those things don't come by merely integrating technology here and there within your workflow. There has to be a change of mindset to truly reap the benefits of digital acceleration, a shift that has to come from the top down to ensure it seeps into every corner of the company. That's why I think executives should stop seeing technology as a mere tool and understand the following 4 key notions to leverage it in these uncertain times.The sudden need to digitize processes due to the pandemic had a lot of companies scrambling to get the talent needed to help them. That's because it's not enough to subscribe to a digital platform or buy software and expect technology to work seamlessly right off the bat. There are implementation challenges and technical aspects you'll have to deal with in order to get the most out of technology solutions. And that's without considering the companies that need custom software solutions!What I'm saying is fairly simple - to truly get the most out of the technology companies buy or develop, executives need to hunt for experienced talent to help them. Collaborating with seasoned engineers and tech professionals can provide them with the digital capabilities they need to meet their digital goals.Unfortunately, securing that talent can prove very challenging. That's because there's a talent shortage in the developed world (especially now, where virtually every company on the planet is looking for the same kind of talent). How to overcome that trouble? You should combine 2 approaches. On one hand, you should aim to achieve talent agility with your own workers. Doing so can provide you not only with the tech talent you want but will also ensure that the tech team knows your company's culture intimately.On the other hand, you should consider using an on-demand workforce. In other words, you can hire a software development outsourcing company, augment your team with staffing services, or work alongside a freelancer. Doing so can provide you with instant talent to fill in your talent gaps, thus ensuring a more seamless technological integration.For years now, executives have rushed their teams to launch products and services as quickly as possible. The notion fueling that approach is that they can monetize the product rather fast while beating the competition to the market. Naturally, those things are important, so you should keep speed as a main concern of your technical development and implementation. However, you shouldn't, under any circumstances, put speed in front of everything else.Delivering technological solutions quickly often means cutting corners during development, such as using subpar code, skipping tests, or using complex workarounds to integrate the solution with the broader tech environment. All of those things often lead to a decrease in quality which ultimately impacts the user experience. Given we're living in the golden age of user experience, you can't afford that.It doesn't matter if you're developing a new CRM for your business or implementing a prepackaged chatbot on your site - if you hurry the process, you might end up getting a second-tier performance. To avoid that, executives need to understand that developing and implementing technology takes time. In other words, you have to aim for clean development and integration that spends as much time as necessary to create solid foundations on which the technology can scale. Additionally, you should never ignore the proper QA and testing phases.Doing that will improve the quality of the final product and its implementation, whether you're creating a mobile app from the ground up or implementing a new AI-powered algorithm to increase your security.Circling back to that ""every company is a technology company now"" quote, it's important to unwrap what hides behind it. Apart from implying that executives need to let go of the notion that technology is just a tool, that modern adage means that any company needs to invest in technology in some way or another. However, that doesn't translate into changing your business model. Rather, it means that companies always have a place for technology in their businesses.Let me explain myself. Though it may be that way some time ago, ""technology company"" isn't a synonym for ""company that develops technologies for customers."" Today, ""technology company"" is a wider concept that, sure, encompasses Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft but that also covers companies as dissimilar as Amazon, Uber, and Pizza Hut.How come? Because ""technology company"" now means ""company that leverages technology, be it internally, externally, or both."" So, you don't have to be an application development company to be a technology company. You can be a pharmacy and still see yourself as a company, mainly because your operations rely on technology to achieve better results and increased productivity. Using technology at the core of your workflow provides you with agility and flexibility to tackle any modern challenge.Thus, executives have to understand that they don't have to offer the next Instagram to be a ""technology company."" They need to embrace technology as a revolution for their operational standards. Doing that will grant them the opportunity to create internal services that can be used by multiple teams, reduce organizational friction by ensuring self-service access to critical digital resources, and increase transparency and productivity by democratizing access to data and insights.These might feel like obvious recommendations for some but I assure you that keeping them in the spotlight is necessary for the entire executive spectrum to finally grasp the importance of transforming their businesses into ""technology companies."" These are the 3 pillars that will allow them to make a shift in their approach to technology and lead to a true mindset revolution.Additionally, it's important for executives to understand that these aren't mere suggestions - these are action paths that are already mandatory for organizations of all sizes and backgrounds. In other words, businesses that fail to adopt them will see how they are quickly surpassed by those that do embrace them.Surely you don't want to be among the ones that lag behind. So, if you're still thinking of technology as a tool, consider these concepts. They'll provide you with the clarity you need to reformulate your approach to tech strategy and ensure you enhance your organizational operations to provide increased value to your customers and your employees.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*ECDasC9YwJkMLvuciHkGyw.png,https://emma-white20.medium.com/3-things-companies-need-to-understand-about-technology-today-9d1f209774ff,startups,aede81ce3ae87fd366deac2eae95711c3d287076303c6378b3485a49
"Bankruptcy Claimed Their Jobs, and Now They're Out for Payback",By Lauren Coleman-Lochner and Eliza Ronalds-Hannon,,https://medium.com/bloomberg-businessweek/bankruptcy-claimed-their-jobs-and-now-theyre-out-for-payback-f7dbc79cedca,economy,af34bb9530012bdf7068e807d0afdd34200ee634a2ec4be0e5ea557c
Shocking Insights,"Your internal experience is uniquely yours. Arguably, it is the thing that is most yours. Only you know precisely what you see in your mind's eye, and only you are privy to your inner thoughts. So how would you react if you found out your mind's eye can be manipulated? And stranger yet, what if I told you our story starts with a peculiar headache remedy from the reign of the Roman Empire?In the first century AD, Scribonius Largus (Roman emperor Claudius's royal physician) found a treatment for headaches in a most unexpected source: an electric ray. By placing this strange, shocking fish on his patients' scalps, Scribonius became the first known person to apply electricity to the brain. Although Scribonius was only looking to make a headache go away, he unwittingly became an early pioneer of a technology that would lead to many insights - including a recent insight into how we visualize and why vividness of visual imagery is different for different people.Over the centuries, electrical stimulation to the brain has moved from Scribonius's electric fish to 17th-century hand-crank generators and finally to modern and scientifically-validated techniques. Much of this exploration was for medical treatments - after all, how do you convince someone to hold a strange, electric fish to their head if not as a way to help ease their pain?In recent years, however, electrical stimulation of the brain has become an important part of the neuroscientist's toolbox, allowing researchers to manipulate parts of the brain without having to open the skull. Electrical stimulation has been used to treat depression, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia and has been used in many studies of memory and attention.Most interestingly for us, though, is a study from 2020 in which researchers used electrical stimulation to adjust the vividness of people's visual imagery. Their results support a theory of how we visualize and why we visualize differently.Before we look at how electrical stimulation works and why it proves to be a wonderful tool for understanding visual imagery and aphantasia, let's take a step back to better understand what it means to have different levels of vividness in your visual imagery.Although not often talked about, visual imagery varies wildly from one person to another. When picturing a waterfall, perhaps you see a pleasant but fuzzy image in your mind's eye while your friend sees a picture-perfect waterfall. Or, like me, you might be one of the 3% of the population who sees nothing at all. If you aren't familiar with the differences in visual imagery (and the total lack of visual imagery: aphantasia), check out this primer.In just the past few years, researchers have started realizing just how much visual imagery varies from person to person. The term aphantasia was coined in 2015, which goes to show how new this field is. Many questions remain to be answered, such as what is visualization, why do people experience it differently, and where do these differences live in the brain?While previous research has found a relationship between imagery vividness and brain activity in the visual cortex (the area of the brain that your eyes connect to), we don't understand why this difference exists. Is there something about the visual cortex of someone with hyperphantasia that allows them to picture a crystal clear waterfall?To get a better idea of what is going on in our brains when we visualize and why some brains might create clearer images than others, researchers took a page from Scribonius's book and electrically stimulated different parts of people's brains to see how this might affect their visualizations.Although you and I understand electricity much better than Scribonius did, we still don't truly have a clear picture of what happens when we hold an electric current against our scalp (or a stingray, for that matter). One big breakthrough is the knowledge that neurons, the cells of the brain, communicate via electricity and that we can influence this communication by pushing electricity into the brain via the scalp. While it may seem like a magical brain-controlling technology, it's important to understand the precision (or lack thereof) with which electrical stimulation targets neurons.In the same way that Scribonius merely held his electric fish against his patient's forehead, researchers using electrical stimulation place electrically-charged pads or magnets on the head to push electricity into the brain. (Note that researchers sometimes use a battery to create the electricity - called transcranial direct-current stimulation or tDCS - and other times use a strong electromagnet to do so - called transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS.)Although neuroscientists can open a brain and stimulate individual neurons directly, this is complex and dangerous and is only done when a surgeon already needs to open the skull for a medical procedure. The non-invasive method of electrical stimulation, in which electricity is placed on the scalp rather than directly on an open brain, doesn't cause individual neurons to fire but instead increases the excitability of the targeted neurons. What do we mean by excitability?Imagine (without visualizing, if you wish) a pot of popcorn, full of kernels flying in every direction and causing other kernels to pop when they land. If each kernel is a neuron in your visual cortex, then open brain surgery is like taking the lid off the pot and poking specific kernels, causing them to pop. In non-invasive electrical stimulation, we leave the lid on the pot and turn up the stove burner, not causing any specific kernels to pop but increasing the temperature of each kernel, bringing it closer to popping. This is what we mean by increased excitability: we don't cause specific kernels to pop but make it easier for any given kernel to pop. In the brain, we don't cause any specific neuron to fire, but instead bring each one closer to firing. Without this increased excitability, a neuron might only fire if several other neurons trigger it at once. With the electrical stimulation, it might trigger with just a single neuron's input.In this way, electrical stimulation (without opening the skull) is not a precise practice in which individual neurons are targeted. But, by changing the excitability of the entire brain region, the neurons start chattering with one another a lot more, shifting the activity in that area. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, when the activity of a brain area shifts, you start experiencing some strange things.Let's say I place my electromagnet at the back of your head, nearest the part of your brain that your eyes connect to and where vision is processed (this is the visual cortex). By pumping electricity into this area, I can make you see stars, just as if you bumped your head, stood up too quickly, or rubbed your eyes too hard. These stars you see - known to scientists as phosphenes - are a result of your neurons firing despite a lack of appropriate visual input. Why do we see stars when we add electricity to our visual cortex?Think back to our popcorn: if you crank up the burner for a brief moment, any kernel that was close to popping will fire off and you'll see a sudden bursting of kernels. Pushing a large amount of electricity into your visual cortex is the same idea: it causes some number of neurons to suddenly fire off and thus you see flashing phosphenes.As researchers induced these phosphenes in more people, they came to realize that some people require more or less electricity to see a flash of light than others. It was almost as if some people were more ""ready"" to see phosphenes. Returning to our pot of popcorn, this is as if my pot is quite hot with many kernels ready to pop, while yours is on low heat and isn't close to done. If someone wanted to cause a burst of pops in each pot by turning the burner up for a moment, they'd have to crank up the heat under your pot but might be able to get the same effect with only a small amount of heat for my pot. The same is true in our visual cortices: my neurons might already be more excitable than yours, meaning that a scientist can push just a bit of electricity into my brain to make me see stars while they'd have to push quite a lot into yours.With this in mind, researchers can measure how ""excitable"" someone's visual cortex is by seeing just how much electricity they need to pump in before causing the light show. So, in an attempt to find out what differences exist in the brains of people with very different levels of visual imagery, scientists used this method to measure the excitability of the visual neurons in people with different levels of imagery vividness. Their question was - does the ability to create vivid visual imagery in one's mind's eye have something to do with how ready and able that person's visual neurons are to fire? Does excitability in visual areas relate to vividness of visual imagery?And their finding: it absolutely does. The more vivid someone's mind's eye, the less excitable their visual cortex. If I can push just a bit of electricity into the back of your head and cause you to see bright flashes of light, chances are you have a weak ability to visualize. On the other hand, hyperphantasics, who see picture-perfect imagery, require a high level of electricity to see phosphenes.""When we found that cortical excitability was negatively correlated with imagery strength, we were at first surprised,"" lead researcher Rebecca Keogh told me. ""But as all of the other experiments started to line up showing the same trend, we became excited that we had found a potential underlying mechanism that explains individual difference in imagery ability.""As exciting and satisfying these results were, the researchers couldn't stop there. They had shown that phosphene thresholds can predict the vividness of someone's imagery, but they weren't sure if an excitable visual cortex causes low vividness. Dr. Keogh explained that ""it might be that people with stronger imagery tend to have less excitable cortexes but this plays no causative role in imagery ability. So to be sure that cortical excitability really is playing a part in individual differences in imagery ability we needed to show that changing cortical excitability likewise changed imagery strength.""And that's where the sci-fi-like research of modifying your internal experience comes in.We've seen how researchers can measure your visual cortex's excitability using electricity: pump in a jolt of electricity and see how much is required to cause you to see flashes of light. The smaller the jolt that worked, the more excitable your cortex is. This strong but short-lived jolt of electricity is caused by an electromagnet (TMS) and is akin to turning the burner up high for just a second. But neuroscientists can also use a slightly different flavor of electrical stimulation that relies on a battery instead of a magnet and applies a weaker but consistent electric current (tDCS). This is more like raising the temperature of the burner slightly and leaving it there.When researchers use tDCS to drive a small amount of electricity in a sustained manner, they make an area of your brain more excitable - or, if they swap around the negative and positive terminals, less excitable (like turning down the burner). The difference here is that, instead of a short-lived effect that lets researchers measure excitability, this electrical stimulation holds its effect long enough to allow researchers to temporarily modify the excitability of part of your brain.With this tool in hand, all the researchers must do is adjust the excitability of someone's visual cortex and see if this causes them to visualize more or less vividly. Based on the previous data with phosphene measurements, we'd expect that if we make your visual cortex more excitable, you'll see less vivid imagery, and if we make it less excitable, your imagery will be more vivid.While this seems straightforward, there's another issue to tackle: how can we know for sure if your vividness is changing? You may feel like the images you are seeing are more or less vivid than before, but it can be difficult to know for sure how this is changing (particularly if the change is subtle).Luckily, there are ways to measure how vivid your visual imagery is without relying on your subjective feedback. The test these researchers used for this purpose is the binocular rivalry task, which, in brief, works as such:I show your left eye a blue circle and your right eye a red circle. Because these images perfectly overlap, you can't see both at once and your brain has to pick which to see, often flipping back and forth between seeing the blue and the red circle. By showing you a blue circle before showing you the overlapping circles, I prime your brain to land on the blue circle and thus you're more likely to see that instead of the red circle. If instead of showing you a blue circle before showing you the overlapping circles, I merely ask you to picture the blue circle, you'll still be primed to land on the blue circle instead of the red circle. Importantly, the more vivid your visual imagery, the stronger this priming effect. Thus, by asking you many times to visualize a blue circle, showing you the overlapping circles, and then asking which circle you saw, we can objectively measure how vivid your imagery is.You can read more about the binocular rivalry task in this summary, but for the sake of this article, all you need to know is that there is an objective way to measure the vividness of your imagery.So now our researchers yield two tools: one to adjust the excitability of the visual cortex and another to objectively measure imagery vividness. With these in hand, they can address the question of causality: of whether or not the excitability in the visual cortex is responsible for how vivid your imagery is. Researchers hooked up 60 people to electrical stimulation that increased or decreased the excitability of their visual cortex and then tested their level of vividness with the binocular rivalry task. Here is what the researchers found:Amazingly, they were able to change participants' internal experience of visualization by changing how excitable their visual cortex is. Though you may believe your visualizations to be something you alone control, these researchers can flip a switch and change how vivid your imagery is.One thing to note is that this change in vividness is not day and night. The participants didn't report an obvious change in their imagery when experiencing the electrical stimulation. It's even possible that their visual vividness didn't change and that, instead, the incoming electricity caused some other shift in their brain which in turn caused a difference in the binocular rivalry task. However, there's a large amount of research showing changes in the binocular rivalry task do align with changes in vividness of imagery, suggesting that these participants really were experiencing a shift in their mind's eye.The researchers have laid out a solid study, showing that, most probably, a more excitable visual cortex leads to less vivid imagery and vice versa. Why would this be and what does it mean for how we visualize?Let's return to our pot of popcorn, representing the neurons in our visual cortex. Remember that a very excitable visual cortex is like a hot pot of kernels, ready to pop at a moment's notice. Now pretend that you're an experimental artist who only draws pictures in pots of popcorn, poking this kernel and that kernel with a hot poker until the Mona Lisa appears in popped kernels.If this is your goal, would you rather work with a hot pot of kernels ready to pop at the slightest nudge or a cool, tranquil pot with not much going on? Remember that, when one kernel pops, it's likely to set off other kernels. So which pot would let your masterpiece shine, and which would cause it to be a fuzzy and unclear art piece? Hopefully, you've picked the cold, unexcitable pot. It'd be impossible to draw a picture in a hot pot of kernels that pop at the lightest touch, as your Mona Lisa would end up being lost among all the accidentally popped popcorn.For perhaps the same reason a hot, excitable pot leads to a fuzzier image, a more excitable visual cortex leads to less vivid imagery: there is too much noise to draw a clear picture. The less excitable your visual cortex, however, the clearer a picture you can draw.Who is doing this drawing? Is there an experimental artist in your brain, poking neurons to draw on your visual cortex? In a sense, there is: your prefrontal cortex. You can think of this part of your brain, which sits just behind your eyes, as the ""final stop"" for normal vision.When you look at the Mona Lisa, the picture first enters your eyes, where it is then sent to your visual cortex in the back of your brain, and then (via a few other stops on a very complex track) reaches your prefrontal cortex, which seems to help you be conscious of this perception. But when you visualize the Mona Lisa in your mind's eye, the opposite happens: your prefrontal cortex sends the signal straight to your visual cortex.Visualization, then, is when our popcorn artist feels an urge to draw an image on the kernels. Brain imaging studies support this analogy, showing that when you visualize an image, your prefrontal cortex activates and subsequently causes neurons in your visual cortex to fire.We've seen why electrical stimulation on the visual cortex might lead to more or less vivid imagery, but what can it say about the prefrontal cortex's involvement? Can we use electricity to improve the skills of our experimental popcorn artist?Using a similar setup as before, the researchers can show how electrical stimulation to the prefrontal cortex (rather than to the visual cortex) changes visual imagery.It turns out that, contrary to our visual cortex, increasing the excitability of our prefrontal cortex leads to more vivid imagery while decreasing this excitability leads to fuzzier imagery. Whereas excitability of our corn kernels (or visual cortex) makes for a worse art piece, excitability of our artist (our prefrontal cortex) leads to a stunning work of art. You can think about this as if, by pumping electricity into the front of our brain and exciting our prefrontal cortex, we're giving the artist a very hot poker instead of just a warm poker, allowing her to more precisely draw her picture on the corn kernels. Alter the electrical stimulation to instead decrease the excitability of the prefrontal cortex, and the artist's tools become too cold to draw a clear picture.To summarize this theory, we can say that someone who has very vivid imagery has either a very excitable prefrontal cortex, a not-excitable visual cortex, or both, and, inversely, an aphantasic has either a less excited prefrontal cortex, a more excited visual cortex, or both.Many readers, especially those with aphantasia, will be quick to ask: can electrical stimulation give you imagery? If you excite my prefrontal cortex and inhibit my visual cortex, will my mind's eye see for the first time?The answer is an unfortunate ""we don't know"". This study involves people with a wide range of imagery vividness and did not specifically recruit people with aphantasia, and thus cannot speak to whether someone with no visual imagery would suddenly experience imagery. If electrical stimulation increases the vividness of someone with middle-of-the-road visual imagery, there's certainly a chance that it'd cause an aphantasic to see imagery. However, it's also entirely possible that the cause of aphantasia is a fundamental difference in the brain that goes beyond the excitability of these brain regions, suggesting that no amount of electric batteries, magnets, or stingrays would open someone's blind mind's eye.Although there's much to be learned around visualization and aphantasia, and while vividness of imagery is surely more complex than just an interaction between the prefrontal and visual cortices, this research has given us great insight into imagery. As we've seen, when researchers use electrical stimulation to change the excitability of your visual or prefrontal cortex, they appear to adjust the vividness of imagery you experience. This certainly bodes well for the theory that visualization is the reverse of sight - that, while sight involves images entering your eyes and passing through your visual cortex to your prefrontal cortex, your mind's eye ""sees"" by passing internal images from the prefrontal cortex to the visual cortex.So while Scribonius was only looking for a headache remedy, he may have been the first human to manipulate a mind's eye other than his own. And although they couldn't have known it, his patients were paving the way to a better understanding of how and why we (well, not all of us) visualize images.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1986/0*n6JCVP4-i1aA7_ZZ,https://mikeperrotta.medium.com/aphantasia-shocking-insights-40d3faab9991,neuroscience,afd6b6f8659f2a3842330ec50c35b62167038a6a042c80659f82c564
3 Reasons Why the New MIT Deep Learning Course is Ideal for Beginners,"Perhaps the most well-known resource for learning deep learning is Andrew Ng's series of 5 courses on Coursera. Those courses are still a great resource for anyone learning the fundamentals of the field but they are now a few years old (their launch was announced in August 2017). In this post, I will give you three main reasons why you should instead start from MIT's course that I am going to tell you about.Before I try to convince you to start your deep learning journey from there, here is a brief description of the course itself.This is the MIT's ""Introduction to Deep Learning"" (MIT 6.S191) and it is now in it's 5th year.On-campus, this is a 2-week intensive course that introduces the topic and goes into a decent amount of detail covering both the fundamentals and applications. MIT has been exceptionally generous to have all the material available online for free, for anyone to learn from.The 2021 edition is getting released to the wider public now. The first lecture was only released on 5th February 2021 and the plan is to release one lecture every week on a Friday for 12 weeks (lecture 12 scheduled for 23rd April 2021). The complete schedule with topics is here. In addition, there are 3 software labs that can be accessed.Thankfully, the videos from the previous years are also available and are worth watching and learning from in case you want to learn sooner and the release schedule for 2021 is slow for you!Normally, I would be telling you why you should learn deep learning to begin with. But since you are already reading this (and have made it to this point), I think you know why you want to upskill yourself and learn about deep learning. It is currently one of the most exciting development in the field of Artificial Intelligence and it is evolving at a rapid pace.Yes, you will not find a more up-to-date course at the moment and that too, from one of the best institutions in the world for free.Why is up-to-date important in deep learning?The speed of progress in deep learning is phenomenal. To get an idea of the pace of progress, check this out!The 2020 version of this course's introduction (which was amazing in itself) contained Ex-President Barack Obama introducing the course (where the video was generated artificially). To create this video, a full actual video of Obama was required which was then picked and stitched together (believe it or not, the voice quality was deliberately degraded to make it obvious that this was not real).However, in only 1 year, the field has advanced so rapidly and significantly that only a single static image is sufficient to create an artificial video of someone (you have to watch the first lecture of 2021 to see the demonstration! ).When you start learning about a new field, you are infinitely more motivated if you can get a sense of the big picture and a good feel of the breadth of the field in a short period. While you can spend your whole career within a small niche within deep learning, it would make sense if you, as a beginner, can get a decent breadth of the subject which is more than an hour's lecture giving you just an overview but not so deep that you get lost in the nitty-gritty details of a single technique and lose sight of the overall picture. I think this course gets the balance right. It has both breadths to leave you with a very good understanding of the (current) scope of the field while going in sufficient detail to help you get cracking on with your own deep learning projects!The course covers both the foundational theory (starting from the building blocks of deep learning: neural networks) and then moves on to cover well-known deep learning architectures and approaches (recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, generative models, reinforcement learning, etc.), important issues when dealing with deep learning (ethical issues such as bias, fairness etc.) and exciting application areas (such as AI in health) via guest lecturers.Please don't expect this course to be a walk in the park. You will have to put in the work and hours but the requirements to start making that effort are minimal. You need to have some knowledge of calculus (how to take derivatives), and linear algebra (how to multiply matrices). The programming exercises are based on Python (prior experience is not required but would, of course, be helpful).To conclude, if you have not started learning about deep learning yet, I'd say start with MIT's introductory course to get your feet wet. This post gave you three very good reasons for this choice (most up-to-date, the right blend of depth and breadth, and minimal pre-requisites). Once you are done with the MIT course, you should definitely check Andrew Ng's 5-course sequence in Coursera which goes into more depth of the foundational concepts of the field.",https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*ufrN7ogSLKty3mp7S-3ckw.jpeg,https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/learn-deep-learning-from-mit-in-2021-for-free-e85cc6adf2f4,artificial-intelligence,b2a716a910e062b529c7e0ebf42f4443ea293077b6c0f492cea1d79e
How to Make Money When the Bookies Get It Wrong and Lose,"When it comes to sports betting, bookies set and control the odds so that, most of the time, they don't lose - no matter the outcome or the number of people who won the bet. However, that doesn't mean they don't make mistakes! In fact, there's a strategy called value betting that makes the most of bookies' mistakes in order to maximize earnings. In this article, I'll show how to find value bets manually with free betting tools and also automatically with some lines of code in Python.We always want to increase our earnings in any activity we do, and betting is no exception. If we have to choose between getting paid double or triple of the amount of money risked or invested, I think we'd all agree to receive the latter - am I right? This is the concept behind value betting, and it's how bettors make money in the long run.Value bet occurs when the ""real odds"" of a match's outcome are better than what the bookies' odds suggest. The idea comes from the mathematical concept of expected value. Every time we make a bet, we should always look for value. For example, these are the ""Over 2.5 goals"" odds collected from 7 bookies during the week for the match Liverpool vs. Man City that will be played on February 7th.Although we still haven't calculated the real odds, we can clearly see that the bookies with higher odds (on top) will pay us more, so they might be good candidates for value bets.As you can see, the concept is simple, but the problem is how to calculate the real odds and find value bets without wasting a lot of time. Before explaining how to do this easily by writing some code, let me show how we would do it manually with betting tools, so you can also understand the math behind it.Note: Value betting is a profitable system backed by maths and statistics, but it's not risk-free. In case you're interested in a risk-free approach, check the ""surebets"" articles I wrote before. Finding surebets will demand more of your time but will help you make some money in the short run. In contrast, value betting will demand less of your time but will help you make money in the long run. Analyze what's the best option for you.In this example, we'll find value bets for the match Liverpool vs. Man City. Then we need to calculate real odds and bookies odds for ""1x2"" (1: Liverpool wins, x: Draw, 2:Man City wins)To make things simple, let's imagine we already have the real probabilities of the match (I'll show you how to calculate them a bit later). According to the predictions of the website FiveThirtyEight, Machester City (47%) have more chances of winning the match than Liverpool (28%).To find a value bet, we need to convert those probabilities to decimal odds. The odds will be the equivalent of the inverse of the probability.odds = 1/probabilyThen we obtain 3.57 for Liverpool, 2.12 for Man City, and 4.0 if there's a draw. This is what is known as ""real odds"" because they represent the real probabilities of an event to happen (they're also based on estimation but are better indicators than bookies' odds).Now to find a value bet, we need to compare these 3 ""real odds"" with the bookies' odds. To do so, we use the following formula.Value = (Bookies Odds / Real Odds) - 1We can say we found a value bet if value > 0These are a set of ""1x2"" odds I got from Odds Portal two days before the match. Let's compare.Using the ""value"" formula, we only found value bets for ""Manchester City Wins"" in MarathonBet, Pinnacle, and Unibet. The odds in those betting sites are higher than what it's supposed to be (2.12), so we can say those are value bets.Let's imagine we bet $100 on the draw. According to our real odds, that should be paying $400 (odds 4.0), but even if we bet in the bookie with the highest odd (3.8) and win, we would make -$20 of what we're supposed to make ($400). However, there's value if Man City wins because those $100 would make +7$ of what's supposed to make ($212).But this is only 1 match! Value bets can be found across all betting markets in many sports events. By placing bets with value, experience bettors maximize their earning. However, finding them one by one is time-consuming; that's why most of them pay for tools that let them find value bets in a couple of minutes. Fortunately, you don't need to pay for it if you know at least the basics of coding.Experience bettors pay for expensive, but profitable betting tools that help them easily find value bets among the hundreds of football matches played on a daily basis. However, you don't need to pay for a betting tool if you know how to code.In fact, I built a profitable betting tool with Python's Selenium and Pandas. In the article below I show the full code and explain how I did it.The following 3 steps are a simplified version of the betting tool I built in Python. They will give you an idea of the concept behind value betting.To find value bets, we first need to calculate the ""real odds."" You can use the FiveThirtyEight website to find the probabilities of a match outcome, but it's better to calculate the real probabilities yourself since they don't offer probabilities for all betting markets. That's why I calculate ""real odds"" on Python by using historical data.On this website, you can find historical data in 27 football leagues over the past 10 years. Instead of downloading them one by one, run the following lines of code to get them in a couple of minutes.The data includes several football stats such as goals scored, conceded, number of corners, shots on target, etc. With this data, you can calculate your own probabilities for any market you want. In this example, we'll only use data from 4 football leagues.In this example, we'll calculate real odds for the market ""over 2.5 goals,"" but you can calculate for any market - just pick the column wisely for your analysis. Since I want to analyze goals, I'll use the columns FTHG (home goals) and FTAG (away goals). Then I just need this simple formula to calculate the real odds.The math behind the formula is simple. It's the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of events. For 'over 2.5 goals', this would be the formula.Real Odds = (Team 1 and Team 2 Matches Over 2.5) / Total MatchesSo if you write in Python,calculate_real_odds('Liverpool', 'Man City', dict_historical_data['English Premier League'], 'Over/Under')You'll get 1.67 as real_odds. This value also depends on the sample you pick for the analysis. In step 1, I downloaded 5 seasons (from season 15/16 to 20/21), but you can add or omit some seasons. It's up to you.You can find the real ""over 2.5 goals"" odds of any match by introducing any pair of teams in the formula. calculate_real_odds.Now that you have the real odds for any match, you have to compare them with bookie's odds. As we mentioned before, you can use webs like Odds Portal to find whether the odds were overrated or underrated.These are the bookie's odds for the 'Over 2.5' odds in the match Liverpool vs. Man City found in OddsPortal.So if we use the formula,Value = (Bookies Odds / Real Odds) - 1we'll obtain that only William Hill doesn't offer a value bet.This is only 1 market in 1 match. There are many of these inefficiencies across many sports events in different bookies. You can even scrape the odds from your favorite bookie or from OddsPortal to find them automatically, instead of doing match by match as we did in step 3.Bookmakers make mistakes, and we can make the most of them. You just need to find value bets that will help you make money in the long run. Today you learned how to find value bets manually with free betting tools and also automatically with some lines of codes in Python.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/0*CTnUFEdE1u1gv426,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-make-money-when-the-bookies-get-it-wrong-and-lose-f494017ca697,data-science,b2d7a66eb1ad937ac5a4f31193a4886b86c643060185186491fe3039
Lively Video Boosts Business to the Top Tier,"On their never-ending quest to draw eyeballs to products, marketers increasingly turn to live streaming. The name of the game is more business and sales.Stephanie Liu, a digital marketing strategist and an author of ""Ultimate Guide to Social Media Marketing,"" is most notably known for her Facebook Live show called Lights, Camera, Live®, where she helps businesses succeed with live video.Liu, along with marketing and branding strategist and millennial expert Chelsea Krost, discussed going big with live-streaming videos during Krost's #MillennialTalk Twitter chat. They compared top tips and tools for conducting a quality looking and sounding live-stream show and ways to start making money.Live streaming is the perfect opportunity for brands to take consumers behind the scenes, which piques their interest in the people who make a company come alive.""Start with the 10x10 framework,"" Liu said. ""Write down the Top 10 frequently asked questions about your business, product or service. Then jot down the Top 10 should-ask questions - what customers should be asking but they don't know because you're the expert.""When you've done the exercise, you'll have 20 ideas that you can turn into a show,"" she said. ""Repurpose every broadcast to extend the lifespan of your content - such as a blog recap, Facebook post, Twitter thread, Instagram Story, one-minute video, audiogram, podcast, Quora, YouTube playlist and GIFs.""She recommended doing live streams of product demonstrations, interviews, promoting live shopping and tutorials.""It's time to get creative,"" Liu said. ""Organize all of those live streams into a single playlist. Viewers can binge watch to learn more about you.""Once viewers realize that you're answering frequently asked questions, they're more likely to ask more questions,"" she said. ""You can learn more about your audience and even turn your answer into a new episode.""Krost reinforced how live streaming incorporates marketing.""It's the most cost-effective, direct-to-consumer way to engage, educate and empower your community,"" she said. ""You'll increase brand and product awareness and sales.""More industries are embracing live streaming. That includes educational and science content. They take the best advantage of captive, inquisitive audiences.""With social distancing putting physical events on hold, brands have increasingly turned to live streaming to connect with and create new opportunities for their audiences,"" Krost said. ""I can't think of an industry that wouldn't benefit from live streaming.""It's all about grabbing and keeping the attention of your target audience or consumer,"" she said. ""A Forrester survey found that live videos hold users' attention 10 to 20 times longer than pre-recorded, on-demand content.""Another factor is if a target audience includes millennials or Generation Z.""Millennials are the largest group of consumers of live content,"" Krost said. ""Sixty-three percent of people ages 18 to 34 are watching live-streaming content regularly.""Thank goodness for live streaming,"" she said. ""I have been able to attend so many weddings, baby announcements, anniversary and birthday celebrations throughout the pandemic.""Traditional businesses are coming along to the video world.""Brick-and-mortar stars have started to embrace live shopping,"" Liu said. ""IAB, which specializes in digital ad marketing, says that 'shoppable media - such as live streams, social commerce, virtual consultations and shoppable ad formats - will be the fastest-growing advertising categories in the near future.'""In fact, live stream-generated sales are expected to double to $120 billion worldwide this year,"" she said. ""Take a look at what's happening with Amazon Live and Facebook Live Shopping. Have you heard of Facebook Portal? The camera will automatically pan and follow you when you're live streaming or in a Zoom meeting.""Service-based entrepreneurs can use live streaming to connect with their audience and target customers.""Live streaming is an opportunity where you can answer the questions that your audience has been wondering about in real time,"" Liu said. ""Use that time to showcase your expertise. Give them an idea on what it's like to work with you.""If you're using Facebook Live, that's a great opportunity to promote your Calendly link to book Discovery Calls,"" she said. ""Use the External Link feature in Facebook Live Producer. After every live stream, we always get highly qualified leads. That's why we use Group Track CRM to follow up and seal the deal.""For those who have an active Facebook Group, live streaming inside the group can keep members engaged.""We usually have our clients promote their biography link when they live stream on Instagram. Easy. Peasy,"" Liu said. ""Even if someone already asked a question, try explaining in different ways. Use the whiteboard, tell a story or use a metaphor. Show prospects that you are a great problem solver.""According to Krost, entrepreneurs are great live-stream formats to explore. They include live interviews, questions and answers, behind-the-scene product development, promotions, tutorials, product launch, service launch, educational event, quick tip, do it yourself or demonstration, giveaway, contest, influencer takeover and podcast promotion and recap.Liu and Krost gave tips and tools to conduct quality looking and sounding live streams.""Invest in an external webcam, digital single-lens reflex camera and mic,"" Liu said. ""Most of our clients got their hands on the Elgato Key Lights because they can mount to your desk and save so much space. We often recommend the Rode PodMic.""More importantly, when you live stream, make sure you're connected to an ethernet cable,"" she said. ""Check your internet upload speed to make sure that you have at least 5mbps upload speed. Speedtest is your friend.""Then there are the final tests.""Create a run of the show so you hit all the important elements of your broadcast - intro, hook, teaser, bullet points,"" Liu said. ""I created the Video Script Maker to simplify this process.""If you can get your hands on the Logitech Brio 4k, that's all you'd need,"" she said. ""If you already have a webcam or DSLR, buy them for your clients. They'll associate you with their new gear every time they use it.""The equipment has the advantage of simplicity.""Connecting the DSLR with CamLink is just like plugging in a webcam,"" Liu said. ""Once it's connected, just choose the DSLR from the camera options. The quality is amazing.""Krost swears by Restream, which she said took her live-stream game up a notch:""When I got live with Restream, I could record videos and media interviews,"" Krost said. ""My simple lighting setup goes a long way: one full-stand ring light and one tabletop ring light, both found on Amazon.""Another tip to make your live broadcasts look a bit more professional is to really take your backdrop into consideration,"" she said. ""I like to catty-corner my camera to give the backdrop more dimension versus being on a flat wall. It helps to give your frame more depth.""The next step is to simultaneously live stream on multiple social media channels.""Restream lets you stream live to more than 30 social platforms at once,"" Liu said. ""We broadcast to Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube.""As a remote live producer, I find the Restream analytics super helpful in telling clients which platform performed the best in terms of engagement and being able to identify their superfans,"" she said.Krost uses Restream for her ""C-Sweet"" podcast.""I stream live on Twitter, Facebook personal page, Facebook business page, Linkedin and YouTube all at once,"" she said. ""Then the live recording saves on my YouTube.""Live streaming is growing fast. Krost cited a Streaming Media survey that showed live video has grown by 93 percent with an average viewing time of 26.4 minutes per session.""The length of your live stream should be based on the format or purpose of your broadcast and who your target audience is,"" she said.Liu said that ""as long as you can deliver value, tell your audience about your show."" She favors the 4MAT Formula:""As a Facebook live streamer, we usually recommend going live for 20 minutes to give audiences enough time to see your content in the news feed,"" Liu said.""As for the top-performing live streams, for our clients we find that having an intro, hook and teaser increases engagement,"" she said. ""That run of the show is super important.""In a well-meshed media plan, live streaming can enhance sales.""If you have a Shopify store, you can power up your e-commerce sales with Livescaletv,"" Liu said. ""You can broadcast from their platform and directly tie it to your store and see sales in real time.""If you have a large audience on Facebook, live shopping is a new feature available in the United States and Thailand,"" she said. ""If you're a live streamer who wants to leverage affiliate marketing, join the Amazon Influencer program and start doing product reviews of your favorite products.""According to Krost, live streams are optimal for product placement.""Storytelling, behind the scenes, tutorials and how-to's are great ways to engage, inform and excite your audience,"" she said. ""The end of the live stream is the perfect place to insert the offer.""These are examples:Although the format is inviting, people slip into miscues when they're live.""Don't use live streaming as a straight-up infomercial or billboard,"" Krost said. ""This should be an opportunity to story tell, make conversations, inspire, showcase your expertise or product, and share how you, your product or your service is the solution.""As good as they might be, productions don't advertise themselves.""A big mistake is not promoting your live stream ahead of time,"" Liu said. ""If people don't know, they won't go. I did a presentation on how to launch your live stream and get people buzzing about it before you even launch.""Don't rely on channel notifications because the next big product feature can take over the notification alerts,"" she said. ""Encourage your viewers to sign up for your email newsletter if you have one.""Liu encourages her audience to subscribe to her company's calendar events.""We know that if it's on their calendar, then they've already blocked out time in their schedule,"" she said.Live streams can go on to live many, happy lives.""A live stream is going to be a long-form piece of content,"" Krost said. ""Chop up your 20-minute live stream into bite-sized 30- to 60-second clips. These clips could be a quick tip or product feature. Then share them on social media to promote the longer video. It's more content.""Liu's company transcribes every live stream using Descript.""Once the transcription is done, we turn that into a blog post and then create five one-minute videos that can be shared across social media,"" she said.

How to Turn Your Passion Into a Profitable Six-Figure Business,"Passion is not a career but an emotion. The dictionary definition says it's a ""strong and barely controllable emotion"". So, the passion career that you were born to do is a myth. You can be passionate about your food, your lover or your car. And it will change with time because feelings are fluid.In a Stanford Research project, a research team found that the idea of passion is harmful to human growth because it's a fixed mindset that wrongly assumes our interests to be fixed.When I started, I had no passion for life-coaching. If anything, I had a passion for depression, anxiety and overeating. I started by making a daily video of my thoughts on personal development. Seven years later, those videos have turned into a six-figure coaching business.You should pursue what you are currently doing. You don't have to be dead sure that it's your life purpose. It's much better to start with a hobby or skill you think you like. You'll learn more by doing it than you ever would by trying to find the perfect job.But can you get paid to practice your craft?Yes, here's how.People pay you for the problem your skill solves for them. That solution is what's called value. Nobody will pay you for writing, interior designing or singing. They will pay you for the end-result that your skill provides - website traffic, a beautiful house or entertainment.When a wealthy mansion owner buys a $100,000 art-piece, he solves the problem of a boring wall. But not every artist gets paid that much. That's because not everyone solves a specific problem in the same way. People who are more skilled solves it better and hence get paid more.Still, don't wait to be skilled to start a business. Even your undeveloped skills can solve a big problem in a small way. And you'll get more skilled by starting where you are than if you were to wait and become 'good'. As Mark Zuckerberg preaches to new entrepreneurs;I didn't wait to be the best life-coach to start working with clients. In 2014, I got my first client for $160/mo. But now, I can charge 25x more and even get partnerships in some of my client's businesses.How? Because I got to practice the skill (coaching) I wanted to get good at. If you want to get paid high-amounts in the market, practice in a way that creates value and gets you paid.""What's the end product your practice can create?""If you are a painter, it can be an entertaining time-lapse of you painting. If you are a 'xyz' coach, make a video or blog/write content that teaches 'xyz' (like what I am doing).Action-Step: With your practice, produce a tangible product every day that can be recorded as an image, video or blog.Do you watch people talk about your hobby online? It can be a YouTuber or someone on Medium. When you watch them, you are behind the screen as a consumer. If you want to make money, you need to get on the screen and become a producer.You can do that by uploading your daily practice on a social media platform.YouTube, Instagram or Medium, pick any platform based on the content style you are comfortable with. Don't overthink this, and go with your gut. You can always expand into different platforms later.When you post, don't stress about being good at all. Instead, allow yourself to suck at what you upload (videos, blogs). Not many people will find you, and that's okay. As the founder of Airbnb quotes;I have 'only' 86k subscribers on YouTube but have still have gotten 650+ clients and made more than half a million dollars. You don't need to go viral to make money. Upload daily and build trust with the algorithm.Soon, it will start sending people your way.There are many cognitive biases that can act against you. Even if people like what you put out, there are many hurdles to making a sale. ""Mr. X may not be ready to take the next step in their life."" Or ""Mr. X may have had a fight with their spouse and dislike your offer.""The key to jumping over these cognitive hurdles is giving away free value and aiming for a long-term relationship.If you have a crush on someone, you wouldn't get down on your knees and propose. You would first take them out on a date and see how it goes.This same principle applies to converting your audience into customers.Don't propose them with your price or discounts. Instead, give away a part of your service or product for free. It can be a digital art piece they can print or a free trial of your new course. I give away free consultation to my clients, giving them a taste of my coaching service. Here's an example of a consultation call that inspired me to write this article.A percentage of people will take your free offer and not follow through with a purchase. Not all dates can go well. Not all people I talk to choose to buy from me. But you would never make money if you consider that as a loss. It's a cost of doing business.Make people comfortable, and they will buy what you sell. After seven years, I still give away free consultations. I don't have to - I can charge $250 for the first 30-min session and $500 for the 1-hour strategy session - but I don't because I'm not comfortable forcing people to pay me without knowing my work.Here's a summary of everything you need to know.All the advice above won't work if you don't have patience. To get good, build an audience and convert customers, you need time. It took me a good one year of making videos to get regular coaching clients.Don't be scared with the idea of working for a year with no results. That year is going to pass anyway.

"Solar Paint, A Scientific Breakthrough","House paint has the capability to be more than just coatings on bricks - in the future, it could also be used as a collecting agent to absorb the energy from the sun and transform it into electricity. This may not be vastly far off, as it's already an active field of research due to solar paints' commercial viability, ease of scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Solar paint could become widely available by as soon as 2022!Solar paint essentially attracts molecules of water and cleaves them to create hydrogen to generate electricity. It works like a conventional photovoltaic cell, taking energy from the sun and creating electricity, but is made up of thin-film solar panels in a liquid form. The paint comprises tiny luminescent molecules suspended within a flexible and sprayable liquid, which absorbs light and moisture.The way the paint can do this is because of the titanium dioxide inside, a crystalline pigment that has an exceptional ability to absorb sunlight and is one of the most promising materials within photovoltaics. It is used in most paints already and is sometimes called ""the perfect white"".This titanium dioxide is paired with synthetic molybdenum disulfide, a latter compound with extraordinary electronic and photoelectronic properties that allows for sustainable solar-to-hydrogen conversion under visible light irradiation. The molybdenum disulfide takes the energy from the titanium oxide, pulls molecules of water from the air from dew, rainfall, the atmosphere, etc, and splits them into hydrogen and oxygen particles. The oxygen and hydrogen is released into the air, and this hydrogen is used to produce clean energy for powering cells.Quantum dot solar cells have been a breakthrough within solar energy because of their significant ability to boost the efficiency of rate absorption to electricity produced. However, these generally take a few days to prepare. Now with a one coat quantum dot solar paint, this can be achieved in under an hour. Although the current efficiency of quantum dot paint is no where up to par with its counterpart in solar cell form (around 8%), this is still a very exciting finding and could end up being 11% more efficient than traditional panels. This would be a simple, cheap, and effective way of producing solar paint!Quantum dot solar paint is a yellow or brown paste that utilizes semiconductor nanocrystals that emit light when struck with a UV beam. Because of their nano size, when a thin layer of dots is taken, the majority of incident visible sunlight can be captured. Their ability to emit colours is taken advantage of by being used as a replacement for conventional dyes to achieve ideal optical and electronic properties. You can actually alter the light absorption spectrum of the quantum dots by changing their size!Colloidal quantum dots have been proven so far to be the most effective form of quantum dots for solar paint, which glow in vibrant and distinct colours and are dispersible in solvents. These quantum dots can therefore be mixed with cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, or titanium dioxide particles, and a paint is produced.The main barrier with solar paint as of right now is its efficiency, which is generally between 3% and 11%. That means if a 7% efficient solar paint was taken, only 7% of the available energy could be used. This will have to be overcome and at a minimum surpass 10% efficiency if solar paint is going to become commercially viable.Furthermore, right now, solar paint doesn't have too long of a shelf life, which is what scientists are trying to achieve with different compositions. Stability is currently at its best when the paint is stored in the dark. There's also the issue of titanium dioxide sources decreasing over time, especially if solar paint goes widespread. Alternatives and other formulations will need to be found to maintain this as a long-term product.Lastly, utilizing hydrogen regarding capture and storage is also somewhat of a difficult situation. Unless meticulously engineered, this can be a challenge. The hydrogen needs to be compressed and stored properly and cannot mix with the oxygen, otherwise there could be a harmful explosion.Solar paint could have some pretty wild implications because it is so much easier and cheaper to install than regular solar panels. The process of installation can be done in minimal amounts of time, and a lot of it can even be done by a homeowner with a spray gun (no previous construction knowledge needed!). Additionally, due to its lightness, it can pretty much be applied to any surface of varying shapes and sizes, like plastics, fabrics, fences, sheds, mailboxes, and the list goes on and on! Transparent solar films can even be explored for more efficient automobiles, as they can be placed on windows of vehicles and used to help charge the car's battery.Solar paint would be suitable in a range of climates, as any place with water vapor in the air can produce fuel, even if scarce- which is especially ideal for areas that don't get enough sunlight to justify the need for solar panels. It could be very useful in developing countries, and could technically mean solar farms could be built in deserts!Of course, there's also the exceptional environmental impacts this would have, as solar paint would permit a self sustained home running on natural resources instead of fossil fuels. Furthermore, self sustained homes are less likely to face power outages because you're using your own power source!Lastly, solar paint is a more aesthetic decision than solar panels. Because solar panels are bulkier and clearly stand out, some people don't want them on their houses. Solar paint offers a simple, attractive, and non-obtrusive technology.Solar paint is still fairly new, but the solar industry is progressive and soon enough solar paint could be transforming the ways in which we receive our energy! Let's do a quick overview of what we've learned in this article.Check out these additional resources if you're interested!",https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*0_0Ye48zx71N_D6xSO9Paw.jpeg,https://moloonaila.medium.com/solar-paint-a-scientific-breakthrough-c50b95f7a4a,science,b5be7e574ef8288c5a9f46a3e7d89587c522c6092b41b52b4a6379ed
What Is Affiliate Marketing?,"Affiliate marketing can be defined as a performance-based marketing technique. It is a simple yet effective link between the advertiser and the product. Affiliate marketing facilitates the purchase of a product right from the source while providing a small commission for the advertiser.Affiliate marketing is one of the world's most popular methods of making money online. In 2019, the affiliate marketing network was worth $6.4 billion and it is projected to increase to $ 14 billion by 2022.It seems that affiliate marketing is slowly taking over. It is a simple technique that can be used with any demographic. Since affiliate marketing is fairly novel, here are five things you should know.These are the groups of people that are involved in affiliate marketing.There are different structures when it comes to payout.All of the payment methods are commission-based and they're usually provided to the marketer on a monthly basis.The amount of money the marketer makes depends on both their payout method as well as their audience size. A lot of established YouTubers who use a lot of affiliate links can earn upwards of $100,000 per month.The Amazon affiliate program is free to join. You can apply to be accepted and once you are in, you can sell any Amazon product. Marketers can also obtain commissions on not only the specific product that was advertised but any other purchases that are made at Amazon for 24 hours after their initial referral.One of the problems with the Amazon affiliate program is that they change their terms frequently which can result in a lower commission for its partners.Awin is a huge affiliate marketing platform that has nearly 150,000 advertisers. In 2019, they generated $147 million in sales.In Awin, brands are very picky with the marketers they will work with. Even if you get accepted into the Awin program, it doesn't automatically guarantee brands. This can be a good thing since it creates a better connection as well as better advertisement for the consumer.Though applying to individual brands can be time-consuming on Awin, it might be worth the wait since not everyone can be accepted by the same brands.In short, anything and everything can be sold through affiliate marketing (as long as it's legal of course). I have seen YouTubers link their camera equipment as well as their outfits.From a marketing perspective, it is better if the marketer finds a niche and sticks to it. Personally, I am more likely to buy a digital camera recommended by a photographer than from a fashion blogger.If the products are accepted through the affiliate partner program, marketers can sell just about anything through the network, and they can work out with the company how they will make money as well as how much.Although affiliate marketing can sound ideal for anyone with an audience, there are some cons that stand out.Competition varies depending on the industry. Since marketers don't have rights to the product, they face competition against anyone else who is accepted into a program and wants to create affiliate marketing as well.When you have momentum, money can accumulate on a pay-per-performance basis. If your audience is small or not receptive to the product it is likely that you won't make much money. It's a challenge you have to face and put all your efforts into maximizing the opportunity, but all in all, it's difficult to predict how much money you will make on it in the end.Some affiliate marketers produce content that can be misleading. Creating ads that have no credibility can cause you to lose your credibility. Besides losing credibility, you are more likely to be rejected by sellers and networks. It's better to focus on providing quality ads that are receptible to your audience in order to not lose your credibility.Over the last two decades, our society has collectively made many digital advances. From these changes, a lot of new jobs have been created and, in a way, affiliate marketing can be seen as a freelancing job.Ultimately to be successful, it is essential to see which affiliate programs are right for you. As well, it is suggested that as a marketer, you should find your niche in order to make sure that the consumers are receptive to your ads.Affiliate marketing is one of the easiest and most comfortable forms of marketing since most of the work is done by clicking a link. Though it's easy, it still requires talented individuals to build an audience that will become their consumers.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2302/1*k5yVl6K1Ac5ZJTydx-z7sg.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/what-is-affiliate-marketing-e0467a951b,social-media,b5c602749e8e2a548b2bf21cb8b78af9f4d07729c9d6f5007ce1f19c
"Twitter Banned Project Veritas. Then, Influencers Manipulated Our Perception to Make Us Feel Censored.","Twitter suspended the accounts of Project Veritas and its founder James O'Keefe on Feb 11, 2021. Immediately following that, one can find a prime example of how social media personalities influence how we experience reality. Mr. Posobiec is modeling motivated reasoning, a bias that often leads us to misjudge situations.Here's how it works. We assume our pre-existing beliefs are right instead of reassessing them when we get new evidence. We seek out the facts (that O'Keefe published a video that claimed to expose Zuckerberg) that affirm what we already believe.Stop and think. Ask yourself if there could be an alternate explanation and whether you've collected all evidence.What is Posobiec leaving out?Although ""veritas"" is Latin for ""truth,"" Project Veritas has a long history of misleading people by doctoring footage, criminally in some cases.Congress banned funding to a prior organization that the Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe ran, ACORN. After deceiving the public, O'Keefe was fined $100,000.Project Veritas has a history of releasing material in what we would call coordinated disinformation. It's clearly released with the intention of influencing the public and it works well. That is why he is not only guilty of crimes for which he was fined but why he also continues to be dangerous.Here is the archived image from a week ago when an article with the video first appeared via the Kremlin-controlled outlet Sputnik.Shortly after, the Post Millennial and Sputnik ran the Zuckerberg story, other popular conservative outlets began publishing it as well. Notice that the first outlet to publish an article featuring the video in North America was the Post Millenial and that is the same outlet Posobiec is sharing with his comment.This is the same Posobiec who told the public that he was preparing for the Stop the Steal campaign - months before the election even took place.Another outlet the Gateway Pundit, also recently banned for lying, had premonitions about election fraud, too. (If you want someone to believe something false, you have to prime them ahead of it by repeating it and triggering the illusory effect).In 2020, the Post Millennial joined a number of hyper-partisan outlets fooled by propaganda originating from the Middle East. The fake article was written by someone who does not exist and intended to manipulate the West. It's a testimony to the journalistic standards at the Post Millennial.The outlet has shown itself to be unreliable repeatedly, but it also shows how one might easily get such an outlet to publish whatever narrative I wished people to believe.Facebook has a well-documented lean toward the political right. It has to do with money. Right-leaning groups and media outlets generate more engagement and the algorithms FB uses prioritizes that.Don't believe me? Let's look at the top-performing posts from the past few days.You get the idea, but if not feel free to check the Twitter feed. The account posts the results of a daily analysis that uses CrowdTangle.FB makes over a billion dollars a year on anti-vaccine groups and has been caught in breach of its own policies for fiscal gain. Actual audio, in context, leaked where employees confronted Zuckerberg about his negative effect on democracy. Analysts have shown, repeatedly, that the top-performing posts on Facebook are dominated by conservatives.Even after Jan 6th, when people were notably removed from the platform, the top-performing articles leaned right for an average of 8 out of 10 posts. That suggests that much like Twitter, the total accounts removed was less than 1%. Note that those rankings came after Jan 6th.The experience of feeling censored may be very real, but the data fails to support that claim. Instead, I suspect another phenomenon altogether is responsible for that shared experience. Everyone knows the scenario of the jealous person who suspects their partner of cheating. Then, no matter what they do, the partner's actions become evidence of what the person already believes.Driven by fear or worry, our ability to process information and think critically declines. When we are worried and leaders repeatedly warn you of that which you fear, you become the jealous partner, except about censorship.Let's set aside fear here, shall we?The reason O'Keefe got banned is that he professionally manipulates videos and has shown no concern for the potential damage incurred by those acts. It isn't because he exposed anything. That should be good news if you're worried.If you feel afraid right now, you're not alone and you're not crazy. If I did not work on the projects that I do, I too I would likely have been drawn into many of these claims of censorship. The stage set for them is expertly assembled and convincingly claimed. When our perception falls so far outside of the concrete reality, we must ask if that error happened on its own. In many cases, it was no accident.Citations:1) https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Project_Veritas2) https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/25/wisconsin-doj-james-okeefes-project-veritas-tape-did-not-show-election-law-violations/100885192/3) https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-113hr83eah/pdf/BILLS-113hr83eah.pdf4) https://www.prwatch.org/news/2013/03/12019/james-o%E2%80%99keefe-pays-100k-settlement-after-deceiving-public-about-acorn-alec%E2%80%99s-help5) https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/politics/project-veritas-ilhan-omar.html6) https://www.newswhip.com/2020/09/top-publishers-facebook-august-2020/7) https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm8) https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/despite-bias-claims-facebook-not-censoring-conservatives9) https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/new-study-finds-facebook-not-censoring-conservatives-despite-their-repeated-attacks10) https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/facebook-twitter-don-t-censor-conservatives-they-hire-promote-them-ncna124530811) https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/10/27/ted-cruz-is-shamelessly-likening-his-role-in-wednesdays-senate-testimony-on-social-media-to-a-boxing-match/?sh=24c6a93147af12) https://www.justsecurity.org/74622/stopthesteal-timeline-of-social-media-and-extremist-activities-leading-to-1-6-insurrection/13)https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/White_Supremacist_Infiltration_of_Law_Enforcement.pdf",https://miro.medium.com/max/2320/1*YqPVJiUPR-wjNatJA0b2Lg.jpeg,https://e-rosalie.medium.com/heres-why-project-veritas-got-banned-from-twitter-4aef54d60edc,social-media,b5e07075df61f4b76c2e81f5669a0d9cc8a1e5b8f49158b0245454fe
Will AI Be The Answer To The World's Recycling Crisis?,"Although recycling nowadays is an absolute buzz-word, only 9% of all plastic is actually recycled. The rest of it usually fills up the oceans forming trash islands. According to statistics, in 30 years, the amount of plastic (only) in landfills will be 35,000 times heavier than the Empire State Building.The recycling crisis is undeniable.Two years ago, in 2018, China restricted its import of recyclable waste products from the USA. This event, together with the recent technological developments in AI and robotics, has brought a significant interest of some western companies towards using AI as a waste sorting and recycling tool.Yes.Sorting rubbish is one of the most monotonous, repetitive, low-paid and even dangerous jobs, that automation can cover. In my previous article, I am writing about the reasons why humans should not be afraid of automation. And recycling and waste sorting are one of the illustrative examples of that.AI-enabled robots are usually a cost-efficient and a few times more productive than humans. What is more, robots would not threaten their life and health by encountering with a hypodermic needle or other unsanitary, sharp and potentially dangerous stuff. What is more, the growing demand for AI systems in recycling centres will produce a set of new roles and further expand the job market.I would not cover the financial side of the recycling market, but this is an important note that supports the idea that AI will lead the recycling revolution. It is estimated that already by 2024, waste sorting and recycling AI robots market will be worth $12 billion.With computer vision, AI-robots can identify logos, colours, shapes and textures and proceed with sorting based on this data. For instance, AI can recognize an Oreo logo, blue-coloured package and a picture of a cookie. Based on this info it can 'assume' it's a package from the plastic cookie pack.Similar to any AI-enabled robot, firstly AI-specialists need to 'teach' the system with the required knowledge. Based on that, AI processes millions of images of waste categories and subcategories, packages, logos, shapes, colours, textures, etc. In the sorting process, the system continually teaches itself to recognize the most obvious attributes of different waste types. Whether the waste is smashed, broken or, for instance, dirty, AI teaches itself to identify these attributes no matter the condition it's in.There are many different designs of AI-powered robots that can be enabled by various systems to identify the waste types. Some of these robots are designed to scan an object with computer vision or physically grab the particular object. In this case, its' sensors would identify the object's characteristics, height, weight, material, etc. Apart from computer vision, waste sorting AI and robots can be enabled with spectroscopy, laser sensors, metal detectors or simply, magnets to capture metal objects from mixed waste.Recycling and trash sorting robots are already starting to raise interest and gain traction. Even before Covid-19 struck.For instance, Sweden is famous for many things. Apart from its gorgeous national parks, breathtaking landscapes and minimalistic Swedish design, Sweden is now famous for being one of the most sustainable countries with the recycling rate of 99%. Swedish recycling revolution is a product of reshaping the mind of the nation to more environmentally-aware, the massive work of government and technology. AI-enabled waste scrapping robots are already supporting Sweden in the recycling revolution and helping the country become almost fully sustainable.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2248/0*R9Wk2P_cJPsgoEP7,https://medium.com/the-innovation/will-ai-be-the-answer-to-the-worlds-recycling-crisis-391d1d8d1e76,artificial-intelligence,b6b800bc0f500f8876a2cd3f90cee6780df1d5846516a66a3b5d6c75
The Ferris Wheel of V-Day,"The lavender colored napkin box looks at me closely from three feet away. The words 'Feel Better' are printed on it in a motherly italicized font.The manufacturers must have made it for the primary use of blotting tears. Not for me. At least, not anymore.I do feel better, I think. I gather up my hair in a tie and pull up my sleeves. There's work to be done.Clean up the room, then clean up my life. The scattered roses and broken shards of glass need to be picked up. Careful, I say to myself. There's water everywhere from the broken vase. And torn petals. Don't want to slip and cut myself.Drama seems to have become a staple every Valentine's Day. Like a broken Ferris wheel that you can't get off.Last year we had the whole drunken driving episode. Returning home from a V-day party with friends, he insisted on driving despite being sloshed. I can't drive a stick shift, but we could've taken a cab, right?I was shit scared, sitting in the passenger seat, soundlessly saying my prayers and my goodbyes at the same time. Prepared for the worst. Words dying prematurely on my lips, because saying anything would only make things worse.The next morning there were the usual apologies and promises to do better. Promises as empty as a cave from which even the bats have flown.This year I knew better. I knew what to expect. Covid-19 put pause on my plans all last year, but now I'm ready. Timing is everything, they say.So, this year, I decorated the house. Flowers, cupcakes, candles. He went one up on me. He arrived drunk, proceeded with the now-no-longer-shocking verbal abuse, and then shattered the vase. One cupcake still sticks to the wall, grimacing stupidly at me.And here I am, cleaning up again. Putting the napkins to good use.Except this time is different. My bank accounts are sorted out. I've been putting away my own money in a separate account, and when possible drawing out small sums of money from the joint account as well. Money is the path to dignity and freedom, my mom always used to say.Next year, V-day will be different. Next year will be lovely. I'll be surrounded with everything I love. Roses, candles, music. And love.I'm learning to love myself, put myself first.This Ferris wheel ride is over, it's time to get off.

What the Proposed Changes to China's Anti-Monopoly Law Mean for Businesses in China | The China Guys,"After only a dozen years since promulgating its initial Anti-Monopoly Law, currently proposed revisions promise to strengthen anti-monopoly enforcement in China and reshape the regulatory landscape in the world's second largest economy. Actions by regulators over recent years have shown a commitment to more vigorous monopoly busting, and supplementary draft regulations indicate that China intends for its enforcement to be as robust as that found in the West.Want to stay in the know on everything China? Subscribe to our newsletter for insights delivered straight to your inbox..........While market economies excel at fostering competition and encouraging innovation, if left unchecked, problems inevitably arise. Even in the U.S., where deregulation has become something of a religion among conservatives since the Halcyon days of the Reagan Administration, a responsive bureaucracy policing private and public companies has remained firmly in place. This has certainly been the case with antitrust law (generally referred to as anti-monopoly law or competition law outside of the U.S.).While some commentators bemoan the lack of vigor in antitrust enforcement in the face of the novel environment that U.S. behemoths such as Amazon, Google and Facebook have created, antitrust regulation is still no slapdash affair. 2020, far from a record-breaking year, still saw criminal antitrust fines levied by the DOJ top US$500 million. While China's relatively new Anti-Monopoly Law does not have the storied history one finds in U.S. antitrust enforcement, penalties levied against companies have grown in recent years. Now, with draft revisions to the Anti-Monopoly Law and the release of multiple draft regulations expressly addressing anti-monopoly issues, everything indicates that enforcement will become considerably more vigorous.Left to their own devices, businesses in competitive environments have an incentive to increasingly rely on monopolistic practices as they grow in power and influence, be that by one company securing a dominant position in a particular market, or by a small number of leading companies agreeing to prevent new challengers from entering their arena. The U.S. was perhaps the first nation to see this happen on a grand scale with large corporations and railway conglomerates in the late 1800s, and the Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in 1890 to put the breaks on burgeoning monopolies. Since then, antitrust investigations have been an important part of the U.S. regulatory environment, and landmark Antitrust cases have come down every few decades, with the breakup of AT&T in 1982 and Microsoft Corp. in 2001 being the most prominent examples in the last half century. Now, some say the time has come for another round of landmark antitrust cases.With the importance of antitrust or anti-monopoly laws for the regulation of large modern economies, it is thus perhaps a little surprising that China waited decades before promulgating its own devoted anti-monopoly statutes in 2008. While there is little of modern Chinese jurisprudence that predates the reform and opening period, most of China's current civil code can still trace its origin to the '80s, in the early years of reform and opening. Yet for many decades, what anti-monopoly law China did have was spread sparsely over a number of disparate legal and regulatory codes.Of course, the historical context for the initial promulgation of China's anti-monopoly laws was considerably different from the unfettered capitalism of 1890s America. Indeed, state-owned enterprises - often equivalent to state run monopolies - were a defining feature of Mao-era China, and are a major component of China's economy even to this day. Of course, with one of the main purposes of SOEs being to provide employment to citizens, the incentives in play were totally different from Western corporations. It is perhaps not so surprising that monopolistic behavior among private and public companies was not of immediate concern during the reform and opening period. The Chinese economy had to first digest much of its inefficient and bloated SOEs before such concerns really rose to surface.However, as non-SOEs rose in prominence in the Chinese economy after the turn of the century, the need to establish devoted anti-monopoly statutes became more apparent. Promulgated in 2007, and taking effect in 2008, China's Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) aimed to add this important component to the regulatory framework. There was an ulterior motive here as well: while the China of the aughts saw some of the most explosive growth of the Chinese economy, the largest domestic Chinese companies were still predominantly SOEs. It was foreign entities that accounted for the largest non-SOE entities operating in China at the time, and there is at least circumstantial evidence that foreign entities operating in China may have been the initial targets of China's fledgling anti-monopoly investigations. The year after the AML was enacted for example, it was used to deny Coca Cola's purchase of Huiyuan, China's largest domestically owned juice company.The past decade has seen the rise of a number of influential private or publicly held Chinese companies - among them Huawei, Pingan, JD.com and, of course, Alibaba. Furthermore, while still heavily 'bloated' and overleveraged, years of reforms have marginally improved SOE efficiency. With an increased emphasis on competition by China's SOEs, anti-monopoly regulation has proved valuable here as well (though the law is a little contradictory, with Article 7 of the AML giving more leeway for some monopolistic tendencies by SOEs, but the entirety of Chapter 5 'Abuse of Administrative Power to Exclude, Limit Competition' aimed at regulating SOEs and government agencies for example). Considering this rapid maturing of the Chinese economy, it is perhaps not unexpected that revisions to the AML were put on the agenda, with draft revisions released for public comment in January 2020.Overall, the 2020 Draft Revisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law (""Draft AML"") seem to indicate a shift towards a more aggressive regulatory regime concerning anti-monopoly issues. Through several new provisions, the Draft AML both expands the scope of the law and adds teeth to enforcement actions and penalties. Specific additions include ""organizing and facilitating other undertakings to conclude monopoly agreements"" (Article 17), which suggests that more complex schemes involving orchestrating companies or price fixing rings will now be easier to deal with. Under the Chapter 3 of the law, new language expands the scope of where abuse of dominance applies, including language specifically aimed at up and coming technology companies. Article 21 sports new language that reads ""...Recognizing operators in the internet field that have market dominant positions should also consider the factors of network effects, economies of scale, lock-in effects, capabilities to ascertain and process relevant data and other factors.""The revisions also expand the scope of where merger transactions would require filings with the regulating agency, and further empowers regulators to investigate failures to file such notifications. Statutory penalties have also been markedly increased, providing more leeway in calculating penalties across the board. This keeps with the trend of increasingly large penalties seen in anti-monopoly cases in the last few years. The revisions also pave the way for criminal liabilities in anti-monopoly cases, adding in an important component hereto lacking (while there have been a few cases of criminal penalties in anti-monopoly cases, these have been in situations where employees of a company committed adjacent criminal acts during the case, such as beating up anti-monopoly investigators when the investigators showed up for a surprise audit of their company).The agency charged with enforcement of the AML is the State Administration for Market Regulation (""SAMR""). The SAMR only came into existence in 2018 as the result of a massive reshuffling of government departments that abolished once vitally important agencies such as the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (""SAIC""), while also bringing multiple other agencies directly under its control, including the State Intellectual Property Office. This reorganization resulted in multiple government agencies previously responsible for anti-monopoly enforcement (the Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Unfair Competition Bureau, the Price Supervision and Anti-Monopoly Bureau, the Anti-Monopoly Bureau, and the Anti-Monopoly Commission) to be merged under the SAMR's Anti-Monopoly Bureau. This will likely be advantageous in terms of efficiency, with regulators being able to more easily coordinate and avoid wasting resources. The establishment of the SAMR represents a massive consolidation of regulatory power, and during its short two year history, it has not shied away from pushing the envelope in terms of anti-monopoly enforcement. Early last year saw the imposition of CN￥325.5 million in fines (US$50.2 million), the maximum allowable under the current law, in an anti-monopoly investigation into three pharmaceutical companies.On November 10, 2020, the SAMR published its ""Draft Anti-Monopoly Guidelines on the Platform Economy"" (""Draft Guidelines""), inviting interested parties to submit comments on the guidelines before November 30, 2020. The Draft Guidelines doubled down on a few short passages that appeared in the Draft AML to create a robust framework through which the SAMR's Anti-monopoly Bureau can pursue antitrust enforcement against internet companies. The guidelines cover monopoly agreements, abuse of market dominance concerns, and concentration of operators.Only days after the end of its period for comments on its Draft Guidelines, the SAMR came out with guns blazing, with a few of those aimed at Jack Ma. On December 14, 2020, pursuant to Article 48 of the AML, the Anti-monopoly Bureau levied a fine of CN￥500,000 (US$77,145) against Alibaba for violating filing requirements concerning its acquisition of Intime Retail Group, a department store operator. Alibaba had acquired 73.79% of stock rights in Intime by the middle of 2017, but failed to file required documents with the SAMR. In an administrative holding, the SAMR found that Alibaba had violated Article 21 of the current AML, which states, ""Any concentration...must be notified in advance with the anti-monopoly authorities..."" However, the holding also let Alibaba off the hook for more strenuous regulatory enforcement, such as suspension of the concentration of businesses pursuant to Article 48 of the current AML by finding the acquisition did not have any effects on excluding or limiting competition. Note that if calculated according to the new Draft AML (with the relevant language now found under Article 55, formally Article 48), this fine could have been considerably higher, up to 10% of the prior year's sales volume of the operators. Alibaba had annual revenue of CN￥376.8 billion in 2019 (US$58.1 billion), so the maximum hypothetical fine could have been as high as CN￥37.68 billion (US$5.8 billion) for simply failing to file required paperwork under the Draft AML.Perhaps more concerning, a short ten days later the SAMR's Anti-monopoly Bureau put out a short announcement indicating it was investigating Alibaba's ""pick one from two"" practice for suspicion of monopolistic behavior. The ""pick one from two"" practice is certainly not unique to Alibaba, though Alibaba may be the top offender. The practice concerns forcing smaller merchants to choose to list products on only one e-commerce platform, and face being delisted from Alibaba if found on another major competitor's platform. This raises both abuse of dominant market position concerns as well as concerns of anti-monopoly agreements if it is discovered that Alibaba was coordinating with other major online platforms to force small and medium sized merchants to sign such agreements.Ant Financial, Jack Ma's other company and focus of considerable media interest these past few months, has so far managed to dodge anti-monopoly investigations - its trouble has been in other regulatory areas. However, this may soon change, as yet another set of draft regulations was put out on January 20 by the People's Bank of China - the Regulations for Non-bank Payment Institutions (Draft for Comments). It was regulations concerning the administration of online small loan services put out jointly by the People's Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission back in November, 2020, that threw a wrench in the highly anticipated Ant Financial IPO last year. This latest bout of draft regulations includes several provisions directed at reigning in anti-monopolistic behavior of non-bank payment organizations such as Alipay and WeChat Pay. Articles 55-57 and 64 lay out a path for the People's Bank of China to work with the SAMR where it finds situations of market dominance to either provide a warning to such entities or initiate anti-monopoly investigations.After setting up its initial anti-monopoly regime a little more than a decade ago, China is already well on its way to making anti-monopoly enforcement a key feature of its market regulation. It has shown this with steadily increasing fines as the years have gone by. Heavy fines have been levied against many other companies in more traditional sectors. Now, Chinese regulators are aiming to bring China's tech giants to heel with new laws and regulations, with the CN￥500,000 (US$77,145) fines levied against Alibaba and other major internet companies under the current law perhaps serving as a shot across the bow, a warning of the stricter anti-monopoly regulation sure to come once all the draft laws and draft regulations formally take effect as enforceable law.Originally published at https://thechinaguys.com on January 28, 2021.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2596/0*wQFYrt3McgFUFBKO.jpg,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/what-the-proposed-changes-to-chinas-anti-monopoly-law-mean-for-businesses-in-china-f8b131b23c6f,economy,b35bcb597105ec8087d588d4c644fac8b6e8912b8ab9017a8185fb0f
Reading Suspense Thrillers Calmed My Anxiety During the Pandemic,"Disclaimer: I am not a mental health expert. If you are in crisis, please contact SAMHSA's hotline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357), where trained mental health professionals can help you. SAMHSA's National Helpline is a free, confidential, 24/7, 365-day-a-year treatment referral and information service (in English and Spanish) for individuals and families facing mental and/or substance use disorders.I have lived with PTSD, depression, and anxiety for two decades now, and in that time, I have learned a lot about what self-care means for me. Hint: it has nothing to do with hot baths or facials. Before the pandemic and subsequent stream of lockdowns, my go-to DIY mental health treatment revolved around a predictable and reliable routine that meant spending at least some time in public and with friends to help balance me out.Since March 13th, 2020, I've been trapped in a new reality that has meant giving up the safety and comfort of the routine I had come to depend on. Gone was my ability to leave my house, which rushed in a new era of heightened anxiety. And since I am one of the millions of Americans who cannot afford therapy, I often find myself turning to Google for ideas about how to calm my heart palpitations, irrational fears, and racing mind. And what I landed on was - for me and my particular mental health struggles - a game-changer.In a fascinating 2018 study, researchers figured out that exposing people to simulated threats through horror movies can calm anxiety. In other words, watching scary movies can actually make you feel better. But I'm too much of a wimp to stream anything spookier than Scooby-Doo on Netflix.Researchers know that patients can find relief from symptoms of several mental health issues through exposure therapy, including PTSD, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and phobias. The treatments target the amygdala, which is the area of the brain that houses fear and fear responses. By exposing a patient to simulated and controlled experiences with the thing they fear, they can learn to reduce their anxiety.Curiously, it turns out that people with anxiety can benefit from consuming horror or suspense thrillers in entertainment. In the 2018 study, researchers noted how this works.When I was a kid back in the 1980s, I got a little cocky and told my mom that I wasn't afraid of anything. My friends and I wanted to see a new movie called The Poltergeist (just writing that gave me chills) so I lied to my mom and said that all my friends had already seen it. She figured I wouldn't make it through the first scene, but she agreed to allow me to watch it anyway. What ultimately happened was that I was scared shitless and gave myself mental and emotional scars. Don't judge my mom, though; she truly didn't think I'd sit through the film.When the pandemic hit, and I was looking for ways to calm my brain down, I read about that 2018 study. But I knew that I could not handle watching any scary movies so, I turned to books.At first, I was nervous. Would a book get into my head and screw me up the way that horror movie did when I was a kid? I had read rave reviews about Ruth Ware, so I started with her book The Woman in Cabin Ten. It was not a horror, but it was a thriller, and it did leave me white-knuckling my way through the pages. By the time I got to the end, I had found myself feeling overwhelmed with relief by what happened to the characters.And I realized that Ware's book was a masterful example of what I think these researchers were seeing. Ware created a world with simulated threats that activated my fears - sometimes in a real way - but the story had a positive ending. And also, nothing terrible happened to me as I read the story.The rush was addicting. So, I got more books.I read Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia and couldn't sleep because I couldn't put that book down. My imagination was on fire with the luscious descriptions of the haunted house - which is one of the main characters! - that sounded like the scariest place on earth.My brain wasn't racing anymore.I read In A Dark, Dark Wood by Ruth Ware and was astonished by how eerily similar the setting in the book matches the neighborhood where I live, and I devoured that book while shivering fear until the satisfying end.My heart palpitations were going away.I read The Guest List by Lucy Foley, and for a week, I questioned if I knew my friends as well as I thought I did. But just like the other thrillers, Foley masterfully guided me through terrifying situations that would send me over the edge in real life.I started sleeping better at night.These books allowed me to feel fear in a simulated manner and to manipulate my fears by vicariously experiencing bravery and adventure. And by the time the stories ended, the characters that I felt close to in my imagination were generally ok. And so was I.And that is the whole point. I was ok.I am not saying that books and movies should replace serious medical attention, but I am saying is that while I feel helplessly trapped in a pandemic, I am learning how to cope with my mental health stuff in a safe way.For me, the uncertainty about the virus is what makes my brain feel frazzled. Rationally, I know that if I take precautions, then I can safely run errands in public, but my anxiety is not rational; it is emotional. Fear isn't always something that has to make sense. And so I worry about getting sick every time I leave my house.There are other ways that I am using self-care to tend to my mental health. Things like making sure my body is healthy, creating routines at home, and having healthy boundaries with friends and family. Creating a safe outlet where I can express my stuff helps too. But the soothing balm that meant giving my mind some relief has come in the surprising form of reading thrillers, a genre that I would have thought ill-suited for anxiety.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/1*pemAxSIqWSeuQ2QJp1dOwg.png,https://sarahcottrell.medium.com/reading-suspense-thrillers-calmed-my-anxiety-during-the-pandemic-7306c5223a2c,mental-health,b057ebf9fa59c77ec495bfac8ad1f0835cde6da0032cf17a03758b74
How You Travel is New Age Colonialism,"Last week my old boss called me and invited me to travel with her to South Africa. When I say, ""travel to South Africa,"" I mean an all-expenses-paid trip to her private home nestled into the middle of a South African national park, with a chef and masseuse and daily game drives and lots and lots of Veuve Cliquot.Needless to say, it sounded like a dream - of sorts. This wasn't the first time she'd invited me on such a wild excursion but it was somehow made vastly different by the timing of it all. After all, we're all living through a global pandemic.The world has been brought to its knees and everyone has been told to basically shelter in place for an unknown amount of time. What's more, essential workers are risking their lives so that we can have our necessities. While all of this is happening, the luxury travel market is growing and becoming even more exclusive than it already was.Insofar as the luxury travel industry provides the allure of exclusivity, it also provides preliminary exposure to a place through the specific lens as seen from White Western culture.It's the opportunity to be close enough to the exotic all while maintaining your Western creature comforts. In theory, well-managed tourism is mutually beneficial to both the traveler and the local economy. Tourism provides numerous opportunities for economic development and employment. Additionally, hotels and lodge operators buy goods and services from local suppliers which further boosts the economy. This copasetic and symbiotic relationship, surprisingly, doesn't always come to pass.As the luxury tourism market continues to grow, it has become something akin to the fashions and fads of previous iterations of tourism, ""such as the Grand Tour of the 18th and 19th centuries, representing little more than a mode of class-based distinction.""Many countries are taking stock of their specific marketability and attempting to draw in travelers. While an ever-growing number of travelers are seeking out more authentic experiences in rebellion against packaged resort/lodge trips, the luxury travel market remains in high demand.Some travelers may crave the feeling of altruism and goodwill when traveling, but many others (or those who can afford it) are clear in their intentions - they want the most lavish experience possible.They do not want to meet the locals. In fact, they may be shuttled from the airport to the lodge without encountering anyone but the airport security and their driver. They want to drink champagne in the middle of the African bush at sunset.Luxury travel in East Africa contributes a massive sum to many nations' GDPs, and therefore effectively becomes a form of neocolonialism, as it uses the forces of economy and cultural imperialism to influence countries and industries.While traveling to post-colonial nations is not inherently wrong, of course, there are some aspects of the luxury travel market worthwhile to unpack. So, let's begin -The industry of luxury travel functions as a form of neocolonialism in the sense that visitors are able to pick and choose what elements of the country and its culture they want to seize upon, while the rest is left by the wayside. It is exploitative and appropriating.While lux-travel might contribute to local economies, it's important to consider the wealth distribution. In many countries where tourism is growing, the lodges, shops, and restaurants are often owned by foreigners.Since travelers have long been sold certain images of the ""developing world"" or ""third-world,"" they are certainly more likely to stay and shop at places that feel more familiar (read: White and Western) to them.It's estimated that in the Caribbean, for example,According to 2013 research conducted by the World Trade Organization, ""just $5 of every $100 spent in a developing country stayed in that destination."" Foreign business owners and investors are able to pick and choose the elements of the country they want to sell for their own financial gain. Sounds a bit like colonialism, doesn't it?Some may argue that this is just a result of globalization, a trait of a growing international economy. Yet, globalization is a directly linked component of neocolonialism insofar as it suggests the State is independent and has international sovereignty when in reality the economic systems and political policy are directed from outside actors and capital.Globalization might ""typically manifest in encountering a McDonald's wherever you visit or in the fact that many of the shops that now fill Spitalfields in London look almost identical to the shops that fill Soho, New York,"" but it can manifest in various ways because, at its essence, globalization is anything that entails the ""integration of global economy marked by free trade, free flow of capital, and exploitation of cheaper foreign labor.""More often than not globalization happens concurrently with gentrification, in which those things that are considered modern, luxury, or good - hail from the West. Furthermore, the West becomes the ""epicenter of global culture."" Under this neocolonial and globalized world, nations that are presumed independent are still dominated, exploited, and dependent upon former European colonizers and Western powers.The ever-growing tourism industry has massive environmental repercussions. Due to increased awareness over the environment, the luxury travel market is on undergoing a bit of a rebranding - ""sustainable"" or ""ethical"" tourism has risen in popularity to combat the negative impacts of ""mass"" tourism.Unfortunately for these companies, no amount of marketing and rebranding can erase the fact that tourism is ""notoriously problematic for some developing destinations as it diverts often scarce water and energy resources from the host community to the paying tourist.""From an environmental perspective, luxury tourism by its very nature requires even more resources than average tourist consumption.Consider the components of your average luxury holiday - ""swimming pools, exclusive islands, private jets, cruises, golf courses, and spas - all are energy and water-intensive. Plants and green spaces must be kept lush, air conditioning, spas, and monsoon showers must be powered. Beaches and other places are made private, with locals prohibited from using them.""Not only are the properties and sites difficult and intensive to maintain, but the local communities are also impacted by the lack of resources. Additionally, waste from luxury tourist sites is often dispersed within the ""poor"" local communities.As the community impacts of luxury travel are brought to light, the market is moving towards a fresher model - sustainable and ethical travel. The UN World Tourism Organization defines sustainable travel as:When I first set out to write this article, I began writing about forms of travel in the ""developing"" world of post-colonial nations. As I unpacked luxury travel alongside voluntourism, I realized that these two types of travel are antithetical. Luxury travel by its nature is meant to be exclusive, lush, private. While voluntourism (perhaps the older iteration of ""ethical"" travel) is meant to connect the traveler to the local community. Similar to luxury travel, there are numerous problems with the voluntourism industry - which you can read about here.Sustainable travel is not only about eco-friendly travel, it's about social impact. It is a type of travel that has a ""positive impact not only on the environment but the culture and the economy of the destination you're visiting.""At the end of the day, the move towards ""sustainable"" travel can often read as being a faux-woke effort to simply make yourself feel better. Regardless of how hard people may try to create the illusions of equity in lux-travel, the wealth disparity will always be stark.Take for example the host country nationals that work in the tourism industry - often living away from home for months on end, separated from family and friends.Those who serve you on high-end trips, no matter how ""ethical,"" often ""live in conditions far removed from the ""luxury"" experience of the tourist, work seven-day weeks and often go months without pay."" People want to feel good about themselves, especially on vacation.So, entire industries are shifting to support this need to feel like a pseudo-humanitarian while sipping cocktails with ice cubes frozen in a freezer leaching the community's limited access to electricity and potable water.Despite the complexities and grey areas of traveling, the fact is - we're going to travel. People love to explore, see new places, treat themselves to luxurious honeymoons and celebratory trips. This isn't going to change any time soon, if anything, it will likely increase once we can all dust off our passports and travel again post-pandemic. So -Bon Voyage!More from Tyler A.

94 Actionable Ideas From 7 Books That Made Me a Better Leader.,"The mark of a great book, at least to me, is whether it changes how we see the world and how we act within it. And while there's no shortage of great books out there, when I think about those that helped define my own leadership practices, the following seven stand out.I highly encourage you to read them yourself, because the below points don't do them justice. But if you're pressed for time, or want a quick teaser as to the material, I hope that the below points can help you as much as they've helped me.If you think this is helpful, let me know. I try to read around 50 books a year and I'd be happy to post takeaways and actions from others if you think it's worthwhile. Cheers!",,https://medium.com/swlh/94-actionable-ideas-from-7-books-that-made-me-a-better-leader-3de65aa5a7ac,leadership,b90e65881e861aa2788af428314c47692502f71e112d5306db88ef78
"I Finally Read Atomic Habits, Here Are My Top 5 Takeaways","Last month, Atomic Habits by James Clear, surpassed 3 million copies sold worldwide. When I saw the announcement pop up on my Instagram feed, it reminded me of something: I had purchased one of those 3 million copies about a year and a half ago and never read it. It was sitting on my Kindle, collecting digital dust. Well, better late than never I figured and dove in.It probably took me less than a week to read, which for me qualifies as quite fast. When I'm able to get through a book that quickly, it's usually a solid indication it's very good. But Atomic Habits is more than just very good. In my humble opinion, it's so good that I would motion to file it under the elite category of books that can actually change your life. This is a motion that I do not at all take lightly.That's how good it is.Self-help and self-improvement can be a bit of a hamster wheel. That is to say, it's easy to get trapped inside the idea of improving your life but without ever doing it because you're too busy reading a pile of How to Change Your Life books. But every so often a book comes along in this genre that actually delivers on the promise and provides immense value to its readers.Atomic Habits is one of those books and it's easy to see why it has sold so many copies in less than three years.While it is well worth reading cover-to-cover as it is chock full of useful and actionable information about habits, from how and why we form them to how to break them and make them, I've decided to highlight my top takeaways and share with you the lessons I felt were the most profound.I put this first because I think it's the single biggest reason why, for some people, ""self-help"" never really seems to help. It also pairs nicely what that reference to the hamster wheel I just alluded to in my introduction and how it can be easy to get stuck trying to change your life without ever actually changing it.I was about midway through the book and the chapter entitled, Walk Slowly, but Never Backward, contained a pearl of wisdom that really resonated with me. And it was one of those rare moments that we as readers live for (and we as writers strive to deliver) where someone says something you always knew to be true but could never articulate yourself, but once you see it in writing, something inside you clicks and you have that very satisfying aha moment that feels magical.He warned about the difference between being in motion and taking action and he explained it perfectly. Motion is all about planning and learning and theorizing. Action is all about deliberate practice to deliver an outcome. It's all too easy to fall into the trap of being in motion, of fooling yourself into thinking you're making progress towards something.I know the feeling. Eating healthy, sleeping well, meditating, going to the gym, journaling, reading books, writing to-do lists, etc. - all great things. But for someone like me, whose real aim is to write and publish books and blog posts, that's all motion. It can help me be in a better headspace once I sit down to write, which is again, great, but it doesn't type the words for me.I can get up early, journal, meditate, get to the gym, do yoga, meditate, write a kick ass to-do list and drink smoothies till my skin turns green, but if I haven't written anything by day's end, what have I done with my day that is going to finish that post I want to write or move the story in my novel along?Nothing.I still have to sit down and think and type and edit and read and rewrite and type. I still have to take action, I have to actually write because that is the only thing that delivers the outcome I want.Sometimes we do need motion to plan or understand our path better. But it's a fine line. It's easy to use motion as a crutch to,""feel like we're making progress without every running the risk of failure.""If you aren't very careful about avoiding this trap, I think it's all but inevitable that you'll develop a very jaded, cynical view of the whole self-help, hustle culture, you-can-do-it-if-you-just-work-hard culture. While the industry itself is not without its nefarious actors and dubious motives, there are a lot of good people with great messages that get implemented improperly and with lackluster results. Because you get caught up in the safe feeling of progress that being in motion gives you.Don't get fooled by this feeling. Take action and you'll be alright.""What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided,"" this, according to James Clear, is the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change.It used to make sense to place a premium on instant gratification. Our very survival often depended on it. So, our brains evolved over time to prefer quick hits of pleasure to the kind of satisfaction one might get from long-term accomplishments.Clear mentions that behavioral economists call this warped sense of evaluation, time inconsistency (also known as dynamic inconsistency). Meaning, how our brains process and evaluate potential rewards is, ""inconsistent across time."" We naturally place a higher value on the present and discount the future.This is often a mistake and places a premium on virtually any habit we pick up over the course of our lifetimes - for good or for ill. Low time preference individuals will thrive, while high time preference individuals will get crushed. The reason being that the rewards from a bad habit, like for example smoking, are immediate while the consequences may take decades to manifest.And the inverse is true for good habits, like saving and investing. In the short term, you might not be able to buy the shiny new gadget you want or eat at that fancy new restaurant, but over decades that amount of saving and investing may very well make you rich.How deeply you understand and design your life around the simple fact that most of the decisions you make on a daily basis will not immediately benefit (or harm) you is going to be one of the primary factors in determining your success in life.Of course, the cheeseburger you ate at lunch won't make you fat. The grueling workout you did yesterday morning won't make you trim and muscular. The $100 you transferred to your retirement account won't make you wealthy. A night out with your friends, a few too many drinks, and poor night of sleep won't wreck your health.The key is seeing very clearly and understanding at a fundamental level that, over a long period of time, these decisions have serious consequences. Which reminds me of a quote Warren Buffett often attributes to Bertrand Russell:If you want to create real change, focus first on who you want to become instead of things like what you want to do and how you want to accomplish it.James Clear gives the example of two different approaches of people who are trying to quit smoking when they are offered a cigarette. One says, ""No thanks, I'm trying to quit."" And the other says, ""No thanks, I don't smoke."" The second person is making a small but fundamental distinction with their response. It's not about what they are or aren't trying to do, it's about who they are.Instead of wanting to write a book, figure out how to be the kind of person who writes books. What kind of qualities and habits do you think they have? Or a physically fit person, what would a healthy person do? Each time you perform a habit, good or bard, you are essentially casting a vote according to Clear, ""Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.""Start at the identity level first and then build out from there. The how and the what components will naturally follow once you figure out the who part.In Chapter 1, Clear tells the famous story of the British Cycling team and their coach, Dave Brailsford and his Marginal Gains philosophy that posited if the team could get 1% better at all the little things that go into riding a bike, they would see significant gains in performance when they added it all together.On paper, this appeared to work. After ""nearly one-hundred years of mediocrity,"" the British Cycling team was suddenly dominating the Tour de France and the Olympics. Of course, in recent years this story has received some criticism with regards to how much it actually help the team, but I think the overarching principle is a sound one.Little things add up to big things. Tiny actions, multiplied by millions can produce massive results. This concept is not unlike compound interest which Einstein is purported to have called the ""eighth wonder of the world."" There's a good reason business luminaries from Warren Buffett to Mark Cuban extoll the virtues of compound interest. It works in powerful, life-changing ways.As Naval Ravikant said:Having goals is not enough. If it was, we'd all be winners. But we know that's not the case. We all set goals for ourselves. How many of us actually see them through? Whether we succeed or fail depends on the quality of the system we develop to help us make progress once we've chosen a direction.As James Clear writes in the book, ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You rise to the level of your system.""I've set countless goals for myself over the years and I've failed to reach most of them. I've set some of the biggest, most grandiose goals for myself one could imagine on certain occasions but that never seems to move the needle.If and when I achieve goals, it's not because I set them, it's because I set up the proper system to achieve them. If you want to see results, i.e. achieve your goals, you should worry far more about your system than anything else.*refers specifically to outcomes, as in a sporting match, and is in no way a comment on anyone's worthiness as a human being.I could probably write two or three more lengthy posts just like this one with all the helpful insights I gained from this book but I'm going to stop here.Yes, it does go into the science and psychology behind habit formation in much more detail, but I wanted to pick out some of the larger, overarching ideas that I found really accessible and practical.I'd strongly encourage you to pick up a copy and read the rest for yourself. If you're struggling with your habits, this is very much a book for you. I think it's a book that can in fact change your life.Sign up for my newsletter to get more TomThoughts straight to your inbox...and a free book!",https://miro.medium.com/max/3000/1*VirWX54R_SgGa6amYPaP2Q.jpeg,https://medium.com/tom-thoughts/i-finally-read-atomic-habits-here-are-my-top-5-takeaways-57dd6f904ab4,productivity,b241e028cab47c716932bef22e476f5c4d4381d252353b159bc26c43
"2 Steps To Write Like a Child, the Best Storytellers on Earth","When I was a kid, we would go into the woods with machetes all day unsupervised. It was the South, OK?We would literally work for eight hours a day, hammering away at trees. Machetes aren't really made to cut down trees, so our little hands would get all blistered and bloody. We patched up and kept chopping. We needed enough wood for our cabin.Oh yeah, did I mention we built our own cabin? It was nice to have when it started to rain. We had slices of American cheese in there for when we had to take a rain-break. We used to stand up in the thing. But we grew since we built it, so we have to crouch now. While crouching in the cabin, we told stories.""What if God was broken into pieces by the Devil and we had to put him back together?"" We would decide to search the woods for artifacts that were the pieces of God. Each artifact somehow had special significance to our lives. Souls of hurt family members, things we wished would happen, etc. I can't remember all of them, but I remember it feeling like a dream.That might be the best story I have ever come up with - and I've written many stories as an adult. The best ones that I've written tap into that same dream-like state of fun - like when I was a kid. Here's how to tap into the storytelling genius of your inner child:This is simpler than it sounds. You can do this so everyone pays attention to the stories you tell at parties - or become a great writer of fiction. Before we unlock those abilities, let's dive into a little background:About a hundred years ago, a few thinkers made a theory (Joseph Campbell is the most famous) out of something people had been noticing for a very long time. The monomyth. Imagine you are a European explorer in Africa. You meet a tribe and learn their myths. You are stunned to hear that all their myths are almost exactly like the myths in your own culture. They had a flood story, a heroic savior story, and many more. What the hell?It's not like these stories are spreading around. They are popping up all over the world independently. Native Americans, Native Australians, Asians, Europeans... all the same stories. All feature dragons and gods and heroes. What are you supposed to make of that?Ricky Gervais claims that if you got rid of the Bible, it wouldn't reappear - but if you erased science, it would reappear exactly how we left it. He's arguing that religious myths are random and wrong, while science is solid and real.What he's missing is that religious stories have emerged independently worldwide, over and over. This is a non-religious argument, by the way. The Bible is a retelling of stories much older. The point stands - if you got rid of the Bible, you'd see the same stories appear again and again. Why?Because they say something important about what it means to be human. They aren't meant to say what is. They aren't science. They are meant to tell us what to do. We're still obsessed with telling these stories, too. Harry Potter? Jesus story. Walking Dead? Flood myth. Avenger's Infinity War? Moses epic.When I talk to my friends about this, I see a glassy look in their eyes right about now. You don't need to know the specifics of how this all works to use it. I certainly didn't understand any of this when I was a kid. I didn't realize that I was tapping into universal myths by following my unfiltered intuitions. Here's what you need to realize to benefit from this:It feels a little funny to rely on intuition to tell a story at first. It's like learning to ice skate. When you start, you're sure you're going to fall and hit your head. You try to ""control"" (that's your ego) the situation by being tense. Eventually, you realize that skating is about letting go, loosening up, and doing what comes naturally. It takes time. Your inner child-storyteller is waiting to get out of you. You let them out by:You can't go back to being a child, so you need practice. That's where the adult comes in. But you also need to remember how to play. For me, the play looks like freewriting, phone calls with friends who make me laugh, writing bad drafts, or trying new writing styles.The practice is easy. You have to do it every day. It's simple: do it every day. It's hard: do it every day. The rest takes care of itself.I work with clients to help them write their stories. The number one problem is: trying to be clever. Nothing else even comes close.Watch kids play. They play house. They play cowboys. They make rules. ""You're the bad guy!"" ""You're the mommy!"" They play out roles in life. They aren't telling a story to be clever! They're following a human need to learn how to exist in the world.If you're trying to write to be clever, I hate to tell you: you're fucked. Writing that works is similar to kids playing house. It's the storyteller desperately trying to understand how to be in the world.My old writing makes me sick. It's so obvious that I want to be clever. It's all that the story seems to convey. I don't care how moral I am, as long as you buy my writing and praise me. It stinks.Why do we feel the need to be clever? We're unsure of ourselves. We haven't had enough practice yet. We're that tense ice-skater. Give us enough time on the ice, we'll be fluid and beautiful, and people will want to watch. We will be an example of what to do. It's simple:The rules don't change. It's just how you think about them that might change. Getting the mindset right with the proper background knowledge helped me to find my inner child. I hope it can help you too.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/1*fWkaJGuQn4JrAOqB5SIncA.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/2-steps-to-write-like-a-child-the-best-storytellers-on-earth-f8f8b497b11,marketing,b299ce612f14a189e0efe55bb8260584430be5bfad0d1c1c101baa3c
An American Nightmare Served With a Smile,"Dutch Van der Linde, the infamous outlaw and leader of the notorious Van der Linde Gang, features within Red Dead Redemption (RDR) and Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) as one of the video game series' most compelling antagonists.Dutch's extravagant and charismatic persona largely explains his success in unifying such a mixed band of rogues and misfits to terrorize the Old West across several decades, all while skilfully evading capture by the authorities.Dutch, at first, comes across as a compassionate and altruistic leader who takes in society's most downtrodden. Certain core gang members were even discovered as adolescents, Dutch taking them under his wing. There he has acted as a mentor, teaching them the valuable skills of reading, writing, hunting, and shooting. However, this is just one of his two faces.The origins of Dutch's evil, the circumstances preceding his downfall, and his true intentions all remain points of fascination for players, all of which I aim to explore here.Dutch's mission is defined by a romantic dream of preserving the Old West and fierce opposition to the Federal Government and modernization, hence his various confrontations with big-city gangsters, leading industrialists, and even the military across both games.His means of accomplishing this mission is where his darker nature emerges. Beneath his twisted, self-made Robin Hood image lies the reality that Dutch only 'saves' impoverished and marginalized people, in return for their undying allegiance to his delusional cause of founding an independent American utopia (something about farming mangoes, apparently).This becomes disturbingly more transparent as RDR2's narrative unravels. Dutch's agenda solely exists to disguise his insatiable and sadistic appetite for violence, evidenced by his lifetime spent committing countless acts of armed robbery and murder.The passage above aptly summarizes the power dynamic between Dutch and his gang, in particular, the part: '...and if we deny it, then we make others our Lord.'Ironically, the source of Dutch's strength stems from each gang member's denial of their autonomy. By instilling into them they should invest their absolute faith in him as an omniscient leader, the gang surrenders all sense of individuality and free thought. They blindly obey Dutch's every word - clouding the distinction between a cult and a criminal gang.Dutch's radical ideology is heavily influenced by the fictional in-game author and naturalist, Evelyn Miller. However, his vague and puzzling application of Miller's theories reveals how he misconstrues them, ('I HAVE A PLAN', anyone?)Miller is a disgraced academic who retreated into the countryside to be closer to nature. His published texts, The American Inferno and An American Eden, are widely regarded as quintessential guides to opposing the apathy and decadence he alleges characterize modern American society.Miller's literature unquestionably fuelled Dutch's inflated sense of self-importance, affirming there is nothing more dangerous than a narcissistic fool weaponizing philosophical teachings into revolutionary dogma.Interestingly, there are notable similarities between Miller and Dutch, underlining how closely Dutch had based his rhetoric on the former.Miller openly labels himself a fraud, having previously reaped the benefits of mingling within high society despite advocating a naturalistic lifestyle. This unsettling truth troubles Miller so much so, that he works himself to death while residing at his forest cabin.The same is apparent for Dutch. He is a hypocrite and a despot who preaches equality, meanwhile enjoying a lavish lifestyle of wearing fine clothing, enjoying casual sex, smoking cigars, and listening to classical music (very loudly in camp).It is his followers who endlessly fight and labour to ensure the gang's survival. Had Dutch existed during the 1960s, he would have manifested as a Manson-esque 'hippy' commune leader.Further attesting to this is the unsettling discovery in RDR2's epilogue that Dutch had secretly been accumulating a fortune worth tens of thousands of dollars over several years - showing his readiness to abandon his nihilistic crusade and companions.Furthermore, both men attempt to justify or excuse their behaviour. Miller remarks that: ""I can't fight my own nature...none of us can.""Dutch paraphrases this statement on two occasions during the missions Favoured Sons and And The Truth Will Set You Free, alluding to his veiled self-acknowledgment surrounding the futility of his feud with the state and indeed anyone else who dares oppose him.A final connection between Dutch and Miller concerns their relationship with marginalized communities. Miller was an outspoken supporter of ethnic minorities and, most controversially, the Native American plight.As noted previously, Dutch routinely aligns himself with so-called socially inferior peoples as they are easier for him to manipulate and convince into joining his cause as an attractive alternative to existing within a prejudicial society.This is more explicitly seen in RDR wherein the majority of Dutch's new gang is formed of disaffected Native Americans, reiterating his opportunistic and brazen recruiting strategy alongside his gross violation of Miller's humanitarian endeavours.One prominent explanation for Dutch's increasingly destructive behavior across RDR2's campaign is that it's a result of sustaining a head injury and subsequent brain damage following a trolley car crash during the mission, Urban Pleasures.When the Italian mobster, Angelo Bronte, provides Dutch with false intelligence regarding a large sum of money being stored at a trolley station, the gang raid the property only to be caught in a massive police ambush, staged by Bronte, leading to their collision after fleeing the scene.Dutch's personality escalates towards becoming more impulsive and volatile thereafter. However, these traits were already ingrained in him long beforehand, with such events only serving to bring his true nature to the fore.The humiliation resulting from Bronte's betrayal deeply impacted Dutch's enormous ego and accelerated his transition to barbarity. Leading him to contradict his mantra of 'revenge being a fool's game' by brutally murdering Bronte, for no other purpose than to heal his wounded pride. His association with Bronte further highlights the dangers he routinely imposes on his followers through his arrogance and incompetence.Moreover, the reason behind Dutch's clash with Bronte and every other conflict he initiates, including the bloody Blackwater Massacre predating RDR2, relates back to his innate fear of being overshadowed by men of real power and influence. This is coupled with his awareness of the inconsequential role he will have within an advancing society that is a harbinger for the extinction of his lawless kind.This revelation is reinforced during a discussion between his former associates, John Marston and Sadie Adler, where John, one of Dutch's oldest friends, maintains that Dutch was always inherently evil.By the time of Dutch's eventual demise, he closely personifies Miller's observations. He dedicated an entire lifetime to wreaking havoc on a land he swore to cherish; he alienated and betrayed his most loyal followers, before lastly, destroying himself.Stripped of his flamboyant appearance, his charming capacity for persuasion, and his outlandish beliefs, all that remains is a broken, hollow reflection of someone who was once a prolific gunslinger.Greed and the thrill of danger propelled Dutch's lifestyle, although he was never capable of enjoying the rewards. During RDR2's final epilogue mission, American Venom after unexpectedly executing the treacherous Micah, Dutch abandons his immense personal fortune, his only legacy, for John and Sadie to claim.While this signifies the last semi-decent act Dutch ever commits, that he cannot directly seek forgiveness or apologize to John, both here and during their final encounter in RDR, confirms that his toxic narcissism continues to overrule his better judgement, consequently making him irredeemable.Dutch's character excels in presenting a strong and multi-dimensional antagonist whom players are able to actively loathe yet also regard with empathy. Perhaps if Miller had survived to read of Dutch's exploits, he would have revisited his philosophy and produced an amended text warning of the dangers of misinterpretation. Perhaps he would have entitled this piece, 'An American Nightmare'.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*I-Z7pzUaxrlgaZWeKuq2Jw.png,https://medium.com/super-jump/an-american-nightmare-served-with-a-smile-d2d774becc8a,fiction,b1793eb7dbbf2f10036d6ac5997d2417b2ea9355f89c06873f81d9c3
Fostering student engagement in the online Architecture Studio,"[note: 'Studio' refers to the physical space that students do their work in, together - peer-learning being an important part of how architectural design is learned and developed. 'Studio' also refers simply to the taught design element of their studies, and the groups that we teach in.]Last semester, my teaching partner Jamie and I thought A LOT about how we would engage students in the online learning environment to carve out a distinct identity (read: vibe) for our studio. At the end of the semester we got loads of positive feedback from our students (verbally and in emails) about how engaged they had felt, and how much they enjoyed our Fridays together. Here's a summary of some of the approaches we experimented with, and that hopefully contributed to the positive experience.Being Jolly After the first day of online teaching a lot of us realised how much harder it was to do than teaching in-person, and there was some rather downbeat chat about it. Jamie and I then decided that it was our responsibility to set the mood of the studio and we agreed to do our best to just bloody well be jolly about being there. As reminded by our course organiser, we avoided referring to online studio as being second best to in-person, physical studio, and made an active decision to not only tolerate it, but to make the most of it and positively enjoy it. Like that thing where you hold a pencil between your teeth and, apparently, before you know it, you're actually feeling OK.Seeing everyone on camera From the start Jamie and I asked our students to use their cameras. We made it clear that it was largely for our benefit as tutors(!) but also there's an element of keeping each other company. It seems like they understood that us being able to see them made teaching that little bit easier for us. If someone didn't default to joining a tutorial with their camera on, rather than asking directly to switch it on, I would often just say ""Hi! Is your camera working today?"". Of course, there were times when this nudge helped, but also times when we needed to be sensitive towards those who really didn't want to appear on camera. That was OK too.Performing I know I come across better on video when exaggerating my facial expressions, voice modulation, and gestures, and got into the swing of doing this for teaching. Like a form of stage makeup. I guess when people aren't there with you in person, more overt signals help them to latch onto what you're trying to communicate.Having banter In much the same way that having an exaggerated persona is a performance, playing upon a rapport between ourselves (Jamie and I) as teaching partners became part of the tone of the studio. We are lucky enough to have previously taught together for a few weeks last academic year, and had been buoyed by one student having told us that we had 'chemistry'! By the end of this semester we definitely had our quirks that we teased each other about openly - hopefully in an entertaining embarrassing mum and dad style dynamic, but apologies to students who just found it cringey. Like I say, a performance in an attempt to put the students at ease, and not feel like the studio was such a deadly serious place.Sorting out tech Before the need for online teaching my computer didn't have a microphone or a camera. It also turns out that it didn't really have adequate processing power for video conferencing either. I faffed around with too many peripherals for too long, but eventually (probably a bit too late) I worked out how to join a session on my computer for video and also join simultaneously on my phone for audio. Being given a second screen also helped immensely in having Teams on one and Miro on the other so that I didn't have to tile windows on one screen or keep switching between the two. It probably also worked for me to be looking away from the students when I was drawing so that I could switch back to looking at them when I was talking to them directly or listening to them (like how your point of focus switches around a room for variation when giving a talk).Getting students to ask each other questions This is one I learned from another colleague on crit day. At reviews, once a student had finished presenting I would invite the next student along to open the discussion by asking a question. I've seen this sometimes as well where students feel compelled to open their comments with a vacuous compliment, but thankfully we didn't get into this strange modern habit with our group. Without fail I was impressed every time with the level of peer inquiry that this method engendered.The next engagement challenge for me in this digital environment where the students aren't in the same space as each other, and, as first years are yet to even meet IRL, is to get them conversing amongst themselves and start the really valuable work of seeking out insights from each other. Please do send me ideas (however cheesy) if you have any.Akiko Kobayashi  Jan 2021",https://miro.medium.com/max/9344/1*5WXyvmLfqRxycHAG9bVQ7Q.jpeg,https://akikomak.medium.com/fostering-student-engagement-in-the-online-architecture-studio-2e52bd003886,education,b2066fd0cd310fb917930d2a31e2f387cf27190f22504c8c9b0541d5
Five Lessons in Launching a Startup,"By Chris Stegner, CEO and Co-Founder at Very Big Things, a leading digital product agency focused on digital transformation and disruption, & Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC)",,https://medium.com/forbes/five-lessons-in-launching-a-startup-a0c29bb48c20,startups,b12509a1edcf6b12b3d9425d38a3bf0b31f6cafc66ce2964504b6b64
"""Right now, our policies do not just allow, but promote, destitution.""","President Joe Biden recently told CBS's Norah O'Donnell that he doesn't believe the $15 minimum wage will be included in the final $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, but he plans to continue pushing for it in a standalone bill. A new report published by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that a $15 minimum wage hike would lift 900,000 people out of poverty while costing roughly 1.4 million jobs by 2025. The tradeoff has sparked a heated debate, but not all agree whether it's the right issue to focus on. As Annie Lowrey writes in The Atlantic: ""The question is what kind of economy we want to have, what kind of jobs we want to promote, and how much poverty we want families in relatively low-wage - and often brutally difficult, emotionally draining, physically tiring, and societally essential - jobs to experience.""",,https://marker.medium.com/right-now-our-policies-do-not-just-allow-but-promote-destitution-48c2a585c077,economy,b055180a87bcf8d7ff723817d53b2bd13a1406d56eca8d5599edaaeb
What Apple's IDFA Change Means for Advertisers,"Ben Legg, Chief Executive Officer of Digital People, former Chief Executive Officer of AdParlor and GLG Council MemberThis past June, Apple sent shock waves through the advertising world by announcing a change in the IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) setting on its new iOS14 mobile operating system. Originally scheduled to go into effect in September, the change would result in a pop-up window appearing on users' screens asking to allow a requested app to track them for advertising purposes.Previously, opt-in was the default and opting out required going into settings and blocking the alphanumeric IDFA code - a process that most users probably never bothered with, perhaps because they were unaware the IDFA existed.After a barrage of complaints, Apple decided to delay the switch until early 2021. To be sure, Apple's change burnishes its image in the area of privacy protection, but it challenges advertisers. To find out how e-marketers are coping, GLG met with marketing expert Ben Legg, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Digital People International. Earlier, Legg was the managing director of Ola UK and CEO of Ad Parlor. Excerpts of the conversation, edited for clarity, follow.Why has having access to the IDFA been so important to marketers?Even though the IDFA doesn't provide information such as the Apple user's name or address, having it allows a marketer to check which ad networks they frequent, enabling a marketer to retarget them elsewhere. You can also learn how often they revisit your site.So if users start to opt out en masse after the changeover, what will advertisers retarget?The goal, of course, is to find a way to get your users to log in so you have access to their email. You can require login to access your site or maybe to gain access to some extra functionality. If you can't get them to log in, you need to resort to the next-best approach, which is looking at their behavior on the app. That tells you who is a frequent ad clicker, who's a heavy user, their language setting, the device they're on and their location, for example. You can then go a bit old school and supplement the information with focus groups of users to get a bit of extra color.How many users do you think will opt in after the change?Let's assume the worst, since Apple's tone thus far has been relatively grumpy and anti-advertising. Many believe the wording Apple will use in its pop-up will be something like, ""This app wants to track you. Do you agree?"" Most people, obviously, would get spooked by that and opt out. There's a sense in the advertising industry that 70% to 100% of people will opt out. If at some point Apple allows the app to use its own language or if Apple comes up with more nuanced language along the lines of, ""This app would like to capture your data in order to retarget you with useful messages or tailored messages,"" you might well get a much lower opt-out rate. But my best guess is about 70% will opt out.If opt-ins are only about 30% of users, who will that affect most?Most advertisers do a good job of capturing customer data, so they have email addresses and won't be too affected. Users of platforms such as Facebook can ask them to match a segment of the platform's database that have interests in common with their own database and serve up that segment. So if you want to reach, say, females age 18 to 29 who live in a major city and have an iPhone, that won't be affected either. The main difference will be some areas of retargeting, particularly by midsized advertisers who are sophisticated enough to do retargeting but not big enough to get users to log in.What about the outlook for free-to-play and non-login shopping?I don't want to be a total doom-monger, because I'm sure some apps will find a way to pivot, but some will go bust. Trying to survive by doing just ad-based targeting, which accounts for about 25% of revenue at most apps, is going to become much harder because CPMs on those apps could fall by half. And if customer lifetime value goes down, you can't afford to bid in the app stores anymore, so you end up in a vicious cycle of having users who aren't worth much that prevent you from bidding much to win new users. This problem also applies to non-logged-in publishers and news sites.How do you think the change will affect ad pricing overall?For Facebook, the impact will be somewhere between zero and 2%. Here's why. Using our spending habits, which I think are broadly indicative, about 40% goes for custom audience targeting based on email addresses, so there's no impact from the change there. About 10% or maybe 15% is look-alike; again, no impact. About 30% is demographic targeting using Facebook data; no impact. What's left is the retargeting bucket, which accounts for about 20% of our Facebook spending. About 10% of that 20%, so about 2% of revenue, is desktop. That's not affected, because it's based on cookies. That leaves you with approximately 18%, and about half of that is Android, which is not affected. So only about 9% of our spending is affected.When IDFA goes away, that doesn't mean Facebook loses 9% of revenue. They're still going to serve an ad. They just won't serve the ads that use IDFA for targeting. So what you get is basically a CPM. So then the question is, what happens to CPM pricing when the top bidder on a retargeting ad has dropped out or all the IDFA bidders drop out? Based on my experience at Google, my gut says Facebook's CPM pricing probably will drop around 10%. So if they got a 10% hit to CPM on 9% of spend, that would be a 0.9% hit to revenue. But other advertisers would probably be attracted, so the drop probably would be more like 0.5%. In fact, it could be one of those things nobody even notices because of all the other noise.Overall, does all this mean a boom for Facebook, Google, Amazon, and the like?In general, anything that restricts data or restricts the ability of smaller players to use data benefits the big platforms that have more data. So from that perspective, the walled gardens are in a strong position while smaller publishers and start-ups are in a weaker position. But the Apple change only confirms a longstanding verity: advertisers, publishers, and platforms that are focused on building a relationship with their users, and get email addresses and permission to target them, are in a good position. The walled gardens and other well-run companies have good relationships with their customers, not just walled gardens.Ben started his career as a Captain in the British Army's Royal Engineers, leading various military engineering organizations in Germany, Canada, Cyprus, Northern Ireland, Poland, and Bosnia (including relieving the Siege of Sarajevo in 1995).

The Perfect Tax,"There are many things that President Biden and the Democratic majorities in Congress should spend money on. A partial list includes vaccines and vaccine rollout, nationwide testing infrastructure (you didn't think the virus would just vanish, did you?), expanded unemployment benefits, direct aid to state and local governments whose tax revenues have been crippled by the pandemic, affordable housing construction, student loan forgiveness, universal public pre-K, Medicare for All, and a Green New Deal. Some of the money can be raised simply by issuing bonds at historically low interest rates, but there are both economic and political reasons for raising taxes as well.One of the most revolting aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is the vastly unequal impact it has had on different communities. In addition to inequalities in health outcomes-poor people and minorities have died at much higher rates than rich and white people-the pandemic has severely aggravated economic inequality. Total economic output rebounded relatively quickly, thanks in part to Federal Reserve reassurances and the CARES Act. But as economic activity has shifted both among and within sectors, the winners have been large, well-capitalized corporations with big technology budgets, while the losers have been small businesses with little cash on hand. The result has been a major shift in profits toward large, publicly traded corporations, especially a handful of technology companies that have benefited immensely from the pandemic-most visibly Amazon. This transformation of the economy has turbocharged the stock markets in which the wealthy keep most of their assets, making them even richer while so many other people have faced personal and financial devastation.This massive redistribution of wealth had nothing to do with skill, hard work, or clever business strategy. It was sheer dumb luck. Take Zoom, for example. A year ago, its stock traded at $75; today, a share is worth almost $420, an increase of more than 450 percent. Zoom has a good product and very well might have become a very valuable company someday, but without the new coronavirus it would not be worth more than $120 billion. Amazon alone has gained more than $640 billion in market value in the past year-that's $640 billion in the account statements of the wealthy people and institutions that own the vast majority of the company's stock. Some rich people like to pretend that their wealth results from their skills and hard work. This is sometimes true, to some extent (although being skilled and hard-working is itself the product of chance). But in 2020, the primary driver of wealth inequality was pure luck.That's the principle behind the Pandemic Windfall Tax: a tax on the excess returns on investments in the stock of public corporations. The basic idea is this: first, we look at the average return on corporate stock since the beginning of the pandemic; then, for each corporation whose stock delivered higher returns, we levy a tax equal to half of those excess returns. For example: if the average corporation's stock returned 20 percent, and Corporation X's stock returned 50 percent, then the tax is equal to (50-20) / 2 = 15 percentage points of returns. The tax will be paid by the corporation itself. If Corporation X's total market value increased by 50 percent from $100 billion to $150 billion (assume it didn't pay dividends), then the tax would be 15 percent of $100 billion = $15 billion.Why is this the perfect tax? First, it corresponds well with our basic moral intuitions. A country is a community of people who live together, a little bit by choice but mainly because of a shared history. When some people suffer for no fault of their own and others benefit for no virtue of their own from the same accident of history, it is only fair that the fortunate should help the unfortunate.Second, the tax will have no negative incentive effect on corporations or investors. The reason for this is that it is a one-time tax on past results and has no impact on a corporation's assets or operations. In the example above, Corporation X owes $15 billion to the Internal Revenue Service. Instead of paying in cash, which might limit the corporation's ability to invest in its business, Corporation X can choose to pay by issuing stock to the Treasury Department worth $15 billion. (In this case, that means that Corporation X would have to issue one share of stock to the Treasury for every nine currently outstanding.) The corporation itself-its assets, contracts, employees, everything-remains exactly the same as it was the day before it paid the tax. (For those worried about government ownership of private companies, the stock could be put in a trust-as was the case for the government's investment in AIG during the financial crisis-or the Treasury could commit to selling it mechanically on a schedule over a long time period, such as twenty years.)Third, the burden of the tax will fall precisely where we want it to fall: on rich investors who made a killing off of the pandemic. No cash changes hands, but now the federal government owns a piece of Corporation X and every corporation like it. The tax is effectively being paid by shareholders of Corporation X, whose stock is now worth a little less than it was before the imposition of the tax. (This happens because Corporation X is the same as it was before, but there are now more shares of stock outstanding.) This will have the obvious and beneficial side effect of reducing wealth inequality. Because the tax falls on people who own shares of companies that benefited from the pandemic, it is a little like a wealth tax; but because it is levied on the basis of corporations' stock returns and is paid by the corporations, it is not a direct tax and not potentially unconstitutional.Finally, the Pandemic Windfall Tax could raise a ton of money. Exactly how much depends on a few details. We would have to choose a period over which to measure stock returns. This could be something like January 1, 2020 until February 1, 2021; it would probably make sense to average the beginning and ending stock prices over a period of 15 days or so. The tax should be levied on total returns to stock investors, including dividends paid out during that period. For the average return, we could use the total return on a broad stock market index such as the Wilshire 5000. Most importantly, we have to decide what percentage of the excess returns to tax. I'm using 50 percent here, but you could defend a higher figure. (Remember, the pandemic benefited the publicly traded corporate sector as a whole at the expense of smaller, private companies, so the average stock market return already incorporates a windfall.) At 50 percent, investors in Amazon can still keep half of the fantastic returns they gained simply because of a virus that killed hundreds of thousands of people.For Amazon alone, whose investors made $640 billion over the past year, the Pandemic Windfall Tax would raise $250 billion. Apple gained even more value as people stocked up on iPads and iPhones and streamed movies instead of going to the theater; it would owe $340 billion. Netflix, the huge beneficiary of pandemic confinement binge-watching, would owe $35 billion. Zoom? $40 billion. You get the picture.In summary, the Pandemic Windfall Tax is a tax on dumb luck that could raise something like a trillion dollars primarily from rich investors (both Americans and foreigners, by the way)-money that is needed to stop the COVID-19 pandemic and help people whose lives have been ruined by it. Because it is a one-time tax, it does not affect any incentives to work, save, or invest. It directly (although incompletely) addresses the crushing unfairness of a public heath emergency that has made the poor poorer and the rich richer.The struggle against COVID-19 is a war-yet another war whose burdens fall most heavily on the poor while little sacrifice is demanded of the rich. The Pandemic Windfall Tax asks only that those who have profited from this war share some of their gains with those who have lost. Is that so much to ask?",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*83ldCFezcV0EoLIhGaGe-A.jpeg,https://jamesykwak.medium.com/the-perfect-tax-33cad3bc3e46,economy,b49987106c397a5880dc3f5ade11c7e7ece1a2be8d248d9e431a047f
I Witnessed a Horrific Car Crash and It Really Helped Me Relax,"When I woke up Monday morning, I knew it was going to be a shit day. It was my fault, really. I'd spent the weekend coaching clients but made the mistake of not decompressing Saturday or Sunday night. Instead, I finished both evenings catching up with two of my best friends, spending up to four hours on the phone with each of them. This caused me to skip my usual wind down and bedtime routines, which affected my sleep and wake schedules. So, I felt disoriented Monday morning.One of the many perks of working for myself is the ability to make my own schedule and cancel entire workdays. So, before my feet even hit the floor that morning, I decided to cancel Monday altogether. I just wasn't ready. Instead of worrying about my long to-do list and the anxiety it created, I chose to focus on centering and grounding myself. I would take care of my body and my home and worry about work later. So, at eight o'clock that morning, I set out to the market.The air was cold and fresh, but the sun was bright and warm. Snowbanks flanked the streets, and coarse rock salt littered the wet asphalt. I cracked the car windows a bit, turned up my classic 1980's playlist, and officially began my day of self-care. On the way back home from the store, the wind whistled through the car windows as Don Henley crooned the words to New York Minute, and I sang along, badly. I was feeling better already.🎼 In a New York minute, oooohhhhh, everything can change...🎼I heard the sound before I saw the crash. There wasn't any skidding, just a slap, then a thud, and a series of bangs. The pickup truck in front of me smacked the mini-van in front of it as the van moved into a left-hand turn. With the roads still wet from the weekend's snow, the minivan skidded out of control and rolled onto its side before hitting a pole. My anxiety ran amuck as I drove past the scene - the battered van, shattered glass, and deployed airbags. Part of me wanted to stop and help, as others did, but the largest part of me just wanted to feel safe again.I needed to get home.I drove cautiously for the short time it took for me to turn onto my street and pull into my garage. It felt as if I'd been holding my breath ever since I saw the crash. So, as I closed the garage door behind me, I inhaled and then exhaled deeply. I sat in my car for a few minutes, breathing, thanking God, praying everyone involved in the accident was okay, and wondering what to do next. Though I wanted to, I couldn't afford to drop out of life altogether, to crawl into my bed, pull the covers over my face, and wish the day away. However, I could afford to rest.My plans for grounding myself became more than regular maintenance. It was an act of defiance against my shock - and not just the way I felt after witnessing someone else's trauma, but all the loss, heartbreak, stress, anxiety, and fear I have felt in the past year...past five years. So much has happened, everything has changed, and I haven't stopped moving. I can't stop, not while the world is on fire, not while we're in the midst of a pandemic, and not while everything hangs in the balance. What I can do, however, is be still and intentional, quiet and caring. I can find ways to strike a balance between work, family, and being kind to myself. So, as I walked into my house, with my family still asleep, I was even more determined to find my peace, calm, and center.Breathe: It may seem this goes without saying, but mindful breathing isn't natural. It takes effort and self-awareness. Deep breaths helped lower my rapid heart rate and kept me from hyperventilating. It was my first step to calming down.Compartmentalize: To help myself stay centered on self-care, I focused on one room of the house at a time, cleaning and organizing it before moving on to the next. This is one of my favorite grounding rituals.Exercise: Once the house was clean, laundry was being done, and everything was in its rightful place, I hopped onto my Spin® cycle and rode for three miles, music blasting. Each drop of sweat represented disoriented and anxious feelings pouring from my body. Forty-five minutes later, I felt so much better.Shower: After my workout, I took a long, hot shower. I took my time mindfully scrubbing the day away with my exfoliating gloves, which I absolutely cannot live without. I cleaned and polished my body and then just stood there, the hot water beating my tense shoulders, breathing in the steam.Skincare: By this point in my day, the effects of the long weekend and the initial shock of witnessing the early morning crash had worn off. My mind was clear, and my body was coursing with endorphins. Next, I turned my attention to my skincare - facial and body. This bit of pampering always feels like a mini spa day. I vigorously massaged my muscles while applying lotion and oil and indulged in using my decedent facial products. I took my time and loved on myself.After seeing the crash, finding my center became more important than before. It was about reclaiming my balance, putting work and other responsibilities on hold, and grounding myself in my pleasure triggers. Monday became a day of gratitude and prayer and taking care of myself first before caring for others.That moment, sitting there at the intersection, watching someone else's life change forever, gave me a sense of urgency about my daily healing. It reminded me to stop rushing around, to breathe more, and to be thankful. In a split-second, life can change or end. It's a scary thought, but it reminds me that all we have is now - yesterday is gone, and by the time we get to tomorrow, it'll be today.It's hard to stop right now when stopping can mean the difference between survival and failure, but there's always time to slow down, to breathe, spend a little extra time in the shower, or sweat until your fear subsides.Balance, because sometimes, it's all you can do.",https://miro.medium.com/max/7000/1*HleG1T1tt56mABQKRMMKcg.jpeg,https://medium.com/lilibetovesen/i-witnessed-a-horrific-car-crash-and-it-really-helped-me-relax-5216c795cf40,mental-health,bc782a43a786453e77c5dc50bac9d2747f63e1b139376783d7d568f7
"Ensure All Voices are Heard, and Other Actions for Allies","Last week, the Tokyo Olympics organizing committee president and former Prime Minister of Japan made some controversial comments about women in meetings. As reported by Nikkei Asia, Yoshiro Mori said that board meetings with women ""take so much time"" and ""Women have a strong sense of competition. If one person raises their hand, others probably think, I need to say something too. That's why everyone speaks.""Management scholar and author Adam Grant responded on Twitter with a different opinion, informed by research from Cornell University:Regardless of the reasons - and regardless of the gender identity of the person being interrupted - allies have a role to play in creating inclusive meetings. When you work to minimize interruptions, you create a more equitable workplace, with the added bonus of helping everyone know that they're valued members of the team.Here are some everyday actions to take in your next meeting to help ensure that all voices are heard:(By the way, Yoshiro Mori is expected to resign because of his sexist remarks.)While the video footage is shocking, I know I'm privileged as a white person to not worry about my personal safety or my family. Members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities, however, are most likely feeling quite differently. And that spills over to the workplace. As Michelle Kim, CEO of Awaken, wrote previously about traumatic events,Michelle's advice? Check in with your AAPI colleagues. Let them know what you've been hearing and seeing in the news and that you're here to support them. For specific ideas of what to say, read Michelle's article. She provides a boatload of suggested phrases to use in team meetings, one-on-ones, and emails.Here's your somewhat regular reminder that ""a group can be diverse, but an individual cannot be."" (Quote from Lori Nishiura Mackenzie and Melissa V. Abad, PhD, of the VMWare Women's Leadership Lab at Stanford in a recent HBR article.)I frequently hear people say things like, ""We're looking to hire a diverse engineer for our team"" and ""Can you recommend a diverse speaker for our event?""When it happens, I point it out and recommend they say ""someone from an underrepresented group"" instead. Yes, it can be a mouthful, but it'll start rolling off your tongue the more you use it.I noticed another salient tip for allies in Mackenzie and Abad's HBR article:Here are a few suggested questions to ask to screen for inclusive attitudes and experiences during the interview process, from my book Better Allies: Everyday Actions to Create Inclusive, Engaging Workplaces:Nappy is a free stock photo website aiming to break down stereotypes and improve Black and Brown people's representation. In partnership with MetaLab, they recently added an All Hands Collection to address a specific concern: the lack of Black and Brown hands interacting with devices.As their website explains,The next time you need a stock photo of hands holding a phone or typing for a presentation, blog post, or product markup, be sure to check out this new collection.(Thank you ⁦⁦Bernadette Smith, for sharing this announcement in your Equality Institute newsletter.

"I tried using Google AdSense for the first time, and it was a nightmare. Here are the beginner mistakes you should avoid","If you want your ads to prioritise getting the most clicks possible at the lowest price, paying for clicks is good. If you want to save more money by setting your target CPA costs and lowering it more than recommended you shouldn't put it under 50 cents or more like I did since other people are advertising their product with google as well and want a spot on the user's screen. Hence, your bid for a spot to display your ad if you bid too low and activate your ad you could sleep and wake up the next day seeing that no one viewed your ad since it wasn't displayed anywhere. so raise your bidding a little but don't raise it by an extreme amount if you don't see results immediately, because of the next mistake I madeAfter activating your ad, you should wait for about an hour or two till you gain impressions this time is shorter depending on what you pay for such as views but keep this in mind and wait an hour. If nothing happens, your bidding may be too low, or there's another problem you should fix.sometimes Google will ask you to make a conversion that detects when a person performs an action on a website such as paying for a product or looking at a page. After you complete the conversions, you will be asked to implement the HTML code into the website. This is impossible if you don't own the site and run the ad without implementing it. Google didn't display my ad, which frustrated me.You will encounter this when you make discovery ads which says it will run ads on ""Youtube, Gmail, Discover and more"" and the name and picture may leave you to believe that the discovery campaign is the best way to attract customers who search up your product/service when in reality every ad does that. The only difference with the discovery campaign is that your ad will show up on the top of someone's Gmail inbox. The ad can display multiple products that the customer can click on youtube. The ad shows up on the google discovery app.Unless you want this marketing style, the 'display' campaign shows up on all these sites and more in some way, except google discovery. You don't need to install tracking code into the website you are linking to advertise it.The date I took this screenshot was February the 9th. The overview displays the statistics for the last 7 days except for today. Suppose you don't see the problem. When I created an ad, my budget was being spent, and I see no change to my statistics and couldn't see what my budget was being spent on. Set your date to today! and speaking of budget.It's possible to spend a bit over the budget of an ad if lots of people click or view it so keep that in mind.To claim the google credit voucher, you may be asked to spend 25 euro or whatever currency you use to earn the credit. I deposited 25 euro into my Google AdSense account and used it all up and got nothing. I thought there was a glitch and contacted google support. It turned out I needed to use up 25 euro on the advertisement to be eligible for the reward without depositing.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1782/1*9xSmImQEVqsXSgXUMeYKHA.png,https://medium.com/mochos-thoughts/i-tried-using-google-adsense-for-the-first-time-e413801a6a2b,marketing,bd05fa160f903e21f605dc6e4c19e6cec6a3a2f3240e9ded0079cde7
Mindfully Creative,"Mindfulness can bring you into discovering the fullness of your own potentials at any stage of your life. It did that for me by first showing how loud and mistaken the inner voices were and then breaking down the voices that told me I was no good and had no spark of creativity.Creativity can be a way of accessing your inner self, your spiritual depths even. It enables you to express yourself in ways that ordinary daily activity is unable to do so. However we do it, that is not the point. It allows us to be a whole person and to shine our own light into the world, thus making it a better place for everyone else. I don't mind if there are many people who do not like my creative expression, there are those who also do. I don't mind about being ' good' or not, just expressing myself and sharing to encourage others to do the same. We do not all need to be Picasso or Rodin, or even Mary Oliver or any of the Nobel and Booker prize winning authors. Creativity should be more about playing and exploring than anything else.We are all capable of being creative in one way or another. Even just making piles of stones on a beach into a small balancing tower can be creative. I love to design sandcastles with my grandson ( not sure if they are for him or me though). Picking flowers and putting them into vases is another joy , playing with colour and form but keeping it natural.I was brought up believing I had no creativity because I was no good at art at school. I can't draw well at all , and my handwriting is appalling. I was one of the last in my primary school year allowed to move fromn pencil to pen because my writing was so bad. Endless pages of repeated a's ad b's and how to differentiate between p's and q's etc was a practice that made little difference either. I just couldn't be consistent with what my hand did, at least when it came to pen on paper, no matter how hard I tried. The other issue was that the harder I tried the more tense I was, and the more difficult it was to control my hands and create a loose flow of handwriting, let alone any kind of drawing.At school, at around age thirteen, I was asked to leave art and put into a class of crafters instead, where we learned other creative skills like weaving, dyeing and batik. I loved it. I preferred this more practical approach to life anyway so I was happy. But it left a profoundly mistaken understanding in my mind about who I was and what I was. The one thing that my craft/ art teacher told me though, was that I had a very strong sense of colour, and she liked how much I dared to use challenging colour combinations. I remember one geometrical design I created for making a screen print from was two specific shades, yellow and purple. It was strong and the contrast made both colours pop, soothing and restful it was not, neither was it subtle. But that comment stuck equally as firm as all the 'can't do' negative ones had done and that perhaps was also my saviour.I am good with colour. Colour matters to me.It matters that I wear clothes that compliment or challenge each other. There are also colours I cannot wear at all because they make me feel overstimulated. These are a lurid neon shade of orange or yellow. Red or green in neon shades is almost as bad. I never wear them under any circumstances. They make me feel anxious and unsettled. But give me a beautiful drift of orange marigolds and I love their shiny golden faces. Softer versions of these colours are wonderful, shades of apricot or sunsets generally are alive.Flowers of all colours work though because they are natural and muted by their green stems and leaves of course too.Later I went on to love patchwork, knitting, gardening, and embroidery. The latter I lost interest in soonest but the other three have remained enduring activities one way or another, throughout my life.I also learned to love art galleries and museums, once I had shaken off my mothers tedious approach to such institutions which was enough to put most people off for life. For her it was social standing and a duty to visit such institutions and I never once sensed any genuine connection in her with anything we saw there. When I asked her to explain what she liked about it she just responded defensively that I thought too deeply about life and asked too many questions. Nowadays I get quite excited by art in galleries when it is clearly born of such talent and insight, especially if it has that luminous quality.I had always felt that somehow writing would become significant to me too, even at school when writing seemed so impossible with my hands, and I was more or less laughed at through my school life if I mentioned being a writer or anything like that. I had a lot of growth and transformation to undertake before I could reach that point but I felt it early on, intuitively I sort of knew it would happen when the time was right, even though it took me by surprise.So I seriously never thought of myself as creative, let alone a creative writer, more a doer of crafts.And then I started to meditate and to practice mindfulness in as much of my daily activity as possible. I started with the mundane like hanging out laundry and found I could make it a colouring exercise, sorting out shades of colour along the washing lines. Since we both wear any of the same rather limited palette of colours that is easy to do.Then I started to recognise that I created good garden designs, both in layouts and in planting schemes.I also prefer to design and knit my own knitwear. I love the different stitches and textures they create, and found myself wanting to recreate modern artists paintings into my designs. I have a Mondrian shift dress which is for cold weather over leggings. I am experimenting with colour in blocks, stripes and many other creative ideas for all seasons.Being deeply mindful is the way to find an opening to your own creativity, by allowing yourself to own your own reality and recognise those agendas given by others. I still have dysgraphia of course - can't handwrite or draw for toffees. But I can plan, invent, design, create, play with colour and do that in many different mediums. And I can and do write, poetry, books, articles stories even.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8064/1*ZvxksBVatE4ZmBSwtWEWPg.jpeg,https://medium.com/mindfully-speaking/mindfully-creative-7a3d2e512f29,mindfulness,bddd574d0000fc5934ae3481cd883d60ce6d24e34dd75515a1a08978
How to Be a Changemaker in Schools,"If I asked you to stop reading and name the teachers and staff at your school that always volunteer first, could you?I bet you could. You might even be one of them, seeing as you are reading this article in the first place.Changemakers are those that do more for the good of the whole.This is a simplistic definition, but at the heart of a changemaker is an unwillingness to settle for the status quo.A changemaker will never utter the cursed sentence ""but we have always done it this way!""I have worked in five different countries. I have taught at one public school, three international schools, one virtual school, and one Department of Defense school.I have worked with talented colleagues who are 100% invested in the outcome of their students.I have worked with jaded colleagues who are overworked, underpaid, and undervalued.In every school where I have taught, there has been a group of changemakers.These are the teachers, admin, and staff who actively advocate for continuous school improvement. They acknowledge the uphill battles and hard-earned wins to improve student learning.To be a changemaker takes tenacity, creativity, originality, and confidence. To be a changemaker is being willing to lead change while creating a culture of the ""greater good"".The changemakers are the five to fifteen (or more) faculty members and staff who volunteer for extracurricular activities, chair numerous committees and become the go-to for advice and help.Changemakers have the ability to mold a positive school culture where every stakeholder thrives. Let's be the changemakers.At one particular international school, I had the pleasure of working with ambitious, driven, and knowledgeable teachers. The environment was conducive to professional learning, with voice and choice provided to students and teachers alike.I thrived in this environment with my insatiable curiosity. Due to open-minded administrators, my every question was answered. I felt emboldened to volunteer on committees and help manage events all because I was interested in the ""behind-the-scenes"" running of a school.Since I was involved in the committees, I was able to ask more questions and offer more solutions. My curiosity drove me to seek change and to become more involved with the school.A changemaker must be curious - ask questions, ruminate, seek help, find answers.Change happens when enough people being asking questions.According to Francesca Gino from the Harvard Business Review, ""when our curiosity is triggered, we think more deeply and rationally about decisions and come up with more-creative solutions...curiosity allows leaders to gain more respect from their followers and inspires employees to develop more-trusting and more-collaborative relationships with colleagues.""When enough changemakers are curious, innovation happens. When we take the time to ask questions, respectfully, and become involved with the solutions, then the culture shifts into a community of curiosity.At one particular school, I could name the teachers who were the most actively involved in coaching, activities, and committees. It always seemed to be the same teachers who stepped up over and over again.As a principal, I knew the teachers I could go to when I needed help. I knew the teachers who would jump in feet first with a positive attitude and a willingness to contribute.What would it be like if we all bore that same attitude? I am not implying that we don't do enough as teachers or that our plates are not already overflowing. Those are true statements. But if there is an opportunity to be involved outside of the classroom, then why not be involved?Teacher complacency can be a real issue, usually brought on by external pressure and time constraints. Sometimes a jolt of belonging is required to lift teachers out of the confines of their rooms.When teachers are active participants in the school community, parents and students notice. Relationships are formed that are brought to the classroom. Students feel more comfortable and are more primed to learn.Being proactive creates community. Active participation creates camaraderie and a ""we are all in this together"" attitude.Changemakers participate and stay engaged to further the mission of the school.I have had the privilege to work with exceptional educators who model their beliefs. I have learned from them and aspired to follow in their footsteps.An administrator I admire valued professional learning and created an environment that reflected his belief that we should all be given the opportunity to grow.This belief seeped into the culture and became the norm and expectation. He modeled his values and worked with the director to ensure they came to fruition.He never strayed from his belief and actively engaged the faculty in their own development, which further cemented his authenticity and genuineness.As teachers, we provide students with exemplars to provide guidance on assignments. We model what we want students to learn. We model how we want students to behave in the classroom.We know students are always watching and learning from us.Leaders are always being watched. Setting core values, and then failing to abide by them, is worse than not establishing core values at all. - Marisa Levin, Inc.Changemakers are at the forefront of upholding the school's mission.They ""walk the walk"" and can be counted on to accurately reflect their beliefs and values.When changemakers are keen to present an innovative solution to a problem, they are seen as authentic voices in the process. They wear their values on their sleeve and colleagues know what to expect.I have sometimes found myself engaged in fragile relationships with colleagues. In almost all cases, it was because I failed to understand how another teacher could believe something so vastly different from what I did.This was most obvious when I was a teacher tasked with collaborating with several departments that were out of my specialty area. My job was to ensure the needs of my students were met by helping support teachers in their use of accommodations.I quickly realized that teachers have a diverse set of background knowledge and beliefs. We all came from different environments that have shaped us into educators. Not everyone will do what I would do.I had to come to terms with the fact that not everybody has to perform the way I think is best. As a Type-A teacher, this was a difficult transition for me.I learned that a changemaker has to find common ground. In order to change to happen, there has to be a disruption of some kind.There is an acknowledgment that something can be done better or differently. This can offend those that have ""always done it this way"" or those that struggle with change.It is not easy to disagree productively. We are at the table precisely because we have a different opinion. I have sat on many a committee where it was not easy to find a sustainable and agreeable solution.Changemakers have to sift through the noise and find the common thread.To enact change, there has to be give and take.This is two-fold. There are easy relationships with other changemakers, in which everyone is on the same page with reforms that need to happen within the school.Then there are the more difficult relationships with colleagues who do not feel change is necessary, or just don't agree with much at all.It took me a long while to realize that both sets of relationships are important.Whether it is with a changemaker already on our side or with a colleague who sits squarely on the other side, relationships help smooth the course of change.When there are mutual respect and admiration, conflicts can be resolved productively. When there is an honest intent to view another perspective, then everyone feels valued and heard.We all have our own experiences that shape us, and with this comes a multitude of opinions and beliefs. Sometimes it is difficult to ""walk in someone else's shoes"" as Atticus Finch wisely advised in To Kill a Mockingbird.Changemakers understand the importance of relationships in cultivating change. For true organizational change to occur, all stakeholders must be involved. This happens over time with positive relationships and productive conversations.I am not going to pretend that it is easy to take on the role of a changemaker. We are busy with our classrooms, our families, our lives.To create a culture where changemakers thrive, school administrators need to lay the groundwork for an open-door environment.The culture of the school must clearly reflect the value of continuous school improvement. There must be an expectation that everyone in the building will continue to learn and grow.Curiosity. Innovation. Relationships. Opportunities. Belonging.

Why Mental Self-Awareness Is Good for Your Brain,"The human brain possesses a remarkable capability that most take for granted and few fully appreciate: It can watch itself work.With effort, you can observe what your brain is thinking about and also what it's doing with those thoughts - the feelings, ideas, emotions, and urges it's producing. This capability falls into a category that psychologists sometimes call metacognition. (Basically, thinking about thinking.) And there's evidence that practicing this sort of mental self-awareness holds immense therapeutic power.""Introducing this idea of self-monitoring is one of the first steps in cognitive behavioral therapy,"" says Michelle Newman, PhD, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Penn State University. ""When you have a greater awareness of what the brain is doing, you can take a step back and take a more objective view of the world and your reactions to it.""Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is among the most evidence-backed and effective treatments for depression, anxiety, addiction, and related afflictions. And Newman says that the kind of objectivity that self-monitoring produces is a critical component of CBT in all its forms.Mental self-monitoring also lies at the heart of mindfulness practices, which have moved to the fore in the battle against mood and substance-use disorders. ""Something about observing our own thoughts changes our relationship to them,"" says Judson Brewer, MD, PhD, a mindfulness researcher and associate professor of psychiatry at the Brown University School of Public Health.In quantum physics, there's a phenomenon known as the observer effect: Scientists have demonstrated that certain subatomic particles change their behavior when under observation. And the closer the observation, the greater the change. Brewer says that something similar seems to happen when people pay closer attention to their own mind.""When we start observing,"" he says, ""we find that we can't be as caught up in, or identified with, our thoughts and emotions.""Like a neglected bonfire, negative emotions tend to die out if they're not continually replenished with negative thoughts.""Thoughts don't always give rise to feelings, but they definitely keep feelings going,"" Newman says. ""For example, you see something that's unfair and you have an emotional reaction to it, and then your mind gets into this ruminative cycle where you think about unfairness everywhere, and those thoughts perpetuate the feeling.""Along with this kind of emotion-shaded cherry-picking, a person's thoughts can also become biased in ways that shape incoming information to one's mood. ""You can start discounting or discarding any information that goes counter to what you're feeling,"" she explains.By paying closer attention to how all this happens in the brain - something that is achievable with practice - Newman says that it's often possible to make helpful changes. You can learn to stop this whole process in its early stages and to redirect your thoughts in ways that suffocate negative feelings and the unhelpful or unhealthy behaviors they encourage.While CBT techniques use mental self-monitoring to identify and address problematic thought patterns, proponents of mindfulness say that simply observing the mind's inner workings can accomplish many of the same happy outcomes without the need to judge or effortfully reroute one's thoughts.""By default, most of us spend almost every waking second of our life thinking without knowing that we're thinking,"" says Sam Harris, PhD, a neuroscientist, author, podcast host, and early proponent of mindfulness meditation. ""We feel identical to our thoughts, and so we're held hostage by them.""Learning that we each have the ability to observe our own thoughts is Mindfulness 101, and a concept that Harris explores on Waking Up, his guided-meditation app. But one of the major insights that comes with practice, he says, is the realization that you and your thoughts are not one and the same. ""Once you can get out of the stream of identification with thought, even for brief moments at a time, you can cease to suffer in many of the ordinary ways,"" he says. ""It's tremendously freeing.""This concept of identity-thought decoupling goes by a lot of names, including ""ego dissolution."" And the benefits of creating some space between one's thoughts and one's identity comes up again and again in the research on mental wellness and treatment. For example, some studies - a lot of them conducted at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine - have found that psychedelic drugs may be a powerful form of treatment for depression and other mood or substance-use disorders. That work on psychedelics has identified both thought self-monitoring and ego dissolution as core components of the therapeutic experience.It's not an exaggeration to say that the cultivation of mental self-awareness - whether through CBT, mindfulness, or magic mushrooms - is now at the center of psychology's most prominent and promising therapeutic practices.But while paying attention to one's own thoughts has great potential to provide comfort and to prevent pain, that potential often goes untapped.There are countless ways to wield mental self-awareness to one's advantage. The payoffs can be truly life-changing, but they require regular practice.Even if you never make that kind of training a long-term part of your life, Brown University's Brewer says that even a taste of formal practice - for example, an introductory mindfulness course - may offer some durable insights. ""I don't know that that's the case, but I suspect it is,"" he says. ""Once we know that we can pay attention in this way, I think that helps us notice when we get stuck in these negative thought loops.""This noticing, he adds, is often enough to set one's thoughts on a different and healthier course.",,https://elemental.medium.com/why-mental-self-awareness-is-good-for-your-brain-a6edc84ab01b,mindfulness,bff995f42bc0bdd365893ef14e536a9f420c8587e78bbdc3e11405d5
Firewatch and the Dangerous Lure of Escapism,"It's now five years since Campo Santo's Firewatch was released. I remember playing through the game in its entirety across two sweltering Melbourne nights, a pedestal fan running in the corner of my room as I turned to a video game to keep me entertained while I endured the heat.Drawn in by the incredible art style - courtesy of British designer Olly Moss - I was immediately taken aback by the game's text-only opening. Where were those beautiful mountains from all of the promotional materials? It turned out, however, that Firewatch wasn't just a visual showcase (as so many games are). It wasn't even a story-focused game, necessarily. Instead, it was one of the first games I'd ever played that was truly and genuinely focused on exploring, uncovering, and revealing the human condition.Of course, the text of the prologue almost immediately begins to cut back and forth between the written past and the fully animated present. The text itself is beautifully written, tracing the budding romance and, later, the crushing pain of ordinary lives gone wrong. A subtle piano score pulls at the heartstrings, but with melancholy rather than simple joy or sadness.In text, Henry (voiced by Mad Men's Rich Sommer) and Julia's (never heard or seen) college love turns into a shared life while, in ""the game"", an unseen player character collects his things and bundles them into a truck. In text, Julia begins to suffer from dementia and its symptoms worsen while Henry struggles to deal with the changes in his wife, as in ""the game"" the character heads out of town. In text, Julia's family takes her to live with them and Henry takes a job as a lookout in the Shoshone National Forest, while in ""the game"" we approach the fire watch tower.And the rest of the game is about confronting, dealing with, and accepting everything I just recounted. At least, for Henry it is. For the player, it can be about your own regrets or the things you've failed to face up to. It could be about your own love of the outdoors, of the peace that solitude provides. It could also be about your ability to connect with people you never actually meet, represented in Henry's relationship with Delilah (voiced by BAFTA-nominated Cissy Jones), his supervisor, with whom he communicates via a walkie-talkie. On the other hand, it could be about how you use parasocial relationships to avoid the pain of your real life. All the while the fire rages on the horizon, coming ever closer.The story of Firewatch is, on the surface, about Henry's summer at the Two Forks Lookout, and the strange occurrences that he encounters and investigates with the aid of companion and guide Delilah. There's a threatening figure by the lake, some odd voice recordings, a weird laboratory, and an ominous mystery to uncover. Is it bigfoot? Is it aliens? Worst of all: could it be the government?Spoilers, of course, but no it's not any of those things. In this game, whose prologue spun a tale of gritty, real regret, it turns out that the following story is actually about... a tale of gritty, real regret. A camper and his son went spelunking, and the son - an inexperienced climber - fell to his death. The father holed up in the forest, unable to return to real life to confront his grief. And now, at the impetus of player-character Henry, this man may have to finally accept his son's death. And at the impetus of this mysterious man and the fire on the horizon, Henry might also have to finally accept the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of his wife.Of course, all of this high-falutin' narrative is wrapped inside a first-person adventure game, and involves dialogue choices, mild puzzle-solving, and a fair amount of walking around. But much like fellow indie adventure game Kentucky Route Zero, a game I consider my favourite of all time, it's not so much about the puzzles, or the dialogue choices, or even the walking around - it's about making you feel something. And like Naughty Dog's contentious sequel The Last of Us Part II, it's subverting the gamer's expectations of how a story usually plays out in order to make you feel those feelings.If it hits you right, it makes you realise that all that ""walking around"", ""solving puzzles"" and ""talking to a woman on a walkie-talkie"" wasn't really getting you anywhere at all - in Firewatch, or in life. Was the game ""tricking you"" into thinking that maybe there was a great conspiracy at play - or did Henry just want there to be? The crazy revelation at the conclusion of Firewatch is that at the end of the day, it's all just sad dudes turning to total escapism in order to avoid confronting their trauma.No, Firewatch won't be to everyone's taste. But I'm so pleased that it exists, as a testament that games can be art. I'm really sad that Campo Santo's next project, In The Valley of Gods, appears to be on permanent hold. But if it ever comes out, I hope I have a spare few nights in a stifling Melbourne Summer to sink myself back into Campo Santo's world.And the fire draws closer.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*NsTmvfWj76aUGGJP9_cSiw.jpeg,https://medium.com/super-jump/firewatch-and-the-dangerous-lure-of-escapism-9694b5ed22a9,gaming,c1d8e7010c5089299c15302e72083d99ccf809c49a2d8c87e70f47f8
Dr. Mariano Busso: Five Things You Need To Know To Succeed In The Modern Beauty Industry,"As a part of our series about ""Five Things You Need To Know To Succeed In The Modern Beauty Industry"", I had the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Mariano Busso.With over the past 20 years of experience, Acclaimed dermatologist Dr. Mariano Busso Is known as a leader in the world of cosmetic dermatology and injectables. Called on by the top pharmaceutical companies to consult on product development, protocols and technologies, Dr. Busso has become one of the most recognized experts in the industry based in Miami, Florida and Beverly Hills, California specializing in non-surgical, minimally invasive therapies that rejuvenate skin, restore youthful appearance, reduce fat, and boost confidence without scalpels and sutures.Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dive in, our readers would love to learn a bit more about you. Can you tell us a story about what brought you to this specific career path?The cosmetic field chose me more than the other way around. I was highly involved in AIDS research, co-discovering one of the drugs used for AIDS treatment, Rescriptor, drug assays and PCR tests. I had a large AIDS based dermatology practice when I graduated, and I was treating serious medical issues. Once protease inhibitors were introduced, AIDS turned from a lethal disease into a chronic condition so my patients that were expecting to die now were going to have a long life. AIDS treatments at that time produced major facial fat loss and deformity to the point that patients carried the disease on their faces. So, patients that were now going to live a long life became concerned about their cosmetic appearance. So, my practice that was fully medical turned cosmetic overnight.Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?I was asked to give a talk in a meeting where 200 of the most influential cosmetic doctors were invited. I was given only 5 minutes to speak whereas other speakers were given 30 or 60 minutes. So I began my talk by saying: ""I was told in research that when you have strong data, a five minute presentation is enough. When your data is not so strong, 30 minutes will do it. But when you have no data, 60 minutes will not be enough"". So I gave a 3 minute presentation where I introduced the technique to inject Radiesse in hands, the technique to introduce lidocaine into Radiesse and the ability to change physical properties of a filler and the Busso hand scale to measure hand volume. I earned a standing ovation from that tough crowd and those techniques caused a revolution in the cosmetic field.Are you able to identify a ""tipping point"" in your career when you started to see success? Did you start doing anything different? Are there takeaways or lessons that others can learn from that?My definition of success is based on contributions in the medical field. Although I made multiple contributions, it was my method of introducing lidocaine in Radiesse and the ability to change physical properties in fillers that gained the most recognition. The President of the Academy of Dermatology named me one of the most influential cosmetic doctors and I was asked to participate in writing the guidelines for the use of fillers for the FDA.Being creative and challenging current concepts is what I enjoy the most. Loving what you do and finding that area in your field that excites you are key.None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person to whom you are grateful who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?I was lucky that I had a mentor, a successful researcher and dermatologist, Dr Lionel Resnik. We spent hours and hours having academic discussions and certainly shaped my mind and views. Even today, 33 years later, we still have those discussions and I know that he is as proud of my accomplishments as I am grateful for his guidance. Coming from a successful physician, by sharing with me that the secret of his success was hard work, he empowered me to become successful.Ok super. Let's now shift to the main part of our discussion. The global beauty industry today has grown to more than a half a trillion dollar business. Can you tell us about the innovations that you are bringing to the industry? How do you think that will help people?The cosmetic medical market has expanded to the point that companies can financially justify making major R&D investments. In a field that used to have a major breakthrough every five years now is yearly. The focus of my research over the past years has been the field of thread lifting. One of the unspoken causes of facial aging is gravity. Unspoken because besides surgery, there are no products that reverse the effects of gravity. Thread lifting represents an alternative to surgery for repositioning facial structures affected by gravity. I developed a unique method and threads for this purpose, the BussoLyft. Awaiting publication, this technique is being taught with great acceptance in the medical community.Can you share 3 things that most excite you about the modern beauty industry?The 3 things that most excite me about the modern beauty industry currently are:Widespread Public interest. It is exciting and inspiring to work in a field that most people are interested in.Innovation. With advancements to our field happening every year, we are constantly breaking boundaries and I can't think of anything more exciting.Very fulfilling. As opposed to most fields in Medicine, patients are happy to see us and be in our office. Patients see us are their allied that will help them navigate through the different cosmetic choices and are eager to start the journey.Can you share 3 things that most concern you about the industry? If you had the ability to implement 3 ways to improve the industry, what would you suggest?I'd have to say that the 3 things I'm most concerned about within the Beauty Industry are:Lack of standardization. The field needs standards. Today, each doctor has a different approach to cosmetics yielding different outcomes. The best outcome should become the gold standard approach.Lack of peer review. Too much information is being disseminated without proper peer review or evidence. In the long run, this can discredit our field.Safety vs Efficacy. Still many patients are making decisions based on outcomes whereas safety should always be the most important consideration.You are an expert about beauty. Can you share a few ideas that anyone can use ""to feel beautiful""?When someone is having a cosmetic emergency and needs to look fabulous asap, we recommend our ""Red Carpet Preparation"". It consists of an at home exfoliation followed by a CO2 mask. It will eliminate most wrinkles, give a glow that people will comment and will last for at least one week.Here is the main question for our discussion. Based on your experience and success, Can you please share ""Five Things You Need To Know To Succeed In The Modern Beauty Industry"". Please share a story or an example, for each.Be curious. Most innovation that affects our field is being introduced from different areas and countries. It is important to stay aware of what's happening. I find myself constantly reading and researching. It's the only way to stay at the top of your field.Follow the scientific method. In order to discern between so much information and select fact from fad, evidence-based recommendations are vital.Trial period. Before stamping your name on a new product or procedure, take your time to learn about it and experiment with it. The trust of our patients is all we have, and we can never lose it.Do not be afraid to fail. We learn when it hurts so mistakes and side effects are incredible learning opportunities and signs that something needs to be changed.Listen to your patients. Follow social media to know what patients are looking for and adapt, quickly. Different groups have different priorities, Baby boomers are fading but are still here, Gen X have major cosmetic needs, Millennials are concerned about looking good in their social media posts and Gen Z are coming out of acne and their sequelae.You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)Sometimes we need to reestablish the balance between our inner and outer beauty images. However, it is our inner beauty what differentiates us, we are all beautiful. I wished that message was louder.Can you please give us your favorite ""Life Lesson Quote""? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?Failure is the first step of success.

"A Transparent Look at My Writing System That Produces 1,000,000+ Words per Year","Here's a wild thought: Whiskey, pasta, bread, beer, and cereal all require just two ingredients - wheat and water - but the outcome is completely different.How is this possible?How can two simple ingredients create such a wide range of delicious products?The answer in a word: process.Identity precedes action. To get what you want in life, choose what you wish to be, then determine the process that will get you there every single time.As a full-time author, filmmaker, and blogger, I write over one million words per year. My workspace, tools, habits, and schedule are by no means perfect, but they're all part of a process that works well for me. Each piece in the puzzle supports my mission, goal, and identity. Hopefully, parts of my system spark ideas that will work well for you.I never sit to write. I had a neck accident when I was 19, and sitting at a laptop for more than 10 minutes destroys my neck, shoulder, and back. I've been forced to get creative: I spend half my workday standing and half my workday lying down.The photo at the top is my morning writing setup. As you can see, I don't own a standing desk, because our centuries-old Victorian house has a very handy built-in shelf above an old fireplace.Most people probably prefer a cleaner and more minimalist workspace, but there's something about a rugged stone wall and a messy stack of books that inspires me to contribute something to the canon of literature. (See if you can spot the pile of commonplace notebooks that I use for generating ideas.)People have too many tools. Slack, Trello, Outlook, Google Calendar, Mailchimp, the latest iPhone... the list goes on forever.Writers don't need any of it. Nevermind Instagram, I don't even own a phone.Never forget that all the greatest works in history were written in ink on parchment.My writing business requires just five tools:Inspired by Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, I wear the exact same outfit - white t-shirt, organic fair trade hoodie, blue jeans, black Vans shoes with custom in-soles - six days per week. I don't want to suffer from choice fatigue, and deciding what to wear every morning is a totally unnecessary waste of brainpower. I want my first conscious decision of the day to be directed at my most creative task.I don't want to contribute to the primary demand for conflict minerals and child-mined rare earth elements, nor do I want to enrich offshore multinationals like Apple, so I do all my writing on a six-year-old laptop that I bought secondhand.If you want to ruin your neck and suffer a lifetime of frozen shoulder joints, write one million words per year on a laptop. If you want to maintain some semblance of posture, open up your stance with a split keyboard. By putting 12-36 inches between your hands, you un-pinch your shoulder joints, relax your back, and un-freeze your neck. Welcome to ergonomics 2.0.(Don't worry: it takes less than a minute for your brain to re-adjust to typing a bit further apart. I was surprised how quickly I adapted, and how quickly my shoulders healed.)Your head weighs around 18 pounds. When you tilt it down and jut it forward to stare at a laptop screen, it's the equivalent of putting a toddler on your neck - introducing the Nexstand.It's lightweight, foldable, safe, and pro-posture. Plus, elevating your laptop increases airflow and keeps your hard drive cool. I never travel without mine.Warning: If you use this in a coffee shop, you will have a dozen excited people strike up conversations and ask to take photos of your workstation. Pair it with your new split keyboard and you can start handing out business cards.By the time lunch rolls around, I'm tired of standing and my feet are ready for a break. Rather than sitting and destroying my neck, I hop on the couch and throw on a pair of periscope glasses. They're easily the nerdiest item I own, and probably the best $12 I've ever spent. Now, I can write all afternoon without cranking my spine.And that's it - five things.Tools don't make you more creative. If anything, they make you less creative because they create distractions and put space between your hand and mind.I have five core habits that sustain my writing career: walking, writing, reading, and thinking. I honestly don't think I could publish books, direct films, or produce articles without all five.Right after I brush my teeth, it's out the door for a 15-20 minute walk by the river. On Tuesdays, I stop by the local farmer's market. My loop takes me through a dog park, along the river, past an 800-year-old flour mill, a very busy duck pond, the ruins of a 900-year-old monastery, and a centuries-old graveyard. I typically chat with several neighbors, get fresh air, and loosen up my body for the long workday ahead.This is obviously the core habit. I've met so many would-be authors on my book tours who've told me they want to be writers, but they write less than once a week. I always encourage them to write every day. If I go two days without writing, I feel the rigor mortis setting in. I'd rather wear out than rust out.We purposely don't have TV, Netflix, or any of the other streamers, which makes it a lot easier to devour books by the foot and consume huge volumes of articles. As Stephen King says:At the end of every day, my wife and I go for a 45-50 minute night walk through the hills. The elevation gets our heart rate pumping and the conversation often leads to dozens of ideas for new articles and stories to tell.We're extremely intentional about our day off. I teach Sunday school to teenagers (via Zoom), then we go for a woodland hike, then read all afternoon by the fire in our Sabbath pajamas. After cooking and eating supper, I typically watch a film with the director's commentary on, then turn off all the lights and stare at the fire for as long as reasonably possible. This helps clear my head of the week past and gets me pumped for the week ahead.If you're like me, you have this idea in your head of the perfect schedule, the ideal writing day, the exact time structure that will magically help you produce huge amounts of highly creative, wildly popular, and critically-acclaimed world-class work.Talk about a fantasy.I try to maintain this schedule Monday to Saturday... ish.I don't believe in fixed-hour scheduling. I'm not in the military. I'm not a monk. I don't work in a factory.Discipline is great, but it's also subject to the law of diminishing returns. Life is just too dynamic to schedule with Marine-like precision, especially if you're a creative. Free yourself from the tyranny of ""only people who wake up at 5 a.m. can be wildly successful.""Fixed-order scheduling beats fixed-hour scheduling any day of the week.Think about it: The early bird who works 6 a.m. - 6 p.m. and the night owl who works noon 'til midnight still each put in twelve hours a day. To force either person onto the opposite schedule would drastically decrease their effectiveness and productivity.All hours are not created equal. It depends on your sleep drive and chronotype. So know yourself. Unapologetically get all the sleep you need, when you need it, every single night, then do your best work at the best time in your best state.Better the imperfect system that works than the perfect system that doesn't. You have to do what works for you.So there it is - the workspace, tools, habits, and schedule that helps me produce over one million words per year.Nevermind copying my process to the letter. I just hope it's a setup that gives you inspiration so your own writing can flourish (or kickstarts you into gear if you've been putting it off.) Anyone can put on the identity of a writer if they learn the craft and stick to a proven process that works for them.Do that, and you'll start to produce your very best work.I can't wait to read it.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10944/1*tgUtUBRlgTCUSf4G2maU-Q.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/a-transparent-look-at-my-writing-system-that-produces-1-000-000-words-per-year-c2a99d37a3db,marketing,c4af7b7f1bd2fd6842aada14fcabbbae326ed12aadd91e9c59c967c6
Physiological Control Centre Of the Brain-Hypothalamus; Explained,"Image: Diencephalon | Public DomianIntroduction:The hypothalamus (from Ancient Greek ὑπό, ""under"", and θάλαμος, ""chamber"") is a portion of the brain that contains several small nuclei with a variety of functions. One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus is located below the thalamus and is part of the limbic system. In the terminology of neuroanatomy, it forms the ventral part of the diencephalon. All vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus. In humans, it is the size of an almond.The hypothalamus is responsible for the regulation of certain metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic nervous system. It synthesizes and secretes certain neurohormones, called releasing hormones or hypothalamic hormones, and these, in turn, stimulate or inhibit the secretion of hormones from the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus controls body temperature, hunger, important aspects of parenting and attachment behaviors, thirst, fatigue, sleep, and circadian rhythms.Image: Hypothalamus location. | By Bruce Blaus ( Medical Gallery of Blausen medical 2014)• CC BY 3.0The hypothalamus is divided into 3 regions (supraoptic, tuberal, mammillary) in a parasagittal plane, indicating location anterior-posterior; and 3 areas (periventricular, medial, lateral) in the coronal plane, indicating location medial-lateral. Hypothalamic nuclei are located within these specific regions and areas. It is found in all vertebrate nervous systems. In mammals, magnocellular neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus produce neurohypophysial hormones, oxytocin, and vasopressin. These hormones are released into the blood in the posterior pituitary. Much smaller parvocellular neurosecretory cells, neurons of the paraventricular nucleus, release corticotropin-releasing hormone and other hormones into the hypophyseal portal system, where these hormones diffuse to the anterior pituitary.The hypothalamic nuclei include the following:The hypothalamus is highly interconnected with other parts of the central nervous system, in particular the brainstem and its reticular formation. As part of the limbic system, it has connections to other limbic structures including the amygdala and septum, and is also connected with areas of the autonomous nervous system.The hypothalamus receives many inputs from the brainstem, the most notable from the nucleus of the solitary tract, the locus coeruleus, and the ventrolateral medulla.Most nerve fibers within the hypothalamus run in two ways (bidirectional).Several hypothalamic nuclei are sexually dimorphic; i.e., there are clear differences in both structure and function between males and females. Some differences are apparent even in gross neuroanatomy: most notable is the sexually dimorphic nucleus within the preoptic area, in which the differences are subtle changes in the connectivity and chemical sensitivity of particular sets of neurons. The importance of these changes can be recognized by functional differences between males and females. For instance, males of most species prefer the odor and appearance of females over males, which is instrumental in stimulating male sexual behavior. If the sexually dimorphic nucleus is lesioned, this preference for females by males diminishes. Also, the pattern of secretion of growth hormone is sexually dimorphic; this is why in many species, adult males are visibly distinguishable from females.Other striking functional dimorphisms are in the behavioral responses to ovarian steroids of the adult. Males and females respond to ovarian steroids in different ways, partly because the expression of estrogen-sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus is sexually dimorphic; i.e., estrogen receptors are expressed in different sets of neurons.Estrogen and progesterone can influence gene expression in particular neurons or induce changes in cell membrane potential and kinase activation, leading to diverse non-genomic cellular functions. Estrogen and progesterone bind to their cognate nuclear hormone receptors, which translocate to the cell nucleus and interact with regions of DNA known as hormone response elements (HREs) or get tethered to another transcription factor's binding site. Estrogen receptor (ER) has been shown to transactivate other transcription factors in this manner, despite the absence of an estrogen response element (ERE) in the proximal promoter region of the gene. In general, ERs and progesterone receptors (PRs) are gene activators, with increased mRNA and subsequent protein synthesis following hormone exposure.Male and female brains differ in the distribution of estrogen receptors, and this difference is an irreversible consequence of neonatal steroid exposure. Estrogen receptors (and progesterone receptors) are found mainly in neurons in the anterior and mediobasal hypothalamus, notably:In neonatal life, gonadal steroids influence the development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. For instance, they determine the ability of females to exhibit a normal reproductive cycle, and of males and females to display appropriate reproductive behaviors in adult life.In primates, the developmental influence of androgens is less clear, and the consequences are less understood. Within the brain, testosterone is aromatized (to estradiol), which is the principal active hormone for developmental influences. The human testis secretes high levels of testosterone from about week 8 of fetal life until 5 - 6 months after birth (a similar perinatal surge in testosterone is observed in many species), a process that appears to underlie the male phenotype. Estrogen from the maternal circulation is relatively ineffective, partly because of the high circulating levels of steroid-binding proteins in pregnancy.Sex steroids are not the only important influences upon hypothalamic development; in particular, pre-pubertal stress in early life (of rats) determines the capacity of the adult hypothalamus to respond to an acute stressor. Unlike gonadal steroid receptors, glucocorticoid receptors are very widespread throughout the brain; in the paraventricular nucleus, they mediate negative feedback control of CRF synthesis and secretion, but elsewhere their role is not well understood.Image: List of the hormones found in the endocrine glandes on the nervous system. | By Lady of Hats • Public domainThe hypothalamus has a central neuroendocrine function, most notably by its control of the anterior pituitary, which in turn regulates various endocrine glands and organs. Releasing hormones (also called releasing factors) are produced in hypothalamic nuclei then transported along axons to either the median eminence or the posterior pituitary, where they are stored and released as needed.Anterior pituitary:In the hypothalamic - adenohypophyseal axis, releasing hormones, also known as hypophysiotropic or hypothalamic hormones, are released from the median eminence, a prolongation of the hypothalamus, into the hypophyseal portal system, which carries them to the anterior pituitary where they exert their regulatory functions on the secretion of adenohypophyseal hormones. Following hormones are released by the anterior pituitary:Other hormones secreted from the median eminence include vasopressin, oxytocin, and neurotensin.Posterior pituitary:In the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal axis, neurohypophysial hormones are released from the posterior pituitary, which is a prolongation of the hypothalamus, into the circulation. Following hormones are secreted by the posterior pituitary:It is also known that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) hormones are related to certain skin diseases and skin homeostasis. There is evidence linking hyperactivity of HPA hormones to stress-related skin diseases and skin tumors.The hypothalamus coordinates many hormonal and behavioral circadian rhythms, complex patterns of neuroendocrine outputs, complex homeostatic mechanisms, and important behaviors. The hypothalamus must, therefore, respond to many different signals, some of which are generated externally and some internally. Delta wave signaling arising either in the thalamus or in the cortex influences the secretion of releasing hormones; GHRH and prolactin are stimulated whilst TRH is inhibited.The hypothalamus is responsive to:The medial zone of the hypothalamus is part of a circuitry that controls motivated behaviors, like defensive behaviors. Analyses of Fos-labeling showed that a series of nuclei in the ""behavioral control column"" is important in regulating the expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors.Antipredatory Defensive Behaviour:Exposure to a predator (such as a cat) elicits defensive behaviors in laboratory rodents, even when the animal has never been exposed to a cat. In the hypothalamus, this exposure causes an increase in Fos-labeled cells in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial nucleus, and in the ventrolateral part of the premammillary nucleus (PMDvl). The premammillary nucleus has an important role in the expression of defensive behaviors towards a predator, since lesions in this nucleus abolish defensive behaviors, like freezing and flight. The PMD does not modulate defensive behavior in other situations, as lesions of this nucleus had minimal effects on post-shock freezing scores. The PMD has important connections to the dorsal periaqueductal gray, an important structure in fear expression. Besides, animals display risk assessment behaviors to the environment previously associated with the cat. Fos-labeled cell analysis showed that the PMDvl is the most activated structure in the hypothalamus, and inactivation with muscimol before exposure to the context abolishes the defensive behavior. Therefore, the hypothalamus, mainly the PMDvl, has an important role in the expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors to a predator.Social Defeat:Likewise, the hypothalamus has a role in social defeat: Nuclei in the medial zone are also mobilized during an encounter with an aggressive conspecific. The defeated animal has an increase in Fos levels in sexually dimorphic structures, such as the medial pre-optic nucleus, the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus, and the ventral premaxillary nucleus. Such structures are important in other social behaviors, such as sexual and aggressive behaviors. Moreover, the premammillary nucleus also is mobilized, the dorsomedial part but not the ventrolateral part. Lesions in this nucleus abolish passive defensive behavior, like freezing and the ""on-the-back"" posture.",https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Q50-ci6PY2gq0YxjEAyKiw@2x.jpeg,https://medium.com/neuro-science/physiological-control-centre-of-the-brain-hypothalamus-explained-79040cc7b72,neuroscience,c4b39c37df26f387611a38bbe6db1e2ea5effb5d4d22a49ad9f0080c
A Simple Daily Habit to Light Up Your Bliss Matrix,"In his twilight years, Charles Darwin looked back on his life with a big regret. He recognized one simple habit would have made him a whole lot happier, every day. He was right about this, as has been proven recently by neuroscience research.What's the habit that Darwin missed out on? It's not meditation, nor healthy eating, nor exercise. It's a habit that's beyond the trend-radar of most of today's self-improvement writers.Charles Darwin wished he'd read more poetry.""If I had to live my life again,"" Darwin wrote, ""I would have made a rule to read some poetry... at least once every week.""Darwin felt his failure to read poetry led to a ""curious and lamentable loss of [his] higher aesthetic tastes."" He believed the lack of poetry in his life had fundamentally altered his brain and numbed his emotional life. He felt sure he would have experienced a higher baseline of happiness had he spent more time with poetry. Darwin reflected:Darwin's instinct that poetry alters your brain and leads to happiness has now been proven by neuroscientists. Darwin was right. Poetry, neuroscience shows, hacks into your brain and lights up your bliss circuits. Reading poetry, the research shows, gives you tingles and leads to feelings of happiness.Professor Adam Zeman, a cognitive neurologist, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology to look inside people's brains as they read poetry. Professor Zeman found that poetry lights up similar regions in the brain as music does, and creates a ""shivers down the spine"" reaction.More recent research published in 2017 found that poetry is particularly powerful at eliciting an emotional response, and triggers this response in a different way to music. ""[P]oetry is able to trigger not only mild affective responses but also the most intense ones,"" the lead researcher Dr. Eugen Wassiliwizky wrote. Poetry, the researchers found, literally creates goosebumps.Dr. Wassiliwizky's team also tested whether poetry that's new to the listener can elicit these chills, or whether the emotional response is due to familiarity with the poem. They found it makes no difference. All poetry has the power to push your brain into bliss. ""Not only did the self-selected (highly familiar) stimuli elicit chills and goosebumps, but also the experimenter-selected, unfamiliar subset,"" Dr. Wassiliwizky et al. said.There is one factor that makes a difference: whether you finish the poem. The researchers found that the strongest goosebumps arise at the end of a piece of poetry.If you want to give yourself happy feelings, this is good news. You can adjust the dials of your brain's neurochemistry to unlock feelings of bliss. Anytime you want. It doesn't take hours of meditation or the use of psychedelics. It can be as simple as reading a few lines in a poetry book.No wonder Darwin wished he'd spent more time with poetry.Carrying a book of poetry in your pocket gives you instant access to bliss. That's a pretty cool thing to have. And I've found there are other benefits too.As a writer and creative, I've discovered plenty of other ways poetry improves my life. In my experience, poetry:I've experienced these benefits for over a decade now. But there was a long time when I wasn't into poetry. For years of my life, I struggled to understand the point of poems. I found poetry difficult to understand, and I didn't get why people would read it.It's only when I found poets that make sense to me that I started to love poems.Poetry isn't a single genre. It's like music or fiction. There are all kinds of poetry, and it takes time to develop your tastes and find what you enjoy.The good news is that exploring poetry can be relatively quick. Set aside just one hour, and you'll get through 30 or 40 poems, which is plenty to start honing your tastes.Or you can give a couple of minutes each day for a month, reading one poem each day. It's a habit that's easy to build because it takes such little time.Here's what I recommend if you want to try out poetry.You can also carry poems in your pocket using a mobile poetry app. One that I like is PoemHunter, which features over 1.4 million poems. It's available for iOS and Android.My favorite way to read poetry is in an old-school hardback book. If you're new to poetry, I recommend getting a taste for poems online before splashing out on a book. Though if you're nostalgic for paper books (like me), then a compilation is a good place to start.The key is to start somewhere. Check out lots of different poets and poems. When you feel a poem lighting up the pleasure centers of your brain, search for more by that poet. Poetry is a journey, so dive in and enjoy the ride.Happiness is much closer than we think, hovering just below the surface of life. Happiness is simple to find. But we forget to look for it - or we don't know where to look.Poetry is an easy place to find happiness, and it's proven by neuroscience to light up the bliss circuits in your brain.So, don't be like Darwin. Don't live with the regret that you never gave poetry the time it deserves. Start reading poetry today, and see where it takes you. Reading poetry isn't a path to happiness. It's the path of happiness. Every step is a moment of joy. Enjoy the journey!We're offering a free course to all of our new subscribers as a thank you for your continued support.

On the Correspondence between Mathematics and Physics,"John Karpinsky May 24, 2020There is an ongoing question in Physics as to why Mathematics describes the physical universe so effectively. Mathematicians are mystified as well. This paper is an attempt to show an approach that might illuminate this relationship and enable progress toward some answers to this question.DefinitionsIn order talk about this subject, We need some new words to describe Mathematics. The problem with most presently defined words is that they assume a tangible substance to intangible entities. Each of these words defines intangible corollaries to tangible entities.The words and their corollaries are:Inistence - -> ExistenceInist - - - → ExistInistent - → ExistentI think the definitions of these words are almost self evident from their corollaries, but I will try to define them anyway.Inistence: (noun) the fact of not having objective or physical reality or energyInist: (verb) have a non-objective reality; unable to be touched or grasped; not having physical presence or energy; not constituting a physical objectInistent: (adjective) not having physical reality or energyI am sure that these definitions can be improved on, but they are a starting point. As we can see, we have a noun, a verb, and an adjective. The substitution of (In) for (Ex) makes the analogy that I think is appropriate. Internal vs External makes sense to me.InistenceNumbers do not exist. They inist. Inistence is parallel to existence and linked in an intimate way. The world of inistence is in the world of information. Information is constituted of the structure of physical things, numbers, numerical relationships, thoughts, algorithms, ideas, and abstractions. The structure of physical things is separate from the physical things themselves. I don't know what links existence and inistence but the hypothesis of this paper is that inistence is formative of the world of existence. Anything that exists follows the rules of inistence. There is no space or time in inistence. It could be a zero dimensional entity, or it could be an n-dimensional entity. The fundamental characteristic of inistence is that it is logically consistent, just as we try to make mathematics logically consistent. I believe that when developments are made in the study of mathematics, they are discoveries of the inistent reality rather than inventions that create a new inistent reality. This makes our existent world operate in a logically consistent manner. That is why mathematics often times describes existent reality or the Universe. There is much mathematics that has no known correspondence to anything physical. The main characteristic of that type of mathematics is that the mathematician tries to make it logically consistent. It could correspond to something physical that has not been discovered yet. It has happened many times that mathematical structures discovered by a mathematician are found to describe something physical much later.There will be difficulty in finding words to describe this relationship because our languages are developed for describing existence rather than inistence. There will be times when a word that is used for the discussion of inistence that belongs to the realm of existence. No doubt that in time, we will coin new words for this newly defined realm.Forms of Inistent EntitiesNumbers are the atoms of Mathematics. Mathematics is the relationship between numbers. It is also the relationship between other abstract entities. Symbols are the atoms of language, and language is also inistent. Other forms of inistence are ideas, thoughts, algorithms and other abstractions. This is not a complete list.There are different characteristics of these inistent entities. This will develop as we discover how inistence is organized. For instance, Mathematics, as I have defined it, may be causative in the existent world. That is the subject of this inquiry. But thoughts that are created by a thinker, and are not necessarily causative, but we must be open to this possibility.MathematicsI use upper case for Mathematics because I want to distinguish the inistent entity from the study of mathematics using symbols. Mathematics controls how the physical world operates. What I mean by Mathematics are not the symbols by which we describe mathematics, but the underlying principles and operations that are being described. We may need a new word for Mathematics, but I will use that word until I figure out a better word. Just as a word is not the entity that it names, a mathematical symbol is not the underlying principle. Mathematics just inists and has no time or place. As far as we can tell, it is eternal and unchanging. That is why Pythagorus and others thought Mathematics was spiritual.AbstractionsAbstractions, on the other hand often are created to describe something in the physical world. We don't know if they are causative, but they help us make sense of existence and inistence. As far as I can tell, all the inistent categories are either Mathematical or Abstractions. Ideas, thoughts and algorithms are all part of the abstraction category. Even when we do mathematics, we are doing it in abstractions. Mathematics is eternal and unchanging, and Abstractions are affected by the existent Universes. But why are Abstractions and Mathematics both included in inistence? It is because neither of them have energy. That is what puts them out of existence and into inistence. The laws of Physics are abstractions of the Mathematics that controls the existent realm. I did not include mass in the definitions because that would be redundant. Einstein discovered that and developed his famous equation: E = MC².So what?Why does this even matter? If we are trying to explore how Mathematics controls existence, we need to have a set of concepts that clarifies the different categories. So far, I have included in inistence all that has no energy, but has a definite effect on our universe, or is affected by our Universe. So that seems to be the defining difference.Information TheorySo how can we approach the problem of finding out why Mathematics has such profound consequences in the Universe? One way to start is to identify the areas where Physics meets inistence. One such area is in Information Theory. One of the successes of Information Theory has been discovering the limits of the transmission of information from one place to another depending on signal strength and noise in a transmission system. I don't know if this avenue of inquiry will be useful, but it might. The information that is transmitted has no energy, but the signal that carries the information does.Black HolesSome Physicists have the idea that information cannot be destroyed. This is a central question in the study of black holes. Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorn had a famous bet with John Preskill on that very subject. Stephen and Kip said that information could be destroyed, and John said that information could not be destroyed. I am not an expert on that, and I don't know what is true. Hawking, famously, conceded that John was right and he was wrong, and paid off the bet. But, if information cannot be destroyed, that would be consistent with the idea that information and inistence is eternal and unchanging. This could be true, but that implies that all information inists always. This is consistent with the concept of 4-dimensional spacetime and General Relativity. I think that the confusion caused by not having a clear distinction between inistent entities and existent entities could be a reason why this problem has been so difficult to solve.For instance, when something physical falls into a black hole, it carries information into the hole with it. Is that information destroyed? Also, the form of that information could be important. If it is one atom, the information is in the form of the structure of that atom, such as, the mass, the spin of the nucleus, the spin of the electrons, etc. If a book falls into a black hole, the information is not only the structure of the atoms and molecules of the book, but the information encoded in the words and sentences of the book. Is that information destroyed? Are these two types of information the same, or do we need another distinction between these forms of information? They are both without energy, but one was created with the big bang and the other was created by a thinker.We seem to have two forms of information, but both are without energy. When it comes to the information that falls into a black hole, it makes sense that the structure of the atoms, electrons, and photons is conserved. They are wave functions, and wave functions are never destroyed. However, the information on the structure of the object that falls into the black hole is more problematic. It could be that, because the object is probably destroyed by the tidal forces at the event horizon of the black hole, information on such structures is destroyed, even though the structure of the particles that make up the macroscopic object is conserved. Also, if a book falls into a black hole, the structure of the book will also be destroyed, and any information written in the book will also be destroyed. This is comparable to the information that we transmit from one place to another here on earth with electromagnetic waves that can get destroyed when the signal to noise ratio becomes less than one. Another way to say it is that the information theory dealing with electromagnetic wave transmission is different than the information contained in a quantum particle/wave. The failure to separate these types of information from one another may be causing some confusion.So, if I am right, There are two types of information. The information in a wave function is never destroyed. But the information created by the assembly of wave functions into macroscopic things can be destroyed, and is destroyed by that object falling into a black hole. But one does not need to go to a black hole. A book falling into a fire will have both the information contained in the book and the structure of the book destroyed.Two Types of informationSo, what is the fundamental difference between these two types of information? Things made by the activity of a wave function cannot be destroyed because of the conservation of energy. They can only be transformed by an interaction with another wave function. But the energy is conserved, and thus the wave function is conserved, even if it is manifesting differently because of the interaction.But for macroscopic structures, there is no separate wave function. The structures are formed by the interactions of the wave functions that make up the Universe. The information into how these structures are configured has no separate wave function. These structures are very fragile, and are often changing. In electromagnetic signals, the signal is easily overcome by noise, and great care must be taken to get a signal from one place to another. Because the information in the signal, and the information in the structure of a macroscopic object does not have a separate wave function and has no energy. So, my hypothesis is that any information with no energy is destroyed when the object carrying that information falls into a blackhole. Only the wave functions are conserved. And since the tidal forces at the event horizon are extreme, the objects themselves will be spaghettified. So, it is not surprising that information in the structure of the object is not conserved. Even stars falling into a black hole are spaghettified. No information on how that star was structured is conserved. Only the wave functions of the constituents of the star are conserved.IdeasIdeas also are in the inistent realm and have no energy, but when put or discovered in the right hands, changes something in the existent realm. This is relevant whether the idea is to go to the grocery store, or an idea a physicist has for a new theory. All of our thoughts or feelings are inistent. The idea that inistence is eternal has some disturbing consequences for the concept of predestination, because it implies that predestination is true. Every idea or feeling or thought must happen because it is present in spacetime. So our ideas always inist if this is true. This has always been an implication in 4-D spacetime, and General Relativity. But, as pointed out before, inistence has no time or place, but is dimensionless. Maybe it is really 4 dimensional. This is another area to explore in trying to understand inistence. It may be that discovering inistence dimensional properties could be a key to finding out how the existent Universe is connected to inistence.Quantum MechanicsThe development of quantum theory was a major advance in our understanding of the physical world. Quantum theory was developed with contributions from many scientists all during the 20th century. Irwin Schrodinger made major advances in the development of quantum theory. He developed a Mathematical structure called the Schrodinger equation. It uses a mathematical entity called a ""wave function"". The all physical systems have a unique wave function which describes how particles will behave and interact through space and time. These physical systems can be very large such as the whole universe or very small such as an electron or atom. A scientist defines the physical system and uses wave functions to describe it. One could think that the wave function is the inistent entity behind the existent physical structure. I like that concept very much because there is one to one correspondence between the inistent reality and the existent reality. Remember that the symbols used to do Mathematics are not the inistent thing itself but represent the inistent thing. I think that we have the smoking gun here that shows a link between the inistent and the existent. How the inistent entity representing the wave function creates the physical structure is still a total mystery, but at least we now have a clue. But it would explain much about the link between inistence and existence. It starts with the Mathematical entity creating the physical entity. From that, we can see that it is necessary that the physical entities must follow or obey the Mathematical structures.To illustrate that the symbols representing the Mathematical structures are not the thing itself, Werner Heisenberg expressed the same thing as the Schrodinger equation using matrices. It is possible the describe the same Mathematical structure using different methods and symbols. It is just that using the Schrodinger equation's wave function correspondence to the physical system is easier to comprehend.ConclusionThis is just the beginning of the exploration of inistence. We need to find out how the Mathematical wave functions create the physical universe. It looks like this just pushes the mystery of how Mathematics controls the laws of physics up one level to how how Mathematical wave functions create our universe. But it does explain why Mathematics dictates the behavior of the existent universe. If the inistent-existent correspondence hypothesis is correct, the ability to use mathematics to understand and control physical systems follows directly. Defining inistence should clarify the difference between Mathematical entities and the symbols describing them. It should allow us to discuss these things with more clarity. This should help us solve the mathematical mystery by giving us a language that does not muddy the scientific waters.References[1] Hamming, R. W. (1980).

Artificial Intelligence is invisible and everywhere,"Unless you're a technophobe, most of us are consumers of AI products today- whether we like it or not. Those who have embraced AI technologies are likely to wake up talking to their Smart Assistant (e.g. Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri) who greets us with the latest weather or daily news, have Google app read an article while preparing breakfast, be interrupted by your Smart Home console after detecting that your neighbor is at your front door, or after having one too many drinks in the evening - crawling into a Tesla with AutoPilot to drive back home (note: absolutely not recommended). Most of the population, however, are likely to be unaware of the ""invisible"" AI technologies that prevents email spam, the digital butler that recommends products as we shop online, facial recognition deployed in various states and cities, or the various algorithms that determine our insurance or credit risk. Whichever category you fall in, AI and its underlying technologies, are already here and everywhere.Growing up as a geek in Silicon Valley and consuming lots of sci-fi movies, I became enamored with the vision of machines that can learn and demonstrate intelligence or Artificial Intelligence (AI). Fast forward several years beyond the decades of AI Winters when any reference to ""AI"" was a liability, I felt like I woke up in an AI renaissance. Among the tell-tale signs was the announcement of the Nobel Awards of Computer Science, the Turing Award ""won by 3 pioneers in AI."" Over the past decade, several branches of AI evolved such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Understanding, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. In fact, you're likely to find all of these AI and STEM disciplines applied to Tesla's electric vehicle platform which can be gleaned from a summary of AutoPilotAI which serves as a recruitment page with one question to applicants: ""What exceptional work have you done in software, hardware or AI?""Other popular applications of AI include Smart Assistants (e.g. Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri) whose products have brought AI consciousness to our mobile phones and homes. There are other less known use cases such as DeepMind beating professional gamers of Go and Chess and accurately modeling the structure of proteins which could lead to significantly reduced time to produce life-saving drugs.You may be asking, ""that's all well and good, but how can our company take advantage of AI?"" The good news is that many of these AI technologies are within reach of much smaller companies thanks to dozens of open-source AI projects and pricing models based on consumption. As these AI Research labs drive the pace of innovation, Google's DeepMind and Tesla / Microsoft's OpenAI continue to publish 100s of papers that benefit the entire ecosystem.This further motivated me to embark on a personal journey to learn more about AI technologies with a mission to drive competitive advantage for our small startup with a handful of engineers in our analytics team. I hope this blog and the dozens of links to other articles spark interest with other business leaders to take a similar journey, so that we may share experiences - and more importantly, plug into the fast evolving AI ecosystem (note: 2 of the AI Turing Awards recipients spent much of their time in Canada hence the Canadian AI ecosystem is pictured below).As we embarked on our journey several years ago, we started with a couple of pilot projects building our own AI-enabled apps using Machine Learning such as Natural Language Understanding to enhance chatbot conversations and streamline user registration by feeding camera images to Vision AI. On a personal note, I thought my computer science background would enable me to lead my team beyond bolt-on applications. However, I soon realized that I had vastly underestimated the scope of the opportunities. Anyone who has taken a similar journey would have discovered that AI combines the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and many more including: statistics and data science. In short, I discovered we had just scratched the surface of the iceberg and the AI opportunities that lay underneath was so immense that it was a struggle just figuring out where to start. The good news is that we made the right decision several years ago to focus on a key ingredient to AI - data. Because, there is no AI without data, this gave us further momentum towards a data first strategy and culture.First of all, I'm not aware of any Introduction to AI or course outline with zero pre-requisite courses. In short, the AI journey is as short or long as you're willing to invest - both time, money, and brainpower. It's a marathon without a finish line. However, if you've read this far, you're likely to be interested in how your company (or you personally) can leverage the AI opportunity. It's a cost vs benefit analysis which continues to be a positive benefit-cost ratio for us which contributed to our leadership position in markets despite larger competitors.Years ago, our progressive CEO spent some time at Singularity University, an event that sparked our AI journey. He later sent our entire executive team to attend a similar program aimed at Achieving 10x Growth by leveraging rapidly accelerating technologies. In addition to being mostly entrepreneurs and technologists used to taking risks, having an executive team with a digital first mindset enabled me to take the first steps towards building our analytics team. I also benefited from a data science executive education program which contributed to my appreciation of Statistics and the science of data. This program included sessions with Data Scientists from global AI champions such as Facebook, Uber, Citibank, AirBnB, Netflix, Singtel. Some of these companies even hosted visits to their HQ in Silicon Valley to meet with their data science teams. Our startup could not match the investment in talent that these companies have spent over several years, but it gave us a peek into the AI opportunity with the diversity of applications from various industries.What is the difference between AI, ML, and Deep Learning? How do I apply it in my business context? These are likely to be questions that we all want answered. Below is a diagram from Singularity University since it provides a high-level concept of the 3-phase AI cycle and simplest answer to the question: How does AI work?1. Perceive Environment - this starts with collecting data as diverse as transactional data from IT systems or IoT devices, video stream, recording of human voices, or digitized images of MRIs or X-Rays2. Detect Patterns - given a hypothesis or business problem, use data to identify patterns using various AI algorithms3. Learn from patterns - update experiential memory and repeat the cycleWhile data is critical to the AI cycle, the first question that needs to be answered is ""what problem are we trying to solve?"" I'll use an example that's foremost in everybody's mind since it has to do with our health. Some of us may have paid a visit to our doctor with a lingering question - ""do I have cancer?"" For the past several years, research labs, doctors, and radiologists at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) have been utilizing AI to improve cancer diagnostics and concluded that AI can spot subtle patterns that can easily be missed by humans. In the example below, it may be a pattern invisible to the human eye that an AI system can be trained to detect (see left diagram). This was compared to a scan of the same patient 4 years later (right diagram) showing an early stage cancer. This AI system called FocalNet has been trained to detect other patterns such as prostate cancer and was also intelligent enough to predict its aggressiveness.And the most amazing thing is that there's virtually no limit to its ability to learn as it is fed more data and computing power. Having said this, I should emphasize that current AI tools are designed to enable humans make better decisions such as the case of doctors and radiologists above, while the most advanced are autonomous such as full self-driving vehicles. If you're still not convinced of the AI opportunity, then I recommend you research the value and impact of AI across industries (e.g. Applications and value of deep learning by industry sector, McKinsey 2018).As a small business, the problems are more commercial-driven than the life-saving or industry-wide goals exemplified by the deep science problems above. Below are some examples of business value (stated as a question) which could be a proof of concept (PoC) for newly formed teams. Note that each problem will have its own definition of patterns, algorithms, and data representations (see links to articles):The 3-phase AI cycle from Singularity above is a highly simplified concept meant to jumpstart the understanding of the general principles of AI. However, as mentioned earlier, vast amounts of sophistication and algorithms lay below what is visible in our AI iceberg. One of this is data science which is a personal passion and is essential to (Phase 1) perceiving environment and (Phase 3) learning from patterns. In order to maintain brevity, I've reserved this topic for a future blog, along with Algorithms (used for detecting patterns), and the different approaches machines learn. Think of it as part 2 of our AI Introduction designed for those that want to roll-up their sleeves and ""open the hood"" to see how the machine consumes data, spits out answers, and learns.However, if you're motivated to get some ""hands-on"" introduction to data science, machine learning or AI, you can view this free online book Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas or Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow (not free) which takes you through the toolkits used by Data Scientists such as Python programming language and several machine learning libraries and platforms. There's also Harvard University's CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (free until Dec 2021). I highly recommend these for those who want to be AI practitioners and those tasked to build a team to help them understand the skills needed to recruit and interview candidates.You've probably watched some of the sci-fi movies of humans vs machines in a post-apocalyptic world (e.g. Terminator The Movie) given the domination of super-intelligent machines. Or if you're a gaming enthusiast, you may have experienced playing an android character in a PS4 game called Detroit: Become Human (top photo). This imagines a future where 25% of human jobs are performed by androids. Unlike Terminator, this timeline occurs before the technological singularity, when machines reach the irreversible point of super-intelligence. This spectrum in AI is sometimes referred to as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) which some brave souls have published a fearless forecast of the point in time in the future.Whichever future you are willing to imagine for our world, AI has demonstrated its ability to enhance our lives along with other countless possibilities in industries like Healthcare. It's true that AI is unmatched by previous technological innovations, but we should also be aware of its dark side especially in military applications. Fortunately, there's growing focus on AI for Good and awareness of risks can keep Dark AI in check. Large companies with billions of dollars in AI Research have made AI ethics and principles transparent. In the meantime, as our world evolves, let's start our journey and take our place in the AI ecosystem.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1664/1*vzjZQKQBsuZBeA2QlifKxA.png,https://medium.com/swlh/a-startups-journey-towards-artificial-intelligence-with-ai101-bdb854e7596d,artificial-intelligence,c8dc29131e2b027b91ef8288a2beb51dc10910fb111f19d20f3b3c3a
Nina Restieri of momAgenda: 5 Things You Need To Know To Create A Very Successful Lifestyle Brand,"As a part of our series called ""5 Things You Need to Know To Create A Very Successful Lifestyle Brand"", I had the pleasure of interviewing Nina Restieri, founder and president of momAgenda. Previously, she has spent time as an advertising executive, as the president of a family business, and as a stay-at-home mom.She started momAgenda when her four kids were seven, five, three, and one, to create organizing products to help make moms' lives (and her own life) easier. momAgenda has grown to include a diversified range of products that help organize the lives of mothers and others, including day planners, home organizers, pads, journals, and accessories. The collection is sold at leading national retailers and regional boutiques throughout the U.S. Over the past fifteen years, Nina Restieri and momAgenda have been featured in numerous outlets including NBC's Today show, The Early Show, MSNBC, Real Simple, Better Homes and Gardens, The New York Times, and The Huffington Post.Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dive in, our readers would love to learn a bit more about you. Can you tell us a bit about your ""childhood backstory""?I grew up in Connecticut. My parents split up when I was very young so my mom, despite having dropped out of college to get married, had to go back to work. Eventually, she started a company and succeeded beyond anything she'd imagined. Watching her career trajectory shaped my thinking about being a working mom. My mom was a mom-entrepreneur back in the 1980's before that term even existed! I grew up knowing I wanted to have both a family and a professional life. I dreamed about owning a company just like my mom did.Can you tell us the story of what led you to this particular career path?I started my career after college in advertising, where I learned the basics of branding, creative, and account management. After five years or so, I took the helm at my mom's company. I ran that for a few years, but at the time I had very young babies and wanted more time with them. So I sold that business and spent six years as a stay-at-home mom. The entire time I was home with the kids, I dreamed of what type of business I would start when I was eventually ready to go back to work. When I had the idea for momAgenda, I knew that was ""the one.""Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?When I was first starting my business, I was a mom of four young kids. I was overwhelmed, with too much to do and not enough time to do it. One night, I went to my book club. I rang the doorbell, the hostess kindly invited me in and poured me a glass of wine. We sat for about 30 minutes before I finally asked, ""where's everyone else?"" The hostess cracked up. ""Book club is TOMORROW."" I felt so silly! I knew then I needed a better system for organizing my schedule, and that I wasn't the only mom who needed something like that.Is there a particular book, podcast, or film that made a significant impact on you? Can you share a story or explain why it resonated with you so much?Eat Pray Love by Elizabeth Gilbert had a huge impact on me, because it's the story of a woman on a journey toward her own authenticity. I think in our society women are encouraged to follow rules rather than be authentic. One of the central reasons I wrote my own book was to express to women how important it is to be yourself and let go of society's dictates that keep us from living our best and most joyful lives.Can you please give us your favorite ""Life Lesson Quote""? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?My favorite quote is from Joan Lunden. ""Exude happiness and you will feel it back a thousand times."" It's something I've taught my kids, in addition to applying to my own life - you get back what you put out there, so try to choose positive energy whenever possible.Let's now jump to the primary focus of our interview. For the benefit of our readers, let's define our terms. How do you define a Lifestyle Brand? How is a Lifestyle Brand different from a normal, typical brand?For me, a lifestyle brand means it's about more than just selling a product. It's about the bigger picture of the customers' lives, who they want to be and how they want to live. It's also about creating community and a sense of belonging.What are the benefits of creating a lifestyle brand?The benefits are that you can really tailor it to your own life and how you want to live. It encompasses your aesthetic and your products, and it also encompasses your core values. It's quite literally the opposite of selling a widget in corporate America - a lifestyle brand can be a direct expression of who you are. There's a freedom of expression you get from creating your own brand that you never experience working for someone else's company.In your opinion, what is an example of a company that has done a fantastic job building a believable and beloved Lifestyle Brand? What specifically impresses you? What can one do to replicate that?I'm very impressed with Gwenyth Paltrow's lifestyle brand, GOOP. She's been able to create a very high-end, aspirational brand with a cohesive look and feel throughout. Even though many of the products in her online store are on the higher end of the price spectrum, they're always sold out! That shows me people are willing to pay more when the branding really speaks to the customer.Can you share your ideas about how to create a lifestyle brand that people really love and are 'crazy about'?I think they key is to really know and understand your customers so you can provide them with everything they want. Think of Anthropologie - they don't just carry clothes, they also carry items for the home, stationery, and bath products, among other things. That helps them to really meet the needs of their customers who want that special aesthetic throughout their homes and their lives.What are the common mistakes you have seen people make when they start a lifestyle brand? What can be done to avoid those errors?I think one common mistake is to follow other people's advice. It's so important to follow your gut when creating a lifestyle brand. You know what to do already. I think it's great to ask people what they think and listen to their answers - but when it's time to make decisions, always do what feels right to you.Let's imagine that someone reading this interview has an idea for a lifestyle brand that they would like to develop. What are the first few steps that you would recommend that they take?My advice is to think about who your target customer is, then find those people and talk to as many of them as you can. Find out who they really are, what they struggle with, what they're afraid of, what they really want. Knowing your customers inside and out makes it easy to develop a brand that can connect with those people.What are your ""5 Things You Need to Know to Create a Very Successful Lifestyle Brand"" and why? (Please share a story or example for each.)You are an inspiration to a great many people. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger.I'd love to inspire women, especially moms, to start taking care of themselves and stop putting themselves last on the list. The mom-life crisis has become an epidemic in this country. We as moms deserve better - we deserve the same love and care we give our kids and partners. I care about this so much that I wrote about it! It's called Overcoming the Mom-Life Crisis, and it's based on my own experience.We are very blessed that some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US, with whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch, and why? He or she might just see this if we tag them.I would love to share a meal with Oprah Winfrey. In addition to her incredible talents in business and entertainment, I really admire how she's able to authentically connect with millions of people she's never met.Thank you for these fantastic insights. We greatly appreciate the time you spent on this!",,https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nina-restieri-of-momagenda-5-things-you-need-to-know-to-create-a-very-successful-lifestyle-brand-7e60e7aec833,startups,c9badee52d176219cac992674f4d25ba666ed795ef272cbbf970c963
Four Takeaways from the 2021 Super Bowl Ads,"On Sunday, the grand American tradition of the Super Bowl match returned to TV after a transformative year, and brought with it one of our favorite weathervanes of cultural zeitgeist - the Super Bowl ads. As with years past, they reflected brand marketers' best guesses at where consumer interests and sentiments are landing these days and, in aggregate, pointed to some interesting market trends that all brands should keep an eye on.Super Bowl, the crown jewel program of U.S. broadcast TV, has long provided unparalleled audience reach for brands, especially those in categories like auto, CPG, and entertainment, whose business models typically require scale and wide consumer awareness to succeed. This year, however, things are a little different. Some long-time Super Bowl advertisers, such as Budweiser, Kia, and Planters, decided to opt out of buying a Super Bowl spot this time and instead donated the money they saved to a charitable cause of their choice.In contrast, after a year of accelerated digital transformation, many digital-native brands, who are better-equipped to deal with the challenges that the pandemic imposes and building on the momentum they had in 2020, made their Super Bowl debut to reach a wider audience. They include:All of these digital-native brands shelled out the big bucks this year to get in front of tens of millions of U.S. households and signal their legitimacy and credibility in a bid to win over the skeptics and late-adopters.Some of the digital-native brands who opted in this year did successfully spark consumer interests with their big game spots. According to market research firm EDO, which indexes ads based on the search activity generated within a short window of it appearing on air, the top ranking brands include Dexcom, which aired a spot in which Nick Jonas rants about some of the cutting-edge technological advances before introducing Dexcom's blood glucose monitoring technology, as well as the awe-inspiring spot for Inspiration4, which is offering the first all-civilian trip to outer space this fall.Interestingly, Reddit and Robinhood, two tech companies that have been in the news lately due to the involvement in the Gamestop stock saga, both aired Super Bowl ads this year, but with very different approaches. Robinhood stuck to their ""We Are All Investors"" spot despite the recent controversy of the app limiting users from buying certain heavily-shorted stocks due to regulations, and promptly got dragged on social media for being tone-deaf. According to Ad Age, Robinhood considered pulling the ad but decided to run it after seeing its users increase during the controversy.In contrast, Reddit ran a super-concise five-second spot designed to look like a broadcast glitch and gives a shout-out to the ""underdogs that accomplish just about anything when they come together around a common idea."" The New York Times declared it ""an unlikely Super Bowl winner,"" citing that the cost-effective short spot became one of the most talked-about (and posted-about) commercials of the day. Regardless of which side you're on, it's fascinating to see the biggest internet drama of recent memory spill over to the Super Bowl ads.As noted in our CES 2021 recap, the push for consumers to upgrade their mobile plan to 5G has officially kicked off as carriers continue to roll out 5G networks nationwide and millions of consumers now have 5G-ready new iPhones. This push is evident at this year's Super Bowl, with two of the three major U.S. carriers, T-Mobile and Verizon, airing spots promoting their respective 5G services. T-Mobile, in particular, produced a trio of humorous commercials to position itself as ""the leader in 5G,"" although only two spots were aired.That leaves AT&T as the only major U.S. carrier that didn't make a Super Bowl push for its 5G network, which reportedly has been lagging behind its competitors in terms of availability and speed. Instead, the company chose a Lord of the Ring-themed spot that promotes its fiber home broadband service.It is a minor disappointment that neither Version nor T-Mobile fully communicated with their Super Bowl spots, the consumer benefits of 5G other than faster speed for mobile gaming or more reliable video calls. This is by no means surprising, considering most of the other benefits that 5G could bring to consumer technology, be it higher network capacity for large crowds or embedded connectivity for smart home devices, have yet to take shape. (Verizon did promote their 5G-powered smart stadium experience in one spot, but that won't be available to most people until live events resume.) Still, it points to the central dilemma in the 5G marketing push so far: most consumers are happy with their home WIFi and LTE networks at the moment, and until more substantial benefits of upgrading to 5G networks fully manifest themselves and are clearly communicated to customers, they will not be very incentivized to embrace 5G.A big question that most Super Bowl advertisers must have pondered was whether they should address the still-ongoing pandemic in their spots. In the end, most brands chose the easy way out and avoided any reference to the pandemic entirely. Still, some brands decided to keep it real and gave some nods to the difficult times we are living through. There were no face masks and social distancing depicted in the commercials, but given the constraints the pandemic placed on production, there were more outdoor sets and fewer crowd shots than usual. But regardless of whether they recognize the awful reality or not, one thing that brands seemed to agree on is to keep the overall tone of this year's ads lighthearted and non-political.For example, McDonald's created a spot that celebrates the joy of singing in cars and going to drive-thrus, which saw a huge spike in revenues over the past year for obvious reasons. Bud Light humorously depicted 2020 as ""a year of lemons,"" with huge amounts of lemons falling from the sky and ruining everything, to promote its new seltzer lemonade.Job search site Indeed also didn't shy away from giving nods to the difficulties of pandemic life, but still inspiringly framed job-hunting as a chance to start over. The spot from Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's, which sells fishing and camping gears, took a similar approach and called for a return to the great outdoors ""in these trying times"" to reconnect with each other.In an effort to keep things light and non-controversial, most brands stayed away from politics and social issues this year. Still, there are two notable exceptions that decided to get a little political: Jeep enlisted Bruce Springsteen to solemnly implore the nation to become ""the RE-United States of America"" in a spot titled ""The Middle,"" while Fiverr ran a futuristically staged ad that poked fun at Trump's Four Seasons Total Landscaping debacle last year. You can guess which one fared better with the Super Bowl audience.Although most brands shied away from cause marketing to avoid controversy this year, there's one social issue that showed up across categories this year, and that is sustainability. From auto brands to restaurants, sustainability has emerged as a shared common value that an increasing number of companies are proudly getting behind, as they leverage it as a unifying signifier of their corporate social responsibilities.For example, GE put out two humorous spots highlighting its latest electric vehicle models: one featuring Will Ferrell as the comedian tries to rally the U.S. to beat Norway in electric-car adoption, and another one that stars Timothée Chalamet as the son of Edward Scissorhands to show off the auto-pilot mode on its all-electric Cadillac LYRIQ.Addressing sustainability more directly, Chipotle aired a spot focused solely on its sustainability efforts, including ""reducing carbon emissions, saving water, and supporting local growers."" Told through the perspective of a child, the ad managed to avoid sounding too preachy and highlighted Chipotle's efforts in sustainable agriculture.In an effort to get the message across in a fun, lighthearted manner, some brands took a more whimsical approach to address sustainability. Swedish oat milk brand Oatly ran an old commercial where the company's CEO sings a jingle with repeating lyrics ""Wow, no cow"" in a wheat field. Similarly, Hellmann's turned Amy Schumer into a ""Fairy Godmayo"" that helps people to dress up leftovers and reduce food waste.Overall, the Super Bowl ads this year delivered a lighthearted diversion from the uncertain reality that we live in today and provided a clear indication of the kind of tone and topics brands are looking to engage customers with this year. As an ultimate mass media event in American pop culture, the Super Bowl commercials continue to be a good bellwether of market and cultural trends that advertisers should heed, especially after a year as transformative as 2020.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10240/1*Y70i-WAUktavNUP8hLF4zQ.png,https://medium.com/ipg-media-lab/four-takeaways-from-the-super-bowl-2021-ads-35694f80abf4,marketing,c25ea58b384fe262693f3f726138a8e5b89c001a45fc3c3e621c65ee
3 Misconceptions About Remote Work and How to Manage Them,"By Rebecca HindsBy many accounts, remote work looks promising.At Mercer, an HR and workplace benefits consulting firm, for example, a staggering 94 percent of employers surveyed said that productivity was...",,https://medium.com/inc./rmeote-work3-misconceptions-about-remote-work-and-how-to-manage-them-b1ef906b37cb,productivity,c44e34f7d4edb376c06f3702da0798109ca9e033a23eb6d4595dc909
How to Build a Game-Changing Sales System So You Can Finally Stop Hustling,"I've freelanced for over 15 years. As well as being a web developer, it's also my job to land new clients.After all this time, I still sometimes find myself trying to convince prospects that my offer is right for them.Most of the time, my efforts fall on deaf ears. And when I do get projects this way, they usually go badly.That's not surprising -what we've come to recognize as ""selling"" is unfortunately more like persuasion. It's about pressure, and nobody wants to feel pressured.But the truth is that when the product and the customer are right for one another, pressure-selling isn't needed.This is called a product-market fit: it means that what you offer aligns perfectly with what the client wants.And when they want it, they buy it.Tragically, freelancers completely overlook this simple principle all the time. Instead, they expend a tonne of effort chasing anyone they think will throw a dollar their way.This is not the freelance dream - it is a quick path to unhappiness and burnout. I know, because I've felt it.If you want to get ahead of the game, you'll need to master the idea of connecting your product or service with an audience who wants it.You need a sales system. One that delivers the right clients directly to you.I've never enjoyed sales, but it took me a long time to realize that I was doing it wrong. I was engaging in the hard sell, trying to tell my prospects that what I had to offer was the best thing in the world, and they'd be an idiot to miss it.I bet you've done this, too.Every time you drop your prices to win a project, you're doing the hard sell. With each sales objection you overcome, you're engaging in pressure selling.Hustling like this can build character and resilience, but after a while, it just becomes a pain. Nobody wants to spend their days chasing potential clients - in the end, most of them say no anyway.A better approach is to inspire prospects to reach out to you. This removes the need to convince somebody to work with you.To achieve this you need a system built broadly of the following components:When you structure your sales process like this you can relax the hard sell because the system does the work for you. This is exactly what I've done to create a sustainable freelance business.Let's take a look at each step in detail.When I started out freelancing I targeted ""small businesses"".But as a niche, ""small businesses"" is too vague. You need a target customer you can easily visualize in your mind.This could be ""vegan junk food restaurants in London"" or ""second-hand thrift stores"" or ""beauty salons in Brooklyn"" or... whatever takes your fancy. You can play with the sector, location, size of the business, or any other variable that springs to mind.The point is to massively downsize your market so that you aren't wasting time targeting everyone. You can speak directly to a subset of people as their go-to specialist.If you don't think niching is worthwhile, consider this: you probably promote your services at business events or on social media. But I'm guessing you don't advertise them on the sides of buses. Why is this? It's because you intuitively know your audience isn't there.Having a niche enables you to go where your audience is. It enables you to speak to them in their own language.Trust me, that is powerful.And when you do this, you realize that attending business events and all that other time-intensive stuff is simply pitching your net too wide.Spend some time, right now, considering your niche. Don't move on to the next two steps before you do this. You can't find a product-market fit if you don't have a market.The term ""value proposition"" sounds a little grandiose. I feel dirty using it. But the fact is that if you don't have one, you basically don't have a business.For years I was just a guy who built websites. I'd say stuff like ""I design beautiful websites for ambitious small businesses"". I'd even talk about the tech I use and include the WordPress logo as if my clients would be impressed by it. Crazy!The obvious problem here is that almost every freelance web developer says pretty much the same thing. How do you stand out?If you followed step 1 to define a niche, you might now be ""the specialist who helps beauty salons fill their seats by providing a user-friendly online booking experience.""Do you see how that statement differs? Can you feel how the positioning of that message would resonate with a target audience so much more strongly than some vague mention of WordPress?And because you have a clear demographic, you can extrapolate your core value proposition by creating more hyper-targeted content that answers their specific problems. What questions does that particular audience have?By connecting a niche audience with a carefully crafted message that speaks directly to them, you can completely transform your business.Once you have established a target audience and have produced content that will resonate with them, you are faced with the tricky task of getting that message in front of them.But having been through steps 1 and 2, marketing your service is now much, much easier. That is because you have dramatically reduced your competition by downsizing your market.Anyone who owns a website will know how tough generating traffic is, particularly from search engines. Over 90% of my business comes from Google - to complete your sales system, you should be aiming for a strong presence in Google, too.The goal is a steady stream of the right kind of customers coming to your website every day.It is possible to achieve this by focusing your content on ""long-tail"" traffic. Instead of trying to rank highly for competitive terms such as ""web design"", you can now target much deeper phrases such as ""web design for beauty salons in Brooklyn"". Getting a page 1 position for this won't be too challenging.It is beyond the scope of this article to explore Search Engine Optimisation in any real detail (I've written about this here), but know that in this insanely noisy world, niching is how you cut through.So much has been written about so many things that being a generalist is becoming a fast way to fail in business. Specialism is the direction of travel.To get your message out there you need to create content ruthlessly for your chosen niche audience, forgetting everything else. Once you establish some authority in this space, targeted traffic will pour in.I have covered a lot in a short space of time. Let's recap:It took me a decade of hustling to realize that I was missing a large part of what it takes to succeed in business. I then spent several months developing my own system for bringing in the right clients. This system, the one I have outlined here, serves my business well. It delivers quality leads on autopilot.It is heartbreaking that so many talented freelancers embark on their journey with enthusiasm, only to have it dampened by the crushing challenges of the business world.I sincerely hope that this article has given you some guidance on how you can construct a sustainable marketing funnel for your business, leading to a less stressful and more prosperous freelance life.If you enjoyed this article, please consider registering for my newsletter.",,https://medium.com/an-idea/how-to-build-a-game-changing-sales-system-so-you-can-finally-stop-hustling-d0a37730916c,freelancing,c85e754347ae15025f518f99a1934700d382efb1a70611e5f7d63a83
Five simple design patterns to improve your website,"User interface design patterns are considered a common language for designers. It's a vocabulary that solves many design problems and as a result appear over and over again. So if you're struggling with user flows and tasks, consider leaning into some common design patterns to optimize your solutions.In this article I'll walk you through one of my common flows as a reader of The New York Times, and take a closer look at 5 design patterns that help me seamlessly navigate this common routine.On the weekends I like to ease into my news consumption. This means I prefer to start with lighter fare, play a game or two to start engaging my brain, and then move into world and regionally specific news. So I'll pour myself a cup of coffee and head over to nytimes.com.Starting on the home page, the nav bar is separated into sections of the newspaper in a flat structure, making every section apparent at once. The navigation is repeated on the hamburger menu on the top left.While this approach might seem obvious, think about how many websites try to cram things into this nav space that don't belong. Short section names that indicate the highest level of organization are appropriate here, nothing content specific like article titles.Once I've clicked through to the Style section, I scroll through the page and I don't see anything that piques my interest, until about halfway through when I see a module tab that presents a view of recent stories alongside the ability to search.Module tabs like this are a design pattern that can help you when you've got limited space, and content or functions need to be separated into sections.My interest in LVMH lead me to search, and I found a story about Rihanna and her hiatus from LVMH that I clicked through to.After finishing the story, I scrolled down and saw additional stories I might consider reading. What's interesting here is that I'm not looking at a list of headlines but at three different article lists.Three different formats present a straightforward headline list for 'Most Popular', thumbnails alongside titles for 'Pop Culture', and larger preview images above headlines in 'More in Fashion.' The biggest visual emphasis is placed on stories I'm likely to continue reading, since I'm already inside a fashion story. And it makes sense that 'Pop Culture' is next in hierarchy, since it's a larger category that contains fashion. The list of 'Most Popular' is ubiquitous and generally associated with this format.This purposeful approach helps guide users to content that will most appeal. It's a good thing to keep in mind when presenting additional stories to your users.After scanning the article lists, I find myself at the bottom of the page, where I'm faced with a 'fat footer.' While you might dismiss this as a bloated repository of links, it's actually an easy and natural way for your visitors to continue their journeys on your site.Not quite ready for real news, I decide to play one of the Times' games, and a link to that section is readily available here.In the games section, my options are organized using the 'cards' design pattern. This approach allows the Times to present many different gaming experiences as a collection, and to organize different groupings of games succinctly, and in a visually engaging manner through its bright colors and intuitive iconography.Unfortunately, I can't seem to finish the Spelling Bee, and I'm almost out of coffee, so I decide it's time to face the music of real news. What's interesting at this point of my journey, however, is that the games world of the Times completely strips out all navigation related to their primary content.The only link to the home page is a small link in the footer, which is specific to the Games content; likewise for the hamburger menu.While this might seem peculiar and counterintuitive, it's very likely a deliberate choice. Perhaps user research revealed that when subscribers played these games, they wanted full immersion and no distractions that pulled them away. The fact that full access to their games requires a fee could have also played a hand in this approach.In any case, I've found my way back to the home page, and back to reality: politics, pandemics, and so much more.So when you're considering user journeys as they relate to UI design decisions for your next website project, a great place to start is with design patterns like these - they'll make your design process easier and will lead to more effective results in the long run.

It's Time To Face Automation,"It is widely recognized that the rise of artificial intelligence and automation will make the production of products and the supplying of services more efficient, as computers start doing what previously took hours in minutes. Already, we can trace ~15% of recent productivity growth to the use of industrial robots. (Graetz & Michaels, 2018, p. 754) However, it is increasingly clear that the integration of these machines will result in lost jobs, as people who are getting replaced cannot get new jobs in similar fields. (Das & Hilgenstock, 2018, pp. 33-34) The confluence of these opposing forces poses huge challenges to the stability of the middle class in particular and modern capitalism as a whole. So what if we do nothing about it, and how can we stop it from happening?As humanity progresses, the amount of people that need to be doing raw labor decreases; ten million people worked in agriculture in 1950, compared to just three million that work on farms today. (United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2017) Conversely, the number of people doing more complex forms of labor has increased, such as in the fields of finance, transportation, and administration. Thus, the percentage of people employed has stayed relatively stable. This is the automation of physical work, and has not caused civilization-breaking problems yet. What we're seeing now, however, is the automation of intellectual work. How exactly do you do that?There are a multitude of ways to create useful AI. The easiest to explain involves creating lots of robots and then breeding, testing, and culling them. This is called ""genetic breeding,"" because of its similarities to natural selection: the robots have random mutations, and the ones with the most useful random mutations survive. Other methods have names like Q-learning, which utilizes rewards in a virtual space, and deep learning, which is akin to operating the world's most confusing slot machine. (Sutton & Barto, 2018) The end result of all of these methods is automation of intellectual work. That's how most technology that would seem like magic 30 years ago, such as Google's Search and Tesla's Autopilot, works. This type of automation reduces the amount of intellectual labor required without generating significant numbers of new jobs. Apple provides 2,000,000 jobs and is worth over $1 trillion, meaning a value of $500,000 per employee. (Apple, 2016) Ford employs 190,000 people and is only worth $35 billion, resulting in a value of about $200,000 per employee. (Forbes, 2020) In the age of AI, you need less people than ever before to generate more money than ever before- productivity is becoming decoupled from labor.Lots of ink has been spilled in arguing just how much AI and automation as a whole will impact the global labor market. As Acemoglu and Restrepo wrote (2018),Winick (2018) compiled studies estimating job losses in the upcoming 25 years due to AI. The conclusion drawn was that while most agreed jobs would be lost, no studies agreed on even an approximate amount. Estimates for job losses ranged from about 2,000,000 on the low end (by 2020) to 400,000,000 on the high end (by 2030).One thing is clear, however: companies and universities are investing heavily in Artificial Intelligence research. The non-profit organization AI Index (2017) found that the number of papers written about AI ballooned to 18,000 in 2017. Furthermore, the McKinsey Global Institute (2018) estimated that companies such as Facebook and Google have spent $18 - $27 billion dollars internally in the field.We've established that the widespread use of AI is coming, and that when it does, many jobs will no longer exist. Now, we must determine what impacts this will have on the economy.You may notice that modern capitalism relies on many of the things AI is expected to have an adverse effect on. Capitalism works best with a large middle class, and AI will increase inequality. Capitalism depends on abundant competition, and AI is most efficient when used at large scales. Capitalism only works when consumers have a choice, but if advertisers can build nearly perfect models of your psychology, can you really be certain you chose to buy that box of cereal? Because of this, automation may reduce the usefulness of capitalism as a vehicle to raise standards of living both in reality and in the eyes of the public.Overall, if nothing is done to blunt the most serious negative impacts of AI, we can expect major job losses, rising inequality, and eroded privacy. What can we do to dull this? The most urgent problem is the impending hemorrhaging of jobs. One solution that promises to prop up the economy is Universal Basic Income (UBI). The basic idea is simple enough: replace most welfare with a government-provided check that goes to all citizens every month. While at first this proposal seems simple and logical, upon closer examination, problems become apparent. For now, we'll ignore the political challenges and consequences of axing most welfare. The most obvious drawback is the immense cost UBI would place on taxpayers. Hoynes and Rothstein (2019) show that a UBI that provides basic support for a household would cost ""about twice the cost of all existing [welfare] transfers in the United States."" (p. 954) The question of how these funds are raised will play a large part in determining the effectiveness of UBI. In addition, because UBI is not means-tested, it will be more regressive when compared with the current social safety net. It is reasonable to infer, then, that UBI may simply add to the inequality intellectual automation will cause.Instead of softening the impact of automation, Bill Gates and others have proposed a ""robot tax,"" which would penalize automation directly. Gasteiger and Prettner (2017) have shown that a robot tax on its own would not eliminate stagnation in the labor market on its own, but could increase per-capita capital. Furthermore, they raise the issue of tax avoidance. It is likely that a robot tax would only be effective if a large number of countries simultaneously implemented it. Otherwise, an enterprising company can simply move the location of its programs and machines, either on paper or in actuality, to a country where they won't be taxed at all.Another large challenge when confronting automation will be the immense need for worker retraining. When workers are inevitably displaced due to both intellectual and industrial automation, they will have to gain new skills in order to stay in the labor market. Failing to provide adequate education facilities for these citizens will lead to more unnecessary unemployment. Jiamovich et al. (2020) used a machine-generated model to predict the impacts of widespread retraining programs. They found that in order to reverse ""low-skilled"" employment back to 1989 pre-automation levels, we would need to successfully reincorporate 10% of the unemployed. Obviously, this is no easy task. Multiple approaches have been suggested, from government-funded education, to corporate training programs. Even so, as Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2011) explain, due to the nature of exponential growth, it is probable that training will get harder over time, as AI is able to automate more and more jobs. In other words, we need to start right now.In conclusion, automation forces us to confront many simultaneous serious situations. At the same time, it promises huge gains in efficiency, standards of living, and productivity. We have the ability to blunt the worst of the negative impacts, while still taking advantage of the positive ones, by using a variety of tools. And yet, right now, we aren't heavily investing in any of them. For the first time in human history, productivity is becoming separate from labor. It's time we decide, as a society, how to deal with that.Acemoglu, D., & Restrepo, P. (2018). Artificial Intelligence, Automation and Work.

In Defence of the Sega Saturn,"I was a Sega kid growing up. My younger brother and I begged our parents for a Master System for Christmas 1990. In 1993 armed with my first paycheque the first thing I did was to upgrade that to a Mega Drive.These two systems provided me with so much pleasure growing up. I enjoyed games of every genre on them, especially the MegaDrive, as I had time on my hands and money in my pocket to indulge myself in my new hobby. I'll not make this post into a games list but highlights included, Sensible Soccer and the early F.I.F.A. games, Super Monaco G.P., Streets of Rage, Revenge of Shinobi, Sonic, E.S.W.A.T., the list goes on and on. Not long after, I upgraded to a Mega C.D. and marvelled at such ""cutting edge"" titles as Sewer Shark and Night Trap.I devoured gaming magazines like Mean Machines and Gamesmaster, always looking ahead to what was on the horizon and that's where I first read about the sequel to the Mega Drive.Development of the Saturn started in 1992, back when I was still playing Master System, but it was early 1994 before magazines started featuring it heavily and it swam into my consciousness. I also became aware of a potential rival to the Saturn in the form of the Sony PlayStation (whatever happened to them?) but at the time I thought it had no chance. Sony made TVs and Walkmans, what did they know about making video games? In my mind, it was going to be another 3DO so I disregarded it as another expensive flop.The biggest things attracting me to the new Sega Saturn were the ports of the biggest arcade games that were rumoured to be coming to the console. I was 17 in 1994 and my friends and I were all driving or learning to drive so we'd regularly spend time in arcades (something that was previously reserved for holidays or special occasions.) Daytona USA was a game I loved in the arcades; I dread to think how much money I pumped into that one title in 1994. As soon as it was confirmed for the Saturn it was game over for any other system, I had to have Sega's newest machine.Over the next year, more and more games were confirmed for the system and my anticipation grew. Screenshots of International Victory Goal, Bug, Clockwork Knight and Virtua Fighter along with rumours of Virtua Cop and F.I.F.A. 96 convinced me that I'd made the right choice. Nothing Sony could do would be able to compete.Looking back now it seems like Sega was in disarray. The Mega Drive was still extremely popular and selling well, but alongside the Saturn, they were also developing another 32-bit system in the form of the 32x, a Mega Drive add-on. This mushroom looking device plugged into the top of the Mega Drive allowing you to play 32-bit cartridges. The thought process being it provided entry to the 32bit market without the cost of buying the expensive Saturn, effectively making it a rival to its own product. It was released in the U.K. in January 1995 and only 40 games were released for the 32x (6 of which needed the Mega C.D.) and without any 3rd-party support, it was quickly discontinued.Confusion also reigned when it came to the system's release dates. In both the U.S. and the U.K. the system was released earlier than advertised. Sega thought this surprise launch would give them the drop on the PlayStation but it backfired spectacularly. With retailers not yet ready and with no advertising in place it had the opposite effect, with some retailers going so far as to drop Sega completely and not stock their new machine. Add to this Sony's infamous ""£299"" keynote speech and the writing was on the wall for Sega before the race has even started.The Saturn released in July of 1995 in the U.K. for £399.99. Mine was pre-ordered and I picked it up on launch day. As well as the £400 console, which came bundled with Virtua Fighter, I also purchased a second pad for £25, a copy of Daytona U.S.A. for £50, and an RF adaptor to make it work with my room's TV. Another mistake by Sega was assuming the everyone had a Scart TV (a European connection standard between TV and machine), so for anyone in my position, if you didn't then another £25 cable had to be purchased.All in, I spent £500 that day, and to help with the cost I foolishly traded in my Mega Drive, Mega C.D. and full game collection. I'd given away almost 20 games just to play 2 new ones, a decision I regretted almost immediately.Here's where the cracks started to appear in my theretofore healthy relationship with Sega. I wasn't a fan of fighting games so Virtua Fighter wasn't my cup of tea. It was amazing to have Daytona in my own home but the conversion wasn't the greatest, as it had been rushed to make the early launch date and it showed with major pop-up and clipping issues.Nevertheless, I pushed on with my new purchase. Soon after I bought International Victory Goal, Shinobi, Victory Boxing and Virtua Cop (complete with gun) then the jewel in the Saturn's crown, Sega Rally.Sega Rally was an amazing conversion, faithful to its arcade big brother, with graphics and sound that were unlike anything I'd seen from a home console. I loved the game, I still love the game, and last time I checked I hold world record lap times for some of the tracks.The problem wasn't Sega's first party games. The problem for me was the 3rd party ones. Everything seemed to come out much earlier on PlayStation, was cheaper, and seemed to be a better version. F.I.F.A. 96 is a perfect example. It released in September of 1995 on PlayStation, and I played it with a friend on his console for months. It was January 96 before it came out on Saturn, it was £10 more expensive and didn't play as well. By the time it came out we'd moved on and were playing Actua Soccer on the PlayStation, a game that didn't release on Saturn till June 96.This seemed to happen a lot. It didn't help that all my friends had PlayStations and for the first time I couldn't swap and borrow games with people. I stood by my purchase and kept buying and playing games until late 1997. Victory Goal was followed by the much superior Worldwide Soccer 97 and 98, Daytona had a sequel called Championships Circuit Edition with better graphics and more tracks. Arcade conversions kept on coming, F1 Challenge, Manx TT Superbikes and Athlete Kings. Early on lots of games appeared on both Saturn and PS1 (Tomb Raider and Resident Evil for example) but the sequels never appeared, becoming PlayStation exclusives.Looking back it feels like all Sega thought they had to do to win the console war was to turn up. They never anticipated Sony blowing them away like they did with a cheaper price point, aggressive advertising campaigns and a console that developers found easier to work with. They hadn't realised that the audience that had grown up with their previous systems were now young adults who were ready for something cooler and edgier, and ultimately this misreading of the market cost them dearly.Some of the software decisions were also baffling. For every great franchise like Panzer Dragoon or Nights into Dreams, Sega made awful decisions like not releasing a Sonic game. Crash Bandicoot became the unofficial Sony mascot, Nintendo obviously had Mario but Sega's mascot skipped the whole generation. That being said there were some top quality titles released during its short lifetime and if it wasn't for the PlayStation then maybe it would have been as popular as the Mega Drive.The Saturn was discontinued in 1998. Its follow-up console, the Dreamcast, didn't feature backwards compatibility, and though it had some of the best versions of popular games, it never truly found an audience. The only way to experience it today is to brave eBay and buy an original machine, but if you're interested in retro gaming and you can afford one I recommend you do. It's a great machine with some amazing first-party games and arcade conversions that a lot of people missed out on the first time around.It's worth it just for Sega Rally Championship.Thanks for reading.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*9ZHMbVWY2gQH5FZh3OxMJw.jpeg,https://medium.com/super-jump/in-defence-of-the-sega-saturn-a679ad959886,gaming,c0653e0f14661a3caf7c59c2e9ff33667ea44cb7b6b16ef8e341a012
Get Answers to Essential Freelance Tax Questions,"Learn about important tax and accounting terms including bookkeeping, tax types, filing, revenues, self-employment, and more.Welcome to this Q&A article that answers some of the fundamental questions you might have about your freelance taxes. I've split up the FAQs into several areas:For more information on all these areas, check out the Freelance Tax Guide.I am not an accountant or qualified tax professional. These guides are intended only as general information, not as specific advice or recommendations.

You'll find a disclaimer at the end of this article.Accountants are qualified professionals who can advise you on your unique situation and help you prepare and file your taxes. A Certified Public Accountant (CPA) is an accountant who has passed a strict examination and meets certain. professional standards.If your freelance financial circumstances are very simple, you may want to file your taxes yourself - although it's very important to know what you're doing. Consulting with an accountant about your personal situation, freelance business finances, and tax needs will ensure you're getting everything right.Bookkeeping is the process of keeping up with invoicing, revenue, expenses, profits, bills, and the other financials in your freelance business. If you want to retain your sanity, you can do this through specialist bookkeeping and accounting software like FreshBooks, QuickBooks, Xero, Wave, etc.As part of bookkeeping, you'll ""reconcile"" what's in your bookkeeping software against your business bank account statement to make sure you're capturing all of your business finances correctly. I've created a complete guide to freelance bookkeeping.It's generally a very good idea. Keeping up with your bookkeeping will let you understand the money that's coming into and going out of your freelance business. It will also make things much easier at tax time.A business bank account is an account you'll use to receive income, pay expenses, and track the transactions coming into and out of your freelance business. If you're a sole proprietor, you're not required to have a separate bank account for your business, but it will make your bookkeeping much, much easier. If you've set up an LLC or corporation for your freelance business, you're legally required to have a separate business bank account.Even if you're a sole proprietor, having a separate business bank account will make your bookkeeping much easier, which will save you time and money. I've created a guide discussing areas like business bank accounts and other basics you can get in place.Accrual accounting is a method of accounting where you report income and expenses based on when they are earned, rather than when money changes hands. For example, if you sent out a freelance invoice on December 31 and received payment on January 15, accrual accounting means you'd account for that invoice in December (when you sent it) rather than January (when it was paid.)Accrual accounting is one of two types of accounting methods, the other being cash-basis accounting. It doesn't matter which of the two you choose for your freelance business, as long as you're consistent, and it is supported by your bookkeeping software.Cash-basis accounting is a method of accounting where you report income and expenses based on when money changes hands, rather than when the money is earned. For example, if you sent out a freelance invoice on December 31 and received payment on January 15, cash-basis accounting means you'd account for that invoice in January (when you were paid) rather than December (when it was sent.)Cash-basis accounting is one of two types of accounting methods, the other being accrual accounting. It doesn't matter which of the two you choose for your freelance business, as long as you're consistent, and it is supported by your bookkeeping software.Personally, I use accrual accounting for my freelance business - and accrual accounting is supported by bookkeeping software. What's important is consistency and your understanding. Choose accrual accounting or cash-basis accounting, but make sure you know what each means in terms of how you record and report on transactions in your business.Your ""Profit and Loss (P&L)"" report is a report you can get from your bookkeeping software that shows your freelance revenue, expenses, and profits over a specific time period. You can use the information from a P&L report to accurately capture important information for your tax return.You can get a balance sheet report from your bookkeeping software. It shows the amount of money you have in your business at a specific time. Sole-proprietors and single-member LLCs generally do not need to report balances on their tax returns, whereas other types of business will do so.Filing taxes is the process of gathering information about your business, completing the relevant tax forms, and sending them to the IRS and your state's Department of Revenue. The tax software you use and your accountant can normally take care of this for you.We can break filing your taxes down into several steps:Typically, most freelancers pay three main taxes:I've created a series of freelance tax guides that can help you understand what you need to do. You might want to start with the introductory guide.You can use online tax filing software like TurboTax, H&R Block, and others. This type of software generally has a fairly extensive user guide that will help you understand how to file your taxes. As a freelance business, it's often worthwhile to work with an accountant who can help you file correctly and find tax savings.Tax filing software is online software like TurboTax, H&R Block, TaxSlayer, or TaxAct that makes it easier to file your federal and state returns. Using tax filing software means you self-report your revenue, expenses, and profits through a step-by-step process. The software will figure out the relevant deductions, credits, and expenses that you're entitled to and work out your final tax amount. Once you've reviewed the results, you can then file your taxes electronically through the software.Tax filing software is useful for very straightforward tax returns. If you have a more complex tax situation, you should speak to a qualified accountant who will be able to advise you and file a tax return on your behalf. Please note that tax return software is not suitable if you're filing as a partnership or corporation, as you'll be required to file additional forms on top of your 1040 and Schedules.Your revenue is the total amount of income you've earned through freelancing, before deducting your business expenses. Your revenue might come from the total amount you've invoiced to clients, payments received from freelancing platforms, compensation from selling your ebook or course, or any other money you've made producing freelance work. Learn more about freelance revenues.Business expenses are the products and services that your freelance business spends money on to allow you to do your work. Expenses are deducted from your revenue to calculate your profit. Typical expenses for a freelancer include things like home office deductions, computer hardware and software, payment processing fees, and similar. You typically only pay taxes on your profits, so expenses reduce your tax liability. Learn more about freelance expenses and see my guide to the expenses you may be entitled to.Please note that business expenses are not the same as an itemized deduction that some taxpayers may choose to take on their 1040.Your profits are equal to your revenue (the total amount you take in), less your expenses (the costs involved in running your business.) Taxes are normally payable on the profit that your freelance business makes, regardless of whether you take that money out of your business or not. Learn more about freelance profits.If you're a freelancer earning money from writing or another creative pursuit, then the IRS and your state will consider you to be self-employed*. This means you need to report your freelance, self-employment income to the IRS and your state, and that you'll be taxed on it.*There are a couple of circumstances where you may be classed as ""employed"" by your business (if your freelance business is an S Corporation or C Corporation you own), but that's rare and it's not covered in these guides. Your accountant will explain if that applies to you and what you need to do.In most cases, a sole-proprietor or a single-member LLC will be the most straightforward type of business structure. In some cases, though, it might be worth considering other options. I've created a guide to freelance business structures for tax purposes.If you're a sole proprietor or an LLC (and most freelance businesses will be one or the other), then the income you earn from your business ""passes-through"" to your personal 1040 tax return, where it is reported on and taxed. The IRS treats an LLC or your sole proprietorship as a ""disregarded entity,"" which isn't quite as harsh as it sounds!It means you don't need to file special, additional tax forms for your business. Instead, you file your 1040 tax forms along with the appropriate schedules to cover your freelance business and taxes.

Bringing The Sims 4 to Life One Brush Stroke at a Time,"I still remember sitting behind the family computer in the early 2000s and popping in my scratched CD of The Sims. That quiet joy in losing yourself in different stories and characters has left me with pleasant childhood memories. Even now I can hear the piano chords when you switch to Building Mode. In this world, I could infinitely create (thanks to the Motherlode cheat), embrace my inner interior designer, and remove all the ladders from the pool!The Sims grew and expanded throughout the years, promising people of all ages the chance to be creative and interact with the community they helped put together. Each time I load up the game, it feels like I'm returning home.I'm that ten-year-old sitting behind that archaic computer once more, where my only worry is matching the wallpaper with the furniture and fretting over that sour conversation that took place with another Sim. The Sims franchise holds a special place in the memories of so many.During the pandemic, I returned to it for comfort and a chance to breathe. I felt absolutely spoiled with all that Sims 4 provides: fresh adventures, new building materials, items, characters, incredible music, pets, and a variety of breathtaking locations to pick from. Before you know it, hours have passed by and whatever worry I had is long gone. That's the magic behind The Sims. That magic is only possible thanks to the creative minds, developers, and artists behind it.One artist that helped bring Sims 4 and its expansions to life is Nina Modaffari, a Maxis concept artist. She shares her journey as a concept artist in the gaming industry and her work behind Sims 4, her designs bringing brightness in this troubling year.SUPERJUMP: Most of us were kids and teenagers when The Sims game came out in 2000. For me, I have a lot of fond memories of growing up with the game and getting lost in that freedom of being able to create. What was your first experience with The Sims?Nina: My first experience with The Sims was playing the original SimCity on my old family computer. Eventually, I finally convinced my parents to let me get The Sims, and after that, it sealed my love for the franchise. Like all kids, I spent a solid amount of time in the original game placing rugs too close to fireplaces or creating endless labyrinths the likes of which the Sims would never escape.I think it was the expansion 'Makin' Magic' that got me interested in the game's art. I remember seeing nothing else like it and being so impressed by the creativity of it all. I had so many ideas for what I would add to the game myself back then and it's really funny to look back and be like - 'well I'm here!'SUPERJUMP: Now you're part of that Sims' magic! What is your role in the development of Sims 4?Nina: I am a concept artist! My job is to help bring ideas to life. I do anything from Create-a-Sim (CAS) outfits, objects, hair, environments, and sometimes even concepting out VFX.SUPERJUMP: How would you describe your art style? Is there a specific artist or style of art that inspires you?Nina: My style is very stylized, sometimes leaning towards 'cartoony'. I love pushing shape language and creating memorable silhouettes with my characters. I prefer bright and colorful pieces and a good dose of rimlight for fun. The Sims really vibed with my style because the design is focused on readability and pushing certain aspects from realistic to stylized to create iconic designs.Some of my favorite artists are Cory Loftis, Claire Hummel, Paul Richards and Alexandria Neonakis, but there are so many more it'd be impossible to name them all.SUPERJUMP: Are there any specific expansion packs or features that you absolutely adore in Sims 4?Nina: I'm a bit biased and have to say Eco Lifestyle is one of my favorites! I was so lucky to be the Create-a-Sim concept lead for that pack, so I got to work on the pack from the beginning to the very end. The theme of the pack is living one with nature and helping rebuild this neighborhood, and the outfits were a lot of upcycled stuff mixed in with some urban Japanese fashion and a healthy dose of 'hiker chic'. I'd never worked on something so unique before, and I really think that it came out amazing.SUPERJUMP: So what's a typical day on the job as a concept artist at Maxis like?Nina: I usually start off the day with a morning meeting to talk with my art lead and other artists on the same pack and check-in for what we will do that day. We also take this time to get feedback from the art director or work together to solve difficult design questions.The rest of the day is usually dedicated to drawing, occasionally taking breaks to stretch (which is very important for artists) until our 'dailies' meeting, where all the concept team shows what they're doing for the day. It's making sure everyone is on the right track and also to see what great work everyone else is doing. I usually wrap up the day around 7 pm and get ready for dinner - it's hungry work!SUPERJUMP: As one of The Sims 4 concept artists, what is your most important artist tool?Nina: I'd say the ability to always want to learn more is the most important tool you can have. Going in with an open mind and realizing that you do not, in fact, know everything, and be willing to take feedback from your fellow artists is vital. On The Sims, we work with a wide array of diverse cultures, and it is important to reach out and ask other people for help if you're not getting something. Knowing that there's always more for you to learn is a lesson that I learned quickly - and I'm honestly glad I did.SUPERJUMP: Were you always interested in being an artist in the game industry?Nina: Absolutely. From the time I first played video games, I remember wanting to be a part of the industry. My parents had asked me if I wanted to do concept art for movies or cartoons, but I was determined to do artwork for games. I think it's because of the interactivity of the medium. It's really awesome to see people creating characters with assets that I designed.SUPERJUMP: I've been excitedly watching you and your art grow over these past years! Could you share with everyone your journey in the concept art field?Nina: I started out by playing games, like many others! I remember distinctly getting art books and flipping through the pages, and it just clicked with me. I went, yep, that's what I want to do, I want to create cool monsters and characters that people will recognize and love.I went to Laguna College of Art and Design and graduated with a Bachelors in Game Art. After that, I got an internship at Disney Interactive for almost a year and got to work on some really amazing projects - it was basically my foot in the door in the industry and my first taste for what production art is really like. After my internship ended, things got tricky.The concept art field is highly competitive and sometimes it felt like there weren't many opportunities. I ended up spending two years doing contract art for companies like Bandai Namco, Hi-Rez Studios, and more. I worked at a small indie development studio for about a year before finally applying for The Sims 4 team and getting an interview! I was so excited and the day I got a call back with the offer, I screamed for joy. It was the second-best day of my life - after my wedding!SUPERJUMP: In terms of artistic design, which games or projects (that you've either played and/or worked on) have left a memorable impression on you?Nina: I think I've learned something from every game I worked on, but also every game I've played. Obviously, The Sims, for one, opened up my mind to wanting to design outfits and unique architecture, but also the freedom to create and never stop creating had a huge effect on me as an artist. I think a game that had a huge impression on me was Dishonored, because of the amazing character and environmental design. Everything in that game looked like an oil painting, and the creative decisions were absolutely fantastic.SUPERJUMP: Is there a specific type of design that you enjoy doing the most? Character design? Prop? Environments?Nina: I'd definitely say designing outfits is one of my favorite things to do! I love being able to render different materials (silk vs satin, leather vs chiffon) and also adding small details like seams or buttons to bring the entire piece together. Creating the color variations can be challenging and fun as well because you're trying to stick to the color palette of the pack's theme but also create a variety of designs that look different enough while still being cohesive.SUPERJUMP: When you're not drawing, what do you enjoy doing in your pastime?Nina: My off-hours are usually spent with my wife and two cats! I love playing video games, baking, and embroidery. I also have a really large collection of plants that I like to tend to on my weekends, rearranging and taking care of them. I also really enjoy tabletop roleplay games because it's a way for me to express my creativity without actually having to draw.SUPERJUMP: What advice would you give to aspiring artists who want to enter the concept art field?Nina: Have confidence in yourself. Seriously, it can be daunting entering this field, but if you have the spark in your heart to create and be a part of something, don't let rejection get you down. I still have over two-hundred rejection emails in my inbox that are reminders of where I came from and how hard I worked to get here. Sometimes all it takes is one email to the right person at the right time to get a response back.Success isn't linear, and sometimes there will be bumps along the road. As long as you get back up and start again, you will achieve any goal you set your mind to!SUPERJUMP: Thank you, Nina, for sharing your journey! Your work in The Sims 4 has brought incredible joy to the lives of many. A special thank you to EA and the Maxis Studio for sharing The Sims magic with us today. Can't wait to see what comes next!Make sure to follow Nina Modaffari here and check out her portfolio.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*6ePcOE6W49Drp7JvuykCHg.png,https://medium.com/super-jump/bringing-the-sims-4-to-life-one-brush-stroke-at-a-time-2cf8940d8f8b,gaming,c982d80613e046ebff9f4064e40d9db05d52d3aed33a4ff89a5fda14
How the CEO of Patreon Used Storytelling To Raise $256 Million,"What's your exact customer profile? You'll need to be able to answer this question very well in order to convince investors to take a chance on you. Jack Conte, co-founder and CEO of Patreon, learned this lesson when he started trying to raise capital. Fortunately, the fact that Jack himself is an ideal Patreon user worked in his favor.As a musician, Jack posts his work on YouTube. His videos garner an impressive average of one million views. Seven years ago, he decided to create a music video that included manufacturing a singing robot. He spent $10,000 and three months on this project.Yet, despite his YouTube popularity, this creation only made him about $150 in ad revenue. Talk about a horrible return on investment. ""It became very clear to me that there's this gap between what creators are worth in the world and their paychecks,"" Jack says.So, he came up with a way for creators to make more money for their art: Patreon. He teamed up with his former college roommate, an engineer, to bring the idea to life. Two weeks after launch, Jack - Patreon's first creator - was making six figures as an artist.But when Patreon began fundraising, the startup was plagued with rejections. Investors just didn't understand the target market enough to tie their bank account to it.In this episode of How I Raised It, Jack shares how Patreon overcame this barrier to raise almost $256 million dollars over the course of six rounds.Though Patreon ended up being quite successful at fundraising, Jack says nothing ever went as planned - it was always a struggle. In the early rounds, this was especially true. ""Everybody was saying no,"" Jack says. ""We were just getting no, no, no, no no, over and over and over again.""But each time Jack and his co-founder, Sam Yam, got knocked down, they made sure to get back up again. After each rejection, they called the investor to seek honest feedback and learn more about why he or she declined. They wanted to figure out what the disconnect was so they could improve their pitch for future meetings.""We would identify the blockers with investors,"" Jack says. ""Then we'd build stories and quantitative and qualitative models to get over those blockers. That was a really important thing: Being very clear about what the problems and blockers were and then solving them one by one.""One of the biggest concerns investors had was: What is the creator market, and how big is it really? They wanted to know how many so-called creators were out there and Jack's exact path to growing Patreon to the point where the company would be able to distribute one billion dollars among its creators.To overcome this hurdle, Jack made a second pitch deck. This one was dedicated to describing the target market. From that point forward, he started every pitch meeting with that deck in order to set crucial context.Turns out, Patreon's co-founders were spot on about the potential of the market - today, they send more than one billion dollars a year to approximately 200,000 creators. They just had to figure out how to adequately explain that to investors.When Jack first started pitching to investors, he felt intimidated and out of his element. ""I'm sitting at these tables in Silicon Valley, looking at investors, and I'm a YouTuber,"" he says. ""I had no idea how to talk to these folks.""At first, he tried quite hard to play the part of what he thought a founder or CEO should be like, rattling off endless details about Patreon's metrics and projected growth. But, ultimately, it just didn't align with who he is. It didn't feel right.So, Jack made a vital adjustment: He threw away the pretense and decided to be himself.Instead of harping on numbers, he leaned into Patreon's origin story, excitedly telling the tale of his robot music video. ""I'd spend 10 minutes showing them that I'm a crazy f*cking artist,"" Jack says. ""And I went crazy on this music video, and only got paid 150 bucks for it."" He'd then ask, ""Do you see the problem now?""This pitch resonated strongly with investors.Jack realized that what early-stage investors really care about - more than the business model or the product - is that the founder is a passionate person who's solving a real problem. They want to know that the founder cares about the issue so deeply they'll stop at nothing to fix it.""Telling [them my] story showed investors that we fulfilled those criteria,"" Jack says.For Patreon's seed round, Jack and Sam pitched between 20 to 30 investors with the hope of raising $700,000. Just a few months in, a Freestyle Capital partner decided not only to write Patreon's first check, but to invest the entire amount. Just like that, they were done raising that round - or so they thought.When Jack told the other interested firms the round was full, some pushed back. They encouraged the co-founders to raise more money so they could also take part in the seed round. Eventually, Jack and Sam agreed, and the round closed at $2.1 million.Choosing to increase your goal isn't a decision to be made lightly. After all, you don't want to take on too much money (and suffer the extra dilution). But if someone is practically begging you to let them invest, definitely consider it. It worked out pretty darn well for Patreon. ""We were able to take a few extra swings, hire a few more people, and make a few more mistakes,"" Jack says. ""So, that was really valuable.""Also, it definitely helps that re-opening the round brought on additional superstar investors like Saar Gur or CRV (formerly Charles River Ventures). ""Saar has become a very close mentor and coach to me, and has been so active and involved and so wonderful,"" Jack says.

The Man Who Built a $500bn Division Will Now Become Amazon CEO,"When Andy started working at an online bookstore in 1997, no one could have predicted he would one day be running a $1.7 trillion empire.Those first few years were far from glamorous. Amongst other things, he was Jess Bezos's personal technical assistant and floated around other roles. A more stereotypically ambitious person might have left to start their own company but Andy stuck around and as result will go down in tech history.Away from all the media attention and headlines, he created a small division called Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006. Without getting too nerdy, it provides a service to other massive companies like Netflix to host all of their content in the cloud. It is in these relative shadows where Andy operated for over a decade as he built something spectacular.You probably think Amazon's online retail division where you buy batteries is massive and you wouldn't be wrong. Yet AWS brings in over half the profits of the entire company on just 12% of the total revenue. Amazon is a cloud computing company with a side hustle of dominating global online retail.Everyone has heard of Jeff Bezos; both his flaws and gifts. It's almost reassuring to understand the mindset behind someone with such immense power in the world. Yet many of us know nothing about who Andy Jassy is and I think it's time that changed.Many entrepreneurs are obsessed with looking cool. They rush to create sleek brands and pick names with missing vowels. They want to fix a problem most people didn't even realize they had. They chase revenue numbers to brag about while at the same time have no idea how they will make a profit.Andy Jassy is made of different stuff. It took 3 years from ideation at a retreat with all the top Amazon executive to the first proper product launch for AWS. He never made revenue predictions or oversold what the division would become. The user experience of AWS is a nightmare except for people well-versed in the tech world. This is a product built for people in the know and there was no attempt to dumb it down.Though what AWS had was a clear selling point. Many businesses ran their own servers, which was often hell because of the expense and lack of flexibility. It was an unwanted burden thought necessary because it was the only safe way to store data. All Andy needed to do was prove them wrong.Many of the early clients were startups who needed computing power but didn't want to be slowed down by having to build all their own infrastructure. As these companies blossomed, so did AWS's reputation.The big transformational win came from the CIA who migrated from a legacy IBM system. If the Central Intelligence Agency could trust Andy Jassy's AWS then so could the rest of the world. It took 10 years for the first $10bn but only a year to go from $30bn to $40bn in 2020.According to some, you can never be successful unless you are your own boss. They paint being an employee as living torture and claim people need to open their eyes and be free. Andy Jassy's story is proof this hyperbole is nonsense.Andy's AWS division was valued at an incredible $500bn by the Economist. This would make it worth more than Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and put it in the top 10 publically traded companies in the world.Not bad for a guy who kept the same boss for 24 years.The truth is AWS could only have been built at Amazon. It started as a technology designed to help Amazon develop new products faster but the wider market opportunity was clear. No other company could have started building similar software and have a tech giant as a client from the start. This meant they could and they did learn faster than everyone else.Andy is a company man through and through. The Financial Times notes how often he uses company slogans to make points in his interviews. You might consider him corporate and boring but you cannot deny the impact he's had on the world. Sometimes it pays to stay at a company and be fully immersed.Usually, when an idolized founder-CEO announces they are stepping down, the stock price takes a hit. People struggled to imagine Microsoft without Bill Gates or Apple without Steve Jobs. Yet the opposite happened when Bezos stepped down.This implies stock market investors are confident in Andy Jassy's abilities though many believe Bezos will still have a hand in the company.It's not only the investors who think Amazon may be better under Andy. According to a survey, 90% of employees believe work-life balance will be improved under the new regime. The majority believe it is a ""good decision"" to make him CEO despite many taking a ""wait-and-watch"" approach.If I were to ever take over from a world-famous founder, reading how happy the employees seem to be for me would mean everything. It's a fantastic testament to his service at the company. Early AWS employee, Manny Medina calls Jassy ""Not less smart [than Bezos], just way more approachable"".To be loved by investors and employees yet unknown to the wider public is an interesting mix. It shows he is more focused on what matters than the whole world knowing how good he is. It seems Amazon is in good hands and scarily it seems Andy thinks the company has barely begun.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2500/1*uD4GfB_9TpIGQ7WY6xdAQQ.png,https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/the-man-who-built-a-500bn-division-will-now-become-amazon-ceo-b1561dd9cb24,leadership,c3364f41c8073ebde17bef30330d1144d325cfbc29c056b6885a289e
3 Missing Data Types and the suggestion to handle it,"During data cleaning and exploration, I am sure that everyone would agree that missing data is often encountered. Moreover, I usually get from people, ""What should I do with the Missing Data?"". For that question, let's define the missing data and the missing data classifications.In statistics, Missing Data is a condition where no data value is present in the variable or observation. It is different from the category ""Nothing"" or ""None"" or anything else, stating that this data belongs to some category. Missing data is just missing, no value present.Missing data could be classified based on the missing reason, they are:I often ask, ""What would you do with missing data?"" to a Data Science fresher, and most of the time, their answer would be ""Removing the data."" While it is not wrong to do this, it depends on the missing data reason.Removing missing data in the MNAR condition could lead to bias, while removing missing data in the MCAR condition would be safe. It really depends on the condition after all.So, what to do with the missing data after all? Remove or Imputation? Let's see a few methods we could do.By far, this is the most simple approach, and many people use it. What you need to do is remove the row which contains the missing data.List-Wise deletion is a safe bet if there is a large enough sample, where power is not an issue, and the assumption of MCAR is satisfied; however, when there is not a large sample or the assumption of MCAR is not satisfied. Listwise deletion is not the optimal strategy. You would introduce bias as well in this condition.Dropping variables is another viable option if there are too much missing data in your variable; However, I believe that keeping the data is a much better option than dropping it. Why? Because you still need to see what kind of missing data we are dealing with. Depend on the classification I explain above; Missing data is data itself if you classify it right.In my opinion, imputation is a much better way than deleting data.This is a basic statistical way to filling missing data; basically, you fill the missing data using the mean, median, or mode of the variable. It fills the data, assuming that the missing data would follow the variable's most frequent data.There is also a method that you could do by filling in the missing variables based on another variable, for example, in the table below.We have missing data in the age variable, and we want to fill it. Instead of taking the Age's mean, we could take the Age to mean for the Male gender.This method's weakness is that we would reduce the variance within the variable as we take the data on its own.Another way to fill the missing value is by filling it with a 0 or some constant number. It works well with categorical variables but sadly would introduce a lot of bias if you use it to numerical variables.There are many ways to impute the missing value based on machine learning, but I would only talk about the K-NN. The K-NN or k-nearest-neighbors is an algorithm used for simple classification by using feature similarity to predict the values of any new data points. The prediction comes from the closeness of the new data point with the training data.K-NN method requires the selection of the number of nearest neighbors and a distance metric. We set the K as an integer number and setting an appropriate distance metric based on the variables.The distance metric, e.g.:1. Continuous Data: The commonly used are Euclidean, Manhattan, and Cosine2. Categorical Data: Hamming distanceThis imputation works by filling in the missing data multiple times using the Multiple Imputations (MIs) concept. Multiple Imputation is better than a single imputation because it measures the uncertainty of the missing values better. For more information on the algorithm, you can check the Research PaperWe could test the method by a dataset example. If you do not have the impyute module, you should install it first.This is the mpg dataset that we have; if we examine it further, the 'horsepower' variable contains missing data.We might then want to fill the missing data by using the horsepower and weight information as it is correlated.When it is finished, you could check the missing data once more, and it surely filled by the MICE imputation.There are 3 kinds of missing data out there:How you filling the missing data thou depends on the missing data classification and what kind of trade-off you want.I hope it helps!",https://miro.medium.com/max/10944/0*ZB4D044TVAsOxIHa,https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/3-missing-data-types-and-the-suggestion-to-handle-it-75eb10bfdf3b,data-science,c8886a82df0d2442aef1bb6fc3c46cf5485b48ecdd3ce8b82f7e9c06
"A Letter, Yellowing","To Whom It May Concern,I'm kidding, don't give me that look.You probably weren't expecting a letter. I certainly wasn't expecting to write one. We both know formality has never been my strong suit, so settle in for a ramble. I'll try to keep it readable. Honestly, I've been hunched over this, pen in hand and paper crumpling, for far longer than I'd like to admit. But I find myself compelled to write. I can only hope you'll forgive me the sudden sentimentality.Yours will be the only letter I bother with, but don't read too much into that.Anyway, you recall how we used to hike the game trails in that little forest behind our home - how we used to find all those bones there? I've been thinking about that a lot lately. How surprising it was, at first. How unexpected. As though death were a superstition and we had just stumbled upon a ghost. I still remember the flare of fear in your face, flushed pink from our sprint across the moss-beds, and the sudden weight of your arms around my shoulders, your breath in my neck. To come so suddenly upon such a stark token in our verdant playground was bewildering, and more than a little unsettling.I didn't say it then, but I was terrified. Though of course you were daring as ever, and by the end of the day you had braided a flower wreath and laid it upon that mysterious ungulate's head. You mastered that fear so quickly, it drove me mad. All I could do was grimace, put up a tough front, push the shivers back down my spine and smile. Truth be told, it frightens me still, though the smile comes easier.I find myself mulling over those bones. A terrible reminder at the time, they've come to be something of a comfort. I had thought them an ignominious end to a menial life, but the more I contemplate the more they seem like a benefaction. A tribute for a home much loved. A monument to life; its end and its continuing. And as you can probably imagine, I've had plenty of time for contemplation lately.This has always been my home. From the first day in that blustery winter - so like the winter that blows outside the window now - when I looked up from dragging my little chest and suitcase and saw you across the gravel lane. From the moment you waved and my mother looked down and smiled, taking my burdens and whispering: Go on, introduce yourself. From that moment, I've been home.And I want to stay. I want to crawl outside and sink my fingers into the snow, up to my elbows, up above my spotty nose and floppy old ears. I want to remain.I daresay I understand those creatures now. Their bones lay not where they have fallen but where they lived. And now life brims within and about them. I want to remain, as they do. For I have lived as they did.And so I make a request. Yes, another one. This will be the last time, I swear.Build of me a sanctuary.Take all the pieces of me and sow them through our valley. Stack femur and tibia in the forest where unseen rascals scamper. Tie stones to sternum and drop the cage in the lake around where we used to swim. Hide vertebrae in the white rocks by the shore.Rig up the hyoid where the wind can whistle through it, like how we whistled our ditties flashing through the switchgrass. Lay scapula across our roof, where we would watch the water trickle through in the fall.Let the warblers nest beneath the sacrum's shield, make for the sparrows a perch of clavicle. String finger-bones from the old boughs we bent and stake up their saplings with sinewy humerus. Fill the parietal bone with berries, to make the pie you would bring me when I was too weak to rise out of bed.Take what's left and scatter it as dust, let the summer breeze that fluttered the towels we donned as capes carry it all away.Finally, lay my face upon your heart. Put my memory to rest in the quietest room of your mind. Forget me when you smile, and live your life as bold as we lived those springs. Those precious days passed without examination.And when you braid my wreath braid it of your favourite flowers and place it atop your own head. It would look exceeding silly on my wispy old pate.Sincerely yours,That Strange Neighbour Boy",https://miro.medium.com/max/8000/0*AEEZ4JsDgbsz-C94,https://psiloveyou.xyz/a-letter-yellowing-7375ea723bd6,fiction,c85987f5536c52be19a4c6ccc2c25b67e909d3e7e675e7fa5e7911cc
Case study: A review and critique of Spellbreak's UX,"Spellbreak is a multiplayer game from Proletariat that takes a slight variation on the traditional battle-royale shooter. They've swapped the traditional weapons of guns and grenades for magical gauntlets. I've loved playing it so far - the game is fast-paced and exciting, especially when you find yourself in multi-team brawls at the end of a match (stay tuned for my 5k highlight clip at the end of the article).As a product designer, I tend to pay a lot of attention to UI and UX in games. Spellbreak has a visually compelling UI that makes great use of audio cues, reminding me a bit of KOTOR. However, I think a few small changes to the UX would go a long way in making this an all-around great experience.A small issue I've noticed in the main menu area of Spellbreak is the lack of UI feedback when an action is taken. One example of this is inviting a friend to your lobby. When a player clicks ""Invite"", the game doesn't offer any indication that the invitation was sent. While it's easy to notice if a friend has joined your game by seeing their character in the lobby, it's always nice to have an additional confirmation when they join.One scenario to consider would be if the player clicks the Collections tab after inviting friends to their lobby. If the player is in that area of the UI swapping cosmetic items, they wouldn't be aware that a player has joined their lobby. On the Play tab, the function of the ""Party"" button is unclear. It looks like a button, but clicking it does nothing. I address some of the Play tab's UX later in this article.As a quick exercise, I put together a diagram of what the experience looks like as a reference to help form some design decisions.Let's take a look at an example from another game. As an Ubisoft product, Hyper Scape utilizes the Uplay interface for the majority of the invite experience. While this is different than how it might be handled in Spellbreak, let's take a look at the breakdown of the flow of inviting friends in the game.Inviting a friend in Hyper Scape - step by stepWhat is so great about the Hyper Scape example?A combination of Uplay and the game UI keep players abreast of the status of their squad invitations. The player doesn't feel the need to spam the invite action because they receive confirmation.What could be improved with the Hyper Scape Example?The ""game invite sent"" notification is at the very bottom of the screen and could be easily missed. The color of the notification also blends in with the neutral background of Uplay's interface, making it hard to see. This could be improved by replacing the current notification with a higher contrast version in a more prominent location on the screen.After sending an invite the player has to manually close the Uplay interface. This may be due to a technical limitation with how the Uplay integration works, but ideally after inviting a friend Uplay would automatically close and display a notification on the Squad screen. I believe it makes more sense to close the Uplay interface automatically because there are two Invite ""slots"" available and the user clicked one to open the Uplay interface. After the player invites someone the Squad screen could display the respective slot as ""pending"" with the invited player's name greyed out in that slot. Controls could also be added to allow the player to cancel a Squad invitation.One could argue that this isn't necessarily an ideal solution if playing with more than one other individual, as the player would have to reopen the menu a second time. This sort of issue could be evaluated through usability testing and analysis of usage data to see how many people play in groups of three vs. groups of two. If groups of two are more popular than I would opt for my proposed solution.For Spellbreak, I would take a feedback and information-centric approach to the lobby invite experience. Adding two basic notifications, one for invite sent, and one for player joined, would improve the experience. Below is a diagram showing how this experience would look.On the Friends page, there were a few features that were a bit confusing for me. First, I'm not entirely sure why there are two friend lists on this page - one for Epic Games Friends and one for Spellbreak Friends. Second, the status indication is broken up into two different places on the Friend UI component. The green dot on the left indicates that a friend is online. The text label on the right-hand side tells you if they are in a lobby or in-game. Third, while it may be obvious that a player needs to click on the Friend component to initiate an action, it may be hard for first-time players to know this.I would make three changes to the current design. First, I would tweak the Friends section so that it appears as one list without duplicates. Without knowing too much about why the original design decision was made, knowing that a user is your friend on Epic isn't that important in my opinion. I would also add a tooltip to the platform logo that clearly states what the Epic Games icon means to eliminate any guesswork.The second change I would make is to give the friend component a dedicated actions menu button. This clarifies that there are actions tied to each Friend in the list.The last change I would make is to combine the status indication dot with the status text description and move it into a single location on the right side of the screen. From an information architecture perspective, this allows the user to scan the name of the friend, then move their eyes to the right and see the status of the friend, before taking action and inviting them to your match. This feels like more of a logical progression. Below is a wireframe of the updated Friends screen.Another UX inconvenience I noticed playing Spellbreak was the class selection and readying-up experience. The game combines the UX for class selection and readying-up into one button. While having one button to do both actions makes for a cleaner UI, it forces the player to take three actions (or clicks) to start a game, versus one. Currently, a player has to click ""Ready"", then select their class, and finally click ""Confirm"" to lock in their choice. The ready-up button is also labeled as ""Ready"" and has no mention of class selection. Having played other battle-royale type games, this behavior was unexpected.A second issue I see is that the game does not remember the class selection from the player's previous match. This has caused me to run the Pyromancer gauntlet more times than I would have liked. This may cause players to drop from the waiting area before the game starts, degrading the playing experience for all others in the match due to a smaller pool of competitors.Let's take a look at how Apex Legends handles this sort of interaction. In Apex, the act of readying-up is separate from class selection. To select their Legend (what Apex calls their classes), a player clicks the corresponding tab up at the top of the screen. Their selection persists, so they don't have to perform this action between matches.What could be improved with the Apex experience?I would move the Legends selection from the top navigation down to a button above ""Ready."" This is a better approach because selecting your Legend is directly related to gameplay and is an action players are likely to take before readying-up. In contrast, changing load-outs or visiting the store is not directly related to in-game performance. The ""Legends"" tab should be accessible from inside of the ""Play"" tab for information architecture purposes since it's directly related to playing a game.I would also relabel the button as ""Switch Legends"", since ""Legends"" does not sound actionable. Within the Legends menu, a confirmation button should be added so the player is not forced to hit escape to return to the main menu. It wasn't immediately clear to me what I was supposed to do after clicking on a different Legend to select one for my next match.I tried improving the Spellbreak class selection UX by separating it from the ""Ready"" action. I also removed the Party button and replaced it with class icons on each player, adding text below each player indicating whether or not they are ready. Ideally, each player's class selection will be saved so that a new game is only one click away.Further improving the class selection experienceOne feature I've enjoyed with Hi-Rez Studio's game ""Realm Royale"" is the ability to change my class while waiting for a match to start. While it's nice that Spellbreak currently allows you to pick up a secondary gauntlet to test while in the waiting area, players aren't able to switch primary gauntlets.If I'm solo-queueing duos, I won't be able to coordinate gauntlets with my partner ahead of the match and might queue with a fellow Stoneshaper. Pairing with the same gauntlet is not ideal because players have to share rarer gauntlet drops and cannot combo the elemental effects of their attacks. A lot of people I played with agreed, wishing they could change their gauntlet right up until they drop into the match. A bonus of adding a feature like this is that players may be less likely to leave games early. If they realize they chose the wrong gauntlet, they can switch instead of quitting. I've had teammates disconnect while playing squads and have had to play quite a few matches without a third.As a new player, the post-match screen was a little confusing. When players acquire a new item, it's not inherently clear what the item is. That's not to say the rest of the page isn't clear and well thought-out. I like that item drops don't appear until after the experience points have been applied to the player's current levels on the left-hand side of the screen. This makes a lot of sense because it helps the player associate their match performance with the receipt of a new item. However, the items the player receives aren't clearly labeled. As a new player, I'd be excited to earn an item drop, but am not sure how excited I should be as I don't know what that item is used for.Fortnite does a great job of labeling each drop you get. Not only do they clearly label the item, but they also offer a visual example of what the item looks like in action.A minimal improvement that would go a long way would be to simply add an item type text label to each item a player receives. I would argue that the class associated with the item isn't as helpful, so that text could be swapped out for the item's type.All this being said, Spellbreak is a great game. It's a refreshing change from the guns and gore of traditional arena-based multiplayer games. I highly suggest checking out the game - it's free to play! I'm sure that like me, you'll enjoy Spellbreak's unique art style, fast-paced gameplay, and enjoyable team-based combat.I'll close with a recent highlight of a match I played a couple of days ago where I landed a 5k.

The Real Reason the Electric Vehicle Revolution Is So Hot,"Over the last few months, three big U.S. electric vehicle charging companies have announced multibillion-dollar reverse mergers to take themselves public. In the latest, Volta Industries said Monday that it will go public at a value exceeding $2 billion and walk away with $600 million in cash to build out its charging network. It is part of a massive expansion of EV charging that is underway - one that, according to McKinsey, will grow to as many as nine million U.S. charging points by 2025.The public consensus about our EV charging future - from industry experts, analysts, and investors - is unusually unified: What we pay for our electric fill-ups is modest and will continue to be, making the prospects of EV ownership much more affordable than the gasoline-propelled past. This is almost certainly true - but only for the next few years. Currently, charging companies supply electricity as a loss leader, since EVs cost considerably more than the equivalent conventional vehicle. While establishing their market, these companies must more or less give away the electricity in order to get people to buy the vehicles and begin building charging brand loyalty. It's a version of the freemium model - cheap until you are hooked.But beginning around the middle of the decade, increasingly cheap batteries will bring down EV prices, and the vehicles will begin to cost the same or less than their conventional cousins. EV sales will naturally rise, and they may even go mass-market. At that stage, charging station proprietors will be liberated to raise the price of an electricity fill-up. And they will do so.That's why charging company SPACs are worth $2 billion-plus valuations today: Like broadband, streaming, and cellphone companies today, charging will be a good business, earning high profits to fill up your EV. It's true that the future of EV ownership will look simpler and cheaper, since electric vehicles contain relatively few parts. But the ""fill-up,"" as we have come to call buying gasoline, is almost certainly going to cost about the same.EV fill-ups will probably continue to be cheap for slow, ""Level 2"" charging - giving you 20-to-40 miles of added battery during the hour you plug in while having a bite at a nearby restaurant or going shopping. But if you want to be at 80% of your battery, and don't have a big chunk of your day to wait, you will opt for fast-charging, and that is where you will pay the big bucks. As evidence, look no further than Europe, where EV sales are the highest in the world. One widely dispersed charging network is Ionity: When you charge your 75 kWh EV to 80% of capacity from 10%, it will cost you roughly $50, a third cheaper than gasoline, say, in France, and around the same on average as filling your whole tank in the U.S.Volta currently has about 2,000 chargers at some 500 sites in 23 states, and now has the money to add a lot more, including 100 fast charging points this year alone. Tyler Lancaster, a principal with Energize Ventures and a lead investor in Volta, told me that under the startup's current business model, it earns its money selling digital advertising that motorists watch on screens while they are filling up. In the future, he said, Volta will raise prices for fast charging, but only a bit. ""Fast charging won't be free, but it will be priced modestly per kWh,"" he said.Lancaster disagrees with my thesis that fast-charging prices are likely to be modeled on the tank of gasoline. The argument is that, in most cases, people will charge up at home while they sleep at night, while parked at work, or while out on errands. But think of how people really behave: Suddenly, you realize you're late for a meeting, late to drive the kids somewhere, or (before the pandemic) late to get to work. You forgot to fill up the car. Without much of a thought, you zip down to the gas station, pump a bit of gas, and you are on your way. That is the EV future - a frequent demand for fast charging, supplied at a premium.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12244/1*TAnX8A-kiga5PdssB_gf8w.jpeg,https://marker.medium.com/the-real-reason-the-electric-vehicle-revolution-is-so-hot-5da8bfe5062e,business,c99336311ab7749caf75c72ebc90e49fece63bb819e7406d6a71769c
Why Entrepreneurs Aren't Getting the Help They Need,"Today's entrepreneur has an unprecedented number of options to get the help, advice, and answers they need to start their own companies, build innovative products, and make a positive economic impact on their communities.So why aren't they getting it?The answer might surprise you.Earlier this week I had a call with an entrepreneur halfway around the world who was in the same space as me and facing the same problems.He, like me, had already had a decent amount of prior success. At some point on his entrepreneurial journey, he heard a calling to help other entrepreneurs overcome the same obstacles he had faced and was still facing.There are a lot of ways for entrepreneurs to answer that call. His own calling had led him to construct a network of experts to create content and give time to the thousands of entrepreneurs that his network could potentially reach.My own calling is Teaching Startup, startup advice and answers on demand via a newsletter and app. So of course I was interested to learn anything I could from his experience. One of the first things he said surprised me, but only for a moment:""We have an ample supply of qualified experts. In fact, we have excess capacity.""Yeah, at first that surprised me, in a good way actually, because Teaching Startup has a ton of demand that could really benefit from that excess capacity. But the surprise wore off after thinking about it. His assessment is not only spot on, but it's also not uncommon.There's actually a ton of available help out there for entrepreneurs. But ""help"" has been defined the same way for decades and offered the same way over those decades, and the results have been lacking, at best.I talk a lot about how entrepreneurship thrives when it can find and exploit a market imbalance caused by, say, a breakthrough in technology. But people don't buy technology, they buy the benefits of that technology.Often times the catalyst for realizing the benefits of a breakthrough comes down to looking at how things have always been done and asking why, then offering an alternative.Teaching Startup is the alternative to decades of the same startup help offered the same way. We've reimagined how advice and answers get delivered to the entrepreneur, based on my 20+ years of experience with my own calling. That experience includes starting and selling a company called ExitEvent that reimagined startup help once before.I took a look at startup advising, something else I've been doing for a long time, and I started to ask why we keep doing it the same way, saying the same things, and expecting different results.So I did what I would do with any other startup - I redeveloped the product into something that offered better value more quickly to more people at a lower cost, leaning on breakthroughs in technology that have happened in just the five years since I sold ExitEvent.I removed friction, cut unnecessary fluff, and moved the most important and valuable parts from the back to the front. I made an app for it, designed it to be on-demand, and I eschewed trends that didn't add value. Then I quickly went from prototype to MVP to pilot to the real thing.The result is Teaching Startup, and the goal is to make more and better entrepreneurs at all stages with a wider availability at a fraction of the cost. We're getting it done, with a 93.3 NPS and 79% of paying members agreeing it can be an effective substitute for a traditional advisor - at $10 a month.I'm building and running it like a startup, so I want to see if you agree. You can get a free 30-day trial and use invite code NEWWAY to get your first paid month after the trial for $5. If you want to cancel, you can do that from any email. We know Teaching Startup isn't for everyone, we just think it's a better way to get more entrepreneurs the help they need.Because it's out there.If you don't want to join Teaching Startup, but you found what I had to say here insightful, please consider signing up for my personal newsletter at joeprocopio.com so you don't miss any new posts.

"What Public, Private & Independent Schools Can Learn About Membership From Silicon Valley Subscription Companies","The past year has been a difficult one for schools.It sometimes seems like everything's in flux.Many families have changed strategies. Some have left traditional schools to join neighborhood pods. Others have gone from independent schools to public schools to save money. At the same time, some public school families have gone private, fleeing the chaos of the public school system. And, to make things more complicated, some students have moved out of the area, but are still learning virtually from their original school.Schools are left wondering - will the students who left come back? Will the new families stay beyond this year? And is virtual learning going to be part of our new normal?In this uncertain time, loyalty has never been more important.I've devoted much of my career to helping organizations build loyalty, building the kind of ""forever transactions"" that justify predictable recurring revenue.So the question is, does what I've learned working with subscription businesses and membership organizations apply at schools?My answer is yes...and I'll show you why. But first, let me tell you how I came to be so interested in this question of how organizations build loyalty so deep and so trusted, that customers take off the consumer hats, don their membership hats and stop looking for alternatives.I first got interested in this topic about twenty years ago. I had just been laid off from my job at a software company the day I got back from maternity leave with my second child Annabel. I decided that for the next few years at least, I needed to control my work, and consulting seemed like a good solution. Well, my fifth client was Netflix. I had already fallen in love with Netflix as a subscriber. As a new mom, I loved always having something to watch, and never having to leave home to return a DVD, and most of all, I loved no late fees.As a business person though, I think I loved them even more, after all, predictable recurring revenue is the holy grail for businesses. It helps us plan for the future, lets us understand our best customers better and optimize future products and services based on what we learn, and of course, businesses with recurring revenue enjoy much better valuations than their more episodic counterparts.Today, subscriptions are everywhere and nearly every organization leader understands the power of recurring revenue, engagement and loyalty - everyone - organizations big and small, public and private, not for profit and profit driven, around the world and across all segments.But back when I was falling in love with Netflix, it was early. Slowly though, I started getting calls from all kinds of organizations that wanted to be the Netflix of news, music, bicycle parts, associations, dental pain management products, insurance...you name it, someone wanted to Netflix it.So I started digging into this question. What did it mean to be 'like Netflix""? I looked for patterns and for what was applicable across organizations. I begin to notice that many organizations were focusing on access over ownership. On prioritizing many small transactions over a single big one. How they began investing not just in one way communication where the organization has a loudspeaker and the customer just has to listen to not just two way communication, but multidirectional communication where members connect and find value in community under the brand of the organization.The first thing I noticed was that Netflix did one thing for subscribers, promising to ""provide professionally created catalog of video content, delivered in the most efficient way possible, with cost certainty"". Over time, they've evolved HOW they delivered on this promise, from DVDs to streaming content, from other people's content to their own proprietary shows - but they haven't changed the promise itself.The second thing I noticed was that their most important metric was retention. Acquisition of new customers was important, but only ""counted"" if the customers fit their profile, because they understood their ideal customer so well. They had confidence that if they attracted a new subscriber with their message and their trial, that person was extremely likely to stay for a long time. They knew how to onboard a new subscriber to engage them. They knew that there were certain early behaviors that indicated whether someone was likely to stay - things like how many titles were in their queue or how many categories of content they consumed. People are much more likely to stay if they're watching both rom coms and documentaries for example. I wish more people focused on retention more carefully - it's just not a very sexy metric. And engagement is the early predictor of retention - recency, frequency breadth and depth of activities.The third thing I noticed was that they were continuously experimenting with the ""how"" of their delivery. They tried time sensitive downloads, streaming through video game consoles, and all kinds of content. The service they offer today looks nothing like the red envelopes of 2002, but the promise is the same.So how does this apply to schools?Well, the first thing is the importance of a clear forever promise. Your brand promise is the promise of what your organization stands for. Your Forever Promise is the promise you make to your customers. What is it that you promise them in exchange for their loyalty and support? As long as you stick with us, we promise you this outcome - that we will do everything we can to help you achieve THIS ongoing goal or avoid THAT ongoing problem.1. First, What is your forever promise? How clear is it to your members? And who are you making this promise to? Who are your best members? And what do you expect from them in return? The clearer you are about your forever promise and best member, the easier it is to predictably help your members achieve their dearest goals. Also, how are you handling the gap between the public promise you make aloud -building global citizens, preparing young people for a meaningful life - may not be the one that your families think they're getting - i.e. getting their child into a top college. If you have a public promise and a ""secret"" promise, that can lead to complexity, confusion and other challenges. Being clear about what you're really promising, and standing by it, is key to attracting, engaging and winning lifetime loyalty.2. The second thing, retention - this is the heart of loyalty. There is often a period after someone joins your organization when they're still wearing their consumer hat. They're still thinking about whether the should stay, and how they might leave. In the Membership Economy, the transaction, the moment someone joins your organization is the starting line for the real work of building loyalty. It's not the finish line. From the moment someone joins, you need to choreograph their first seconds, minutes, days after making this commitment, to help them decide that your organization is going to be part of their everyday habits.The way you choreograph this onboarding experience is by looking at your best members - the ones I call superusers - who go beyond just being good citizens, who support you and recognized that you provide good value and use the products and services you provide appropriately and well. The superusers go beyond just being good members, because they contribute their own time and money toward the good of the organization.Superusers are the students who build community and take on the less popular leadership roles. They're the parents who volunteer for the spring play. And of course, many go well beyond paying tuition, donating countless dollars - and hours - to attract new members, onboard them, and improve the experience for them. Superusers are the flywheel for schools. So how do you make more of them?If you're a superuser, I want you to think way back to when you first became familiar with your school. If you're a school head, I want you to think of a superuser who you wish you had more of! Think about the earliest interactions. Why did you join? How did you learn about the school and its traditions? At what moment did you take off your consumer hat, and become a member, not looking for alternatives? And when and why did you decide to start volunteering and donating? Did someone ask you? Did something touch your heart? One association I worked with noted that most of their superusers were invited to join by their bosses or mentors, who encouraged volunteering. It's often a personal friendship and invitation that launches the superuser journey. It can be really helpful to understand what experiences makes someone engage and commit, and build them into the onboarding process for every member.3. The third area for focus is in experimentation. If your forever promise is ""creating global citizens"" what is the best way to deliver on that promise in today's environment? Very often organizations launch around a promise, create a solution that is best in that moment, and then stop focusing on the promise and start focusing on the original solution as a product. For example, I do a lot of work with newspapers. Many of them have a ""forever promise"" that is something like this ""a trusted source to help subscribers understand the world around them, so they can make better decisions"". That promise doesn't mention paper at all. And yet many newspapers have been dragging their feet in the shift from print to digital. If you were starting fresh today with the goal of helping young people understand the world around them and make better decisions, how would you do that? Would you use classrooms at all? 6 hour days? Or would you design something different? Even as the promise stays constant, the way you deliver on that promise, the products and services you offer, need to be continually changing.Maybe you'd offer courses, or conferences, or study tours, or community, or research resources, or access to experts....You could go beyond content to include the powerful triumvirate of Content, Commerce and Community. The possibilities are endless.If you were starting today, and weren't burdened by your successful legacy, and by the power of tradition, but wanted to achieve your same forever promise, what features and benefits might you invest in?If there's ever been a moment where the spirit of continuous innovation is needed, it's right now. In some ways, COVID, the political divide, the movement for racial justice have created tremendous upheaval. That's true.But with that upheaval comes permission to move more quickly, to experiment more radically. Even low level employees are being given new opportunity to bring ideas to the table, share their technical expertise, be more fully involved in finding rapid solutions. Organizations that have historically innovated only slowly and methodically are now racing to solve problem after problem as they emerge.Never before have organizations been so motivated to set aside their beloved processes and products and rethink the best ways to deliver what is needed to solve their members problems and help members achieve their goals.The fact that families are rethinking what they had thought was a ""forever transaction"" with their schools, both public and independent, means there's an opportunity to attract, onboard and engage new members, as well as an opportunity to prove your worth to your longtime members.The easiest step you can take is actually the most powerful. Take a step back before you step forward. Look at what you're offering your students, parents, and alums, today. Compare it to the forever promise you made to them. If you were starting fresh, what else would you do to help them achieve their goals and reduce their problems? What new tools do you have available, and how can you use them creatively?A big part of building loyalty is being willing to evolve to solve the long-term problem or achieve the long term goal - because it makes members confident that the organization is looking out for them. Now is that kind of a moment.The secret to a Forever Transaction is to love your members and the forever promise you make to them more than any product or process. If you focus on your members and their long-term goals, you'll build the kind of trust and loyalty that will last forever.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*Tn1LEokC-1UxidOo,https://medium.com/swlh/what-public-private-independent-schools-can-learn-about-membership-from-silicon-valley-aac201e67451,business,cae7d9096efe684e509c31b79c061c1104e3dac1ebd638de884d28e5
Listening to Machines,"How do you teach an AI to walk?Generally speaking, you don't. Artificial Intelligence, as we typically use the term right now, means a computational system that learns through pattern-spotting and self-correction, so you don't so much teach it as create a setting in which it can teach itself. If you want an AI to walk, you provide a set of constraints - gravity exists, bodies are made of connected parts, the ground pushes back when you push on it - and give it a challenge, like moving a certain distance. Then you step back and let it learn, and often marvel at the results.A recent paper entitled ""The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution,"" published by a conglomerate of European and North American researchers, is packed with technically correct AI-devised solutions to the locomotion problem that are also, by any traditional measure, wrong. There's the AI that when asked to evolve a virtual robot able to move a certain distance, created a tower-like structure of requisite height and simply had it fall over. Eventually, it learned to sort of somersault upon landing, thereby ""walking"" a bit further. Yet other AIs solved problems by spotting and exploiting bugs in a system, like a video game that doesn't count a death if the player kills an enemy in the process, prompting the AI to ""win"" by repeatedly committing suicide.This is just a tiny subset of the delightful accidents that machine learning can make, but it illustrates something bigger about AI that most of us non-researchers are still only vaguely aware of: AI is ""intelligent"" in a way that looks nothing like human intelligence. We're talking about machines, algorithms, and networks of data and code, after all, not squishy gray matter bathed in fluid and plagued by emotions. Human brains are the product of millions of years of evolution in a complicated social-physical world, so obviously we're going to think differently than any digital entity, even one we designed.As humans, we tend to expect human-like behavior from AI anyway. Crystal Rutland, the UX designer who organized the ""Empathy and AI"" talks at Design Week Portland this year, notes that human beings have an instinct for empathy, and automatically attach human-like qualities to just about everything we encounter. The more intelligent something appears, the more we tend to see ourselves in it.This helps explain why so much science fiction over the years has depicted AI as something that's almost human, except for a single quality, like an absence of morals (The Terminator) or an overly literal worldview (Commander Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation). This lets artificially intelligent characters serve as a foil to the humans around them, providing a cautionary example or casting our own flaws into sharp relief. The android Bishop does the latter in Aliens, with his calm pragmatism and self-sacrifice. However, all of these examples are grounded in the unspoken assumption that a sufficiently intelligent machine will communicate more or less like a human.The reality is turning out to be different. For several years now we've had virtual assistants that combine voice interaction with some degree of artificial intelligence to perform helpful services through a conversational interface. But if you've ever used Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, you already know how limited those ""conversations"" can be: confined to a small vocabulary, and bound by a semantic straightjacket that forbids the kind of multi-layered, wandering requests that we often take for granted in human discussion.Simulating human conversation, in fact, turns out to be one of the hardest tasks facing AI experts. Amazon has put enormous effort into this problem over the last few years, most famously through the Alexa Prize, which offers large cash incentives to the world's foremost AI researchers in pursuit of one of the Holy Grails of human-computer interaction: 15 minutes of small talk. So far, even the most successful efforts can only maintain the easy give-and-take of human discussion for a few minutes at a time, before being derailed by a non sequitur or a casual reference to a topic from a few seconds earlier.Even the most advanced AI is still idiotic at certain things that humans do as a matter of habit. They don't generally understand analogies, make leaps of insight, or synthesize unconnected information into more abstract concepts. They're rarely able to consider context or environment, or to break a cognitive thread and pick it back up again. They're not empathetic to humans, because they're not humans. As a recent WIRED story on the Alexa Prize points out, ""Twenty minutes of small talk with a computer isn't just a moonshot, it's a trip to Mars.""But the qualities that make AI different from humans also make it uniquely insightful, in ways that have nothing to do with humanity. An intelligence that learns through rapid trial and error unencumbered by a lifetime of context is going to see what's in front of it with exceptional clarity. Growing two meters tall and falling over is an obvious way to travel two meters...if you've never heard of walking. This kind of useful ignorance can shine a light on our own assumptions, and lead to extraordinary creativity. Properly directed, AIs have the potential to be world champion out-of-the-box thinkers. But are we ready to hear what they have to say?The advent of smart speakers means there's now a critical mass of people who talk to rudimentary AIs every day. According to most reviewers' accounts (and personal experience), early interactions with them tend to alternate between useful responses, entertaining pleasantries, and a steady progression of dumb mistakes - unrequested music at random moments, and lots of ""I'm sorry, I don't know."" But eventually, regular users of smart speakers learn the routine: certain phrases that almost always work, the pared-down syntax of machine communication, and an acknowledgement that this isn't a pleasant human in a sleek cylinder. They learn, in other words, to speak machine.Those assistants are going to get a lot smarter, but they're never going to be human. The rapid trial-and-error training process of machine learning allows AI to absorb immense amounts of information, and eventually handle tasks ranging from driving to medical diagnoses to financial trend spotting, with a facility unmatched by humans. This is certain. But it's not going to make them experience the world like humans, or behave like them. And really, there's little reason they should, except to make us more comfortable.At a certain point, the question of AI communication starts to feel like just another round of the long-running Skeuomorphism Debate: to what degree should we clothe new technology in the trappings of the old, in order to ease its acceptance? Early email interfaces used envelope icons; early graphical operating systems explicitly referenced a desktop; early automobiles resembled horse-drawn carriages (minus the horses) - not because it was efficient, but because it was recognizable. Eventually these references faded away, and today we have a Gmail interface that looks entirely digital, and is far more powerful and flexible for not relying on the analogy of paper letters.Our desire to talk to AIs like we talk to people could be thought of as a version of that tendency, and we'll eventually shed that too. When you imagine AI interfaces of the future, don't think of talking to a pseudo-human. Imagine something else: a human-machine language that we haven't yet defined.This idea isn't new. Cyborg anthropologist Amber Case points out that the concept of ""non-human allies"" has been used to describe technology for years, often comparing it with another intelligence that we habitually anthropomorphize: dogs.Dog owners love to talk about their pets as if they were people; successful dog trainers are quick to point out how misguided this is. Read practically any guide to canine discipline or behavior, and the central message is invariably one of respect for canine otherness. Dogs are intelligent, emotional, and responsive, but they aren't people, and the first step to getting along with them is learning to treat them like dogs. Common techniques like using firm, repeated commands when communicating, and establishing yourself as a ""pack leader"" all arise from this concept.Computers aren't dogs, but the underlying idea of respecting an alternate form of intelligence is similarly helpful. Dogs can be trained to do useful things like sniffing for explosives or guiding blind owners through busy streets, but they remain dogs. AI is already navigating us through busy streets too, as well as helping us process complex data, and improving web search results, but it remains AI.Developing a healthy relationship with this increasingly intelligent, non-human ally will depend on our ability to respect its otherness. When we view AI as something like a person, we expect it to have human morals and insights, and to see the world in similar ways as we do. This can blind us to its potential uses as well as its misuses.AI algorithms have helped spread fake news on Facebook, and pushed inflammatory videos on unsuspecting YouTube viewers. An AI-enabled car hit and killed a woman in Arizona recently, and AI-powered autonomous weapons are already being tested by multiple governments. None of these are inherently evil, just as a hunting dog who bristles and chases after a squirrel isn't evil; both are doing what they've evolved to do, with some influence from the humans who trained them. In the case of AI, though, humans are also the ones creating the environment in which they evolve.So we have several tasks before us. We need to take extreme care in how we train these artificially intelligent beings, by providing them with information and environments that lead them toward empathy and instill in them values that align with humanity's. But we also need to accept their limitations, and ours. We can't build other humans - only nature can do that. But we can build something wonderful and constructive, as long as we're willing to talk, and listen, to it as something separate from ourselves.Originally published at www.designweekportland.com.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*JfShmUuqpl2BnbLT,https://medium.com/the-protagonist/listening-to-machines-6a5ad0248343,artificial-intelligence,cb152c363437b7216c0d907f5b9b24c24d456d59bd01f1e53cd03b9d
Can We Beat The Bookies? Predicting Football Games With a Simple Model,"Football is considered one of the most beautiful games because of how unpredictable it is. Underdogs' wins and comebacks make some games hard to predict, even for expert bettors.However, things change when it comes to making a model that predicts all the games in a league. A season is a long competition with many ups and downs for even the most powerful clubs, but in the end, just a couple of teams are serious candidates to win a league. It's no coincidence that the winners of La Liga, Serie A and Bundesliga were almost the same in the last decade.As a bettor, I know that I can't predict that Liverpool would lose 7 -2 to Aston Villa, but as a data scientist, I know that it's possible to make a simple model that helps increase the chances of winning a bet.Let's predict football games matches for the top 4 European leagues! First, I'll show you where you can get the data I'm using, then we'll build the model together and in the end, I'll tell you how this helps me in sports betting.We need three inputs to build the model: historical data, the current table, and the matches left. Luckily, the historical data of football matches in many leagues are ready to use in CSV format on this website.Although the website contains football data for many seasons, I'll only consider the past 5 seasons. There's some debate about how much historical data is necessary for building a model. In my experience betting on football, I consider the last 5 years enough to make good predictions.Too much past data could make our model less accurate. Football clubs, rules and players change a lot over the years. Ten years ago, there was no VAR to correct referee decisions and 15 years ago, there was no Messi winning games on his own for Barcelona.Note: I also used this data to build a profitable betting tool with Python's Selenium and Pandas. In the article below I show the full code and explain how I did it.You could download the .csv files one by one or let a Python for loop do the job for you with the following code:With this simple code, we stored the data from season 15/16 in a dictionary called dict_historical_data. After this, we just have to rename the keys. For example 'SP1' represents 'la_liga'. Those details can be found on my Github.There are many websites that show the current positions and the matches left in many leagues. Just google it and copy and paste the necessary data.I already built a CSV file with the table and upcoming matches for the top 4 leagues. You can find the files on my Github.We should always know the math before writing any code and this time is no exception.If you watch a football game at least once, you know that a player could score a goal at any time during the match. This is a histogram of the number of goals in every match over the past 5 years for the top 4 leagues.It's no surprise that Bundesliga has the highest average number of goals (2.91), but if you see the 4 graphs closely, you'll notice that all of them have something in common - their distributions have a common fit curve. It's the Poisson distribution!Some of the reasons are these:Above all, we're trying to make this simple. We could add more variables to increase the accuracy of predictions, but for now, let's do it the easy way.So we're dealing with a discrete probability distribution of the number of events occurring in a given time period. If we consider a goal as an event that might happen in the 90 minutes of a football match, this makes more sense.As we can see in the formula above. The Poisson distribution requires 2 inputs lambda and x. In our analysis lambda would be the median of goals in 90 minutes. This could be the median of goals of a home team, away team or in the league. On the other hand, x is the number of goals in a match that could be scored by Team A or Team B.To predict the winner of a match, we need to calculate a team's strength within a league. To do so, I use the function calculate_strength that returns a data frame with a normalized number of goals scored and conceded by all teams that played in the top 4 leagues over the past 5 years.Below you can find an example of the strength of Premier League teams. For example, Manchester City is the team with the best attack at home, while Leeds has one of the highest numbers of goals conceded in away matches.A game between these two teams would increase the number of goals in the match and also increase the chances of Manchester City winning the match.After obtaining the strengths for the 4 leagues, we create another function that simulates all the possible outcomes between all the remaining games. This function uses the previous one that calculated the strength of each team. Lambda was calculated with the formula lambda = home_scored * away_conceded that represents the probability of a goal scored by the home or away team.Also, we need to set limits for the number of goals used in the simulations. Since teams like Bayern Munich are setting the bar high lately, we'll use a limit of 10 goals scored for each team at most.For each iteration, we calculate the Poisson formula previously shown. In this case, the parameters are the number of goals scored (x) and the average goals scored (lamb_home and lamb_away). Instead of writing the formula, we use poisson.pmf function from the scipy library.The result would be classified into 3 categories: win, loss or draw. After that, we use the formula 3*prob_home + prob_draw to find how the 3 points in the football match are distributed between the 2 teams. When the chances of a home team to win the match are 100%, then points_home would be 1 and the home team would get 3 points. The same idea goes for draws.Finally, we execute the 2 functions created with the following code:Inside the for loop, we store the results of each game in list_points_home and list_points_away and also, we update the table after every game is simulated.The prediction for the 4 leagues are the following:Here you can find the result of each game in the season.These predictions are helpful if you like to bet on full-time live results (1x2). Imagine a favorite team is losing in the first half, then betting on a comeback or a draw would pay way more than betting on the prematch. However, before placing a bet, you should also consider the underdog's chances of winning the match.This is when the model comes in handy. By searching the team name in the prediction table, you can easily see their chances of winning and decide if they're good or bad underdogs.I'll use Bayern Munich as an example. Bayern's previous first-half results were 0-2 (losing to Mainz) and 2-2 (draw with Borussia M'gladbach). We don't need the model to remind us how a great team is Bayern Munich, but if you know little about Bundesliga, the model can show you the chances of Mainz holding the victory or Borussia M'gladbach keeping the draw.By typing the name of a Bundesliga team in the table above, you will obtain that Mainz has a score of 0.5, which means low chances of winning the match even though they're 2 goals ahead. On the other hand, M'gladbach has 0.8 when playing home, which isn't bad if you compare it with other Bundesliga teams.If we knew nothing about Bundesliga, we could say that M'gladbach has more chances of at least getting a draw than Mainz winning or obtaining a draw.These were the real results of the matches:So the model is helpful after all! M'gladbach even managed to win the match. Naturally, if you use this as a guide to betting in the prematch, the profit would be little, but if you use it wisely when the favorite team is not winning, then the returns would be higher.These are just 2 matches. Hopefully, at the end of the season, I'll be able to make a better comparison.This model is far from perfect. Actually, its simplicity makes it less proper for certain scenarios. For example, in the analysis of a football match, I only considered head to head historical data. In real life, this would not be enough for me to place a bet. I'll still need data about the performance of the home team playing home and away team playing without the home advantage.I still consider it really good for predicting leagues' winners and a good guide when a favorite team is not winning a match. In a league or a cup, football teams have many ups and downs, but at the end of the day ...",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*j1ivoeEs0TsU-sfmNN2pPg.jpeg,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/can-we-beat-the-bookies-predicting-football-games-with-a-simple-model-43fe020fb384,data-science,cbc4b00aafb60201104ed06065a54f2e1aadf8362ecba0da7217d6e0
4 ways to make the jump from graphic design to user experience,"Let's be honest, the title ""Graphic Designer"" is not as glorified and romantic as it once was. There used to be a time when, at least for me, every other commercial, advertisement, etc. was click-baited with ""Become a graphic designer in 3 months"". It seemed like every portrayal of a ""modern cool/hip person"" was some variation of a graphic designer. Today, that is not the case. And to be frank, I think social media and the wave of creators equipped with wide spread graphic tool accessibility is responsible for that change whether you deem it good or bad. Today, the hottest role seems to be the digital ninja who can visualize and activate data, understand and articulate business principles while also speaking developer, do surface level research, grasp human-computer interaction psychological rules, and finally, design a visually appealing ""thing"". Enter: the UX Designer.Graphic Design in its most simplified explanation is: visual communication. There will ALWAYS be a need for visual communication and that need will be filled by people who not only enjoy it but are good at it. You know, the people who have a knack for the visuals. But, if you find yourself wanting to do something a little different, feel stuck where you are as a graphic designer, or maybe you just aren't enjoying working only the visual side of things, there is another option. If you are truly ready to make the jump, pivot away from your graphic design career, and step into an exciting user experience role; follow these four steps.I know, you are thinking, ""Oh great, here comes another perseverance chat about working day and night and never giving up"". In some ways, yes, that is what this means. But nothing worth having is ever easy. One of my favorite quotes from a popular career advisor and radio personality, Ken Coleman, states, ""If your why doesn't make you cry, the price of commitment will"". There will never be the perfect time, opportunity, book, course, teacher, etc. The difference between those who find success and those who don't always starts with taking the first step.One of the practical ways that I firmly believe makes switching from graphic design to user experience possible is obsessing over it. This may seem unconventional and some people may stop reading right here, but I truly believe that obsessing over the arena and immersing yourself in it will help ease fear and self doubt. Here are some easy ways to do that:Some will say this can cause ""burnout"" or cause you to have an overload of information, give you unrealistic expectations, etc etc. The people saying that are the same ones that are worried that you are going to succeed and take their job one day. If you have not noticed already, there are a LOT of gatekeepers in the UX field and they are always willing to lend a negative comment. Block it out and keep moving.I have always been a learn-by-doing person who dives head first into the deep end. Some people prefer to dip their toes in and test the waters. But I believe the quickest way to familiarize yourself with an arena is to go all in. This method usually causes a good amount of initial failure and some ""wow I looked stupid"" moments which is the perfect recipe for explosive personal growth. The perfect time to start is right now. (after you finish reading, of course!)If you want to make a meaningful career shift and pivot from graphic design to user experience, you have to embrace a change in your thinking. If you get uneasy, anxious, and fearful about new things being shaken up, you are normal. But I believe it is important to recognize that feeling for what it is and push past it. Here is my case for embracing it. Change is inevitable. Everything in this world changes and nothing stays the same so why not put yourself in a place both mentally and physically to be successful. I am going to outline some areas that are crucial for a change in thinking when shifting from graphic design to UX.As someone who has a degree in Graphic Design, I can say with confidence that graphic designers and UXers are taught to view problems and how to solve them in a very similar way. Process oriented, homework first mentality, and the ability to ball up your ego and throw it in the nearest garbage can. However, there are some key differences that you need to start changing in order to find success in your transition to UX.Graphic design and UX share a lot of things. The main thing they share is that at their core they both center around solving problems. While graphic design aims at visual communication and the ability to convey a message, UX is based on solving problems in more ways than just visually. If you want to go from graphic design to UX you need to change your approach and close the gap between conveying a message and going deeper into solving problems at their core. Here are some practical ways to change your problem-solving approachMaybe you are reading this and you have exhausted every effort, cannot seem to get over the mental block of changing career fields, or simply feel like you aren't good enough to go from graphic design to user experience. As I mentioned above, there are a lot of people out there insisting every person must have requirements X, Y, and Z before they can even start to consider going into user experience. I cannot disagree with this enough. If you have a passion for it and a belief that you are meant to work in this field to enact lasting change on people and products, then you CAN do it.One of the wonderful things about the field of User Experience is that it is filled with people who are successful because of their willingness to try again after failing. It has become a cliche but failing teaches you more than success ever will.",https://miro.medium.com/max/9266/0*Ea0ubb-36t6IxhOH,https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/4-ways-to-make-the-jump-from-graphic-design-to-user-experience-b524b8223804,ux,cc20a65cee01de259e36320e1d6a81c0b045e43d05d654f803f10618
Optimizing Gene Expression for a Longer Life,"Many factors influence our health and lifespan.From genes to lifestyle, from exercise to diet, many things matter. To make it even more complicated, these different factors interact with each other.And why stop there, let's add another complication: the effect of each of these factors, as well as the effect of their interaction, will differ substantially among individuals.To use an example I've written about: diet.Calories and protein matter. Of course, these factors interact. Protein has calories, after all. The protein composition matters too. Some amino acids (such as glutamine and methionine) appear to affect several aging pathways. But... that effect depends on how well (or how badly) your body metabolizes these amino acids, which depends on your genetic background.Likewise, the effect of calorie restriction appears to differ among individuals with different genotypes.So, it's about the genes after all, then?Well, only partially.Sure, genes matter. But what matters too is how you use the genes you have. More specifically, we're starting to unravel the importance of gene expression and regulation. For example, in aging brains, changes in gene activity lead to several manifestations of aging. In that example, though, individuals still have a different genetic 'starting point'.What if we use individuals that are genetically identical and raise them in the exact same environment? That's what researchers did in the tiny roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, as I detailed here. Genetically identical worms were raised together. Still a rather big difference in lifespan. The key? Differential gene expression.So... what if we start to tweak this gene expression?Lo and behold, a new study tested this out (again in the popular model organism Caenorhabditis elegans).The authors set out to pit two evolutionary hypotheses about aging against each other: the disposable soma theory, which states that aging is the result of a trade-off between reproduction and lifespan, and the developmental theory of aging, which states sub-optimal gene expression in adulthood causes us to croak with age.The idea is that if we can tweak gene expression to increase longevity without a negative effect on reproductive potential, that would be a point in favor of the developmental theory. If the disposable soma theory would be correct, gene tweaking your way to a longer life would harm reproduction (investing resources in maintaining your body's health would prevent your body from investing in reproduction, according to this hypothesis).Let's gene-tweak some tiny worms.To achieve the manipulation of gene expression, the researchers used RNA interference (via feeding the little worms E. coli that contained a viral vector with bespoke RNA). RNA interference is a technique where designed RNA molecules are used to 'interfere' with the DNA →protein process. The RNA molecules are put together in such a way that they bind to the mRNA that is the intermediate step between DNA and protein. This 'silences' a gene since the protein it codes for is no longer made.The scientists started the treatment at three different stages of life: eggs (so lifelong treatment), adulthood, and post-reproductive period (an analog for old age).They did this for five genes implicated in certain aging pathways: age-1 (involved in nutrient-sensing signaling), raga-1 (TOR signaling and regulation of growth), ifg-1 (global protein synthesis), ife-2 (protein synthesis in somatic cells), and nuo-6 (mitochondrial respiration).The results are complex, but here's a summary. Silencing the genes had the following results:A mixed bag when it comes to assessing the aging hypotheses the authors set out to study. age-1, raga-1, and ife-2 appear to support the developmental theory that says that problematic gene regulation is a root cause of aging. ifg-1 and nuo-6 on the other hand appear to support the disposable soma theory, where investments in lifespan and reproduction counteract each other. Overall, they emphasize the importance of gene expression:Of course, these are tiny roundworms in a controlled laboratory environment, not human beings in a complex world. (Also, RNA interference reduces gene expression but does not necessarily shuts it down completely.)Of course number two, this study altered the gene expression in five genes. There are probably a lot more that are involved in aging.Aging is complicated.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/0*Rs09gO-b3PJ5cuYE.jpg,https://medium.com/predict/optimizing-gene-expression-for-a-longer-life-77631af63d11,science,cd4f2a6eba0a3194878e5e27ca1143aa7e27a17b33e85a1704c13788
The FSOC's Looming Challenge: Un-Ringing a Very Large Bell,"The incoming Financial Stability Oversight Council will face an extraordinary challenge: a large and growing shortage of market liquidity that has necessitated unprecedented government intervention in fixed-income capital markets, and threatens to undermine the future vitality of those markets.U.S. regulators confronted a similar problem in the wake of the 2008-09 Global Financial Crisis, with surprising success. This new challenge is far more daunting, however, and the stakes much higher.A central policy challenge that emerged from the Global Financial Crisis was the problem of ""Too Big to Fail."" Bailouts of AIG and Bear Stearns and equity injections into over 900 U.S. companies under the TARP program were not only politically unpopular but also raised serious questions about moral hazard. In particular, the concern was that large firms, particularly the large banks that survived the crisis, would receive preference in debt markets because investors believed that they would be insulated from loss, and that this belief could prove self-fulfilling in practice.Extraordinary legislative and regulatory attention was paid to prevent this outcome. Congress, under Titles I and II of the Dodd-Frank Act, and the banking regulators through their implementation of the law, revolutionized how large financial institutions were financed in order to ensure that losses could be absorbed by their shareholders and creditors without creating systemic risk. Regulators more than doubled capital requirements; imposed new liquidity requirements that dramatically increased bank holdings of cash and cash equivalents; and required large U.S. banks to issue more than a trillion dollars of long-term, bail-in debt that could be converted to equity in the event of failure.[1] Regulators required those firms to prepare so-called living wills, including plans for recovery and a pre-packaged bankruptcy, and established a massive regulatory apparatus for ensuring that those plans were credible. The FDIC was given new authority to resolve bank holding companies in the event that a traditional bankruptcy was deemed a risk to financial stability - preventing a repeat of the Lehman Brothers incident, where policymakers lacked the legal tools to conduct an orderly resolution.Overall, these changes not only made large banks more resilient but also composed a fundamentally new approach to resolving large firms, known as single-point-of-entry resolution, for use under either the Bankruptcy Code or through an FDIC resolution under Title II of Dodd-Frank. It is difficult to overestimate the amount of regulatory and banking resources devoted to this task over the period 2010-17, when the effort was effectively completed, as the resolution plans for all relevant U.S. banks were deemed acceptable.[2]Market reaction has consistently signaled the success of these efforts. Studies analyzing post-2010 data have found that large banks are not receiving any material benefit in the pricing of their debt over smaller firms.[3] This has held true not only in stable times but also during the recent COVID crisis, when some had suggested that differences in debt spreads would reemerge.[4] This result is remarkable, as it is difficult to correct moral hazard. The regulatory and legal community deserves extraordinary credit for this achievement, as does the Congress for prioritizing it in the first two titles of Dodd-Frank. They achieved a metaphoric miracle: they un-rang a bell.Now, post-COVID, Congress and the regulatory community face a far greater challenge. Over the past six months, the Federal Reserve has intervened to backstop most of the fixed-income markets in the United States - Treasuries, investment-grade and some high-yield corporate debt, municipal debt, and asset-backed securities of every type, from mortgage to credit card to floorplan loans.[5] In addition to purchasing a total of $2.2 trillion in Treasuries and $650 billion in agency MBS, the Fed has established a raft of market support programs. Some were repeat performances from 2009 - which, notably, were implemented immediately, almost reflexively - and new programs were established to support the municipal market and to purchase corporate securities directly from the issuer or on the secondary market; these programs were a dramatic extension of previous authority, as was the purchase of exchange-traded funds - equities - that invest in fixed-income assets. The March 2020 interventions followed an incident in September 2019, when the Federal Reserve was required to backstop the Treasury repo market - the most liquid market in the world.Thus, going forward, financial market participants are likely to operate on the assumption that the Fed will be a buyer in the event of significant upset in any fixed-income market. And moral hazard traditionally serves as a self-fulfilling prophesy. If the Fed is expected to buy a given asset whenever illiquidity combined with heavy sales results in a rapid decline in price, then investors will anticipate lower price volatility and demand lower compensation for risk, thereby increasing demand for the asset. Investors also will finance their asset purchases with greater leverage. If the Fed ever made it clear that it would not backstop the asset, the result would be a dramatic price decline with knock-on effects as levered institutions were forced to unwind all at once - the definition of financial instability. Experience with the government sponsored enterprises - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - provides a disturbing precedent. Implied backing became actual backing in 2009, and that bell continues to ring more than a decade later.Of course, the societal benefits of what is colloquially known as ""the Fed put"" were substantial at the height of the COVID crisis, as the economy struggled to recover, and corporates and municipalities were having difficulty funding themselves. Indeed, it is universally agreed that the Federal Reserve's actions were appropriate at the time, and saved the economy from a tragic outcome. But most also agreed that the bailouts of AIG and Bear Stearns in 2009 were appropriate at the time; nonetheless, strong, concerted action was universally deemed imperative in order to prevent such benefits from being appropriate ever again.So, now, the question is what happens next. And that concern should be large, as the collective moral hazard from the Fed's corporate and municipal debt facilities dwarfs any bank TBTF considerations that arose after 2009. Consider that a primary TBTF concern was that a handful of large banks would over time be able to issue debt at yields slightly lower than regional banks. Compare that to almost all fixed income instruments in the United States being issued at rates that do not fully reflect their underlying risk because the market believes that there is a put to the Fed. Or, put another way, the Fed serving as a market maker of last resort in almost every fixed income market in this country.[6] And charging nothing for the service.[7] Thus, the taxpayer is not being compensated for the subsidy provided to issuers and investors by implicit backing or the risk of that backing becoming real; furthermore, since the recipients are effectively unregulated, there is no other way to mitigate the resulting incentives to issue additional debt.And this view of the problem may be far too narrow. It presumes that a post-GFC rise in issuance of fixed-income debt, which increases demandfor market liquidity, is organic - and thus, that the policy question is how to provide the necessary supplyof capital-at-risk market making for that large but natural level of demand. In the Rise of Carry, a book published at the end of 2019, the authors describe a broader concern: that Federal Reserve monetary policy has caused fixed-income instruments to trade like money-like instruments backed by the government. Thus, corporates have an incentive to leverage beyond their business needs in order to earn an arbitrage profit by buying higher yielding securities - what they call a carry bubble.[8] As the authors explain:The authors noted - again, before the COVID crisis - that central banks not only must intervene to prevent the collapse of carry bubbles but also are rewarded politically for doing so:As predicted, in March 2020, central banks around the world intervened to support fixed-income markets, not only for U.S. government debt but also for corporate and state and local debt. The resulting moral hazard is extreme but intangible and deferred, whereas the lift to markets from that intervention was immediate and clear, as were the kudos predictably received by the central banks for ""decisive"" and ""forceful,"" even ""heroic,""[11] action.In sum, private sector markets are becoming accustomed to central bank support; those markets are likely growing inorganically large on the assumption of that support; private sector market making continues to be discouraged by regulation; and thus the need for future central bank support continues to grow. If for any reason that support were ever withheld, the results would be devastating. And, so, on our present course, it never will be withheld.Correcting this moral hazard will be far more difficult than correcting a TBTF impression: the bell is much larger, and it has rung much louder and longer. In essence, it will require convincing investors that there is sufficient liquidity in all the relevant markets and therefore that the Fed will no longer be required or inclined to intervene when demand shocks occur. Only then must investors assess the credit risk of each corporate or governmental issuer on its own merits, both absolute and relative to other issuers. It is difficult to imagine a more important task for the incoming Financial Stability Oversight Council, or one better suited to its mandate.There are effectively three basic options.Here, demand could be reduced in two ways, directly or indirectly.Directly. Significant demand for market liquidity comes from open-end mutual funds, including money market funds at shorter tenors, and hedge funds. Money market fund reform seems most obvious, as two crises appear to have demonstrated its problems. More broadly, the liquidity that open-end mutual funds offer their investors is mismatched with the liquidity of their underlying assets; regulation in theory could restrict how quickly mutual fund shares could be redeemed or require those funds to hold more liquid assets.[12] For hedge funds and other leveraged investors in debt, demand for market liquidity could be suppressed through broad application of margin requirements. All such rules, however, come with significant costs - lower returns for investors or higher funding costs for businesses, and in some cases other types of financial instability. There is also the potential for unintended consequences: gates intended to slow fund withdrawals have shown rather to accelerate them, as investors wish to leave before the gates come down - the so-called concrete airbag.[13]Indirectly. Demand for liquidity by funds could be reduced by reducing the supply of fixed-income instruments being issued, and therefore the size of funds that hold them and their demand for liquidity. This would require significant changes to fiscal and monetary policy - reduced Treasury and municipal issuance, and a change to a Fed monetary policy regime that has encouraged high levels of corporate borrowing to fulfill the demand of investors reaching for yield. For reasons too obvious to state, this option appears dead for the foreseeable future.Since the GFC, the supply of capital devoted to principal-at-risk market making has declined, in part because capital, liquidity and other regulations have made it far more expensive for bank-affiliated broker-dealers to support those markets.[14] (Also, since the failure of all the major monoline investment banks in 2008-09, most principal-at-risk market making now occurs in bank-affiliated dealers.) The primary taxes on such activity are leverage ratio requirements that require uneconomic levels of capital to be held against Treasury securities and low-risk corporate debt; a stress testing regime that continues to assume massive losses in these securities under stress, and therefore inflates the capital cost of holding those securities in dealer inventory; a GSIB surcharge that requires still higher levels of capital based primarily on the level of a firm's capital markets activity; and a Volcker rule that, at least until recently amended, blurred the line between prohibited proprietary trading and permissible market making, inadvertently disincentivizing the latter - which Congress specifically sought to preserve.At the time the rules were adopted, there was an acknowledgement that market liquidity would be reduced; this cost, however, was considered worth the benefit in terms of reducing the probability of a disorderly failure of a bank-affiliated firm. But it seems the cost was underestimated, and the marginal benefits appear to have diminished with the adoption of numerous other reforms having the same goal.[15] There is general agreement among both policymakers and market participants that partly as a result of these rules, broker-dealers simply could not and would not expand their balance sheets in order to meet demand for liquidity in March 2020.[16] Hence the need for the Fed to make unprecedented interventions in these markets.Notably, collectively, these rules not only diminish the amount of capital that existing broker-dealers are able to supply but also operate as a formidable barrier to entry or expansion by any other bank-affiliated firm, and as an incentive for existing players to exit.[17]Rationalization of these rules would likely restore significant liquidity to fixed-income markets. Such benefit would have to be balanced against any perceived increase in the chances of a disorderly failure of a bank-affiliated broker-dealer. Such a cost-benefit analysis - that is, a determination of the net marginal benefit of the rules that most disincentivize principal-at-risk market making - would need to include consideration of the resolution processes described earlier, as well as other capital and liquidity rules that would remain in place, and other relevant market developments such as central clearing.Perhaps the defining quotation of the Vietnam War came from an anonymous U.S. Army major to a journalist in an after-action interview: ""It became necessary to destroy the town in order to save it."" Thus, some are already proposing to further expand and make permanent the reach of the Federal Reserve and other central banks in order to stabilize capital markets. In other words, the puzzling idea is this: in order to prevent the taxpayer from ever having to bail out a bank-affiliated, private sector broker-dealer under any circumstances, the taxpayer instead should bear directly and continually, through the central bank, the risks currently borne by those firms.These proposals come in various forms. One idea is for the Federal Reserve to operate a standing repo facility for Treasury and agency repo markets; thus, the heretofore most liquid market in the world would require permanent government support. More significantly, a senior official at the Bank of England (among others) has recently proposed a permanent market maker of last resort function for central banks, with details -continuous or intermittent operation, rates, scope of securities covered - to be worked out after study.[18] Some have further proposed - albeit not for financial stability reasons - to have the Fed offer deposit accounts to anyone, and to offer a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. Thus, in a crisis, investors would be able to withdraw their money from funds and banks and place them at the Fed as a safe haven.[19]Collectively, and in some cases individually, these steps would mark a significant abandonment of U.S. market capitalism in favor of a system with significantly greater government control. Before starting down that road, it might be advisable for policymakers to explore other ways of saving the village.[1] Regulators also generally prohibited such bank holding companies from issuing short-term debt that could complicate such a bail-in at the holding company level.[2] See Federal Reserve Board, ""Agencies announce joint determinations for living wills,"" Dec. 19, 2017: https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20171219a.htm; and Federal Reserve Board, ""Agency Feedback Letters for 2019,"" https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/agency-feedback-letters-2019.htm.[3] See, e.g., General Accountability Office, ""Large Bank Holding Companies: Expectations of Government Support,"" July 31, 2014; https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-621.

In an article in the Bank Policy Review of the Philadelphia Fed, Ryan Johnston (2016) reviews the recent empirical literature on TBTF and concludes, ""The weight of the evidence is that, while there may have been significant TBTF subsidies prior to and during the financial crisis, following the crisis any subsidies are small."" (p.19). Atkeson et al. (2018) conclude that variation in the perceptions of an implicit government guarantee account for substantial variation in the market-to-book ratios of U.S. banks, and that from 2011-17 such perceptions no longer account for a material part of bank value. Further, Minton et al. (2017) find that the Tobin's q (the ratio of the market value of assets to the book value of assets) and the market-to-book ratio of bank equity decrease with bank size rather than increase as would be expected if larger banks benefitted from a perception of being TBTF. In ""The Decline of Too Big to Fail"", Berndt et al. (2018) compare credit default swap spreads and estimates of ""distance to default"" for 800 U.S. firms to estimate implied market perception of bailout probabilities and the impact on the cost of debt. They conclude that there has been a ""dramatic and persistent reduction in market-implied probabilities of government bailouts of U.S. GSIB holding companies...[and]...similar but smaller effects for domestically important non GSIB banks..."" (p.2). They also find that the decline in bailout probability has reduced the market value of banks by nearly one-third. (They are unable to determine if the reduction is the result of post-crisis reforms or a shift in market perception owing to the fact that the government allowed Lehman to fail.)[4] See Covas, Francisco and Fernandez Dionis, Gonzalo, ""Putting 'Too Big to Fail' to Rest: Evidence from Market Behavior in the COVID-19 Pandemic,"" (Sept. 9, 2020): https://bpi.com/putting-too-big-to-fail-to-rest-evidence-from-market-behavior-in-the-covid-19-pandemic/[5] See Federal Reserve Board, ""Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility,"" (July 28, 2020): https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200728a9.pdfand ""Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility,"" (July 28, 2020): https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200728a1.pdf(while newly issued high-yield corporate debt is not generally eligible for purchase, debt previously rated BBB and subsequently downgraded is eligible, and that debt is a substantial part of the market).[6] There is one type of investment-grade security that the Federal Reserve will not purchase: one issued by a bank holding company.

One could argue that the Fed is not a true market maker in the sense that it only bids, but if there were a wave of disruptive buying, one presumes that it would begin to offer.[7] Note the contrast with TARP financial assistance in 2008-09, which was priced to earn substantial returns for taxpayers; similarly, traditional lender of last resort support is done at a penalty rate.[8] Lee, J.

Meet The Disruptors: ,"As a part of our series about business leaders who are shaking things up in their industry, I had the pleasure of interviewing Nick Cianfaglione.Nick Cianfaglione is the CEO and Founder of Artist Republik. Artist Republik is a decentralized networking and management platform that allows independent musicians to manage, market and book themselves as well as grow their industry connections and career. . Being an early adopter of the entrepreneurship mentality, Nick launched several small entrepreneurial ventures throughout middle school and high school. After the loss of his father, he was introduced to the inner workings of the music industry while initiating a charity concert series to raise money for cancer. The series entitled 'Club For Cancer' was the catalyst to his prior firm Northeastern Entertainment Solutions, which hosted local, regional and national artists in over fifty different venues across the country. As a student of Rhode Island's Bryant University, Nick found success in college by launching NES360, a leading fan base growth and marketing company. His experience with NES360 introduced him to working with over 500 clients worldwide; interviews with these artists brought the problematic workings of the music industry to light. As a solution, he launched Artist Republik in 2018 and has assured a series of big developments for the company in 2020 and beyond.Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your ""backstory""? What led you to this particular career path?My story started when I was 15, 2 years after the loss of my father from cancer. I was involved in running a relay for life team with some of my friends in high school and I came up with this idea to host a neon glow party concert to raise money for our team. The first year it totally failed.. out of a total 250 people that could come, only around 25 showed up. But I knew I was onto something, I just needed to go all in. I spent the next year planning one of the biggest parties I could think of. In May 2015, I hosted ""Club for Cancer"" Neon paint party. We ordered 80lbs+ of paint powder and sold out the concert in under 2 weeks. When sitting backstage, looking at this packed music venue, I knew I was on to something big and that anything was possible. That night I raised over $3k for cancer awareness and knew this was what I wanted to do. Club for Cancer was the start of one of the most insane entrepreneurial journeys of my life.Can you tell our readers what it is about the work you're doing that's disruptive?Artist Republik is disruptive because it completely changes the structure, flow, and daily operations of the music industry, both traditional and new music tech companies. It enables music artists of all sizes to obtain and manage all the resources they need to grow their careers without the middle man, contracts, hidden fees, and sketchy back channeling.Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?There have been a lot of mistakes I have made over the best 7 years in the music industry. I don't know which of them would be the ""funniest"" but a lot of my mistakes came from my early days hosting concerts. I was young, naive, and didn't understand how the whole business worked. All I knew is that i loved hosting concerts, I was addicted to selling out concerts and counting the money after shows, and I didn't learn anything from the classic routes. I never took a business class before college, I didn't listen to podcasts or read books so I learned from failure. Whether it was misjudging my market when hosting concerts, hearing no more then yes on sales calls, losing significant amounts of money due to shows being under sold, losing staffing members due to a lack of commitment, hiring the wrong teams to build Artist Republik in the start, and so on. The list is HUGE. But every single one of those small, or big, failures is what is guiding me to success today. I know I am nowhere near done ""failing"", I am just confident that now I have the resources, the knowledge, and the support to fail, learn, and bounce back.We all need a little help along the journey. Who have been some of your mentors? Can you share a story about how they made an impact?I have a lot of mentors... and I mean a lot.. Currently in Artist Republik, I rely on my board of directors, my advisors, and a large group of mentors which include, but not limited to, David Beirne, Humble Lukanga, Ann-Marie Harrington, Ken Sutton, Jeff Taylor, Nick O'Hara, Ryan Buonogorio, Adam Alpert, and many many more. But there is one mentor that has always been there and it's my oldest brother Mike. Him and I are always at odds on decisions and thats what makes us great together. He hates risk, doubts everything, is insanely minimalistic, and very cautious. Myself on the other hand, I love risk, I operate in a world where you have to be cautious but also daring. So I know that I am a very daring, overly trustworthy, risky person who will do anything to make my business ventures advance so having him as a mentor is great because he questions everything I do and enables me to see a different view point. By no means is he an industry expert like some of my other mentors, but he is a psychological challenger for me that always causes me to analyze a situation deeper and view it from a different perspective.In today's parlance, being disruptive is usually a positive adjective. But is disrupting always good? When do we say the converse, that a system or structure has 'withstood the test of time'? Can you articulate to our readers when disrupting an industry is positive, and when disrupting an industry is 'not so positive'? Can you share some examples of what you mean?I don't know if disruption is not always good, but I am a firm believer that innovation is not always good and individuals can very easily over innovate. I have ingrained this idea into every company I have run and it has always worked. Innovation is not reinventing the wheel, it's improving the experience and removing the pain points of a consumer. An example I always use of this is Tesla, they didn't make a better tire, they made a better power source for a car. You can see this a lot in today's tech world with failed companies, their mission statement may have hit the pain point but they went too far, they over innovated and they confused the customer, or drained resources into developing this innovative technology that no one asked for. Tesla could spend billions of dollars on building a better tire but are consumers asking for that? No they want a better, greener car, so focus on that. Like everyones teacher would always tell you in middle school, KISS- keep it simple stupid.Can you share 3 of the best words of advice you've gotten along your journey? Please give a story or example for each.We are sure you aren't done. How are you going to shake things up next?Artist Republik is nowhere near done. We have a lot up our sleeves, and a lot we cannot talk about but I can say, we are going to completely change the entire structure of the music industry and how it operates.Do you have a book, podcast, or talk that's had a deep impact on your thinking? Can you share a story with us? Can you explain why it was so resonant with you?Sadly I don't, I'm always working, I listen to my hustle playlist on spotify probably everyday and just learn by doing. I've tried to start some books or podcasts and always get distracted with work.Can you please give us your favorite ""Life Lesson Quote""? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?""If a driver has the courage to create his own conditions, then the rain is simply rain."" This is my favorite quote because a lot of people run away when life gets hard, just like alot of drivers get scared when it starts raining. But if you calm down, clear your head, adapt to your conditions (change your tires, braking distance, and level of control), well the rain is nothing more than rain. It doesn't stop you from racing, it just changes how you race. Just like in life, you have a life changing event but that doesn't stop you from living, it just changes how you live and if you have the courage to redefine this, then you can still live life to the fullest.You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)I would love to inspire a movement of love, equity and critical thinking. I think all of our problems would be solved if we were able to sit back, love, have compassion and understanding and apply some critical thinking to every situation. We could solve global warming and climate issues, we could solve wealth gaps, and more. We're all on this crazy ride of life together, so let's all work together. That's what inspired Artist Republik, I sat down with over 500 artists and had compassion, and understanding, and critical thinking and now we are creating a platform that will hopefully change the trajectory of millions of people's lives.How can our readers follow you online?You can find me on instagram @chalkerbeachboy, you can find Artist republik on everything @artistrepublikAnd checkout artist republik online at artistrepublik.comThis was very inspiring.

"It isn't the message that's the problem, it's how the message is made","Yet. Whenever scrum teams are prompted to consider their key strengths, they predictably point towards the team's ability to communicate. So why is it that within scrum teams shared understanding of complex work is the norm, but outside it, there's a mix of spaghetti and static. What gives?I've got a theory. Well, David Graeber has a theory in his The Utopia of Rules that I'm ""borrowing"" (read, bastardising). It goes like this:What have anthropological theories about structural violence got to do with communication? Well my hypothesis is that fatigue from interpretive labour is commonly being misdiagnosed as a communication problem.Graeber cites a few great examples of interpretive labour.He talks about American sitcoms from the 1950s, where ""jokes about the impossibility of understanding women"" was a common trope. It's rather obvious how popular culture reflected the fact men didn't need to understand women due to their dominant place in society; but if women wanted to navigate a man's world, then they had to do heaps of interpretive labour.Back in high school I remember a creative writing exercise where you had to imagine what daily life was like for the opposite sex. Well, Graeber recalls that girls find it easy detailing the minutiae of life as a boy. However, boys are often incapable of considering life as a girl beyond mere superficialities- many outright refuse to even do the exercise. If Reddit's /r/menwritingwomen is to be believed, this phenomena isn't restricted to teenagers.What is true of gender relations can also be applied elsewhere. Interpretive labour is present wherever unequal social structures exist, underpinned by the threat of force or coercion.Well, if you think about it, members of a scrum team are relatively equal. Nobody has the power to hire-and-fire, reprimand, or determine pay; ""violence"" or force isn't formally possible. As a result, decisions are made largely by consensus; if you want to make changes, there are norms around deliberation, openness, compromise, and agreement. You don't tell people, you have to convince them. In Graeber's language, the cost of interpretive labour is shared and low because everyone has a responsibility to understand each other and an expectation to be understood in return. The result is that communication is integral to the decision-making process; if you want to get anything done, you'll need to understand others.Now consider the hierarchy surrounding your organisation's ""communication problem""? Chances are, it's a person in-the-know trying to inform those out-of-the-know about a decision that has already been made (nominal appeals for feedback being a mere ritual). The problem is conceived as one of message and medium; a matter for the speaker, not of understanding, but of being understood. In this system, it's clear that the interpretive labour for the speaker is negligible, but that of the audience is really high. Unlike in scrum teams, communication is not integral to the decision-making process but an activity to be fulfilled after-the-fact.In practice, this will immediately ring true to people. Most employees will instinctively sink significant time into thinking about the intentions of their managers. They'll decipher, consider, analyse, reflect and watch. In short, they'll try to understand. They have to, I mean, nobody wants to get sacked or get pushed aside. Yet, I'd also venture to guess that this effort doesn't feel reciprocated. It flows one way from those without authority, to those with it.It is my theory that the chasm between these two experiences accounts for the common workplace complaint that communication is poor. The problem isn't that people aren't ""getting the message"", but rather that people are excluded from determining the message itself. To add to their woes, the excluded are then expected to do the heavy-lifting of interpretive labour. It induces stress, anxiety, and exhaustion.Ironically, if this is true, then the common solution proposed to communicate more frequently, across more formats, might actually worsen the problem. It will only serve to remind the excluded of their place in the decision-making process. That is, relegated to taking their orders from muffled voices behind closed doors. Such practices may actually reinforce unequal social relationships, widen the gap, and skew the burden of interpretive labour further to one party.Is it hardly surprising staff get fatigued, becoming passive decision-takers?What are the tell-tale signs that interpretive labour is wearing down morale?I don't have a prescriptive set of solutions to resolve this issue, but it feels like any resolution to this problem will promote participation, inclusivity, divergent thinking, diffused decision-making, flat management structure, and devolved authority. It'd also require the challenging task of defining and upholding a thoughtful, purposeful organisational culture. One that redefines leadership as the quality of empowering others, such that it reduces the inequality .Most simply, the best way to ensure key decisions are communicated throughout the business - might be to involve more people in the process of making them.",,https://jackmunn.medium.com/communication-its-a-decision-making-problem-880666fc3d57,leadership,ceda9803add4eef039295d22eb876b978c8265fc9e23c8da0ef7283f
Still Got It: The Lean Startup 10 years on - Book Review,"""Minimum Viable Product"" ""Game-Changer""  ""Disruptive""  ""Pivot""A confession: I've been using these terms for years, without knowing their origin, or what they really mean.There - now that's out I feel a lot better, and it helps to know I'm not alone in my ignorance, as many memes, blogs and TV shows testify.These buzzwords were born 10 years ago with publication of The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, and I'm glad to have dived in now, and experienced several minor epiphanies along the way.Starting a tech agency around the same time with a friend from college, we felt intimidated by formal business plans and methodologies. They seemed geared towards established businesses with trained Managers and we couldn't relate as 'upstarts'.What distinguished Ries then and now is his background as developer turned tech entrepreneur, the influence of Japanese ""lean manufacturing"" processes and bias towards action. This appeals to startup founders, engineers and teams with big ambitions but limited resources.Ries defines the startup as any ""human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty."" Right now, that applies whether you're working alone, in an incubator or as part of a mature, multinational organisation.As humans we seize on 'brilliant ideas' and our fear is not to ship, to miss an opportunity to launch the big product. In fact, data and case studies show the problem is more frequently that of achieving failure; successfully executing a plan that goes nowhere.We can all think of examples of this in the workplace or as consumers, and the pattern is supported by 'magical thinking' and tales of entrepreneurial heroes who persisted through countless rejections, eventually to be vindicated by success.Can we avoid these pitfalls and be one of the 10% of start-ups who don't fail? The answer is yes; if we take an approach of rigorous experimentation to all our activities, and work with 'small batches' and short cycles.The goal is to figure out the right thing to build, that which customers want and will pay for - as quickly as possible. The route to this is engaging with and talking to customers, asking 4 key questions:1. Do customers recognise the problem you're trying to solve?2. If there was a solution, would they buy it?3. Would they buy it from us?4. Can we build a solution for that problem?The common tendency for product development is to skip straight to the final question and build a solution before confirming customers have the problem.As a founder who pivoted agency services into software products, Ries' focus on a ""Concierge"" Minimum Viable Product (MVP) making sure the first few customers have an experience as good as you and your team can make it, resonated with my own experience.The caveat here is that novelty is often disliked by customers used to a certain way of doing things - ""If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses"" (Henry Ford).The way I reconcile this is you need to fix a problem experienced in the world now - that is the 'MVP'. The by-products of doing this are data, insights and techniques to build the prototype for the future paradigm - for which the TAM (Total Addressable Market) is that much larger and more exciting. This vision is owned and driven by the founder and their team.One of the most powerful tools in this cycle of continuous experiment, testing and improvement is the 5 WHYS technique originally developed by Taiichi Ohno, architect of the Toyota Production system.At the heart of every seemingly technical problem is a human issue, be it design, management or training. Asking 5 WHYS provide an opportunity to discover what that human problem might be, with a culture of tolerance to all errors the first time they occur, without allowing the same mistake to happen twice.Like other popular methodologies (Agile, Privacy by Design) which capture the imagination of individuals within startups, established businesses and government, this approach only works if the organisation is committed to the process, gives it time and avoids temptations of the 'blame game'.Done right, the Lean Startup method does have the necessary flexibility to accept, embrace and benefit from failure, or rather realisations the current direction of travel isn't working, and change course via a pivot.So, a startup's ""runway"" is focused not on months of burn through salaries, marketing, production etc but the number of pivots, or revolutions of the engine left in the tank for the founders.The final challenge is growth; be it viral, sticky or paid, it needs to be sustainable if not to become a 'vanity metric' and powered by output from the existing engine, so the data and multiplier effects can be analysed and tweaked ready for the next batch.After a decade, some elements have dated in the fast-moving world of tech, but the game of applying the tests of Ries' book to the latest startup heroes in the FT, Forbes or Wired is enjoyable as well as a rewarding one when planning your next move as founder, or investor.Do contact me and share how you get on...",https://miro.medium.com/max/654/1*2AOEuUXyt4u2ZYgMU3z01A.jpeg,https://gilberthill.medium.com/still-got-it-the-lean-startup-10-years-on-book-review-f37bbfcee763,startups,cfee1d9b76b5d68b4dfa5492693221e76351ec9754dd56ab5e4eff65
"What Is An ""Influencer""","Have you ever come across someone's social media page to find a perfectly curated life. It looks like all they do for a living is look good and take pictures of it. WHAT DRUGS ARE THESE PEOPLE ON?It's called influencing, and it's more complex than most people think.There are 4 major types or categories of influencer, based on audience size.Nano influencers are the smallest category of influencer. They tend to have a following of less than 10 000.These types of influencers are still considered influencers because of the impact they have on their immediate communities. These people are often in positions of authority within their communities. Think government leaders, religious leaders, popular local shop owners, etc.This category of influencer tends to have the highest relative engagement since their communities are much smaller and therefore easier to build relationships and trust in.Brands that work with Nano influencers often seem more trusted. This is due to the personal connection that the influencer shares with their community members.Clearly, the main drawback of working with Nano influencers is the small audience size. Brands looking to run large scale social media campaigns should not be collaborating with Nano influencers because of the sheer number of individual influencer partnerships required to hit the ideal audience reach.Micro influencers have anywhere from 10k -100k followers from a vanity metrics perspective. These influencers have built a following or community around a similar set of interests, otherwise known as a niche. Micro influencers tend to be regarded as experts in their niches.This group typically includes your travel bloggers, food bloggers, game reviewers, wellness experts, and a variety of others. Many brands prefer working with these smaller sized influencers because they have such high engagement and expertise within a specific niche.The issue that tends to arise in partnerships with Micro influencers involves the investment vs. return aspect. Collaboration results aren't 'necessary for payment', which means that regardless of the cost, investors are not promised a successful campaign.Macro influencers are what most people think of when they hear the word influencer. They have likely used social media to build fame, and along with it a large following. These influencers have anywhere from 100K - 1M followers.These influencers can be classified as the best of both worlds when it comes to brand partnerships. They tend to have both a niche following and a large following. Some people in this category would include someone like Jeffree Starr, who built his fame on MySpace and has since managed to transfer that fame to all other major social media platforms.Many Macro influencers will be able to produce incredible results in brand partnerships because they have spent YEARS nurturing their audience. In addition to the great results, they are generally very professional and easy to work with. Since macro influencers are established brands, they too come with a team of staff that is familiar with contracts, professional high quality content production, and streamlined communication.Mega influencers are the largest category of influencer, and they are more famous than influential. These accounts have upwards of 1M followers. This includes people like Kylie Jenner, Selena Gomez, and Jimmy Kimmel. These tend to be A and B list celebrities who naturally attract a large online audience.Unlike the other categories of influencers, there will be much less of a common interest or obvious niche within the community. These audience members will have a wide range of interests and may be following this person for a variety of reasons, rather than expertise in one area.They are not subject matter experts, but can absolutely provide brands with a large consumer reach. They often don't have the real influencer conversion power, although some do. Despite the massive online audience they have, collaborations with these influencers often come with a hefty price tag. For example, Kylie Jenner brings in upwards of $1M for a single sponsored Instagram post.Now that we have covered the main categories of influencer based on relative online reach, let's get into the different ways influencers actually MAKE their money. There are a variety of income opportunities, but I will break down the most common ones.Brand partnerships are the most common way for influencers to make their living. The average rule for brand sponsorship is $100 per 10k followers for a post, but that number can go up significantly if the influencer has a strong niche and high engagement. Brand partnerships can include things like posting a picture holding their product with a caption about why it's a great purchase.Affiliate links are another common way that brands choose to work with influencers. If an influencer loves a brand and naturally promotes them, they may choose to set up an affiliate link. Next time they share the product on their feed they can tag the brand and offer any followers a product discount with a specified URL or checkout code. This lets the company know that a particular influencer converted a sale, and can pay them out accordingly.This is a great revenue stream for anyone with a very niche audience who does not want to create a business themselves. It is also great for people with existing businesses looking to add more revenue streams. An example of this might be a beauty influencer who partners with MONAT to start selling their hair products. Although affiliate marketing companies come with some stigma, the earning potential is incredible when you do it right! And truly, if you love the products and buy them anyways, why wouldn't you make money selling them?This is the one that can require more work and more capital in the beginning, but in my opinion is the most rewarding! If you are someone who has gone through something and has an excellent solution for an audience dealing with the same issue, then this is for you! This is also where Nano and Micro influencers can scale to 6 figure businesses without massive followings. You just need a well positioned, results oriented offer. If this is something you want to learn more about, follow and connect with @justyne.biz on Instagram to learn how.Paid collaborations are different than brand collaborations because the goal will not be a commercial promotion or advertisement, but instead for growth and engagement. Collaborations with other people in your industry will often come unpaid as they are mutually beneficial for audience engagement and follower growth, but this isn't always the case. Many podcasts, blogs and larger influencers will have budgets for paid collaborations. This may include jumping on a live together to talk about a topic that interests both party's audiences.Here are some fun behind the scenes facts that may surprise you.This industry is a lot more complex than most people may understand at first glance. There are a variety of factors that contribute to an influencers success, and is in no way an easy way to ""get rich"".I hope you have learned a little bit about what it means to be an ""online influencer"" in todays social media driven world.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2106/1*jUcKZAHNTsxYXg64wZUn9A.png,https://medium.com/illumination/what-is-an-influencer-and-how-do-they-create-an-income-b31847d76ae2,social-media,d1ba9683d67f00e8a37e33fadf82a5abf23b5d622cc5b4d54a5c6105
How to Write an Outline that Amazes Your Clients,"Creating an outline is an important part of writing a good article because it ensures that your content is well-structured.I didn't know that when I started writing and doing freelance. After getting a brief from a client, I immediately jumped into researching and writing.Even though that approach didn't get me into any trouble/complaints from clients about structure, I felt stuck sometimes. More importantly, I had to take much time reading the content again and again to make sure it was logical and persuasive.That's why I decided to try outlining. Here's what I do.When I sit down to write an outline for an article, I always create a docs file, name it ""Outline,"" and then open the writing brief. Something like this:Some clients will tell you exactly what they want you to write about in the brief. For example, keywords (main and secondary ones), suggested outlines, links to be included in the content, and references.If you have this type of brief, it's easy to develop a good outline that matches your client's requirements.But more often, your clients just send you a very short brief including only a topic idea, a primary keyword, and a deadline. Don't panic because, in this case, you have more control over the topic you're assigned and more opportunities to impress your clients.By reading the brief carefully, you'll understand the concrete idea of what your article should be about, what your client expects to see, and what direction you should go with.When you create an outline, you don't need to care about the introduction. Just go right into the key sections of the article.Sometimes it's a definition of a key term/a tool and its importance/benefits/features. Sometimes it can be steps to do something.Make use of what you already know about the topic and type them down. It'd be helpful to make notes of things you're not sure about or need more information. In doing so, you can have an idea of what you should research later.For example, article title: The Definitive Guide to Instagram Reels MarketingKey points (also key headings):What is Instagram Reels?Why choose Instagram Reels over TikTok?Instagram Reels success storiesInstagram Reels marketing tipsIn this step, take advantage of Google to go deeper into the topic, identify what people are talking about/what they want to know, and take notes.Look at key points you've listed in step 2 to expand your searches.Use the notes in step 3 to edit your rough ideas in step 2 to ensure your post includes the most relevant and helpful points.This step is fairly easy because you already know what you'll talk about in the body of the piece. You can quickly come up with how you want to start the article and close it.For the introduction, you can begin with striking statistics, draw a problem, or use a quote. For closing, you can summarize key takeaways from the piece, reinforce the key points, or include a call to action to encourage readers to do something next.If the brief includes a fixed title for the piece, that's good - you can skip this step, and your outline is done.If the client asks you to propose some titles, it's not too difficult because, at this point, you have a really good idea of what you'll write about. You can quickly put together some potential headline ideas that trigger readers' curiosity and emotions.Once you complete all of these steps, you can send the outline to the client to ask for approval.A worthy note is that your outline doesn't need to be perfect. You don't need to make your headings compelling because it's better to polish them later when you finish the first draft.Not all clients will ask you to submit an outline. And I also know many excellent writers don't need an outline to start. They can go with whatever they have in mind while still producing masterpieces.I'm not at that level, so I still need an outline.If you're like me, I hope this post will help you in some way. Feel free to share with me your process so we can learn from each other.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8920/1*k1MW0AC8CAmxlTbvd7tGxA.jpeg,https://medium.com/writers-blokke/how-to-write-an-outline-that-amazes-your-clients-47a373b947ac,freelancing,d2cf06940a6e2432d17959242916fde0b1b0c379ed17d7bc9dfee599
Gaming Headset Showdown: HyperX Cloud II Wireless VS Roccat Elo 7.1 Air,"The mainstream gaming headset market is packed with good, competitive choices, and the wireless space is where most of the innovation and focus is right now. Five years ago, it was almost impossible to get a good-sounding wireless gaming headset at a reasonable price, but now the sub-$150 market is riddled with options.My two favorite wireless headsets in this price category are the HyperX Cloud II Wireless, and the Roccat Elo 7.1 Air, both of which released last year. The Cloud II sells for $150, and offers a sterling blend of build and sound for that price. The Elo sells for a hilariously-low price of $99, yet still packs in all the features I'd expect from a high-end pair. It might seem absurd to compare two headsets with such a large price gap, but they're impressively comparable.Let's split some hairs and pick a ""winner,"" shall we?HyperX Cloud II Wireless (Original Review Here)- This $149 successor to the original classic Cloud II headset has enough new things that it could have been called a Cloud III. Featuring a revamped design, powerful sound profile, built-in surround functionality, and a 30-hour battery life, the Cloud II Wireless is a stylish headset that performs well.I named it my favorite wireless headset of 2020 for its combination of a refreshed design and excellent audio. And then, I tried the Roccat Elo and got nervous.Roccat Elo 7.1 Air (Original Review Here)- For $99, this headset from Roccat and Turtle Beach offers all the features of the Cloud II Wireless...then adds RBG, a graphical equalizer, on-ear mic monitoring volume controls, and Turtle Beach's Superhuman Hearing mode. It's one of the most packed-out headsets I've ever used at any price.The build and design are a bit chunkier than the Cloud II's sleek curves, and the padding is more contoured and less velvety, but if you just want to get the most stuff for the least amount of money, the Roccat makes a phenomenal case for itself.The Cloud II Wireless offers a richer, punchier, more sumptuous sound profile, but both headsets are very close in terms of overall rendering quality. Each offers an accurate midrange with a slightly elevated treble response.Bass lovers will prefer the default sound of the Cloud II Wireless. Its response digs down deeper, and has more power, thump, and clarity.Of course, that's all just by default. Roccat's software offers a full graphical EQ with plenty of presets and full customization, meaning you can easily tune the headset to whatever sound profile you'd like. With a little bit of tweaking in the sub bass frequencies, you can mimic the sound of the Cloud II Wireless.On the virtual surround front, the Cloud II Wireless has a nice implementation with good channel placement. It has a simple on-off toggle. The Elo has two different modes with two different virtual room profiles, and I think they both sound good and also offer solid placement around you. Neither one has support for the vertical channels or true 3D spatial cues offered by Windows Sonic, but you can use Sonic with either one so that's a non- issue.Out of the box, I slightly prefer the sound quality of the Cloud II. But the Roccat also sounds great, and edges out a tie thanks to its EQ and surround options.WINNER: TieHyperX is famous for putting memory foam on all of their headsets, and the Cloud II Wireless is no exception. It has a ""barely there"" feel to it, with soft ear pads and a well-padded headband. The only small comfort flaw that might bother some users is the lack of angled drivers inside the ear cups, meaning that your ears might gently touch the softly padded interiors. The soft foam and sleek, light build make for yet another headset that lives up to HyperX's legacy of comfort.Roccat used a totally different approach to make their headset cozy. It has a thick suspension headband up top and heavily-contoured memory foam ear pads designed to better seal around your head's non-flat shape. The drivers inside the cups are angled, so your ears shouldn't touch anything while you're wearing them. Also, the pads contain Turtle Beach's ""ProSpecs"" relief system, essentially an area of softer foam in the center of the pad that helps them seal better around glasses.Both headsets seal well on my head with an impressive, comfortable fit. The suspension system and contoured pads of the Roccat Elo allow it to fit easily without any work. For the Cloud II, I have to do some fiddling with the adjustment arms and positioning to get the most-proper fit.However, the leatherette and the memory foam are both much nicer on the Cloud II Wireless, giving it a truly premium feel. The foam has a much slower rebound than the foam on the Roccat model, and the leatherette covering feels less cheap. The slight stiffness of the Roccat pads makes them feel like a constant presence on my head.Both headsets are perfectly comfortable for hours and hours of listening, but the Cloud II Wireless feels a bit nicer. A Roccat model with denser memory foam would be untouchable.WINNER: Cloud II WirelessRoccat's Elo looks like a classic 90's studio headphone, with a greyish black color scheme, large oval ear cups, and a slight swerve to its support structure that helps the headset maintain an even clamp.HyperX's Cloud II Wireless is all sleek lines, curves, and bold red accents. It's like a combination of the original Cloud II frame and a modern Bluetooth headphone. Every angle is smoothed out and clean, and it has a more pleasing overall look, in my opinion.Both headsets are built really well for the price, out of a combination of metal and plastic components. Both headbands use a metal core, and both use robust plastics that should hold up to years of normal gaming use. The Roccat has the small advantage of fully rotating ear cups that you can lay flat around your neck, and the hinges that allow this have a nice smooth action that's pleasant to control.I love the industrial and slightly angular look of the Roccat model, but I think most users will end up preferring the sleek build and premium materials of the Cloud II Wireless.WINNER: Cloud II WirelessHere's where the Roccat Elo totally crushes it, and depending on your personal needs in a headset, that might prove to make it a winner in your eyes regardless of the other categories. Gaming headsets are features-focused products, after all.The Roccat Elo 7.1 Air has RGB lighting, full graphical EQ, two surround modes, a removable microphone with digital noise cancellation, a second volume wheel to control mic monitoring, and Turtle Beach's Superhuman Hearing mode. It does all this with a 27 hour battery life without the lights on, or about 15 hours of RGB-enhanced gaming.In a vacuum, the Cloud II Wireless is no slouch. It also has a nice microphone, built-in mic monitoring and surround, and a 30-hour battery. Its larger dongle and stronger wireless signal also give it a slightly longer useable range...but I could still use the Elo from 30 feet away with a couple of walls in the way. At that distance I can't reasonably play a PC game, walls or not.Still, the Roccat software offers so much more flexibility and control over the sound, and you can store multiple user profiles. The RGB is incredible to have in a wireless headset at this price point. And Superhuman Hearing isn't just a gimmick; it really does enhance the presence of spatial cues in games.Neither headset has a 3.5mm auxiliary input jack, and the use of a standard USB connection and supporting software means that these are PC-first headsets that also offer some basic console support...but no Xbox connection is possible for either one. Both headsets also use USB-C ports for charging, as should all modern peripherals.Roccat has proven here that you don't need to spend huge to get a huge features package. The Elo 7.1 Air includes absolutely every feature you could want out of a modern gaming headset, and I hope other companies take notice. HyperX could respond by adding an EQ option to their software, and I'd love to see them get more invested in RGB as well. Love it or hate it, it's an easy way to add some color and flair to a peripheral, and it goes a long way to redeem the more studio-like look of the Roccat model.WINNER: Roccat Elo 7.1 AirThe true story here isn't that the Cloud II Wireless wins, but that the Roccat Elo 7.1 Air comes so close. Roccat's model offers competitive sound, nearly as much comfort, and a features package that's larger than the more expensive model. The Cloud II hangs in there as my favorite headset of last year thanks to its premium, sleek design and comfortable materials, alongside a sound profile that I find more pleasant to listen to out-of-the-box.But if you don't mind getting involved and tweaking some things, the Roccat model is just as capable, and a clear runner-up for best headset of the year. It's also easily the best PC headset available for under $100. It's not even a contest.Roccat produced a headset that could have cost $130-$150 based on the features it offers, and instead priced it at $99. That's a seriously impressive move, and I hope it makes the rest of the business take notice.The Cloud II Wireless is still an awesome piece of design and audio engineering, but the Roccat Elo has earned a permanent place on my shelf right next to it.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8064/1*HT1-H_8YWTPN_YPYT1Hx-A.jpeg,https://xander51.medium.com/gaming-headset-showdown-hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-vs-roccat-elo-7-1-air-9151a1692e37,gaming,d2d80a35d578ecfc28f5ce3477b0bede1f34aef4278b3d9bdaeb2dab
Frugal Problem Solving Canvas,"2 years after creating the Frugal Strategy Canvas, here is the Frugal Problem Solving Canvas to help barsintorm to come up with frugal products and services.I used the Frugal Strategy Canvas in over 40 workshops to help companies think and brainstorm in a systemic way about frugal innovation across it's value chain. The beauty and complexity of the tool lies in it's simplicity. Beginning 2021 I published the article on 20 ideas for becoming a full-stack Frugal Company which is complementary to the Frugal Strategy Canvas which details the various layers of systemic change that be brought about in an organization.I'd like to zoom back from the strategy to a constraint based problem solving methodology which still remains the achilies heal of frugal solutions. Cognitive biasses and mental fixedness are the major deal breakers for coming up with frugal solutions. Using this canvas you can strive to have a frugal approach to prolem solving.Constraint based problem solving requires critical thinking, lateral thinking and calls for our ingenuity (check out my short article on Creativity is antifragile). However the various biases at work block us from being creative, and the only solution is to embrace constraints.Problem framing is an art, as Einstein says, the solution is in the problem formulation.Problem understanding is key at this stage. Various tools can be used to understand the problem and forumate it correctly. I use specially mind maps and question storming or the question ladder to come to a proper question. At this stage if you find solutions to the problem you can fill in the solution box. Specially for frugal innovation, what is more important than an intellectual problem understanding, is an emotional understanding of the problem. One needs to identify oneself with the problem so that an intrinsic need to solve the problem arises that gives natural access to creative solutions.Once the problem has been formulated you would have identified the various constrainsts, if not brainstorm and prioritize the constraints. Try reformulating the problem with the constraint and without the constraint. When you have tight constraints you need resources to have multiple functions or uses to be able to do more within the constraints. This call or ingenuity. At this stage if you find solutions you can add them to the solution box. Sometimes the only resources that you have are also the constraints.Sometimes the solution lies within the ecosystem. Winning partnerships give you access to ressources that could be expensive to own. Frugal innovations often use alternative distribution channels.At this stage brainstorm available and accessible ressources. How can you better use under used resources ? Can you find a new use for your resources to solve the problem ? Under tight constraints often frugal innovations have a modular or a multifunction design. Sometimes your only resources are also your constraints. If you find solutions at this stage you can add them to the solutions box.Frugal Innovations call for creative solutions. If you haven't yet found solutions using the previous steps, apply the SCAMPER creativity tool to generate ideas by permutation combination of the problem elements, it's an age old tool, but still one of my favourites and most effective to bend the cartesian mind. For those who wish to go one step further should expriment with metaphors (check out my article on the stale bread philsophy) and for the real players add in a little serendipity to make it fun ! Remember that this canvas is limited in size and dimensions and I didn't have enough place to emphasise how important it is to have fun and enjoy the problem solving process!Once you have have a few solutions plot them on an assumption matrix and check how you can validate riskiest assumptions with your available ressources in the shortest time. That's also how Tesla tested its demand for electric vehicles with the Tesla Roadster model.All these efforts will hopefully 'payoff' so have you identified what impacts will your innovation have ? Growth through innovation is more sustainable than growth through depleting precious natural ressources ! Which of the 17 UN sustainable goals does your solution answer to ?As a compliment, here is a quick checklist to evaluate if your approach was frugal:Hope this framework helps you become a better frugal problem solver!

6 Ways To Create Psychological Safety,"Great managers make you feel safe. When you are safe, you feel comfortable. The comfortable working environment ensures good collaboration, honesty, and appreciation. Creating such conditions should be the top priority of every manager and every company.The term itself has been around since the 1960s. First organizational theorists like Edgar Schein, started to research organizational challenges. Still today it is considered one of the most important factors for teamwork, learning, and risk and change acceptance.Now, what is the magic behind it? Psychological safety is a feeling of being safe. You feel accepted and respected. But not only. You are also open to risk and go the extra mile. You are not afraid of disagreeing or asking questions. Moreover, you can be yourself as the environment embraces diversity and honours inclusion. We can think about the psychological safety climate within a team or in a company.What would you do if you don't feel safe? You would most likely try to escape, run away from the source of fear. It is only a natural reaction. When you experience something unpleasant, you try to switch to something more pleasant. In a work environment, you sometimes cannot leave a meeting or cancel a call in the middle of it. If someone is shouting at you, disagreeing with you, blaming you for problems, you don't feel well. Your adrenalin levels skyrocketing, and you are ready to attack back or to disappear.As a manager, you need to learn to control different situations. You will be often in a position of bringing bad news or communicating changes. You need to prepare for negative emotions. So, try to master psychological safety rules. All is about creating conditions and sensitive communication. You need to train your eye in seeing that someone is about to run away or trying to attack back. Be mindful of a toxic environment and cut its resources.Every situation is different and needs a different reaction. Some strategies allow you to control your private or group meeting. Onboard these communication strategies:Nothing can be worse than lying to your team. Never do that. You always need to be fair, open, and honest with them. Even if the situation is difficult (e.g., a colleague is fired, business results are not good, a project scope must change, the office is being moved to a new location, etc.). Prepare yourself for possible scenarios. How your team members can react? How do you wish to communicate?When I decided to leave my manager position, I didn't want to announce my plans publicly at all-staff meetings or team meetings. That would create a panic. Instead, I chose to speak with each team member and explain my decision. This way, I was able to answer questions and tackle fear from the future.Some news is difficult to digest. Respect that. You have to be patient when you see that after you announced something your team is shocked. Kill the meeting and revisit the topic on a different one. Give them time to prepare for it. Let them explore possible resolutions and conclusions.One half of my team was working remotely. Yet, during the company restructuring, it was decided that this part of the team would be disbanded. It was a pure cost-based decision. When managers announced it to people, they were shocked, completely hijacked by their feelings. The leader mentioned that individual meeting would follow. At that point, the announcement meeting ended. As much as this was disappointing, we needed to keep on working. So, when the first wave of emotions settled, the discussions continued. It took a few days though.Emotions are a fuel of communication. Yet, often they are inhabiting purposeful collaboration. Handle your emotions as you must handle your team member's emotions. Conversations can get heated with you or with them. But facts should stay clear. Is the solution good or bad? Based on what facts? If someone feels it is good or bad? They can work with intuition, but not with the actual reality. Delegate tasks to cover the topic if you must.You should reflect on your feelings. You might be angry, or ecstatic. Not everyone will share that with you. So, mind your feelings to make correct decisions based on facts, not based on what you like.The business was booming. My company acquired new projects and assigned them to my team. But, I didn't feel it was right for us to work on them as we were already busy. I felt annoyed and not comfortable presenting this news to my team. Nonetheless, it must have been done.Thus, I had to filter my opinions and cascade this news to my team. The way I did it was that I told them I knew were busy, but, we got this opportunity to work on it. I promised to support them as much as I could. We were all in one boat. Regardless of position. The simplicity was in the fact, that the company paid us for project work, and we got projects. So, we had to work them out and schedule plans as a group to mind the capacity. If we stayed annoyed as a group thanks to my poor communication, we would have not been productive and moved on anywhere.It is difficult to apologize. Especially, if you were convinced you were right. No. As a manager, you need to build an atmosphere in which people are not afraid of apologizing and acknowledging mistakes. After all, everything is a learning opportunity.I don't know everything. Although I need to make decisions. I had two options over how to lead a finance issue. The project manager suggested one solution, yet, I decided on the other. I was wrong. I had to come to her and sincerely apologize for not listening to her. There are never enough opportunities to either praise or apologize at work.Any meeting should have an agenda. But, that's not always working. If you are stuck on some topic and discussion gets all over the place. You might need to cut it off. A lot of meetings from my experience end up in vain as there is no solution. We often go into too many details with one and won't manage the other, a lot of people have ideas and the time is short or similar. You must be flexible and find the right time to move on or to stop the meeting and move it to another day.Take ownership over the situation and don't let people argue with each other. Always ensure respectful communication. Even if it means you have to have a series of meetings to solve one business case.A big problem is when someone steals your meeting. These meeting hackers occur from time to time. Watch out for them! I had a colleague who was always commenting on presentations. Sometimes fun, sometimes not. He periodically tried to hack meetings by diverting conversations to unrelated topics. During presentations, they hated him for being loud and stealing their thunder. So, I led a training about how to deal with disruptions during meetings and how to handle frustration while public speaking. Flexibility was key. So, we learned to flip such interruptions into a joke, if necessary made colleagues silent, and continued in a discussion.Listening is the most important. Listen to how people speak to you. Listen to their complaints, their wins, and their problems. If they share these with you, you are on a good way to build a psychologically safe atmosphere. So, don't underestimate moments when people reply, 'I am fine, everything is fine.' When you ask them how they are doing. Dig deeper. See what is happening under their facade.Identify a problem in its beginning before it grows over your head. As a manager, try to be one step ahead and track conditions in your team. By listening to how people speak to each other, you can undercover potential problems of disrespect and competition. Negative values can destroy psychological safety. If your colleagues make fun of each other and genuinely bully one of them, then you have a problem.One great example is a rotating team meeting chair. If you are not a leader of the meeting, you can watch how other people lead and talk together. I did it. I noticed an interesting fact - one colleague was always complaining, another was always silent, one was a clown of the meeting and the last one had better ideas than others. Thanks to that, I could work with each of them on their 'thing' to make their communication more professional. By knowing how they worked and communicated I gained their trust and respect for my feedback.You can destroy a psychologically safe atmosphere easily. When you are not honest, you tell lies, you have a closed mindset when you are selfish or don't listen to your colleagues. So, be mindful to try to keep trust high. Psychological safety is an important ingredient in your management cookbook. It allows you to work with people and communicate without hesitation.So, don't be afraid of cancelling the meeting if you are not ready for it. You can stop a meeting at any point when you feel it is not going anywhere or that you or your team needs to think and digest things first. You can always go back and seek solutions when you are not steered by your positive or negative emotions. Your priority should be always to create an atmosphere in which people feel safe.Interesting books about the topic of psychological safety:Edmondson, A. (2018). The Fearless Organization: Creating Psychological Safety in the Workplace for Learning, Innovation, and GrowthClark R. T. (2020).

5 Rules I Followed to Build a 6-Figure Online Business with My Boyfriend,"In April 2017, I participated in an event series designed to help students tap into entrepreneurship. A month later, I wasn't only dedicated to starting my own business but also dating one of the event organizers.Three months after I met Philip, we started organizing personal development workshops for students. What began as a passion project soon turned into our common life goal: Supporting people to unleash their full potential through a business that deeply fulfills us.Our workshops were a side hustle and we barely charged attendees. We've not been after the money but about the experiences we made and the people we met.Three years later, we decided to stop hosting workshops and to focus on building an online business.Luckily, we made that decision in December 2019, shortly before the pandemic heavily affected the event business anyway.In the following months, we used our time to build a 6-figure online business in less than a year.And even though I'd choose the same path over and over again, running your business with your better half isn't always easy.When I first told Philip that I want to schedule business meetings and write minutes, he thought I was joking.But the reality is that business meetings and romantic dates can quickly become indistinct if you don't set boundaries.As a passionate entrepreneur, you might often find yourself working late at night or during the weekend. At the same time, you might find yourself talking about the business all the time.To avoid this, we schedule business meetings and date nights.We take an hour every Monday to talk about our goals for the week. Additionally, we decide on a shared activity we want to engage in to nourish our relationship. This can be a movie night, going out for drinks, playing billard, or anything else that we enjoy doing together.Apart from that, we're also careful about making sure each of us has enough alone time.My partner and I live together and work together, which basically means we spend 99.9% of our time together.And even though we love this reality, we both need our alone time too.You might not be able to fully separate the business from your private life when you're running a company with your partner.However, you can at least ensure that you talk about important things during a more formal business meeting.Additionally, don't forget to schedule romantic dates and me-time so you can also nourish your relationship and take care of yourself while growing your company.And make sure you don't forget to celebrate your wins during your date nights. Sometimes, we get so caught up in chasing the next big thing that we forget to embrace our successes.You can work hard and play hard. If you do both, the whole journey will be more fun and fulfilling, so make sure you also reward yourself.Effective leadership includes critiquing, empowering, and coaching those around you.Even though we're still a team of two and only hire freelancers for specific projects, Philip and I give our best to show up as leaders by being each other's critics, cheerleaders, and coaches.Keeping these three fundamentals in mind helps us perform at our best while improving as business partners and caring lovers.We both expect each other to provide constructive feedback, cheer each other up, and support each other during challenging situations.Even if you've been in a relationship for years, starting and running a business with your partner might be a whole new challenge.Before you dive into scaling your numbers, make sure you set a healthy foundation for your personal growth by showing up as each other's critic, cheerleader, and coach.Giving constructive feedback as a critic or supporting each other as a coach isn't always easy, but it'll help you move forward with fun and ease.As a passionate entrepreneur, you'll likely be excited about your business and talk about your ideas late at night or during a romantic dinner.This has become normal for us because we decided that's how we want to live our lives. We love what we do and if one of us has an idea or question, we don't hesitate to talk about the business at 10 pm.However, finding a balance wasn't easy and if you're not careful about setting boundaries, you might soon find yourself living for the business, which isn't the goal.Especially if you're starting a side-hustle, it can be worth separating your work from your relationship.Otherwise, it can quickly become hard to set priorities and you might lack intimacy and romance in your relationship.Sometimes, it's important to be in a co-founder role and act as business partners instead of a couple. And sometimes, the contrary is the case.You really can't expect to build a successful business if you can't clearly communicate your expectations.However, giving feedback without hurting each other is particularly challenging when you're in a relationship, so make sure you know what your partner needs and expects.You can indeed be respectful and supportive while disagreeing with each other. Just make sure you understand the needs and desires of your partner - in your relationship but also as a co-founder.This will ensure that you can perform at your best while also enjoying your romantic partnership.When we first started our business, I often found myself questioning our choices but didn't feel comfortable sharing my doubts with my partner.On the one side, I didn't want to sound pessimistic and doubt our goals and on the other side, I was afraid of disappointing him.This led to lots of frustration as I didn't feel intrinsically motivated to work on our common goals. And in the end, he always knew that something was off anyway.Looking back, the #1 rule I'd define is to make sure you both can question your choices and goals without feeling bad.Just because you decide to work on common goals doesn't mean you can't make changes.Entrepreneurship requires lots of trial and error and if you're afraid to talk about your doubts, you might end up wasting lots of time.Regularly check in with your partner and talk about the big picture of your business and relationship.We take time for long reflection sessions once every three months. However, we also check in monthly to see if we're both on the same page and comfortable with the projects we're currently working on.If you don't take time for these conversations, you might soon develop different visions and goals, which will definitely harm both your business and your relationship.Smart entrepreneurs don't start a business with someone who has the same skills and strengths.If you and your co-founder are both programmers, but none of you can sell the product, you'll have a problem.In that case, you'll either need to hire a salesperson or invest lots of time into learning how to market your product.On the contrary, if you have different skills and strengths, you'll be able to come far without paying someone or investing additional time.When Philip and I first started our business, we've been working on the same tasks. We didn't know our strengths and weaknesses and often spent hours working on certain tasks together instead of assigning clear responsibilities.This wasn't only time-consuming but also exhausting and frustrating.It took us three years to realize that we have completely different strengths that would help us move our business forward.While I'm a prolific writer and can easily connect with our audience, Philip is great at business development and manages the entire technical back end of our company. Combining these skills helped us scale from zero to six figures in ten months without hiring employees or exhausting ourselves.If you want to build and scale a business with your better half, make sure your skills and strengths are complementary.Figuring out what you're good at might take some time, but it'll be worth it.Contrary to the beginning, we now have distinct responsibilities.Instead of working on everything simultaneously, we ensure that both of us can play to their strengths. This doesn't only lead to better results, but it also makes each of us happier as we can focus on the things we're each good at.Wanna become your best self?

Build Strong Freelance Tax Foundations,"Explore some of the positive steps you can take right now to get the right areas in place for easier freelance taxes in future.Welcome to this delicious and wholesome part of my guide to freelance taxes. It's time to talk about building the right foundations to make your taxes that much easier - and that's always a good thing.Before we get started, if you're not sure what these guides are all about, I recommend you read my introduction to the freelance tax guide.If you're confused about any of the definitions I use here, check out the glossary.You might also want to see what business structure is best for you.In this part of the guide, I'll cover some of the key areas to think about when you're setting up your freelance business. These steps will make your tax filings a little bit smoother, and who doesn't want that? These tips aren't just for brand new freelancers either. If you're already running a freelance business, there may be some information you'll find helpful.Here's what this part of the guide to freelance taxes covers:I am not an accountant or qualified tax professional. These guides are intended only as general information, not as specific advice or recommendations. You should not rely on any of the information in these guides to make financial, tax, or other decisions. Always use official sources like the IRS website or your state's Department of Revenue to get accurate, up-to-date information.You should always speak to a qualified tax professional about your unique tax circumstances. These guides only apply to freelancers filing taxes as sole-proprietors or single-member LLCs in the United States. You'll find a disclaimer at the end of this article.The type of business you run determines if you must get a separate bank account for your freelance business:Even if you don't need a business bank account, it's often a very good idea to have one anyway.If you only have a tiny number of freelance transactions, then a business account might not help that much.If you have a medium or large number of invoices, receipts, bills, and expenses then a business bank account will make your financial management and bookkeeping easier, and time is money.An Employer Identification Number is a unique number that the IRS and other federal and state agencies will use to identify your freelance business.Even if you don't need a separate EIN, it's often a good idea to have one. It gives your business more legitimacy, can protect you from identity theft, and can help when opening a business bank account. There aren't really any downsides to having an EIN.It is free, fast, and simple to get an EIN from the IRS, and you can get one immediately online.A bookkeeping system is the answer to many, many freelance tax and finance woes! Good bookkeeping and accounting software will help you:There are several well-known online bookkeeping systems including FreshBooks, QuickBooks, Xero, and Wave. There are lots of comparisons of bookkeeping software online. Here's a good comparison from PCMag, another one from Investopedia, and another from The Balance.Bookkeeping systems are so important that I have dedicated an entire section of the guide to them.Good bookkeeping is critical to running a successful freelance business.Retirement accounts can be a useful way to reduce the amount of tax you owe, either when you contribute to the retirement account (Traditional accounts) or when you take money out in retirement (ROTH accounts). Here's a good explanation of retirement accounts for the self-employed.Probably the most important part for freelancers is that contributing to a Traditional IRA or equivalent 401(K) plan will reduce the amount of income you will need to pay federal or state income tax on. Specifically, contributions to these types of retirement accounts reduce your earnings for the purpose of calculating your taxable income.Retirement accounts do not have an impact on the amount of self-employment tax you pay.Note that there are contribution and income limits that will impact how much you can contribute to retirement accounts and whether those contributions are deductible for tax purposes. Talk to your accountant to understand what those are.Contributions to retirement funds can reduce your freelance taxable income.It's helpful to understand the various types of taxes and how they will be applied to your freelance income.There are two main federal taxes - federal income tax and self-employment tax, both of these are payable to the IRS. You will generally need to make estimated tax payments on your expected earnings throughout the year.Federal income tax is charged in bands on all your income, including your freelance earnings. the amount you pay in federal income tax depends on how much you earn. Most freelancers will pay tax at a 10%, and then a 12% rate. If you're making a good income from your freelance business, then the top part of your income may be taxed at a 22% rate or even higher.Self-employment tax is charged on all of your freelance earnings at a rate of 15.3%.In most states, freelancers will also need to pay state income on their freelance earnings. This tax is filed with and paid to your state's Department of Revenue. Income tax rates vary from state to state.Several states do not charge state income tax, they are: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. New Hampshire and Tennessee don't tax earned income either (including freelancing), but they do tax investment income.If you use a payroll system to pay yourself or employees, you will need to pay Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) taxes and State Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA) taxes to the relevant agencies. These taxes are not due on money taken out of the business as an ""owner's draw"" which is typically how you pay yourself as a sole proprietor or LLC. These taxes are out of scope for this freelance tax guide.You may also need to pay other types of taxes, like franchise taxes or local and municipal taxes. These taxes are out of scope for this freelance tax guide. Talk to your accountant to see if you may be liable for other types of taxes.Understand your taxes so you can be sure you're putting enough aside each quarter for estimated taxes and at the end of the year.An accountant will provide you with expert, tailored advice for your freelance business and taxes. They will often help you find expenses, deductions, and credits that will outweigh the cost of hiring them in the first place, and remember that fees for your business accounting are fully tax-deductible.If you are a partnership, S Corporation, multi-member LLC, or C Corporation, then you should always hire an accountant to assist with taxes. There are extra forms that these types of businesses need to file, and an accountant will ensure you're compliant.If you're a single-member LLC or a sole proprietor, then you may find that you can file your taxes yourself through software like TurboTax, H&R Block, TaxSlayer, or TaxAct. I would still recommend that you hire an accountant, to ensure that you're reporting and filing taxes correctly.Hiring an accountant helps ensure you get all your taxes right.Alright, that's it for this part of the freelance tax guide.

Why Jamus Lim Is Wrong On Carbon Taxes,"Many carbon tax advocates - such as the Workers Party economist Jamus Lim - tend to hedge their support for the tax hike on a conditional rebate (see here). It stems from the recognition that making energy more expensive will create some negative consequences such as higher consumer prices, job loss etc, so there is a need to compensate the ones whom are hurt by the tax via rebates, tax reductions, etc. We can all at least agree on that.The problem is that cash rebates to the poor don't easily compensate the long-term costs of carbon taxes. Carbon taxes differ from other types of broad-based taxes on labour and consumption because it is targeted at a much narrower tax base (which makes it easier to avoid). This matters because it means carbon taxes create a larger distortionary effect that ripples through the economy.A carbon tax primarily penalises high energy consumption activities first. In Singapore, this would apply to the bulk of the economy since 79% of total electricity consumption comes from industrial and commerce-related activities (household energy consumption make up only about 15%). These producers will then react to the rise in energy costs by scaling back investment and production.This then in turn hurts economic productivity as a whole. Eventually, this will manifest in job losses - most noticeably in oil & gas but overtime also in other industries - and a rise in prices of goods that we see in supermarkets, how much transportation costs, etc.To put it very simply, carbon tax advocates imagine a 1-for-1 exchange where the government can send a low-income family $150 to offset a higher electricity bill this month due to the carbon tax (and thereby achieve revenue neutrality). But that is a pipe dream. It's nice in theory, but impossible in practice. The costs to the poor will be a lot higher than $150, and these costs slowly manifest in many daily economic activities when economic productivity slumps (for a more technical explanation of this, see the tax interaction effect here).Funding government spending for other environmental policies with the tax revenues of a carbon tax is also generally a bad idea. Tax economists widely agree that narrow-based taxes like carbon taxes raise taxes far less efficiently than broad-based labour/consumption taxes, particularly due to the way it hurts the economy. I agree with Jamus Lim that the government should orientate spending toward more environmentally-friendly infrastructure (as it has been for many years), but these tax revenues should be raised through broad-based taxes instead, as it would be far more efficient.Going green and reducing emissions is a worthy pursuit. But to reiterate, the carbon tax is the wrong answer. If anything, the existing carbon tax should be abolished. Public investment in greener and more economically efficient technologies, educational initiatives to nudge consumer behaviour towards less wasteful activities and cap and trade policies are all better policy tools that will hurt the poor a lot less.Donovan Choy is a Visiting Research Fellow at the Adam Smith Center Singapore.

Female Disruptors: ,"As a part of our series about women who are shaking things up in their industry, I had the pleasure of interviewing Elizabeth Brunner.Elizabeth Brunner is a San Francisco-based designer and the founder of StereoType, a fashion-forward kids clothing brand that's designed to celebrate individuality and freedom of expression by blending traditional ideas of boys' and girls' wear. StereoType's blended fashion collection combines elements of style, design and comfort to inspire creativity, individuality and freedom of expression. Throughout her life, Elizabeth has been examining our collective perceptions of fashion, and going through the process of learning and unlearning the 'rules' associated with it, which has become a deeply personal journey. After studying fashion design at California College of the Arts, Elizabeth found herself at odds with wasteful fashion industry standards. This led her to making the decision to launch her own line, Piece x Piece, a pioneering line of one-of-a-kind, high-end pieces that reused discarded sample swatches from larger fashion houses. However, it wasn't until a few years later that she met her ultimate style muses: her own boy-girl twins. Watching them dress themselves, she was in awe of the way they joyfully broke all the 'rules' of gendered clothing, blending their wardrobes together with a sense of style that could only be described as 'free-for-all.' It was the ultimate unlearning of the rules that we've all been taught about gendered fashion at a young age. The lesson felt deeply personal and Elizabeth knew there was no turning back. From there, StereoType was born. Elizabeth launched StereoType as a way to share this joyful, blended vision of kids' clothing and to advocate for self-expression of all humans, especially the small ones. Elizabeth believes that by breaking fashion rules and disregarding the boundaries we put around what boys and girls should wear, we encourage a more playful, creative, expressive sense of self for everyone.Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your ""backstory""? What led you to this particular career path?My journey to becoming a designer and eventually founding two clothing companies, including my current clothing brand, StereoType, began when I was a young girl. I watched my mother as she sewed clothes for herself and family, carefully cutting, measuring, laying out fabrics, and patterns, it really planted a seed. I would collect the scraps that she didn't use and then use those pieces to wrap around my Barbies. After studying fashion design at California College of the Arts, I found myself at odds with the waste of fashion industry standards. This led me to the idea for my first company, Piece x Piece, a pioneering line of one-of-a-kind, high-end clothing pieces that reused discarded sample swatches from local fashion houses, which I launched in 2010. Starting Piece x Piece was a full circle moment for me, relating directly back to my childhood time spent with my mom collecting scraps.It wasn't until a few years later that I met my ultimate style muses: my own boy-girl twins. As I watched them dress themselves, I was in awe of the way that they joyfully broke all of the ""rules"" of gendered clothing, blending their wardrobes together with a sense of style that could only be described as ""free-for-all."" My daughter always felt most comfortable digging around in the dirt in her dinosaur shorts while my son got pure joy from twirling around in dresses. As I watched my kids create their own ""blended style"" mixing and matching items from each other's closets, I myself started to ""unlearn"" all of the rules of gendered fashion that I was taught throughout my life.I created StereoType as a way for me to share the joy that my kids have experienced in creating their own style with ""blended fashion"" and to advocate for self-expression of all humans, especially the small ones. By breaking fashion rules and disregarding the boundaries we put around what boys and girls should wear, we encourage a more playful, creative, and expressive sense of self for everyone.StereoType is a fashion-forward kids clothing brand, advocating for individuality and an evolution of an expansive sense of self. My favorite part of this brand is working with my own kids. They inspired the line so they are very much a part of the creative side of the business. It's fun for them to have the opportunity to provide their input into each of the pieces in the collection, and offer their unique insights. It's exciting for them to know they are the inspiration behind StereoType.Can you tell our readers what it is about the work you're doing that's disruptive?StereoType is rooted in the idea of ""unlearning"" everything that we've been taught about gendered clothing. Historically, pink was considered a masuline color but somewhere along the way we were taught pink is only acceptable for girls and not for boys. We've been taught that girls should wear princess dresses but not clothes with dinosaurs or trucks. I am challenging those dated ideas with StereoType's blended fashion collection. ""Blended fashion"" as a concept is also disruptive. Blended fashion is the idea of mixing and matching items from the boys and girls sections that makes kids feel joyful and authentic to who they are and what they want to wear. Blended fashion is all about not letting your kids be afraid to pick out what they want to wear and challenging the norms of gendered fashion.Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?When I started my first business, Piece x Piece, I put way too much stock into my Instagram following. Social media and building a following from scratch for a brand new company takes a lot of work and commitment - it's a long game - and I wasn't overly comfortable with social media at the time (I'm still not.) It was really challenging for me and the mistake that I made was self-identifying with my business, how many followers it had on Instagram and ultimately with its successes and failures. My big takeaway from that business that I am now implementing for StereoType is that my business is my business, and I am who I'm as a person, and my self-worth doesn't depend on my business' success or failure. Additionally, I also learned that no one can ever be an expert in every aspect of a business and that it's OK to ask questions and hire people for your weaknesses to support with the different areas of business such as social media, content development, public relations, etc.We all need a little help along the journey. Who have been some of your mentors? Can you share a story about how they made an impact?I feel incredibly lucky because my husband Robert is a great mentor for me. He knows what it's like to start and run a business because he has done it a few times himself. He started his latest company Ammunition Group in 2007, so having his insight, advice and support along the way has been a true gift during my journey as an entrepreneur.As I was starting my first business, Piece x Piece, I was feeling overwhelmed and I told my husband that I was feeling unsure about what I was doing and the next steps. He gave me this valuable advice that I'll never forget. He said, ""You will stumble and fail along the way and it's OK, that's part of figuring it all out. You have to take risks to get to where you want to go!"" He gave me a lot of self-confidence when things started to get challenging and I started to doubt myself. He continues to offer his sage business advice and unwavering support. He's the best!In addition to my husband, I've found many other mentors in friends, books, podcasts, and YouTube. Today, mentors are everywhere, and if you take the time to look, you'll find them!In today's parlance, being disruptive is usually a positive adjective. But is disrupting always good? When do we say the converse, that a system or structure has 'withstood the test of time'? Can you articulate to our readers when disrupting an industry is positive, and when disrupting an industry is 'not so positive'? Can you share some examples of what you mean?I believe that being disruptive is positive when there is a new perspective being offered on something that's not often thought of. For instance, when something is positively disruptive, it offers an opportunity to see something in a new way. For example, with StereoType, we offer equality to boys and girls, by disrupting the ""norms"" of gendered clothing.When something is disruptive in a 'not so positive' way, it makes people feel isolated or separate. In our business, we view equality and inclusion as a huge part of our mission and vision. But for example, if a business' goal is to create separation or exclusion, in my perspective, that's causing negative disruption.Can you share 3 of the best words of advice you've gotten along your journey? Please give a story or example for each.Keep going, even when things get hard. When I was starting my first business, Piece x Piece, I was feeling unsure about all of it, and feeling really challenged by what the next steps for the business should be and my husband, who's a long-time entrepreneur, gave me this advice. He explained to me the importance of moving through challenges without letting them stop you. Many people are really afraid to fail, so they don't even start. He explained to me that challenges are going to arise and test you but it isn't a bad thing, as long you keep moving forward. There's always a way to figure it out and move on.Don't identify your self-worth with your business. This is something that I self-discovered throughout my journey as a first-time entrepreneur with my business Piece x Piece. I learned to not self-identify with the ups and downs of being a business owner. While you are the ""idea"" behind the business, you are not your business. It's important to understand that you are on the journey of entrepreneurship with fresh eyes and almost everything is a new experience at the beginning. For me, realizing that I won't know everything and being OK with it was an incredibly valuable lesson. Not identifying with my business has given me the space to accept successes and failures as they come, without being attached to either outcome - while continuing to focus on my vision.Listen to your gut. Since starting my first business and now working on my second, StereoType, I've realized that I can run my business in the way that I want to run it and have the power and confidence to do so. Specifically, I have learned to trust myself when it comes to making big decisions and listen to my gut. There will be people who come along the way (whether advisors, consultants or employees) who don't always have the same vision as the founder of the business and what I have realized through experience is that it's critical to take time to listen to my myself before making decisions, so I am not led away from my original vision. I think this advice is pretty specific to women. Speaking up and sharing my perspective and point of view is really important and something that I have to keep practicing as a business owner. For example, with my current business, I had the intention of building a team of women to support me in bringing my vision to life. I trusted my gut on this and now have an amazing group of women working collaboratively with me on building the StereoType brand.We are sure you aren't done. How are you going to shake things up next?I plan to expand the conversation about gendered clothing for kids by continuing to speak up and inspiring a new way of thinking around gendered fashion. For instance, boys love sparkle just as much as girls do. Girls love camo and dinosaurs just as much as boys do. At StereoType, we are committed to elevating the conversation about ""blended fashion"" to make it mainstream and normalized.In your opinion, what are the biggest challenges faced by 'women disruptors' that aren't typically faced by their male counterparts?Women disruptors are still challenged with speaking up and speaking out about ""disruptive"" topics and going against the grain of what's been traditionally done. With men traditionally being in the leadership roles, it takes practice to voice our perspective and opinions, particularly if it's very different from that of our male counterparts.Asking clarifying questions. In the past, I've worked with designers and tried to keep up with their highly technical language and eventually realized that asking clarifying questions was extremely important for me to fully grasp the subject matter. It can be intimidating when someone that you're working with is saying things that are difficult to understand but it's an essential step of understanding and having clarity.Do you have a book/podcast/talk that's had a deep impact on your thinking? Can you share a story with us?How I Built This: The Unexpected Paths to Success From the World's Most Inspiring Entrepreneurs. This book (which is also a podcast) has so much great advice for new entrepreneurs about navigating the business world. It has been super inspiring to me because it shares the struggles of being an entrepreneur and how those entrepreneurs get through those struggles.Dr. Shefali's Book and Talk on Mindvalley on Conscious Parenting. In this talk, Dr. Shefali talks about being a conscious parent and also being conscious in your overall life. She makes it an easy topic to understand. One of her first talks that I listened to, she said, ""You are already making mistakes, but the beauty is that you can be conscious of those mistakes and choose another way next time."" Knowing that I will make mistakes and understanding where the ego comes in is such an important concept and has inspired me to consciously choose another way to parent.The Michelle Obama Podcast. Finding people who are uplifting in life and in business is only going to further you along in your path and give you the tools to keep going. Actively seeking out inspirational stories and messages is key in your journey and Michelle Obama's podcast offers just that.You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)A movement I'd like to inspire is the growth of open-minded parents. To inspire parents to continue to find new ways of learning about bonding and connecting with their kids. I'd also love to encourage parents to play more, get silly, and get their hands dirty and nourish that ""inner child"" on a regular basis. I believe the more open-minded parents are, the more they'll nourish their individuality and take pleasure in things that they used to when they were kids, the deeper the connection will be created between them and their kids.Can you please give us your favorite ""Life Lesson Quote""? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?""Be who you are, and say how you feel, because those who matter don't mind, and those who mind, don't matter."" - Bernard M. Baruch.I found this quote when I was first starting StereoType and for me it really resonated with the idea behind the brand as it supports the importance of being yourself.How can readers follow you online?Instagram: @stereotypekidsofficialFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StereoType-Kids-105395494671591/Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/stereotypekidsWebsite: https://stereotypekids.com/",,https://medium.com/authority-magazine/female-disruptors-elizabeth-brunner-of-stereotype-on-the-three-things-you-need-to-shake-up-your-70216f24eec4,startups,d6f735ca440336de7f881a868d7bbd4fe29d0aad10ceb373af2dcf92
3 Ways to Become a Leader That Everyone Wants to Work For,"Having a bi-weekly potluck is never going to be enough.The overarching question is while everyone has the ability to manage a group of people, does everybody have the ability to lead?The answer to that question is 'yes'.You don't have to be the boss that walks into the breakroom and your direct reports instantly get quiet because they are talking crap about you. The manager that makes everyone question how you managed to land your role.It takes work, time, and energy.You can grow your leadership skills in such a way that will not only make other department heads look up to you, but employees will want to work for you.Everybody has things that they are good at and things that they are bad at.As a leader, it's up to you to figure out what skills and responsibilities are your strengths and weaknesses.A good practice to do this is to create a 'T-chart'.Think about all of the qualities you deem the most important for a leader to have. Is it having an even temper? How about effective conflict resolution?Whatever those qualities are, list them on one side of the chart. Then, circle the ones that you are confident in your ability to enact.Those are your strengths.After you've finished circling those, then, identify qualities that you oppose within a leader. Once that list is compiled, circle the qualities that you think you exhibit.Those are your weaknesses.Spend time either working on practicing your strengths or eliminating your weaknesses.To fail is an innate part of being human.Whether it's failing at fully training an employee or your business plan not quite meeting the monthly quota, failing is a part of life.As a good leader, it's your responsibility to be honest about and own your defeats. There are things that you can do as a department lead to prepare your team for your shortcomings.There's no need to wallow in your own self-pity or to dwell on whether or not you let your team down - build a space that supports these types of things.Take the time to be open and honest with your team.Do you have specific, realistic expectations of each person? What are the goals of your company for the month? For the year?Be vocal about the direction your company is headed and what exactly needs to happen to successfully get to the destination.There are multiple different types of feedback, 2 being positive and negative.As you would assume, positive feedback entails letting someone know what good, impactful things they have done. It provides reassurance that what is being done is working.On the other hand, negative feedback is constructive criticism.Keeping your team in the loop on how they are performing is not only integral to the company but to each individual specifically. You're placing confidence in them that you can successfully help them be successful.Don't be a lazy manager. The one that's pedestal is so high up that you aren't capable or willing to do mundane tasks.There's a definitive line that's drawn between tasks that employees should have an opportunity to handle and tasks that you can jump in on.For instance, you should ask yourself these types of questions - Is this type of task reoccurring? Are any of my team members equipped with the required knowledge and skills to accurately complete this?Don't take opportunities from your team members to acquire new skills and to grow as team members, but at the same time, don't throw them to the wolves.Nobody likes a helicopter boss.Don't micro-manage your team. Don't be the person who is in their business at all times wanting to know what they are working on and going to do next.That type of management style gives off the impression that you don't trust your team. It tells them that you think they are incapable of working independently.You should avoid that at all costs.On the other end of the spectrum, don't be so hands-off that you are perceived as not caring - macro-managing. You want your team to know that you care, are there to support, and are intuitive to their needs.You have the power to become the leader that everybody wants to work for.We all have it within us to effectively lead a team of people, you just have to be able to reach within yourself to pull your skills to the surface.Take the time to reflect on who you are as a leader - what are your skills and weaknesses? As a leader, you need to be able to come to terms with the fact that you aren't always going to achieve what you set out to do.It's those moments of defeat that you can use to uplift your team and create a space that normalizes making mistakes.Be open and deliberate. Make sure that you are keeping the necessary lines of communication open with your staff.Finally, figure out what situations call for delegation and which ones call for your attention.Don't underestimate your team's ability to work efficiently, but also don't assume that they don't need support.You don't have to be the manager that people hate working for, you can be the leader that everyone wants to work for.",,https://medium.com/illumination-curated/3-ways-to-become-a-leader-that-everyone-wants-to-work-for-8a7bf14ffe59,leadership,d7ab40db693953c83bac1f442ee20da1d370a6f594da04134ca5d40f
The Variety of Synaptic Experience,"With three pounds of globby matter sloshing around in a bony bowl of crackling biochemical soup teetering atop the shoulders - and just 25 watts of power, roughly the equivalent of a dim light bulb- the human brain is quite an extraordinary machine.Encoded in the firing of its neurons is the embodiment of an evolving conscious experience.It renders the game of life across a multiplicity of senses in real-time while computing the complexity of subjectively experienced qualia and emotions in parallel - ranging from the colors of the rainbow to the sound of a symphony to the taste of a finely filleted mignon.It dives deep down into the feelings of anguish, envy, and disgust. And ascends all the way up to those of aspiration and unconditional love.The inertia of memory and expectation are encoded in its synapses - remnants of the past and the future - and they collide ceaselessly and seamlessly in the present, distorting perception, altering the direction of decision, and displacing action, more or less, toward survival and reproduction.In short, the brain is a tool for agency in the game of life, a personal computer to calculate the consequences of choice. In toto, it is a vehicle for conscious experience and evolution.And it can be argued that our perceptions of the world, the contents of conscious experience - apparently -are not even real.How do you define real?And electrical signals interpreted by your brain is, precisely, the problem.Anil Seth, a professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex who studies the basis of consciousness in the brain, argues that we never see the world as it really is.That instead, evolution has shaped our perceptual mechanisms -the interpreters of electrical signals in our brains- to generate a re-construction of reality rather than re-presenting the thing itself.Reality - as we perceive it - is a simulation built on the regularities of the universe that are encoded in our sensory data. It is an electromagnetic abstraction of experience shaped by evolution that is further distorted by the irregularities of expectation.Whatever the universe is, through perception we are presented with a shortcut to interaction - a model of reality - and the construction of experience, the user interface, is necessarily constrained by its consistencies.With the brain, we have a distorted low-pass filter optimized to make decisions quickly and focus on what is relevant to survival - and to tune out all the rest. In the game of life, this is all that matters, this ability to be shaped by and to reshape the environment.Consequently, the perception of reality is a controlled hallucination mediated by a medley of neurotransmitters circulating throughout the nervous system to maximize survival.And at the core of reality, there are likely hidden causes that we can never directly access.Perception is our best guess to what is out there.Karl Friston, a neuroscientist at University College, London who frequently thinks about what is out there, formulated his best guess and proposed the free energy principle.In his principle, Friston proposes that living systems can remain in a non-equilibrium steady-state - such as we find ourselves - by restricting themselves to a limited number of states.In limiting the number of options available - i.e. minimizing free energy - a stable platform of emergence is made possible through which energy can evolve and nature can express itself with greater degrees of complexity.Variational free energy, as it is called, is a function of observations and a probability density over their hidden causes, which entails beliefs about the hidden states of the environment.When a system actively makes observations - when it interacts with its environment - to minimize free energy, it implicitly performs active inference and maximizes the evidence for its model of the world through its actions.The brain, then, in reflecting upon itself and the world, is an inference engine trying to figure out what is going to happen next given the sensory data. And minimizing free energy is the process of minimizing the difference between its model of the world and the perception of it.As beings constantly engaged in this perception-action loop, this generally means one thing for us:Surprise is the signal that the model is wrong - that the truth is stranger than the fiction - and that something needs updating, sometimes immediately.With the free energy principle, we are left with but two options:Consciousness, Friston proposes, is not a thing, but rather an ongoing inferential process making predictions about the universe to profit from its probability, so that it may propagate itself in perpetuity. Choice is the vehicle of its expression.In essence, consciousness is a function that collapses reality into a useful model that predicts what the world should be like and, apparently, gives us a choice in the matter.Donald Hoffman, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, Irvine, has also proposed that the brain is essentially a VR headset optimized by evolution to play the game of life. A tool for consciousness to model the world and update it, to render the effects of choice.With this immersive simulation- a video game, if you will - and by hiding the source code, the brain can most efficiently compute predictions about the future based on experiences from the past that will generally increase the odds of survival in the present.""Evolution has shaped us with perceptions that allow us to survive. But part of that involves hiding from us the stuff we don't need to know. And that's pretty much all of reality, whatever reality might be. [3]Following the path of Hoffman's evolutionary argument, we find that truth is the first casualty of perception, and that this illusion is a prerequisite for progress toward something greater.Like an icon on a phone that hides the details of the bits of electricity pulsing through its transistors, so too, Hoffman proposes, is the perception of spacetime itself - our conscious experience - the user interface to a hidden reality that is encoded by and transformed within the firing of neurons in the brain.Through this re-presentation - this interpretation of electrical signals - we find a useful shortcut to interact with the world, a filter to focus attention on what is relevant to fitness and to forget about the rest.It is the virtual projection of an underlying order that exists beyond the senses, beyond what we perceive to be in space and time. Plato's shadow.And the condensation of experience into consciousness through spacetime proves itself to be a fortuitous mechanism for the interpretation of electrical signals by the brain with respect to survival.With each firing of an action potential, the brain updates its model of the world and projects the prediction to the screen of awareness, thereby influencing the inertia of its actions and the subsequent state and model of the world.Which begs the question - if spacetime is not fundamental, then what is?In his paper Objects of consciousness [4], Hoffman proposes that consciousness itself is a fundamental property of the universe.""To construct a theory of consciousness we propose a simple but rigorous formalism called a conscious agent, consisting of six components.""We then state the conscious agent thesis, which claims that every property of consciousness can be represented by some property of a conscious agent or system of interacting conscious agents.""A key intuition is that consciousness involves three processes: perception, decision, and action.""In the process of perception, a conscious agent interacts with the world and, in consequence, has conscious experiences.""In the process of decision, a conscious agent chooses what actions to take based on the conscious experiences it has.""In the process of action, the conscious agent interacts with the world in light of the decision it has taken, and affects the state of the world.""However, when considering the processes of perception, decision and action, it does seem necessary to discuss conditional probability.""A general way to model such conditional probabilities is by the mathematical formalism of Markovian kernels. One can think of a Markovian kernel as simply an indexed list of probability measures.""A Markovian kernel can also be thought of as an information channel.""So, each time a conscious agent interacts with the world and, in consequence, has a conscious experience, we can think of this interaction as a message being passed from the world to the conscious agent over a channel.""Similarly, each time the conscious agent has a conscious experience and, in consequence, decides on an action to take, we can think of this decision as a message being passed over a channel within the conscious agent itself.""And when the conscious agent then takes the action and, in consequence, alters the state of the world, we can think of this as a message being passed from the conscious agent to the world over a channel.With the scientific method, admission to reality is gated by the independent repetition of results and, with the brain, all roads thus far have led to the hard problem of consciousness. The binding problem of perception with the inevitable conclusion:This means that - whatever it is - it cannot be reduced to variables where its states are examined carefully, replicated faithfully in experiment, and captured precisely by equation.Or in essence, shared with others, despite being so apparently ... real.Consequently, consciousness - the playground of thoughts and ideas - has been scrubbed from the formulae describing our collective experience of the world and deemed, largely, negligible.Nonetheless, consciousness - the platform of daily existence - seems to be abundantly obvious and it pretty much goes without saying.The foundation of science is built on the premise of establishing axiomatic principles that cannot be doubted and proceeding to discover truths and certainty from these axioms.And with his single axiom, Descartes established the de facto first principle of the scientific method - perhaps confusing the effect with the cause - and thereby encoding a presupposition of consciousness throughout the centuries.Nonetheless, with the aid of language and despite the fundamental but necessary delusion, a marvelous array of human brains have brilliantly constructed fairly accurate models of the universe - of its underlying order- through the theories of general relativity, quantum mechanics, evolution, and neuroscience.With their equations we can catch a glimpse of whatever reality is and capitalize on it through the repetition of results. Truth is not found, per se, in the equations themselves but rather in the regularities of their predictable observations.And standing on the shoulders of giants, we can see the consequences of our collective model building over the centuries-perhaps even the trajectory of what is possible and where we are going.The human brain, in its capacity to interact with reality through the mirage of perception - in its ability to play the game of life - is, understatedly, quite remarkable.And consciousness -the passenger peering out the perceptory window, the occasional driver at the wheel - though directly experienced from moment to moment, seemingly persistent over time, and on which success in the game largely depends, remains a complete conundrum with respect to scientific inquiry and explanation.The same brains that have brilliantly pieced together the story of the universe and our place within it have all failed to empirically account for the notion of consciousness itself and the role played by the brain in steering it toward the formulation of such incredibly successful theories!In the wrangling of uncertainty through observation - the dance of the scientific method - that which we understand the least appears to be a given.And it sits at the center of every experience we have, shaping everything that we think, feel, touch, see, and do. Everything that we measure and observe.It is the author of every equation, the conductor of every orchestra, and the audience of every illusion.To some, consciousness is the first principle.If we are to make progress with this axiom - that consciousness is fundamental- then we must clearly define a model which is capable not only of explaining choice but also predicting its contours throughout the history of the cosmos.Fortunately for us, Henri Bergson, a French philosopher from the turn of the 20th century, has already spent a lifetime pondering this very problem. What model of the universe is capable not only of capturing its mathematical structure but also its intent?In 1907, Bergson published his philosophy in a book called Creative Evolution [5] in which he examined evolution, perception, and consciousness -notably before the advent of genetics, general relativity, quantum mechanics, cosmology, and neuroscience -and concluded that:Free energy, if you will, with one primary cause -the need to create, the need to express novelty in nature.The following words are his own ...""Transformation is brought about by the influence of the external on the internal, continuously exerted in the same direction""The mysterious power of building up very complicated machines to utilize the simple excitation that it undergoes.""It will have to make the best of these circumstances, neutralize their inconveniences and utilize their advantages - in short, respond to outer actions by building up a machine which has no resemblance to them.""Life is, more than anything else, a tendency to act on inert matter.""Nature's simple act has divided itself automatically into an infinity of elements which are then found to be coordinated to one idea.""Consciousness is the light that plays around the zone of possible actions or potential activity which surrounds the action really performed by the living being.""It measures the interval between representation and action.""Consciousness seems proportionate to the living being's power of choice.""What does this mean, if not that my perception displays, in the midst of the image world, as would their outward reflection or shadow, the eventual or possible actions of my body?""What you have to explain, then, is not how perception arises, but how it is limited, since it should be the image of the whole, and is in fact reduced to the image of that which interests you.""In a general way, reality is ordered exactly to the degree in which it satisfies our thought.""Consciousness, which is a need of creation, is made manifest to itself only where creation is possible.""It wakens as soon as the possibility of a choice is restored.""For consciousness corresponds exactly to the living being's power of choice""Co-extensive with the fringe of possible action that surrounds the real action, consciousness is synonymous with invention and with freedom.""To sum up - if we suppose an extended continuum, and, in this continuum, the centre of real action which is represented by our body:""Life as a whole, from the initial impulsion that thrust it into the world, will appear as a wave which rises, and which is opposed by the descending movement of matter.""We show how a certain direction has been followed further and further by beings more and more intelligent.Nearly a century after Bergson published his philosophy of creative evolution, Dr. Guilio Tononi, a neuroscientist and psychiatrist at the University of Wisconsin, proposed a mathematical theory of consciousness in 2004. [7]""Integrated information theory (IIT) attempts to identify the essential properties of consciousness (axioms) and, from there, infers the properties of physical systems that can account for it (postulates).""Based on the postulates, it permits in principle to derive, for any particular system of elements in a state, whether it has consciousness, how much, and which particular experience it is having.""IIT offers a parsimonious explanation for empirical evidence, makes testable predictions, and permits inferences and extrapolations.The axioms of IIT are meant to capture the essential properties of experience:Intrinsic Existence - Consciousness exists: each experience is actual.Composition - Consciousness is structured: each experience is composed of multiple phenomenological distinctions, elementary or higher-order.Information - Consciousness is specific: each experience is the particular way it is - being composed of a specific set of specific phenomenal distinctions - thereby differing from other possible experiences (differentiation).Integration - Consciousness is unified: each experience is irreducible to non-interdependent, disjoint subsets of phenomenal distinctions.Exclusion - Consciousness is definite, in content and spatio-temporal grain: each experience has the set of phenomenal distinctions it has, neither less (a subset) nor more (a superset), and it flows at the speed it flows, neither faster nor slower.""The axioms describe regularities in conscious experience, and IIT seeks to explain these regularities by asking the question:""IIT argues that the existence of an underlying causal system with these same properties offers the most parsimonious explanation.[8] ""IIT addresses the mind-body problem by proposing an identity between phenomenological properties of experience and causal properties of physical systems:""The conceptual structure specified by a complex of elements in a state is identical to its experience. According to IIT,With IIT, we are presented with the idea that experience itself is an intrinsic property of the complexity of electrical signals in the brain.Consciousness is not something constructed by neural firings, but rather something fundamental that is experienced and expressed through them in response to the world.Consciousness - as both audience and author of the illusion - is a channel for creativity that is always compounding the interest of choice, and it is one and the same thing as the electrical signals encoded within the substrate.In her book, The Nature of Consciousness: A Hypothesis [10], Susan Pockett shares a rather simple theory of consciousness that may open the doors of observation to consciousness and the brain.""The basic fundamental principle being proposed here is that: consciousness is identical with certain spatiotemporal patterns in the electromagnetic field.And in her book, The Electromagnetic Brain: EM Field Theories on the Nature of Consciousness, Shelli Renée Joye summarizes the start of the art with respect to the interpretation of electromagnetic fields in the brain.""The process can also be viewed mathematically as a continual Fourier transformation of energy resonating between two orders.""The EM field theory of consciousness predicts that correctly configured EM fields that are produced by hardware will be just as conscious as similarly configured fields that are produced by wetware, so according to this theory,""Predictive coding [11](also known as predictive processing) is a theory of brain function in which the brain is constantly generating and updating a mental model of the environment.""The model is used to generate predictions of sensory input that are compared to actual sensory input. This comparison results in prediction errors that are then used to update and revise the mental model.""Constrained by the statistical regularities of the outside world (and certain evolutionarily prepared predictions), the brain encodes top-down generative models at various temporal and spatial scales in order to predict and effectively suppress sensory inputs rising up from lower levels.""A comparison between predictions (priors) and sensory input (likelihood) yields a difference measure (e.g. prediction error, free energy, or surprise) which, if it is sufficiently large beyond the levels of expected statistical noise, will cause the generative model to update so that it better predicts sensory input in the future.While there is much to be said about consciousness given its elusive nature - what it is, where it is, how it is, etc - language can only take us so far in capturing the essence of its slippery slopes.As the condensation of a lived experience - an abstraction separate from the thing itself - words point at the mystery but never really capture it. They are but a shadow.Over billions of years, energy has condensed, coalesced and coagulated into increasingly complex configurations of matter throughout the universe. And through these interactions, nature has evolved a mechanism - at least once, that we know of - for the universe to become aware of itself.And whatever consciousness is, it seems to be rooted in the act of choice. A perpetual prediction about the future predicated on probability that inevitably follows the path of evolution .Through science we have the crystallization of this teleology, this fundamental creative drive to increase in complexity and level up - despite the odds - captured in its method.And the advancement of science is expressed through results and repeatable observation. So, according to the theories presented,By pointing our minds at the mystery and watching it unfold both within and without, perhaps a glimpse of consciousness is possible- of our fundamental nature- as it flutters by before quickly unraveling into the next moment and dissolving into a sea of abstractions.Despite the necessary delusions, we can still learn something about the intersection of the universe, the brain, and consciousness directly - through empirical observation.And we can do that - simply - by doing nothing at all.By not even thinking about it.Or in other words, by meditating.And then we can analyze the spectral domain of the EEG signals that were recorded in spacetime.Where we would expect to find repeatable patterns consistently expressed and correlated with conscious experience, not once, but every time.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1560/1*W-lyPMQc_Yjda8HXX8Qyvw.jpeg,https://medium.com/@neurokinetikz/the-variety-of-synaptic-experience-7592da14ebb8,neuroscience,d9c54c52c67440ae32e946e6c0a5bd96c5200c333dddc82757e40b13
3 Changes that Turned an Unhealthy Relationship with Facebook into a Productive One,"Most people reading this probably have an unhealthy relationship with social media (if they are honest with themselves).My relationship with Facebook evolved as the platform changed from a connection with friends into the doom-scrolling king of social media. As my book was nearing its publication date, I stopped doom-scrolling and started only promoting the book and interacting more with its target audience. Although Facebook's algorithms have changed to make it harder for authors to reach their followers, certain features are still quite beneficial when growing a following.The upshot of focusing social media on your writing is that it benefits both your career and your mental health.Even more important for a writer with a message, it helps you provide more value to your target audience by involving you in the spaces they frequent.In the past, businesses (yes author, you're a business too) could reach their followers at a nearly 100% rate through the ""page"" system - now the best we can hope for is 10-15%.You can thank Facebook's ever-changing algorithm, and their new focus on ad revenue, for that. Now pages must pay for ads to reach their entire audience. There is an organic way around this - primarily by driving engagement and getting others to share your posts. The alternative is to use Facebook groups which work very much like the old pages did (your reach is as large as the group member count). In addition, groups are where people go on Facebook to find the topics they really like.So go to the groups that have the traffic you seek; this will naturally promote your work and your message within your ""tribe"" and give you valuable feedback on your writing.This is how I put the doom-scrolling to rest for good, and how I started providing value instead of opinions that would simply dissolve into the airwaves at best (or start arguments at worse).Writing is more concise than speaking - it allows us to put our thoughts down in the most fluent way possible. Most social media is more like a conversation than like writing in the traditional sense. Instead, if you have an opinion on the topic, you should write an informed piece about it and share that when the subject is brought up by others. This keeps your message focused and on point, unswayed by the emotions of the present moment (or comment, as it were).It also helps to avoid picking fights on topics in which you are passionate while producing organic traffic (in other words, getting eyes on your writing).Facebook is no longer about sharing photos of you, your friends/family, and your cat - it's a competition for attention like every other game in town (read: the internet).Given that you will only reach a low percentage of people on each platform, your goal should be to convert some of them to an offsite following where your reach is 100%. The best example of such a following is an email list. You can check out my travel-related newsletter here for an example:See what I've done there - even this platform is one of those where your organic reach is not 100%. But the email list (or your own Facebook group, not author page) is a 100% reach platform.Ultimately, your goal should be to convert your target audience from an audience for Facebook (or whatever platform you're on) to an audience FOR YOU.You, as a writer, are forever in a competition for attention. Even if your writing is the best in the world, you are competing against not only every other writer but against those cute cat videos and the latest online gaming trends. If you have your hand in social media, use it in the same way social media uses you - by playing the numbers game.Get your work in front of as many eyes as possible.Make sure most of those eyes belong to your target audience by sharing inside of traffic sources (such as Facebook groups or forums) that act as hubs for their attention.Stop doom-scrolling and looking at cat videos (or the equivalent time-waster) while on social media and instead seek to share value.Become involved with those communities you seek to help and find out what they want, what they fear, and what they spend their time doing. Use this information to provide the value they crave, and grow your following while you do so. In this way, you can provide ever-increasing value to them in the future by having 100% access to your tribe.This is how I turned my nasty Facebook habit into something productive - you, as a writer, can too.",https://miro.medium.com/max/15000/0*3RrnHWjMDQviXimX,https://medium.com/better-entrepreneur/3-changes-that-turned-an-unhealthy-relationship-with-facebook-into-a-productive-one-28488e6305d0,marketing,d9d45448f71a3ce5c74c45ae2233a78d9fb6bd6613dfb9d1f595a568
Seven Sins of Leadership,"Here's the short list:1) Poor communication2) Loss of Focus3) Micro-management4) Complacency5) Apathy6) Hypocrisy7) EgoismHere's the elaborated list. Solutions and antidotes in the last section.Communication is the most critical skill for any leader. If the leader cannot transfer thoughts to others in such a way to promote action, they cannot succeed. Too often, they speak in generalities; assume the message sent is the same as the one received; or keep information to themselves.Virtuous leaders (e.g., those who don't commit this sin) understand the mechanics of communication: word choice, tone of voice, body language, ethos, pathos, and logos. They apply them across multiple mediums to ensure dissemination and understanding. Successful leaders understand the megaphone effect; how to use it and how to not abuse it. They also understand the hazards of sending the wrong message by accident.Sharing fuzzy, poorly developed ideas lead directly into the next sin, Loss of Focus. When people don't understand what they're supposed to be doing, they put so much time and effort into understanding the problem, it robs them of resources to put into the solution. For the people who work for you, one of the most empowering things you can do is to set clear priorities [See more here]. When that's done, get out of the way! Like a horse at the racetrack, when employees understand the direction and finish line, the jockey doesn't need to lead - he just jumps on and enjoys the ride!Unclear priorities come when leaders lose sight of what's most important. That translates to splintered efforts. When team members don't have the same priority, it's like a team of horses pulling in different directions. The wagon will move forward, but not nearly as fast as it would with everyone pulling in the same direction.When this happens, it will often drive the supervisor to micromanage. The manager doesn't trust people to do the right thing, so he spends his time hovering and looking over shoulders. Employees become irritated, annoyed, or angry. Eventually, those who can leave, will. The ones who stay behind will take a daily bath in discontent. Why does this happen?Two major issues can drive micromanagement. Poor communication is one. The leader fails to recognize his own shortfall and its effects. Because she hasn't clearly communicated priorities, milestones, or end-state, employees are floundering, trying to figure out what needs done. The manager thinks he communicates well. This drives the lack of trust.Experience is another major cause. They've been hurt before and as a result, vow to never love again, I mean trust again. It can be enormously difficult to escape the prison of past experience.How do you know if you're a micromanager? People are asking you questions about picayune things. Once upon a time, I took command of a basic training unit. A couple of weeks in, my supply sergeant asked me how many pencils to order for the next quarter. I looked at her like she was crazy! I was exasperated until I realized my predecessor had been a micromanager. Once I understood that it changed my approach to leading the unit.Excellence comes from constantly seeking improvement in people and processes. ""That's the way we've always done it"" is an express ticket to mediocrity and reflects one of two things. The first is the notion, ""it's not worth my time to explain it to you."" This isn't healthy and is usually the result of that person's past experiences with leaders. That will remedy over time.Complacency is the other reason. People get in their comfort zone and want to hunker down. They've discovered a level of effort which doesn't overly exert them but renders minimally satisfactory results. It can happen to the rank-and-file and it can happen to leaders. It's the leader's job to push, push, push. The status quo is not good enough and leaders must push for improvement.How do they do this? They try to cut costs; reduce time to completion; use fewer people to do the same work; increase productivity; improve the process; and so on.Believe it or not, there are leaders who get so focused on day-to-day operations, they forget to pay attention to results. Apathy. Leaders get paid to get things done. They don't get paid for trying; they don't get paid for staying busy; they get paid for results. Sometimes people forget this because they're caught up in the daily soap opera which can be our work environment. This is a mortal sin, not venial.Hypocrisy. When leaders say one thing but do another, their personal credibility is undermined. When leaders hold other people to standards but don't meet them personally, they lose their credibility. When leaders measure the performance of people below them but refuse to accept responsibility for mistakes or shortcomings, they're demonstrating hypocrisy.This can take many forms, as evidenced above, but they all result in the same thing: a low trust organization. Not only are there low levels of trust, but there will also be low morale. Lastly, the organization will become one where employees will only do what's explicitly checked. Neither the leader nor the organization will benefit from employees' discretionary effort. The idea of someone going ""above and beyond,"" will not exist.Egoism. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. But it doesn't have to be absolute to seduce. Too many leaders get the idea that because they get a bigger paycheck, everything revolves around them. The leader is part of the team - not over them, behind them, or in front of them. This egocentric worldview will manifest in many ways.On the tails of hypocrisy, the leader will stop holding himself/herself accountable. ""Oh, that rule's for the peons . . . not me, I'm the leader."" When I see parking spaces reserved for leaders outside the door, I'm always confident in finding a lack of humility inside the door. Sometimes I'm mistaken, the ""perks"" are legacies, holdovers from a prior regime. When moving into a leadership position, keep an eye out for these things. It's one way to send an early, powerful message of change. That's useful when you're not quite ready to make substantive operational changes...Solutions and AntidotesWhat do you do when you become part of an organization practicing these seven sins? Ideally, you about-face and go find someplace else to work. That's not always a viable option. Let's start with the next most obvious action. I've told thousands of leaders this time and time again: your personal example is the most powerful tool you have. Make sure you understand the seven sins and avoid them.If you're walking into an organization with these poor practices, more than your personal example will be necessary. Let's quickly look at actions we can take for each sin.To remedy poor communication, work hard at two-way communication. When you share information with your people, ask for back-briefs. Ask them to tell you what they heard in their own words. Simply parroting your words doesn't mean they understood you. Looking up the chain-of-command, press the boss for clarification. This can be a little prickly but frame it in terms of efficiency. You want to make the best use of resources (time, money, employees' effort) to get the right things done. Also, this article has great points on asking questions.Micro-management is the bane of every strong employee's work life. The antidote is to build trust and that takes time. Stephen M. R. Covey's The Speed of Trust is a great read and a great resource; the best I've ever read on the subject. When your boss micromanages, over-communicate. Not in an obnoxious, overbearing way, but work hard at pushing information to him/her. Regular updates can go a long way towards relieving their anxiety. Weekly updates are my first choice, but some bosses/situations may require them daily. The updates should be short and to the point. They take time and can be annoying. One benefit I found with them is it forced me to better plan my work and sharpened my focus on priorities. Those are huge pluses.To fight complacency, talk with employees about the greater purpose of the organization. How/what does it do for society? Tapping into this motivation creates a powerful spring of energy for many people. Some will be indifferent. Look for the first opportunity to cull the herd with those. Draw the line for employees from their personal success to the company's success. Then reverse it. When employees understand the two are linked, it will often help them see their way to better performance. For complacency, focus your efforts on the people below you in the organization. I would not invest time and effort in trying to ""lead up"" in this area.Apathy, while closely related to complacency, will benefit from the purpose discussion as well. But additional measures are also needed. A healthy dose of accountability is the antidote for apathy. As with other medicine, it may not be well received. Transitioning to an accountable organization is painful.There will be a mixture of reactions with the majority exhibiting great resentment. A small percentage will rejoice in it and embrace it strongly. Those tend to be the best players. They like it because they've been carrying the rest of the team. They understand that, as well as the company may have been doing, performance will skyrocket when everyone is pulling hard in the harness.Clearly communicate the desired business results. These performance measures must be clear, concrete, and measurable. Many businesses have key performance indicators (KPIs). Those are important but leaders at different levels may need to supplement with more immediate measures for their teams.Once these are established, implement a performance feedback system. Use both formal and informal feedback to give people the opportunity to adjust and adapt their efforts. It's unreasonable to expect an instantaneous change. This will require patience and persistence.There will be a portion of employees who will initially resent it and then slowly warm to it as they see results. They'll convert over time as they realize the team is stronger, more engaged, and quite frankly, more fun when everyone plays hard. These people will take some patience but are worth the wait.The last group will be the most troublesome. They'll not only resent the change; they'll actively work against it. These malcontents will make your life miserable. As with everyone, provide them performance feedback often. Take every opportunity to help people understand what they're doing right, what they're doing wrong, and then how to fix the latter. In his book, The One-Minute Manager, Ken Blanchard talks about adapting the mentality of ""catching people doing something right,"" as a powerful tool of change.People will make clear where they stand and what they think for the most part. The most resistant need the opportunity to change and adapt but don't carry them forever. 90 days is long enough for people to start making the adjustment. Make sure people know the train is moving and they need to get on board or go somewhere else. Harvey MacKay, author of Swim With Sharks Without Getting Eaten Alive, says he never lost sleep over the people he fired, only the people he didn't but should have.There is danger in being too patient. Carrying employees who are unwilling to change risks spread of the attitude. Remember, that's what put us in this position in the beginning. Keep in mind those employees are unhappy. Cutting them loose gives them an opportunity to find happiness elsewhere.Performance feedback is also a large part of the cure for hypocrisy. Holding people to standards should be a no-brainer for leaders but sometimes they fall short. As a leader, one of, if not the best way to grow an organization, is through performance feedback. Sadly, companies offer little training in how to conduct feedback. It's not a natural process and many people shy from it. Done poorly, feedback can cause people to become defensive, even confrontational. It is possible to create a climate where performance feedback is routine, positive, and moves the company forward.Finally, egoism. Humility is the opposite of egoism but teaching humility is often painful. In my experience, life teaches humility as opposed to a leader. Mentors can also help people ""get over themselves"" as I've heard it said, but my personal experience and observation have indicated that egoists often resist their advice as well. As a recovering egoist, I routinely catch myself being prideful.Having blunt discussions with egoists may help. Emphasizing the perspective of others and showing how they view the world may also help. Finally, explain how their attitude negatively impacts the workplace, especially in terms of teamwork and collaboration.Pride can be a wonderful thing. It often helps sports teams battle through bad situations to win games; it can help companies overcome difficult situations; and it can help people endure hardship. But as the saying goes, it foregoes a fall. Pride will often lead to over-confidence, hubris, and a sense of entitlement.Emphasizing respect for individuals, sharing in hardships, and building genuine relationships with people across echelons are all ways to combat egoism. Unfortunately, people with out-of-control egos usually refuse to do those things.They don't respect others because they see themselves as a different, superior breed. Because they're ""special,"" they don't see that they should endure hardships. This is commonly seen when corporations lay off employees yet executives receive bonuses. I'm astounded when I see this and quite frankly, see red when I read these executives' pathetic attempts to justify their actions. I'm shocked that boards of directors okay these pay packages.The self-view of being ""special"" prevents them from creating relationships across different levels. I'm not saying the CEO should be cook-out buddies with the first-line supervisors. But they can interact with them, listen, and talk with them directly. These are the things that leaders who are loved by their people do. Some call it as having the ""common touch,"" a phrase I dislike because of the embedded sense of royalty. What the phrase speaks to is those people have no sense of different levels within the company. They are comfortable talking to anyone and everyone in their company. That is admirable.The seven sins of leadership come in a multitude of forms. Leaders at every level will commit these sins at different times. There's never been a leader to go through their life without committing them. The goal isn't to be perfect. The goal is to understand the sins, to recognize them, and to work towards eliminating them. Just as religious sins will never go away, leadership sins won't either. We must keep working towards recognizing them in ourselves and working to get better.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*daz_guIfRuDJTbkhmbZGwA.jpeg,https://medium.com/the-shadow/seven-sins-of-leadership-394869f579ba,leadership,d9e4845e13f5f2bdbe7a4756a2265ea7d129ec38b6bbb80594adc712
How AI and Neuroscience Are Coming Together to Benefit Both Disciplines (and Society),"Biomedical engineer Chethan Pandarinath develops prosthetics - but not just any prosthetics. That's because the Emory University and Georgia Tech researcher's goal is to enable those with paralyzed limbs to use those arms as if they were their own, via signals from their brain.Pandarinath hopes to achieve this by analyzing brain activity recordings of paralyzed people to identify neuronic patterns corresponding to specific movements. In theory, these patterns could power artificial intelligence (AI) systems connected to prosthetic limbs, enabling similar movement control over what's essentially a foreign object attached to the body.If that sounds complicated, it's because it is - hugely so, Pandarinath says in Nature. But it's certainly not science fiction. And that's mainly due to the growing convergence of AI and neuroscience.Both disciplines, after all, share the same goal of understanding the secrets of human cognition. That means learning how the brain works, which, in turn, can inspire the design and development of artificial neural networks while reaffirming the validity of previously developed algorithms. Indeed, the continued improvement of modern AI and deep learning systems (in terms of accuracy, resource-intensiveness, and the ability to learn and adjust more effectively with less data) requires a fundamental understanding of the workings of the human brain.One of the most potent connections between AI and neuroscience is the concept of reward-based learning, a focus of some computer science researchers since the 1980s. From an AI and computer science perspective, it's easy to see why: Reward-based learning systems can learn on their own through built-in rewards and punishments systems. That means that instead of human instruction, these systems use a system of reward predictions that continually adjust based on experience.These kinds of reward-based systems include temporal difference (TD) learning, a milestone approach developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. TD learning is different from traditional learning methodologies in that it continuously samples the environment and adjusts its reward predictions based on those received versus expectations. In this way, TD learning matches expected vs. received rewards for each moment in time, continually adjusting expectations (and, by extension, improving algorithmic accuracy).According to DeepMind, an AI research firm, the eureka moment permanently linking AI and neuroscience came just a few years later, in the mid-1990s. It was then that researchers noticed that neurons in the brain seemed to use similar reward predictions - by studying the brains of live animals, they were able to see that certain dopamine neurons fired if the animal received more or less reward than expected. They soon proposed that the human brain also uses a TD learning algorithm, a hypothesis that has since shown its validity through numerous other experiments.Since then, most AI researchers have focused on deep reinforcement learning using advanced methodologies such as distributional reinforcement learning, allowing them to tackle ever-more complicated problems. Distributional reinforcement learning improves on traditional TD learning through its ability to predict a much broader spectrum of possible rewards. And a recent DeepMind research paper published in Nature goes even further, suggesting that the human brain also uses distributional reinforcement learning.""We found that dopamine neurons in the brain were each tuned to different levels of pessimism or optimism,"" the authors write. ""If they were a choir, they wouldn't all be singing the same note, but harmonizing - each with a consistent vocal register, like bass and soprano singers. In artificial reinforcement learning systems, this diverse tuning creates a richer training signal that greatly speeds learning in neural networks, and we speculate that the brain might use it for the same reason.""There is still much we don't know about the brain. Additionally, the vast majority of current AI algorithms also have several disadvantages over natural neural networks that researchers (so far) haven't been able to overcome. These challenges include their insatiable hunger for large training datasets and the massive amounts of energy required to match even a toddler's ability to correct mistakes. Deep learning algorithms are still elementary compared to the brain's complex circuitry, while even the most robust current AI algorithms easily break when confronted with anything outside their express purpose. ""Deep learning algorithms (often) require millions of training examples, whereas humans, especially kids, can pick up a new concept or motor skill with one shot,"" illustrates neuroscientist and science writer Shelley Fan.Despite this, however, the two disciplines - thanks in part to several partnerships and researchers with combined AI and neuroscience backgrounds - are increasingly inspiring and improving each other thanks to the shared framework of reinforcement learning. ""Combining (deep learning) with brain-like innate structures could lead us towards machines that learn as quickly, flexibly, and intuitively as humans,"" Fan says. Dr. Shimon Ullman of the Weizmann Institute of Science adds there are several ways neuroscience can improve AI and deep learning even further, including:Because the two disciplines have a symbiotic relationship and are essentially solving similar problems from different angles, AI also impacts neuroscience profoundly. The ability of AI to analyze larger datasets than researchers would have thought possible even just a few years ago is a big one, but there are others, including using AI algorithms to reassess our ideas on how the brain works when performing complex tasks and movements. ""If you can train a neural network to do it,"" says Google Brain's Dr. David Sussillo, ""then perhaps you can understand how that network functions, and then use that to understand the biological data.""This intrinsic relationship between AI and neuroscience is something that Emory University and Georgia Tech's Pandarinath, the researcher developing AI-infused prosthetics, knows all too well. ""The technology is coming full circle and being applied back to understand the brain,"" he explains, which could help spur new treatments for various ailments. Maneesh Sahani, of the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London, agrees. ""We're effectively studying the same thing,"" he says.""In the one case, we're asking how to solve this learning problem mathematically so it can be implemented efficiently in a machine. In the other case, we're looking at the sole existing proof that it can be solved - which is the brain.""",https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*u9yqjTtznX7Yk5q98jMCmQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/how-ai-and-neuroscience-are-coming-together-to-benefit-both-disciplines-and-society-ece89694baf4,neuroscience,d21e5c89097fa1cea7e7274e3cd0bf10e7715e6e29616cf2df10fa75
Designing Circulation Space - STAIRS,"What do you do when you first see a staircase? Chances are, you look up at it! It creates a visual connection. Staircases can really open up a home visually, and they can mentally create the impression of scale and of volume, even in very compact homes.Staircases perform an important purpose - to physically connect one level of a home to another - be it across split level, or across two stories of a home, or between inside and outside.However, stairs are great for other functions too. For impacting how your home feels, and how it is lit naturally, and how it flows overall.Architectural details can transform the simplest house into a memorable home. While the spaces in a home provide a blank canvas, the details create the light and shade, bringing depth to the design in the process.While each detail has a functional component-a staircase provides access to different levels in a home and acts as a circulation element in a residential space ; a skylight provides additional natural light; a window provides ventilation and light it also has a strong aesthetic component that contributes to the creation of architecture. These details, unlike a standard window or door, can be interpreted in numerous ways. And although the basic ingredients must be present, there's enormous scope to create a detail that's fresh and innovative and with an impact that is greater than the sum of its parts.In architecture, the concept of circulation refers to the way people, the blood of our buildings, move through the space.In particular, circulation routes are the pathways people take through and around buildings or urban places. Circulation is often thought of as the 'space between the spaces', having a connective function, but it can be much more than that. It is the concept that captures the experience of moving our bodies around a building, three-dimensionally and through time.Although every space a person could access or occupy forms part of the circulation system of a building, Circulation within interiors refers to the way in which people move through and around a building throughout time. It can be broken down into direction, the type of use, the frequency of use and the time of use.The speed of the movement of circulation can be fast or slow. The speed of the movement will depend on the visibility of the location .The direction of circulation can be either horizontal or vertical. If circulation is described as being horizontal, it refers to how people move in and around on a particular floor or level, but, if it being described as vertical circulation then it refers to relationship between the levels; looking at how people move between the various floors. Methods of horizontal circulation include moving walkways and corridors, whereas examples of vertical circulation can include a lift, stairs, escalators and ramps.Private and public refers to different circulation zones. If a circulation route is considered to be within a public zone, it suggests that the area is widely accessible; an example of this could be a lobby. Whereas a circulation route considered to as private, will include the back of house and staff circulation passageways.These two types of circulation zones will differ functionally, in terms of the level of use (how busy it is) and the aesthetic. Circulation routes within private areas will be designed to optimize productivity and efficiency, whereas public circulation routes will be more attractive and aesthetically pleasing.When you are planning your design of these methods of circulation, they do not need to be ugly or hidden away; circulation routes can be a beautiful key architectural feature.When considering the various circulation routes, you need to make sure the pathway is unobstructed and well illuminated. If the circulation route is a fire escape route, then you also want to ensure that this is the quickest and safest route out of the building. In design practices, the flow of the circulation is one of the first areas to be considered; Because the circulation areas often Connect with the rest of the interior Design.In restaurants, bars and cafes circulation routes are important for both staff and guests. For instance, circulation largely affects the relationship between the kitchen and table service, when planning this type of circulation route you need to consider time and efficiency and consider the best route for avoiding incidents. For guests, you should consider the circulation routes to access the bathrooms, considering access and flow routes which will not getting in the way of staff under pressure or ending up in private area. Circulation routes should be used to keeping minimal interference between front and back of house.For buildings like museums and galleries, mapping out clear circulation routes can help communicate different zone locations, where to access the various floors and the location facilities like toilets and food. This is extremely important in public buildings of this nature; people will often spend lengthy amounts of time here, so they will want to know where the various break points and facilities are located upon their arrival.This will help to inform the visitor plan how they can progress through the interior during their visit.DirectionHorizontal circulation might include hallways, atria, paths, entries and exits. It is also affected by the furniture layout, or other objects in the space such as columns, trees, or topographic changes. This is why architects usually take furniture as part of a concept design, because it is critically linked to the flow, function and feeling of the space.Vertical circulation is how people move up and down within the building, so it includes things like stairs, lifts, ramps, ladders and escalators which allow us to move from one level to another.Public circulation is the areas of the building which are most widely and easily accessible. Stairs, in a unique way, are like bridge. In this guise, circulation is often overlapped with other functions, such as a lobby, atrium, or gallery, and is enhanced to a high level of architectural quality. Issues of visibility, how crowds move, and clear escape paths are key points to consider.Private circulation accounts for the more intimate movements within the building, or the more ugly ones which require a degree of privacy. In a house this might be the back door, in a large building the back of house, staff offices or storage zones.Designing CirculationThere are two rules of thumb when it comes to designing circulation. The key circulation pathways should:The reason for these two rules of thumb is fairly obvious: people want to be able to move around a building with ease and efficiency, But, once you've got these rules sorted, you're welcome to break them.Sometimes for architectural reasons you'll want to interrupt a direct circulation path with an item of furniture or a change in level to define a change in place, make people slow down, or provide a focus point. Similarly, circulation doesn't necessarily have to follow the shortest distance between two points. Rather, it can take into account the sequence of spaces, thresholds, and atmospheres encountered through movement, which prepare you for the transition from one space to the next. Circulation can be choreographed, to add architectural interest.In this way, circulation is also intricately linked in with Residential or commercial plan of building related to what activities take place inside that space .Efficiency and layout of circulation spaceCirculation space is sometimes seen as useless space, adding needless area and cost to a project. So we have to focus efficiency while designing circulation.Commercial office buildings and apartment buildings, for example, will typically seek to minimize the amount of circulation space. In these cases, where the buildings are often tall, the vertical circulation is often designed as a core at the centre of the building, with stairs and lifts packed tightly together, and short corridors on each level leading away from this core to the individual apartments or offices.In contrast to this method, where all the circulation is located centrally and often hidden, circulation can be externally expressed and shown off of the façade or within the building. Even in smaller buildings, such as houses, circulation areas such as a staircase can become architectural features of the home.A celebrated example of this technique is the Pompidou Centre in Paris, designed in high-tech style by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano. Here, you can see the translucent escalators with red undersides snaking across the exposed façade of the building, the ever changing movements of people making the building present and active in the square.Circulation & The building codeThe Design of circulation spaces in a building follow government performance standards, that is the building code ,for the selection of angle of stairs and width of the circulation elements, including stairs and landings, hallways, doors, handrails, balustrades, ramps and ladders.The stair lingo ...""Risers"" are the vertical part of a stair. ""Treads"" are the horizontal part you put your foot on. ""Rise"" is the height a staircase runs. ""Nosing"" is the front edge of the stair tread. ""Stringers"" are the side components that support the treads and risers of the stair. There's some other terms, but they're the basics.(I generally aim for stairs that have a 275mm min deep tread, and 180mm max high riser. For width, I like 1,000mm min clearance - so it has to take into account any handrails, etc.)While going to design risers and treads, the difference of level should be considered.Generally, riser heights should be set between 15 and 17 cm (max 20 cm for service stairs), and between 13 and 15 cm for public buildings (hospitals, schools); while the tread depth calculation is related to the users physical effort necessary to overcome the riser's extension in height.Usually the Blondel formula is used:2r + t = 62 ÷ 64 cmwhere:r represents the risert represents the treadFor private stairs in dwellings the relationship between riser and tread dimensions can be increased:2r + t = ÷ 65 (with max value of r = 23 cm)Usually, a maximum of 15 treads for each flight of stairs should not be exceeded, although, in certain cases, especially for restoration projects, a higher number of treads is suggested instead of having excessively high risers, making stair ramp ascent more comfortable for its users avoiding factors relating to excessive steepness. In conclusion, treads with rounded edges are more practical and safe in case of intense usage.Stairs can be open or closed. ""Closed"" means they have a solid riser, and you can't see in through the staircase (and often they'll have storage built in under). ""Open"" means the risers, or part of the risers, do not exist. You can also combine the two in your design, having some parts open, and some parts closed.Stairs can be key in getting the overall design of our homes to work. when designing stairs ,You can treat the staircase as an opportunity to create privacy in your home.Stairs can offer sense of curiosity and secrecy in what they lead to when you can't completely see what's at the other end of them.They can be a strong transition between the public areas of a home on the lower floor, to the private areas of the home on the upper floor. The way they are designed can prevent visitors in your home from feeling it is appropriate to travel up them.Visibility on stairsLighting can create a dramatic impact in a staircase - during the night and day time. Low level lighting used on stair walls, or in LED strips, will create one effect. Alternatively, pendant lighting will create a feature during the day time as well. Just be cognizant of how you're going to change light bulbs and that you can service them in a safe way.Improving visibility on stairs significantly reduces the risk for common mishaps caused by misjudging distances. Otherwise you can trip on a step or miss it completely. You can catch a heel on the edge of a step. Such mishaps are a routine cause of twisted ankles, sprained knees or more serious injuries incurred by a total fall.Stairs may open up the homeIf privacy is created by not seeing where stairs lead to, the reverse also occurs.Opening up your home's volume can happen through creating open areas at the top of the stairs. It may be a lounge room on the upper floor or simply a small space to sit that creates a small library area. This will lead the eye up, to experience the openness of your home.Think about this when you're creating a staircase in your home, and what's going to be at the top of it, and what's going to be at the bottom of it, and what is the visual story of the journey from one end of the staircase to the other.Make stairs ,a hero in your home?Staircases can create a sculptural and very strong aesthetic element in your home. Of course, there are the sweeping, grand staircases, a la Gone with the Wind, or Sound of Music.In contemporary homes, glass, steel and timber may be used instead. Staircase adds dignity and charm to your home when it is carefully designed and built! . It provides easy and quick access to different floors of the house. Stairs are available in a variety of style and materials like wood, glass, brick, R.C.C., etc. When there is a change in direction of vertical transportation, turning stairs are usedWhilst the costs for staircases such as this can vary wildly, this can also work on a very budget level and economical level as well. Celebration of the staircase as a sculptural, feature piece can come in smaller ways.Balustrade designThere are a variety of materials you can use for your balustrade.At its simplest is a plastered wall, with a handrail or timber cap. There are also open timber balustrades, glass and steel, or steel mesh or powder coated aluminum panels.The range of choice is huge, and yours will be driven by the overall aesthetic you're seeking for you home, and your budget.Stair tread (and riser too!)Residential stairs are conventionally constructed from a cost-efficient material such as MDF, and then wrapped in their finished surface. This may be carpet, or timber flooring.Alternatively, you can choose other materials, based on your budget. Some fantastic stairs are fabricated from glass treads, and checker plate steel.Getting from A to BThe arrangement of your stairs will often be driven by the other things in your floor plan, however there are lots of options for how a stair can be laid out.You may have a simple run of continuous treads, or the stairs return on themselves in a U. You may have simple treads with a flat landing at the half-way point, or you may include winders (the triangular treads), which help you turn corners in less space.Each of these choices will have an impact on how the stair feels to travel up and down, and how it looks in your home.Some designs can include intermediate levels in the staircase that are integrated with things around them. It may be that a landing provides a little zone for a library, or extends out to create some joinery in an adjacent space.How you step onto the stairs can also change. You may start on a large plinth, or something that creates a small bench seat to sit on.Using stairs as a lantern and light shaft for your homeStaircases are also a fantastic opportunity for performing as a light source both during the day and at night. There's few places in a two-story home, unless you create an open void, where you get the opportunity to see two stories of the home, and to borrow light from the upper floor and bring it down into the lower floor.Often, staircases are inbound in floor plans. They'll be back towards the front door or back towards the garage so that you can get easy access when you're coming home to the upper floor of the house.Especially in compact home designs, where external walls are saved for premium living spaces that want access to views and light directly, the stairs take a back seat in location!The spaces that stairs immediately service on the lower floor are generally inbound spaces as well and they can be quite dark if you don't use the staircase as an opportunity to grab light.Think about how you can do this with your staircase. If your staircase is on an outer wall, you could put windows in it.Think about how you want to create those windows, be they operable or fixed, and then whether they need to be an obscure type of glass for privacy, or whether they can be transparent and grab a view.You can also position them based on how you're going to experience that view as you move through the staircase. Will you get privacy at the half level landing height, for example, and see sky through them, or are you going to want to connect visually with the outside as you move past the windows.If the stairs are fully inbound and have rooms the whole way around them, then look at how you could top-light those stairs and put skylights into your roof.Combine this with an open balustrade design, and / or an open stair design and voila! You have a light well in your home that will bring natural light into the darkest parts of your floor plan.So there's the stairs with obvious activity of moving from one floor to the next, but if you stop and think for a while, there's a host of other needs and usage possibilities that can be accommodated by your staircase.It's not only people that need to move from one floor to the next, but also stuff. How is your staircase design going to make it easier to store the items that need to travel between floors while taking safety considerations into account?How about the following alternative uses for the stairs?• A great storage opportunity, either under the stairs or around the walls of the stairs for books and objects.• A seat to sit on to put on your shoes.• An opportunity to showcase and admire art, objects or family pictures on the walls or on the landings.• A quiet place to sit or read if there are large landings.• Stairs as a stage for singers at parties.• Is your home going to be built all on one or two flat levels or is there an opportunity to add some interest by putting in some split levels. Split levels make a home more interesting to navigate and they can be used to create different ceiling heights.Stairs are a powerful design tool ...Even when they're very simple, very economical, and very cost effective, they can be solutions that have a magical design impact in the way that your home feels and operates. Try to Explore the opportunities that staircases provide (and remember this works for external staircases as well.) Don't just think of them as a way to get from A to B. Think of your stairs as a way to create another really fantastic space and experience in your home. Then you can borrow the joy of that stair space to bring joy into the other spaces in your home.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1566/1*0VAjITRurnlHSybo3UCmeA.jpeg,https://vinitamathur.medium.com/designing-circulation-space-stairs-66409302a2cf,design,d37b9e33471e1918527456739b8e05050109ca7bb19927616e985b47
"Customer Journey Map, Flows and IA","Enterprise UX case study (part 3).This is the third article about crafting UX artefacts to the need of the product. We continue discovering the redesign of the EPAM's time-off management system - Vacation portal. The first part-'Value of the design artefacts and how to make Personas work', the second - 'Problem statement, Value Proposition Canvas and Hypotheses'.Let's discuss some practical aspects of creating CJM.As you can see, I treat it wider than a UX artefact.It is a good way to analyze the user's flow in the product. With it, we could shine a light on the user's problems and help the team to solve them.If you will try to make it all on the single piece of paper, as a linear sequence, you'll get a timeline with events.To make our Journey mapping more precise, better to take a single hero and a single scenario with a definite goal.Examples:Well, the second story looks not very exciting... but you got the point.Some details about what the designer could add to the CJM:It depends on the product's environment.If you could do it with a team, stickers and board-great.If you are in the remote team, it's better to make it in Miro, or another web service.Often it is done simply, without graphics, in Excel or Spreadsheets. Team members could add their impact in the cloud.In Miro, CJM process is far more collaborative, with digital stickers and wide interaction with a team.By my experience, the best way to learn how to build the CJM-simply do it, validate, fix the mistakes, and repeat.Before (re)making any digital artefact, try to understand the existing solution. Even if you are doing product from scratch, usually you have a competitor's product.Often we, designers, are focused solely on user's needs. Sure, the designer is a user advocate, but usually business isn't evil. So we could find a good solution for both. Remember about value loop.Your manager is clever but busy. Help him get the context of CJM without unnecessary details. The management shouldn't get the outcome of the CJM out of the blue.Good designer involves stakeholders in the process.And usually, he does it peacefully). Maybe, they would not participate deeply, but their attention is important. Without this, the risk of hitting the wall (misunderstanding) is very high.After making the CJMs for main Personas, I had almost all the cards in hand.The team was aligned, the design process was established, users and their needs were discovered. And we have almost all the crucial flows of the user in the service built by words.Managers also gain a product view, current problems assessment and see the possibilities for improvement of the solution.In some cases, it's necessary to make the most problematic current flows more visually appealing to stakeholders.Below you can see an example of the flow for the user to take a time-off in the original system.Too many ways to do the same thing (book a leave). Messy flow, fragmented requests forms.Reworking such flows with stakeholders and users helped us to get the next solution.At first, some stakeholders were surprised, that it could be so simple-you could take any request in any place.If the designer could simplify the user flow, tests it with users, this data could give arguments to sell the idea to stakeholders.To do that, necessary look at them-some people could be persuaded by numbers, better conversion rates, etc. Others accept qualitative research data.Clear UX flows, presented by the designer, help to win both types of stakeholders.The new service concept where a user is in power in any page, easily switches between the variety of request types was unanimously accepted.It was high time to continue radical changes.Researching, I already saw a lot of issues in the navigation of the service.I made an expert review, analysed the structure of the information in the service. To highlight issues, I took prioritized Personas and did sitemaps for them.Below is the sitemap for the original navigation for the Administrator, who could do everything in the service.Stakeholders clearly saw the problem with navigation: duplicated elements, difficult orientation in the service and other IA issues.After decomposition, I understood the links and interconnections in the service. We made a card sort, to see essential navigation elements and what could be removed.Below you can see the result of the work-improved navigation for Administrator.On the team demo, I could defend my decisions, using the researched data. The accessible and comprehensive audit report helped to rework the Information architecture. As the team was involved in the card sort, their opinion impacted the result.Working with information to the user with PO, we applied a new approach to giving the user the necessary power. After improving the navigation and flows, we could gather everything in one place.The change was supported by team members. In the demo, they actively participated, by themselves answering on some sceptical questions about navigation. We eliminated almost 70 % of the previous structure, gaining clarity and functionality.Most of the existing back-end solutions were supported, that was especially appreciated by management.We moved step by step, applying UX techniques in the redesign process.With developed and prioritized Personas, we understand key users.Making Value Proposition Canvas, designer finds the balance between the needs of the user and business.The Problem statement helps to reduce risks of solving the wrong problem of the product.Working on Hypotheses builds the basis for finding the right answers.Building CJM and Flows is connecting the dots between the user, existing problems, product and behaviour.Analysing Information architecture, the designer acquires the logical and clear structure of the product.We were ready to make the UI and implement our design.Let's look at the original service main page.In the redesign, based on the result of the research, we changed the approach user's starting point.We used the good-working pattern: user wants to make all his actions in a single place. If he needs the details, he could have them here.All actions for the leave could be done in the Dashboard. Navigation is simpler, too.Sometimes users were in trouble because they don't know the rules of different types of time-offs. Previously, to get this info, they needed to go to the external knowledge base. We give them a handy 'cheat sheet' for terms, numbers, etc.Sure, the rules for time-offs are complex, and often people don't know the legal information.To aid new people quickly get the point about business workflow, details and align it with a new service, we wrote a short and concise User guide.Previously, to take a specific request, the user needed to go through complex navigation to find a form. We totally reworked the request forms, the user now could take any request from any place.We used sidebars as the main approach to have all underhand. Also, the approach to the legal notes and informers was changed-only essential info is shown.All these changes (and many others) helped both users and business.We got excellent feedback about the changes. Users loved the clearness of new design, appreciated the handy possibility of quick access to the request details, etc. As a result, support tickets dropped heavily.I hope, my articles helped you to move a step closer to the Goal - making a good digital product, valuable for users and business.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/0*rV2xg1gayCscfcc2,https://medium.com/design-spot/customer-journey-map-flows-and-ia-c2c60ecc4587,design,d80dc8467c9da8ced462fd8c82ddb7cb1b7c07dbed166438f58a8646
Extremists on Telegram exploit Parler's de-platforming to ramp up recruiting,"Following the announcement that Amazon Web Services (AWS) would be removing Parler from its servers, a newly rebranded group surfaced on the messaging platform Telegram. The ""Parler Lifeboat"" successfully positioned itself as a refuge for the soon-to-be de-platformed crowds from Parler and experienced explosive growth over the next several days.The DFRLab's investigation into the group showed that it was formerly a public group for the violent extremist organization the Proud Boys that was renamed to reflect the impending migration of users sympathetic to far-right views following Parler's de-platforming.Right-wing extremists have used Telegram's platform design and affordances, such as the channel- and message-forwarding features, to direct users to increasingly violent content. In December 2020, the DFRLab reported on a UK-based white nationalist community that included white supremacist and antisemitic narratives alongside disinformation about the U.S. elections.The earliest records of the community that is now the Parler Lifeboat date back to July 18, 2019, when it was named ""Right Wing Chat Squad."" Despite being publicized as a ""public chat"" the group was technically shielded from the public eye by way of a proxy group which served to vet newcomers before granting access to the real group.The earliest record in the channel data, dated June 21, 2019, shows the community migrating from a private group titled ""Right Wind Chat Squad V3.0"" to a public group of the same name. The most recent name change occurred on January 10, 2021, roughly 10 hours prior to Parler's removal.In preparation for de-platforming, the Parler Lifeboat was promoted by the official Proud Boys account among their final posts on Parler. At the time of the Parler platform takedown by AWS, the post had been viewed upwards of 1 million times.The Parler Lifeboat group was also promoted on Telegram internally. Due to Telegram's simple community search feature, the inclusion of ""Parler"" in the name of the group worked to elevate the community to the top of Parler-related search results, which spiked after the platform was taken down.Analysis of the message history shows abnormal activity in the month leading up to the January 10 spike. Since Parler Lifeboat was a Telegram group, rather than a channel, the administrators had the ability to remove content from the record. Between 23:16 UTC on December 1, 2020 and 13:59 UTC on January 10, 2021, the group's records have been redacted. Records show that members continued to join the group - at a rate of three or four users per day for the month of December, which supports the notion that messages were removed retroactively by administrators, though notices of new members joining were not.With the knowledge that Proud Boys were centrally involved in the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, the group administrators could have decided to delete the group's message history in the lead-up to the felonious events that transpired in order to protect contributors from possible legal repercussions.Chat history records show that invites witnessed a concurrent spike with messages on January 10, 2021, reaching a peak of nearly 14,000 invites from January 10-11, 2021.The massive volume of invitations to the group may be in part the result of Parler evacuation efforts. Members were invited to the group at intervals ranging from every few minutes to every couple of seconds for the greater part of January 10, the day Apple and Amazon announced they would join Google in removing Parler from their services.Not all of the newcomers to the Parler Lifeboat were necessarily new to Telegram or unacquainted with the Proud Boys or other extremist communities on the platform, however. The Lifeboat was promoted and shared on 41 other channels and groups on Telegram, some of which were extremist communities that espoused white supremacist ideologies and Nazi propaganda. Positioning the Parler Lifeboat within an established network of extremists online would expose unsuspecting Parler refugees to harmful influencers from more extremist corners of the platform.At its peak, Parler Lifeboat had grown to a subscriber base of upwards of 16,000 users according to data from TGStat, an open-source Telegram analytics tool. Once the Proud Boys had successfully attained a moderator position to review thousands of prospective channel members, they took precautions to distance themselves from the Proud Boys name.

Reinforcement Learning Uncovered,"Reinforcement learning is one of the most exciting and promising research topics of AI. During the last few years, it has repeatedly proven to be one of the most effective research fields, able to defeat humans in many environments. In 2016 an RL agent beat Lee Sedol in the game of Go, while in 2019 competed at grandmaster level in the game of starcraft. But how does reinforcement learning work, exactly?In this tutorial, we will explain the basics of reinforcement learning in the simplest way, trying to decompose and justify the main concepts without complicated formulas. I am a mathematician, so I will die a little bit on the inside but hope that in the end, you have a fine grasp of what reinforcement learning is and, more importantly, you want to know more!After all, RL is not that complicated. Trust me, as with everything in this world, it is just a matter of truly mastering the basics.At the very core, reinforcement learning is based on an agent that repeatedly interacts with an environment.The agent can represent everything able to act: a poker player, a trader in the stock market, my poor, old, bad, tired, robot vacuum which cleans my house. The environment instead is everything external to our agent: it would be all the opponent players, the dealer, the deck for the poker player, would be all the people investing in the market and the market itself for the trader, would be my house and all the objects inside it for my vacuum.As a result of every action the agent takes in the environment, two things take place:It is like in video games: when you (the agent) kill (act) the bad dragon in the game (the environment), your skill points increase (get a reward), and the dragon is not part of your game anymore (the game state changed).I am pretty sure many of you are familiar with the following chart, which describes the loop going on between the agent and the environment.One fair question at this point might be: ok, ok that's great dude! But how long does this agent-environment interaction take place? Well, we have two options:Since the second case is more intuitive and easy to explain, we will focus on it, but keep in mind that everything can be extended naturally to the no-ending framework.Now, as everybody in this world, our agent is interested in maximizing its reward (everybody wants to get rich right?). But our agent is a smart guy! So it does not aim to maximize the reward it gets here and now (we will call this the immediate reward), but it would rather maximize the rewards he receives across all the interactions he has now and has with the environment in the future. I do not know you guys, but I would not choose 10 bucks right now if I can get 2 bucks every day for the next 20 days! So, what the agent really wants is to take actions that allow maximizing the rewards received in time from here on. Indeed, this quantity is called return, and so the agent wants to maximize its return. Here below the mathematical translation of what we just said. In the following equation, t represents the current generic time step we are settled in right now, while T is the time step in which we reach the ending state.In so doing, our poor agent still has a problem: in many many settings, there is high uncertainty on the state it reaches by taking some action or the reward it gets. Think about it. If we (agent) buy (act) a stock in the market (environment), we are not sure that the price will rise the next day (positive reward) or will drop (negative reward). If we (agent) declare our love (act) to that girl (environment), we are not completely sure of the answer right? People who formalized reinforcement learning imagined three kinds of uncertainties occurring during the agent-environment interactions:Among these, the agent can only control the last one. While rewards and next states do depend on the environment dynamics, the agent can only decide how to act. In each state, it can either play deterministically by selecting one action or randomly choosing across multiple possible actions. We will say that the agent has a policy, which means it has a strategy to use across the whole game. In a given state the policy tells which action the agent is going to choose and with which probability it is going to take that action.So, we realized that our agent has uncertainties about its future! But how can it deal with them? Poor guy, it just wanted to maximize its return! Well, the trick is not just considering one possible return related to a specific sequence of actions, rewards, and next states, but rather considering all the possible returns related to all the specific sequence of actions, rewards, and next states which can occur. The agent needs to account for all the returns which might receive from all the possible futures which can be reached, and average them with their probabilities of happening.Starting from the current state, which we might imagine for a moment as a root of a tree, the agent simulates a possible evolution of the dynamics (i.e. sequence of actions, rewards, and next state) up to the end of an episode. While reaching the end and traversing the tree, the agent multiplies the rewards it gets from state to state with the probability of that dynamic to happen (i.e. probability of choosing that action, getting that reward and ending in that state). Once the end state is reached, the agent creates another branch by considering a different possible evolution and repeats the process. This is done again and again up to all the possible branches which can be derived from our state are considered. As a final step, all these quantities are summed up to compute the weighted average which defines the value of the state, because it expresses how good is for the agent to be in that state according to all the possible future returns and related uncertainties.Notice an important point. We said above that among the three types of uncertainties, the agent can only control the way it acts (i.e. its policy), while next states and rewards indeed depend on the environment dynamics. Hence, when we are assessing the value of the state we can fix a certain policy and compute the value with respect to all the possible next states and rewards. In other words, we can make the state value to depend on the policy, so that changing policy changes the value state. For the mathematician which lives in you, this is written as:It reads roughly like: the value of the state s when we play with policy pi is equal to the weighted average of all the returns we get from considering all the possible futures which can take place starting from state s and playing with policy pi.Now let's try to focus on these concepts with an example. Assume you are in the situation of deciding if to declare your hidden, huge and crazy love to that girl (or boy). You have two options (actions): you declare, you do not declare. If you declare there is a 0.5 chance she says yes. If she says yes you are very happy and so this will give you a return of +100. But if she says no you get sad, a little more unsure of yourself and slightly more distrustful of humankind and relationships in general: we could quantify all this strange but passionate whirlwind of emotions with a good -60. On the other hand, if you choose the other option and do not declare to the girl, you live in an eternal what-if scenario but avoid yourself the risk of suffering, and so with a probability of 1.0 you get a reward of (let's say) -10. So, what is the value of this state? Well, we still need to specify the policy. Indeed, the number of policies is infinite, because not only you (the agent) could choose to declare or not declare, but you could declare or not declare according to some probability. To keep things simple, let's compare the two simplest cases coming from the two deterministic policies:That's it! But 20 is greater than -10, so here is the mathematical explanation why you should always go for it!The Bellman equation is the last step of this tutorial. Simply put, it represents a way to express the value of the state without performing each time all the computations deriving from considering all the possible futures. In many settings in fact applying the weighted average process we described above is literally impossible: there are too many states and too many possible episode evolutions. In chess for example, the number of states is something like 10**120 (this is a 10 followed by 120 times 0). As you can imagine, computing the possible returns for each of the states would take ages indeed! The Bellman equation comes to the rescue: even if it does not completely solve the problem, it provides a way to simplify and speed up the computations.The core point of the Bellman equation is that it expresses the value of a state just in terms of the value of the next states which can be reached from it, and neglecting in this way all the remaining future dependencies. In other words, if we know the exact value of the next states (and indeed also the immediate environment dynamics) we can exactly compute the value of the state we are right now. You can see this crucial point from its expression:As you can notice, the value of the state s when we play with policy pi depends on the immediate environment dynamics (i.e. the action we take in s, the probability of getting the next state and the reward obtained) and the next state value.Also, the Bellman equation suggests an interesting way to compute the value of the state. We said that we can now compute the value of the state just in terms of the value of the next states which can be reached. But this reasoning also applies to each of the next states: so if we know the exact value of the next next states we can exactly derive the value of the next state. The reasoning iterates state after state, up to ending one: if we know the exact value of the ending state, we can compute the value of the states immediately before, and knowing those we can go back up to the first one.Finally, it is important to notice that even if it speeds up the computations, the Bellman equation can not be concretely applied to really large state games. Still, we have to scan at least once all the possible states, which can be prohibitive in many environments.That's it. Congratulations you managed to come so far! Hope you enjoyed this introduction on reinforcement learning as I did in writing it! By now, you should have a fair grasp on the basic concepts of reinforcement learning, and be able to move to the next level (..or episode!).

From Shame to Self Acceptance,"This morning in my group Zoom meditation I made an enormous faux pas. In the middle of the 45-minute session, I loud-whispered to my partner Nancy in the kitchen that our dog Freckles had already eaten. My friend Jessica, also on the Zoom meditation texted me that I wasn't muted. I quickly put myself on mute and then entered into a shame spiral.My whole body got hot. I became unable to concentrate and though I stayed on the video call, I could not resume my personal meditation. My head was spinning and, with every rotation, spitting out a new criticism. ""You're so stupid."" Swoosh. ""You're a moron."" Swoosh. ""You don't belong here."" Swoosh. ""You're an embarrassment.""As these disparagements flooded my psyche, I willed myself to do what I often do to get myself out of the negative thinking pattern. ""What is the opposite of shame?"" I asked myself. ""Love, acceptance, belonging.""When I have been on the other side, witnessing someone who did something embarrassing or humiliating, I have felt compassion for them. In a way, their blooper is a gift, a reminder that we are all human. And mine this morning was too. I gave the gift of making a mistake, something probably every person on that call has worried about doing at some point.I thought about all of these people who've I've meditated online with for the last fifty days. Every morning, meeting each other before the sunrise at 6 am to sit together and, in our own ways, pray for healing for ourselves and the world.When I interrupted the flow of our practice it was a blip in time. For them, a minor distraction. I know that they didn't feel what I felt. They didn't think I was a loser, that I didn't belong. They probably didn't give it a second thought after it happened.In my shame mind, these people would be spending the day gossiping about the nitwit who wasn't on mute during meditation. But as I contemplated this intrusive shame-thought I realized how utterly narcissist and self-important it is. And unrealistic. That two-second interruption was just that, a two-second interruption.At the end of the daily meditation, we all unmute for a moment to say goodbye. I thought about saying something like, ""I'm so sorry you guys..... blah blah blah,"" but I decided not to.I thought about my mistake like the gift that it was - an invitation to being human. If I self-flagellated, worried, and asked for forgiveness from the group, I would be telling my friends that, if they'd made that same mistake, I wouldn't be forgiving of them. I would be saying it's not okay to be human.So, like every morning I just smiled and waved. I had found my way to the opposite of shame. Like I do every morning, I felt the love and acceptance from the group. Shame was nowhere to be found.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12096/1*yYjIehUkVLi00JdtIeTMzQ.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/from-shame-to-self-acceptance-c4f54ac1bafc,mindfulness,d679f446035a0a3ed01ed2aec20eae69762cb16bb55426d01279dcc9
College Doesn't Prepare You for the Post-Graduation Slump,"When I graduated college, I was on top of the world. I'd worked long and hard to finish my degree - late nights, insufferable classes, long hours at work and school - it was all worth it. I had a degree, and I had a job lined up after graduation. Everything worked out just like I had hoped it would.But after graduation, I was surprised to find that life wasn't as fun or as glamorous as I had hoped. I had a job, but for the first time in my life, that meant that I was doing the same thing five days a week for eight hours straight. I didn't have homework or essays looming over my head whenever I tried to take some time for myself, but I was exhausted. I had more free time than ever, but my friends had moved back home or weren't free at the same time I was.While college had prepared me to graduate and to get a job, it hadn't prepared me for the post-graduation slump.I've talked to many friends who fell into a similar post-graduation slump (I may have coined the term, though don't quote me on that.) It's when you have put so much time, energy, and commitment into graduating college that when graduation day finally comes and goes, what comes next is less than what you'd hoped for.We put so much effort into getting through college and getting that glorious degree that once commencement comes and goes and we step into the real world, life seems like a bit of a letdown. It's that period where you transition from your dynamic, ever-changing college life to the monotony of a day job and the responsibilities that come along with it. Things get better, but it takes time to adjust. Time that no one really warns you about.Well, the obvious answer is after graduation, but it doesn't always seem to occur at the same time for everyone. For me, the slump started in the fall. I had begun my full-time job, and, at least initially, things were going great. I was used to working long days and more hours per week during the summer, so in some regards, things weren't so different (other than the job itself being new, of course.) But when fall rolled around and some of my friends were preparing to go back to school while I soldiered on at my 9 to 5, the real slump started to occur.I wasn't used to doing the same thing every day with no end in sight. I was used to having two classes on Monday, one on Thursday night and one first thing on Friday. I was used to fitting in work in the cracks in between when I was on campus - two hours here, six hours there, four hours Friday morning before my weekend kicked in. It was weird having the same schedule day in and day out when I had become so used to shaking things up every other day. It was hard trying to find times when I could meet up with my friends - some who were still in school and therefore only available when I wasn't, and some who were still working non-traditional jobs after graduation. August and September of the year I graduated college were some of the most confusing months as I ran into the post-graduation slump.When that slump hits for you - whether it's the day after graduation or a year after graduation - you'll find yourself wishing you were back in college for the random hangouts and varyingly scheduled days. But for most of us, that's not an option. You might find yourself feeling ready to shake things up after dealing with the mundane-ness of your week.Or maybe you're exhausted by it all, even though your mind is telling you everything should be easier now that you don't have assignments due every day and a hectic schedule to remember.Either way, you'll probably get to a point where you're tired of your new life. The post-graduation slump isn't fun, and no one wants to stay there for long.So how do you get out of it?When you're in school, there's a constant cycle of new things that come your way; new classes each semester, new events to try, new clubs to get involved in, and new people to meet. College is set up to provide you with experiences, so after college, it's up to you to create that environment for yourself.Go ahead and bite the bullet; try that new cooking class you've been thinking about, join a Meetup and finally try that new hike you've heard about or try joining a Zoom hangout you've debated joining but never found the time for.The options are endless if you put your mind to it and try.Another thing college is great for is meeting new people, but how do you do that out in the post-graduation world when your college friends are a state away?Trying something new is a great place to start, but there are other ways to meet friends, too. Try Bumble BFF to make a new friend. Ask one of your new coworkers to happy hour. There are tons of unconventional ways to meet friends, too. I made a new friend (or two) through a Facebook group associated with a podcast I listen to. The possibilities are out there if you're willing to put in the effort.Post-college life can be monotonous, with your day to day schedule largely the same five days a week. If you're feeling the slump in this regard, figure out ways to make each day slightly out of the ordinary.This could be scheduling something small into your day or shaking up the workweek by taking the occasional vacation day for yourself. Maybe take time to do a hobby you'd long forgotten about when all of your free time was spent writing essays. Take time to read for fun at the end of each day. Whatever it is, find something that makes you happy and work it into your new schedule.Adjusting to life after college is just that - an adjustment. Give yourself grace as you navigate this new territory. The post-graduation slump won't last forever, but it's okay if you embrace the slump for a little while as you come to terms with your new reality. Embrace where you're at and find things to love about your life right here and now. Maybe your job isn't all you thought it could be, but what are some things you're doing right now that you love? Maybe you're missing your best friend who moved back home; how can you keep in touch and plan to see each other again now that you're no longer roommates? Figure out the good things you still have in life, even if those things no longer revolve around school.This may seem contradictory to the last point, but you can embrace where you're at and remain hopeful for your future. Life post-graduation is all about taking baby steps to get to where you want to be.That could be working diligently at your new job so that one day you earn that promotion you've been dreaming of. It could be pushing yourself outside your comfort zone now for the rewards that it'll reap down the road. You could simply be hopeful that your plans with a new acquaintance this weekend will be the start of a new life-long friendship. The post-graduation slump won't last forever, so find ways to lift your spirits now and in the future.But you can overcome it and build a life for yourself after college that is everything you hoped it would be.Don't let the changes coming your way after graduation make you forget that you accomplished something amazing. You graduated. And you still have lots of years left to establish yourself in your career, make new friends, build relationships, and be the best version of yourself you can be.A 5-day email course with tips on budgeting, investing, and productivity for 20-somethings.

Quantum Fluctuations and Entanglement as Illustrated by Young's Double Slit Experiment,"IntroductionIn my opinion, quantum fluctuations and entanglement are the least understood elements of quantum mechanics. By examining what is happening in the double slit experiment, we can see more clearly how they work. The equations describing the interactions don't give one any feeling for what is happening. The surprising strength of quantum entanglement is one thing that becomes clear when looking at this experiment. Another puzzle that has not yet been explained in any reasonable way is the randomness of the location of the interactions. In this paper, I hope to show that the quantum fluctuations of the Higgs field, sometimes called the quantum foam, are responsible for this randomness.The Higgs FieldAccording to our present understanding of the Universe, the Higgs field permeates all of space-time. This is a scalar field that particles interact with, giving them mass. We know that this field exists because of many things. One is the experimental verification of the Higgs boson, which is the particle causing the Higgs field. Another is the brief existence of what we call virtual particles in otherwise empty space. Some of the most common virtual particles are electron-positron pairs. That is because these are lower energy particles so that the random fluctuations of the Higgs field have enough energy to produce these particles more often. These particles can be detected indirectly by various measurements including the Casimir effect. (Hendrik Casimir). These experiments prove the existence of the Higgs field in empty space.What are the characteristics of this field? First, being a field, it has the characteristics of a wave. These waves have all possible wavelengths and all possible directions in space-time. As waves propagate, they interfere with each other resulting in a very noisy Higgs field environment in free space.Figure 1 shows a simulation of what these quantum fluctuations look like. In quantum physics, a quantum fluctuation is the temporary random change in the amount of energy in any point in space. These are tiny random fluctuations in the value of the Higgs field which materialize into elementary particles when the energy at any point that exceeds 1.022 Mega electron volts for an electron-positron pair. These fluctuations have more effects than just the appearance of electron hole pairs. One of those effects, results in random fluctuations in the location of particle to particle interactions that happen in the double slit experiment.Young's Double Slit ExperimentThe double slit experiment, as illustrated in Figure 2, performed by Thomas Young in 1801, is one of the most important experiments ever performed in quantum mechanics. This was before quantum mechanics was even dreamed about. It demonstrated the wave nature of photons. That was not yet well understood at that time. The experiment belongs to a general class of ""double path"" experiments, in which a wave is split into two separate waves that later combine into a single wave. Changes in the path lengths of both waves result in a phase shift, creating an interference pattern. Another version is the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which splits the beam with a mirror.In the basic version of this experiment, a coherent light source, such as a laser beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate. The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits to interfere, as shown in Figure 3, This produces bright and dark bands on the screen - a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles. However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles (not waves); the interference pattern appears via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen. Furthermore, versions of the experiment that include detectors at the slits find that each detected photon passes through one slit (as would a classical particle), and not through both slits (as would a wave). However, such experiments demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through. These results demonstrate the principle of wave-particle duality.Then, in 1927, Davisson and Germer demonstrated that electrons show the same behavior, which was later extended to atoms and molecules and to everyone's surprise, we found that they were also waves. We were sure that they were particles, but this experiment showed that particles also have wavelike characteristics.Additionally, the detection of individual discrete impacts is observed to be inherently probabilistic, which is inexplicable using classical mechanics. But, these experiments have still never been fully explained (described) by quantum mechanics either. It is merely stated that the shape of the calculated wave function describes the probability with no convincing reason.But it is made up of individual particle/screen interactions, and the wave shape is calculated by the Schrödinger equation which gives the probabilities of the interactions. This is puzzling because other types of waves like sound waves and water waves appear to be continuous. It does not look like they are made of probabilities. Something really different is happening in the double slit experiment.How does the particle go through both slits at once?The double-slit experiment (and its variations) has become a classic thought experiment, for its clarity in expressing the central puzzles of quantum mechanics. Because it demonstrates the fundamental limitation of the ability of the observer to predict experimental results, Richard Feynman called it ""a phenomenon which is impossible [...] to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the only mystery [of quantum mechanics].""The particle, whether an electron or a photon, is really a wave. It only acts like a particle when there is an interaction. Figure 4 shows how the interference creates the intensity bands.This pattern is the same even if only one particle at a time is passed through the slits. This proves that the particle is a wave. But it does not explain the mystery of why it shows the pattern as a frequency of interaction vs location instead of being continuous. Looking at the situation before the electron or photon passes through the slits, it is obvious that the single particle goes through both slits at the same time. It was a wave before it encountered the slits. Then when the wave encountered the slits, it is diffracted just like any other wave. Also, miraculously, all of the energy of each electron or photon passes through to the other side of the barrier. Then, that diffraction results in two wave fronts at each slit interfering with each other to produce the pattern shown in Figure 4.Why is the location of the particle interaction random?Figure 1 shows a simulation of how the quantum foam is constantly fluctuating. Figure 5 shows how the noise of the quantum foam is combined in superposition with the coherent particle wave. The energy of the Higgs field is random at every location in space-time. Most of the time, the Higgs field has much less energy than that required to produce an electron-positron pair. But the energy that is there is enough to alter the location of an interaction when the wave is near an atom. We have not analyzed this mathematically yet, so there are questions to be resolved to verify this picture. The picture looks good qualitatively, but we don't know if it is correct quantitatively. But, it is still a better explanation than the current QM explanation.How is the energy suddenly concentrated in one spot at the detector?All particles have a wave characteristic, but when they interact with other particles(waves), they interact at the location of the second particle. Just for illustration, let's have the traveling particle be an electron, and the interacting particle is an atom that has an electron vacancy. Let's put that atom in or on the screen that captures the electron. So, as the electron wave approaches the atom wave, they are both in super-position to the quantum foam noise. That is altering the wave shape of both the electron and the atom. As they are distorted by the noise, there are peaks of noise that will suddenly and randomly extend the matter waves toward some random direction and thus occasionally toward a specific atom. The atom is also shooting out noisy matter waves. When they collide, an interaction happens. The location of the interaction will be more likely at the high points of the Schrodinger calculation of the wave function, and less likely at the low or zero points of the wave function. This is why the Schrodinger wave is incorrectly called a probability wave, when it is actually a matter wave.What brings the energy together?The wave function of the particle is very widely distributed, so it takes something very powerful to bring the energy back together again. You can see from figure 4, the wave is extremely diffuse. A single particle extends throughout a region of several centimeters. How does it get localized again?The most powerful forces in the universe are the result of symmetry. Entangled particles are known to have links that can extend to many kilometers, and a measurement of one entangled particle can affect the connected entangled particle instantaneously. In a properly set up experiment, two electrons become entangled to have opposite spins. Then they can be geographically separated. Because the entanglement is caused by the fact that spin is a conserved quantity, ""Up"" spin is balanced by ""down"" spin for a net zero spin. When one entangled particle is measured, the opposite entangled particle behaves as if it was measured too. The universe will move heaven and earth to keep the conserved quantities balanced. We don't know of any deeper cause for these particles behavior than the fact that they are entangled. This sometimes called a non-causal interaction.For the double slit experiment, the energy of the electron wave is captured, and even though the electron wave is very delocalized, the whole electron is captured. The electron in free space is a coherent wave, and thus entangled with itself. This causes the whole electron wave to be attracted to the atom. There is no energy barrier to overcome. All of the energy of the electron wave now becomes part of the atom's wave function. This is called a measurement if we are looking at it. If we are not looking at it, it happens anyway. The interacting particles do not care if we are looking at them or not.This shows the power of entanglement. For these quantum interactions, the localized energy does not need to exceed any threshold. The total energy of the entangled wave is used to make the interaction proceed even though the localized energy is very small. It is very important to the universe to make these interactions happen. No energy is allowed to be lost, and ""No entanglement is allowed to be ignored."" I think that is an important principle in the laws of Physics.We always knew the entanglement was important. It is used in the efforts to do quantum computing. The biggest problem for quantum computing today is how to keep an entangled state of a particle long enough to do a computation. That is because our environment is full of other particles that can interact with the desired entangled particle, and destroy that entanglement, which makes quantum computing not work. Of course, when this entanglement is interfered with, the interfering particle becomes entangled with the particle used for quantum computing, thus destroying its usefulness. Even though we know entanglement is important, very little is known about it. Most of the research is devoted to trying to solve the quantum computing problem. That is very understandable, but it does nothing to fully understand entanglement.The questions about entanglement include ""spooky action at a distance"" (Einstein), is dis-entanglement really instantaneous, what is the medium that carries the entanglement, does it required a 5th dimension? These, and other questions need to be answered.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2048/1*ydQcP686JmXzjH-9wpqobg.png,https://john-99387.medium.com/quantum-fluctuations-and-entanglement-as-illustrated-by-youngs-double-slit-experiment-a62da060b3,science,d7190a3dbcd2463ba2ac111f2406c0d899745886ca9ccc39169f3660
A mini-guide to microcopy,"Some time ago I thought that it is not so important to think about microcopy in designs. But I was so mistaken) The biggest misconception is some designers believe that microcopy has a very low priority in the design workflow. But to be honest, Microcopy has a significant influence on the quality of user experienceFirst, you need to define your brand. It's essential to always think about the Brand and Audience when you start working on any project.Here is a list of general questions to define your Brand:After you've set a vision for your brand, you could start on figuring out who is your audienceSame to help you to define your Audience:For example, for a wealth management application, humor would be irrelevant; it needs to have a businesslike tone. But a business tone would be irrelevant for social networks, fitness applications, e-commerce. It all depends on who are your users and how will you communicate with them using your app.The main purpose of microcopy is to create conversations with users and let them know that everything you write is addressed to them.Avoid communication in the 3rd person, instead of 'No data to show' it's better to write 'You didn't add any item to the list. Click here to change it!'.Also, it is recommended to use a Natural Tone in microcopy. It has to be short and precise; don't use long speeches because users will lose interest in your writing. Try using everyday words. Don't try to be smarter than your users by using difficult or technical terminology (one of the rules of 10 Usability Heuristics).The Voice and Tone of your dialogue should have a free format. So, don't use boring phrases and messages. Create a friendly atmosphere with the people that use your application.Examples:Sign In and Sign Up pages are the landing pages of the application. The users' first impression of the app will be based on these pages. Instead of writing 'Log In' or 'Sign In', you'd better write a more friendly message that will make people smile. It will show how happy you are to see them.Nobody will keep in mind standard titles and messages, but everybody will remember the original greetings in your application.Another point is that users don't know WHY they have to Sign Up for your application and spend time on it. How could you persuade them to start registration?The easiest way is to write down the benefits that the user will get when an account is created. As an example, it could be secret sales, the ability to, a Wishlist, track an order, get bonuses, see a history of purchases, fast checkout, etc.Examples:Remember that users need to have the opportunity to Reset the Password in case if they forgot it. How better do that? It has to be very neat, easy, and without extra information. Reset password and get a new one is the main goal on this page. The only components that you need are:Examples:Placeholders have different types depending on the category:Don't try to make placeholders in every field that you see in the design; it is useless and creates a mess. There are 2 cases where it is best to use placeholders:Examples:Error messages have to be friendly and do not blame the user in case of mistakes. Build a warm and friendly tone that will help to form a positive impression of your application.All types of error messages have a list of rules, such as:Examples:These are mostly generic recommendations for errors in microcopy. So, how do you cover all error cases? Short checklists below will help you not forget any case.Checklist for Sign Up:Checklist for Login:Checklist for Contact Us:Checklist for Password Recovery:Success Messages give users the satisfaction that an action is completed and everything is fine. This is the most expected response that they want to see, so don't deprive them of their happiness.Success messages could be instructions for the user. They tell about the next actions or mandatory steps. It will help to create a positive feeling about your brand and even bring about smiles if you use friendly messages.Checklist for success messages:Avoid faceless microcopy like 'The transaction was completed successfully.', 'Registration was successful', 'Your order was successfully received', and other boring examples of how to make your brand greyscale and non-memorable.Spend time on original text turnovers, don't copy and paste standard templates, invent your unique brand style, and soon you'll see a profit!How do you create attractive text for success messages? It is simple to do using general rules:Examples:Designers usually forget about the importance of Empty Stats designs and sometimes they implement by developers using silly text 'No data to show', 'No contact in your list', 'Your Wishlist is empty', 'Your cart is empty' etc. Are you familiar with such a situation?)The main principles for valuable Empty Stats are:Examples:You could wonder, but 404 Page also a part of microcopy) It could be designed with a hilarious image to make users laugh, but it will be useless for them if it doesn't bring any information. Try to figure out why you created this page and how it will help users. 404 page needs to bring useful information about what happened and how to fix it.Checklist for 404-page:Examples:Be friendly with your users, and never blame them for errors or mistakes. Using an effective microcopy, you could avoid misunderstanding between the user and the app. Be careful about the details. And last but not the least, put a piece of soul in your microcopy and users will never forget about it)Hope that it helped you, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors!Resources and references that were used for this article'Microcopy the complete guide', Kinneret Yifrah, Nemalahttps://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/'Error 404: what the error page means and how to use it', Digital Guide, ionos.com'The Four Cornerstones of Writing UX Microcopy', Sheena Lyonnais, xd.adobe.com'A Pocket Guide to the Craft of Words, Part 2 - Microcopy' by Christopher Murphy, Nicklas Persson, Owen GregoryMicrocopy Patterns (@tinywordsmatter)https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/empty-state-ux-design",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/0*UcArTt7Ee2X6gupG.jpg,https://uxdesign.cc/a-mini-guide-to-microcopy-55496469f03b,design,d15712f558a550cda3f7531eaa0df3982497e70da9aafdcb3541f4a8
What are the public sentiments around Farmers protest in India?,"Some of the major observations on public sentiment about the recent Farmers protest in New Delhi, India. And how sentiment analysis on twitter sample data played a key role in understanding the public sentiment.When someone like me who is not much into studying and understanding the farm laws of India ,it is always a tough task to whether support the farmers protest or not. Most practical approach for this problem is analyzing the public comments.Here, I used sentiment analysis technique on sample data from twitter(10,000 tweets) for analyzing public sentiments and as a Proof of concept(POC) you can look into the steps followed and the key observations from the sample data .This blog completely focus on analyzing the tweets and steps followed and trying to find why most of the tweets falling under neutral comments.Extracting the tweets from millions of tweets on twitter, can be handled by finding the right keywords the user tags.#FarmersProtest is one of the common keyword the users tagged. Using 'Tweepy' , the data is extracted from twitter. The programming language used for this study is python.Noise removal plays a major role in finding a correct sentiment from a tweet. Non-English tweets, and the emoji's are not considered for this study. NLTK ,Text blob, regular expressions are used here in various stages of pre-processing.List of pre-processing techniques used:There are multiple libraries to find the sentiment scores. Text blob is used as a part of this study. In Text blob, ""Polarity"" is the factor which represents the sentiment score in the range of -1 to 1.-1 represents the Negative sentiment,0 represents neutral and 1 being the positive sentiment.Word cloud is a representation of common words used in tweets .With respect to the sentiment scores and categories made, 3 word clouds are made to represent the most common words in each category.Word frequency graph and word cloud are the easy way of representing your text data to others.Positive word cloud and word frequency :The above graph represents, The most common words used by users are ""thanks"", ""support"", ""protest"", ""right"", ""government"" to express there support to the farmers protest.Negative word cloud and word frequency:Negative word cloud indicates, ""fake"", ""democracy"", ""propaganda"", ""shah"", ""inhumane"" are most common words used in tweets which have negative sentiment scores.Neutral word cloud and word frequency:Most common words observed here are ""support"", ""thank"", ""stand"", ""protest"". There are common words in all 3 word clouds. Example, ""support"" is being used in positive and neutral word clouds, which indicates both positive and neutral tweets contain this word.There is nothing wrong in getting words like this, as the word meaning changes when it is in a sentence.Coming to this big question, we have a various observations.Major observations on why they are 'Neutral' :As some of the international celebrities came into the picture in support of the farmers, there is a deviation from the main topic to a sub-topic ""Do international celebrities involvement correct or not?"", leaving the main topic behind.Most of us don't want a protest, when you can settle the terms with government. These neutral tweets suggest the same. To be short, it indicates they don't want any violence to happen and the settlement to happen with farmers.The sentiment analyzer model is not trained as part of interest in this study. ""Text Blob"" is used as a sentiment analyzer for predicting the scores. As the text blob model is trained on large corpus of text data, this package is used for better results.Note : This study is a part of understanding and handling the unstructured data. And study is not done in favor of any of the sides in the conflict.References :",https://miro.medium.com/max/1640/1*k2ObLWMzZzM-XYD78-mDbA.jpeg,https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/what-are-the-public-sentiments-around-farmers-protest-in-india-6807924135f8,data-science,d8880736815bb21e3247fd132373085af703549af16e14efa454c5f9
How to explain UX to dummy Charley?,"Meet Charley - a graduate student. He receives an increased scholarship as he is an active and dedicated student. Also, Charley is full of ideas and eagerness; he dreams about creating an online store.As we have mentioned already, our student has a meager budget so he has no money for using the services of an expensive professional Web studio. So he opens Google, types ""open an online store from scratch individually"". Charley studies the basics of website development and sees odd terms - UX or User Experience, conversion, usability audit, and call-to-action.If Charley has a good advisor who will give a clue about a result of such a scenario, our rising entrepreneur shall not have to close up the shop half a year after opening it. If such a friend using clear examples, tells the rising entrepreneur what is user experience and how to design it, describes the process of usability audit, tells how calls-to-action work on the website, perhaps the path of developing the rising resource will sound more positive.This article will become such an advisor. It will explain to Charley and other beginner entrepreneurs what UX is and how it is helpful for an online store owner in plain English.When the Internet appeared in the 90s, there were no UX. It was chalked up as an accomplishment to create the ""Hello, world!"" page. At that time the page had to exist only.At the cusp of the millenniums, the situation has changed drastically with the emergence of search engines. The number of pages has increased and the first SEO signs appeared. For appearing at the top of the search results, it had to correspond with the search request as much as possible.Website owners clued into this and began grabbing the audience with the keywords.Sysadmins understood all these efforts of the resource owners, but they were reluctant to sort the search results. At that time they began working on their search algorithms and introduced the concept of website ranking, i.e. compliance of the website to several requirements that determine its quality including the informative value and usefulness for the user.Over time, more websites appeared, so the algorithms and requirements also changed. User behavior was added to ranking. Now, a search-oriented website should be fully convenient for a user from the load speed and design to info and selling texts.In 2017 analysts marked a turning point in distributing the traffic between mobile and desktop devices in favor of the former. This determined a new trend known as ""mobile-first"" named after an eponymous Google search algorithm.The mobile-first algorithm and trend are about the priority of optimization of the Web-page optimization. To put it in simple words: if the website does not have a page adapted for viewing on mobile devices, users leave it. The more users leave the website, the worse the behavior is. This leads to a downgrade in the search results. So, the website will be shown on the 3rd-10th page of the search results.Charley can conclude that if he ignores user convenience and does not orient on the requirements of the search algorithms towards website usability, he may not get the desired traffic and even more desired orders or even may not be indexed by search engines. So this is a waste of time and money for resource development and SEO.The concept of user experience has been introduced in 1995 by Donald Norman.Every user has his/her impression of the website when s/he visits it from any source (search results, social media, other websites, etc.). This impression is demonstrated by the following actions:These actions reveal different user's impressions from the website. The more users make target actions on the website, the better the user experience is (or, according to experts, the usability).UX abbreviation is often used with UI - the visual user interface and all its visual components - color set, form of key elements, and their general use conditions (click a button, swipe, stretch, etc.). Many non-experts confuse these concepts and think that there is no difference between them.To put it in short:A UX/UI design is an interface development (including the website) that considers not only its appearance but also the convenience of using it.""Convenient"" means ""easy for implementing the website function"". If we are talking about an online store, a ""convenient website"" is a website where a user always makes a purchase (the uber goal is making a large purchase).Interface development includes not websites or software only. Let us analyze a simple example: an ax. If compared with such tools as a spade or a hammer that should have a straight handle, an ax should have had a different handle created by experimenting and improving within thousands of years:This term was formed of two words - ""use"" and ""ability"". So, it determines the convenience of using one or another object, mastering it, and to what extent it can solve the user problem.Let us consider what is usability using a flat plan as an example.The flat plan usability can be considered from different points of view:These are ways of operating a flat - one object. The concept of convenience can be also understood differently. Usability specialists analyze what a consumer of one or another product (in our case - a website) wants so as which properties and consumption cases determine this convenience.If speaking about the usability of websites, their level of development is evaluated by conversion - how many visitors made a target action: made a purchase, left a request, subscribed to a mailout (depending on the website goal).If a resource has some problems, specialists will perform a usability audit. This allows determining what hinders the visitor from making a target action.In the sphere of website development, it is recommended to consider usability on the stage of the project vision. The step logic (UX) that the user needs to follow on the way towards the target action should be developed before developing the website. The interface elements (UI) are adjusted to such logic.Firstly you need to make research on the target audience:These steps determine the decision about the easiest way to convey the business offer bypassing the fears and overworking all doubts of the target consumer.The usability audit is also made later - during the website work. But the main work is performed at the beginning of the project design. So, the owner of the future resource saves time, effort, and money investing in an actionable and efficient vision based on the user experience. If UX research is performed after the implementation, the owner often has to redo the project from scratch changing the step vision and logic and remaking the design.When you buy a puppy, the first thing you should do is to train him to do number one during walks. It is too early to walk it, so you need to protect your floor from puddles and piles until the puppy grows up. So it's time for ""field studies"": you monitor where does the puppy goes to the toilet in your flat and next time put a rag there.So, you analyze its behavior, accumulate the experience of interacting with the puppy as you can learn its habits by practical studying only. The same with the user behavior on the website: place the relevant (most suitable) offer where they make more clicks or impressions.Usability audit solves two tasks:In these terms the research algorithm will be as follows:This can be compared with such a true-to-life example as a regular medical check - not for treatment, but disease prevention.Let us explain to Charley what conversion is as it was mentioned above.The word ""conversion"" is used in online marketing. In simple terms, it is the percentage of visitors who have made a target action.Need a true-to-life example? It is the number of tomato sprouts that has taken roots and will be fruitful at the end of the season. If you water and fertilize them, you will get more tomatoes. If you do nothing, there would be no harvest at all.There are two types of conversion:This can be visiting your blog found by the visitor in the search results. S/he may read a few posts on the website and share them on social media. The visitor also subscribed to the news not to miss the updates. S/he did not make a purchase but this does not mean that s/he will not make it later.Users who made a micro-conversion are potential brand ambassadors - i.e., they can share information about it by marketing buzz (usually via social media). This allows building up a reputation and increase brand awareness;The conversion path is the period from getting interested in the offer to the purchase. It can also coincide with the landing page pattern:It can also include more complicated additional steps:Although additional steps make the process longer, they allow filtering ""casual"" visitors and leave productive and purposeful customers only. This means that the visitor is ready to follow all the required steps for receiving the product that interests him/her very much.A simple example: the second part of the ""Frozen"" cartoon had been rumored long before the opening night. The conversion path is as follows:The quality of the teaser (offer presentation) so as other aspects (the plot, availability of the movie for the target audience in various towns, toy availability, shipment methods, etc.) determines the number of customers that will follow the complete path to the purchase.So, this depends on the persuasiveness of the Call to Action (CTA) so as on the availability of the description of the characteristics and purchase conditions (price, description, shipment, payment, etc.).The Call To Action quality can also be estimated. If the website developer and owner always understand the call, the visitors sometimes don't.Folding doors in commercial premises can serve as an example. They are opened either by pulling or pushing. Some doors have a special sign with the opening direction. This is an example of appropriate usability. If all visitors open the door properly for the first time, this means that the usability is appropriate.The difference between the Call To Action on the website from the door is the following: if one decided to visit an institution, s/he will not leave it even if he failed to open the door. S/he will try again as s/he took many efforts before and is motivated enough.As for the website, the situation is different. As the path to the action is less labor-intensive, if the visitor does not gain the required result from the first time, s/he is likely to leave it and open another website or will not make the purchase/order at all. These are the realia of the Internet.So the usability of the call to action and the pattern of the action itself should follow simple logics: the visitor should have no doubts that s/he wants to click the ""Submit"" button and should have no questions about how to do this as s/he comes closer to the desired button or form on the website.To put it in a nutshell: don't make mistakes while designing it.Charley has a pool of concepts analyzed above. If he reads about them on the vision stage, i.e. long before he begins developing the resource, he can analyze his future project through the eyes of his target audience.If Charley wants to open an online store, he needs to know what does he want to receive a year later. But now he has nothing except the dream about becoming an owner of a profitable resource. So he has to cast aside his first desire to order his neighbor schoolboy Jim a website assembly on Joomla and grasps all ""marketing gizmos"" later. Charley has to realize that even an online store that has a certain sales volume will not last long without such gizmos.Another extreme that occurs with potential owners of online stores is when they think that such an enterprise is very expensive so it requires a lot of staff and a very large budget. But there is a solution.Currently, entrepreneurs do not have to study 5 years at a university for opening a successful business and manage it. If you want to save money, better apply a resource allocation approach, not the economy.Winning tactics for appropriate distribution of the existing funds in case of a small budget include replacing the staff with tools, i.e. investing in buying and mastering them. Most business processes can be automated. There are a lot of tools that allow solving routine problems individually on the Internet. You only need to choose the suitable ones for reaching the goals of your enterprise.""Which ones should help?"" - wonders our rising entrepreneur. Luckily, we have the answer.During the collection of operational concepts and UX information Charley may use heatmaps and scroll maps for analyzing his product through the eyes of the target audience.On the resource vision, stage heatmaps and scroll maps allow collecting data about the visitors' response to the resource peculiarities and the order-making process.Working with heatmaps and scroll maps can be compared with spying on somebody with a binocular - we see what one is doing and s/he does not realize this. We are talking about the resource owners and the user.Search engine algorithms based on artificial intelligence track every action of Internet users. This is a well-known fact so this is OK.This allows the systems to detect what resources and search results are the most suitable ones in a certain case. Why not to improve your business with the results of this great work performed by artificial intelligence and adapted by specialists of leading corporations for better understanding? We also think it's worth trying.Besides analyzing the UX, these tools have other advantages:These tools perform other functions described here.Heatmaps and basic knowledge of the terms described above are enough for Charley to understand the main concept of his future online store that will be profitable and attractive.Regular audit of the resource quality allows gaining experience and determine what innovative resource functions for boosting and appropriating the sales volume and can be interesting for the users.",https://miro.medium.com/max/852/0*sLM3_irV4Bd3KdTs,https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-to-explain-ux-to-dummy-charley-3960b7c4f59,design,da5c216eaa76254e38444691f714f99c3039dbb1f1ed94e812eeb332
How to Unlock your Creative Potential in Three Steps,"By practicing consistently, lowering the stakes, and embracing useful constraints, you give your mind and spirit the room to expand.I have a confession...I love experimenting on people.Don't worry, I usually only target students.The book, Art & Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland, describes a ceramics teacher who split his class into two groups. One group was graded on the quantity of work, the other was graded solely on the quality of one piece.Guess which group had better pieces?The quantity group did better by far. You see, instead of theorizing, planning, and talking about what makes the best pot, the quantity group took action. Freed from the expectation of competence, they spent their time exploring, experimenting and creating.This inspired me to test the theory for myself. While lecturing at a Chinese University, I taught a few sections of a course called ""Innovation in Business."" I assigned one group a semester-long project to find a business need and design a product/business to solve. The other section was to do the same work (though abbreviated) every week.Do you need to ask which group had better ideas?Of course, the weekly group knocked it out of the park. The ideas were far more creative, the briefs were much better written, and intriguingly, the class's satisfaction was reported to be far higher.Both these examples track with the research done on creative productivity that discovered two elements of highly creative people:Here are some examples: quick! What did Edison invent? Well, a lot of things actually. He held a total of 1,093 U.S. patents. Shakespeare wrote close to 40 plays and over 150 sonnets, while Alexander Dumas wrote 277 novels over his lifetime - six every year of his working life.Since creative people are prolific idea-generators, they have more misses than hits. But, using Edison as the example, we tend to remember the hits like the lightbulb and the telephone while forgetting the misses; a talking doll and a ghost detection machine (both were on the list as misses, but your mileage may vary...)Let's add research done on people who perform at the elite levels to the conversation. More deliberate practice equals better performance. Tons of it equals great performance.Or, as John Maxwell said: ""Small disciplines repeated with consistency every day lead to great achievements gained slowly over time.""There are a few factors at work here:Consistent and focused practiceWe all know that more practice equates to better performance. However, when we are thinking about high stakes projects, we believe perfection demands a great deal of time and focus channeled into one project. Instead, research shows that trying many things in quick succession and consistently has more impact.Reduce the StakesImagine this, I put a 1 foot wide by 12-foot longboard on the ground and offer you $100 to walk all the way across without falling off.Think you can do it? Of course, and it would be no challenge at all. Now suspend that same board between two-20 story buildings, 260 feet in the air. Would you still be willing or able to do it?The skill needed hasn't changed. The difficulty hasn't changed.The stakes have changed.In my experiment, the quality group had one high-stakes project. If they failed to produce a good piece of work, they'd do poorly in the class. Because of this: they were less willing to take risks, to experiment with new opportunities. The second group, on the other hand, had no such stakes. Their only failure would come from not trying at all. Experimentation was, therefore, easy and fun.Embrace Effective ConstraintsFinally, both the above stories showed the value of constraints. In both examples, each group had opposite rules. One had the limitation of needing to deliver their best work in one piece with no time constraints, whereas the second group had the condition of needing to produce a great deal of work in a short period. Time-pressure and the need to continually ideate and create led to better ideas and outcomes than those with no such constraint.In your own life, you can use these three elements to increase your work's effectiveness and creativity.By practicing consistently, lowering the stakes, and embracing useful constraints, you give your mind and spirit the room to expand.See, experimenting on people can be fun and useful!!",https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*_M3OqLe-YNGjR2cK.jpg,https://samseaster.medium.com/how-to-unlock-your-creative-potential-in-three-steps-468f19a77697,productivity,db11d2955f177fa06e4c282bbf06c8d2e0f9e4c46add3f6391d0e480

iPad Pro + Raspberry Pi for Data Science Part 3: Installing Our Data Science Tools,"Welcome back, folks! We're back again with our third and possibly final post in enabling a Raspberry Pi to work with an iPad Pro for data science work. If you've been following along so far, then you will already be able to connect the Raspberry Pi to your iPad Pro with a direct USB-C to USB-C connection. In case you missed those first two posts that have gotten us tho this point, here they are again:In this post, we're going to cover getting all our data science tools installed onto the Pi properly. In case you are unaware, the Raspberry Pi's CPU makes use of an ARM architecture while many other modern computers use an x86 architecture. Don't worry, you don't need to know what those exactly mean, but it's to say that installing some things can be a bit unconventional.Alright, we have a lot of ground to cover, so let's go ahead and hop into our first tool: Pandas.In most cases, you're probably familiar with downloading Python libraries from PyPi using a command like pip install pandas. The good news is that pip still does work for many Python libraries; the bad news is that it oddly doesn't work for some other tools. Being that Pandas is one of the most prominent tools in a data scientist's toolbox, I thought it was important to call out this alternative means of installation.For our Pandas download to the Pi, we're going to be making use of apt. In case you're unfamiliar with that is, it is a common means to install software on a Linux-based machine. (APT stands for ""Advanced Package Tool.) In order to properly install Pandas on your Pi, all you need to do is run the following command in your CLIsudo apt install python3-pandasAnd that's it! You can now use Pandas just fine. Onto our next tool!If you're like me and most other data scientists, chances are that you are using some form of Git to perform version control and code integration with teammates. At my day job, I use Git with GitLab, and for my personal work, I use Git with GitHub. And if you're like me, you also likely use GitHub as a means to showcase your personal portfolio of work. That said, we're going to both install git and ""git"" your Git working with your personal GitHub account. (Did you like my pun in there?)To install git itself, apt once again comes to our rescue. All you need to do is run the following command: sudo apt install git. And that's all we need to do to install Git. Before jumping into connecting our Git to our GitHub, let's first set our git configuraiton settings. Run the following commands below to respectively set your name and email:Alright, now we're ready to connect Git to GitHub. This is going to be a fair bit more complex than what we've done so far, so please be careful to follow each step in the process below. You can actually find almost all these same steps in GitHub's official documentation, but I'll go ahead and cover it here since the official documentation isn't exactly linear. (There is one specific thing if you're using the same Screens app as me.)In the following steps, we'll perform these three high level actions: generate a new SSH key, add the SSH key to the ssh-agent, and add the SSH key to GitHub.Since it's been a while since I've done this, I honestly can't remember if an SSH key already comes standard on your Raspberry Pi OS initialization or not. In any case, we'll just go ahead and create a new one to make things similar on ourselves. Here are the steps to do just that:With our SSH key now created, we need to add the SSH key to our ssh-agent. This is a very simple process that can be covered in two swift steps:We're just about there! This is where things get a little odd since we're using the iPad to connect to our Pi. These steps are only going to make sense if you installed the Screens app in our previous step. We unfortunately can't just use our CLI (Blink Shell) for this last section as we'll be using our iPad's web browser to input these SSH credentials.1. We're going to use a small tool called xclip to copy the contents of your SSH public key file to your clipboard. To install this, we'll use our old friend apt once again: sudo apt install xclip2. If you haven't already, it's now time to fire up the Screens app. The reason for this is because the xclip tool copies the contents of the SSH key file to the clipboard of the Raspberry Pi, NOT the clipboard of the iPad itself. Fortunately, the Screens app allows us to transfer clipboard contents back and forth between the iPad and Pi.3. Open the terminal in your Raspberry Pi interface. Just to ensure we're on the same page, this is what I'm looking at right now:4. Run the following command to copy your SSH key to the Raspberry Pi clipboard: xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub5. In order to continue using our SSH key directly on the iPad, we'll need to transfer the contents of our Raspberry Pi clipboard to our iPad's clipboard. This is super easy to do in Screens. In the bottom-right corner of the Screens UI, you'll see a small square with an arrow pointing up. Click that and then click the ""Get Clipboard"" option. Now your SSH key will be in your iPad's clipboard!6. Open up your favorite browser and navigate to your personal GitHub account.7. Navigate to your account settings by clicking on your profile photo icon in the top-right of the UI and then clicking on ""Settings""8. In the left navigation menu, click on ""SSH and GPG Keys.""9. Click the green ""Add new SSH key"" button.10. You should now see the UI pictured in the screenshot below. Paste in the key from your clipboard and give the key any arbitrary name you'd like. I just have mine called ""Raspberry Pi.""11. Click the green ""Add SSH Key"" button, and we are done!Congrats! You are now able to interact with your personal GitHub from your Raspberry Pi!I personally work a lot with Docker images, so one of my biggest gripes about doing data science on the iPad by itself is that there was really no way to build or work with Docker images natively. Whereas Pythonista is an app that provides a great interface for working directly with Python, there is no special app that builds Docker images. (And yes, I understand why this is. That's not going to stop me from being upset about it.)Like our other tools, the Docker install on the Raspberry Pi is unconventional, but it's fortunately not as complex as some other things. Once again giving credit where it is due, a big thank you to Sofija Simic at this website for providing these instructions.And that's it! if you want to ensure everything is running properly, I would run the ""hello-world"" container ( sudo docker run hello-world ) and see if you're getting an output properly. We're ready to move onto our final and perhaps most interesting tool: JupyterHub.Chances are that you've used Jupyter notebooks or JupyterLab, but you might not be familiar with JupyterHub. JupyterHub takes things to the next level when it comes to creating a legitimate discovery environment. This is because JupyterHub allows multiple users, multiple compute resources, and multiple data sources to come together all under one roof. It is super nice, and we actually use JupyterHub in my day job at my Fortune 50 company.So you might be wondering, why do we care to enable this ""enterprise-grade"" thing on our tiny little Raspberry Pi? I have two reasons for that, and you admittedly might not care about the one but will definitely care about the other. The one you might not care about is enabling of multiple users. But the other more important reason is that we will set up JupyterHub to instantly start right away on the Pi's boot up, and we'll be able to instantly connect to it from our iPad without having to initiate any special start up commands.Once again, many thanks to Gerold Busch for providing my basis for this section. Let's get into enabling JupyterHub on your Pi! (Note: I'm not going to cover user management in this post, but if you're interested in that, Gerold's post does a great job at covering that.)We're going to cover two overarching topics in here. The first will be enabling the auto-startup of JupyterHub on your Raspberry Pi, and the second will show you how to quickly get working with JupyterHub directly from your iPad.1. If you haven't already, ensure that you have all your Python configuration settings all good to go. If you've been following along with this series so far, you can skip to the next step. Otherwise, you'll need to run the following commands:2. In order to configure a proxy that will allow JupyterHub to receive its users properly, we'll need to install NPM (Node Package Manager) and another tool called configurable-http-proxy. We can install these by running the following commands:3. We now need to install Jupyter notebooks and JupyterHub from PyPi. We can do this with one quick command:4. JupyterHub uses a Python-based configuration file to store settings for JupyterHub. In order to make use of it properly, we'll need to first generate it and then move it into the /root directory. We can do that with the following commands:5. We now need to edit the bind_url in that configuration file we just created. We're going to set it to port 8888, but it doesn't necessarily have to be that. To do this, run the command sudo nano /root/jupyterhub_config.py. We will then need to uncomment and update the following row with this information:6. Okay, the basic behavior of our JupyterHub start-up is now good to go. Now we just need to have our Raspberry Pi start up JupyterHub on OS bootup. To do that, we'll first need to create a new file in systemd. In order to start that process, run the following command: sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/jupyterhub.service.7. Fill this new file with the following information:8. Run the following commands to put everything in order and get your JupyterHub up and running:If you compared my post to Gerold's original post, you will notice that I skipped on enabling JupyterLab as the default interface for our JupyterHub instance. This isn't because I don't like Lab, but rather it doesn't really work with Juno Connect, the app we'll be using to connect to JupyterHub.Speaking of Juno Connect, you might remember from an old post of mine my recommendation to use Juno as a Jupyter interface. Juno and Juno Connect ($9.99) are made by the same company, but the difference is that Juno is designed to work natively on the iPad whereas Juno Connect is intended only for working with remote servers. I really do like the native Juno, but it's a tad bit limited in that you can only use pure Python libraries. (Again, another limitation of the native iPad.) Juno Connect will use the compute resources of the Raspberry Pi, so we're not bound by those same limitations with the native Juno. They both have their use cases, so I personally have both installed.Sorry if that last paragraph got a little bit windy. Let's jump into setting up Juno Connect with your Pi. All you need to do is open the app and tap on ""Add Jupyter Server."" If you've followed along with this series so far, you'll be able to fill out the server information with these settings:Tap ""Save"" and you're good to go! If you navigate now to any of your notebooks, you'll see the same UI you'll be familiar with the basic Juno app. Here's what my setup now looks like:The coolest thing about how this works is that you aren't limited to interacting with just Juno Connect or even your iPad. If you prefer a more native experience, you can connect to JupyterHub with your IP address directly in a regular web browser. I tested this same IP address on my iPhone - which is not at all directly connected to the Pi - and lo and behold, it works! (Although this would be a terrible way to work!)And that wraps up this post! I'm sure there are more tools we could add, but I think this gives you more than enough to get started. I'm not sure if there will be another post in this series or not. I'm currently looking into ways into enabling a small Kubernetes cluster just for learning purposes, but I'm currently struggling to enable that. If I can get it working, I'll write another post on that. But even if I don't write another ""Raspberry Pi + iPad"" post, I'll definitely write more data science posts. Stay tuned for those, and thanks again for reading!",https://miro.medium.com/max/3684/1*Fv0ynloqGP_DEW2hBMfajA@2x.jpeg,https://towardsdatascience.com/ipad-pro-raspberry-pi-for-data-science-part-3-installing-our-data-science-tools-77d020e485f2,artificial-intelligence,dc1fbf517c73230c0348bd422e9673ae56d38e48af5d2b9e7edfe98d
Cognitive Risk Management,"by Alexander Petrov, John Thomas, Ricardo Balduino, Maxime Allard, and Aakanksha JoshiMachine Learning (ML) applications have become ubiquitous. News about AI for self-driving cars, online customer support, virtual personal assistants, and so on come daily. And yet, it may not be obvious how to connect existing business practices with all these amazing innovations. A frequently overlooked area is the application of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to help process huge volumes of business documentation quickly and effectively to find the proverbial needle in the haystack.One of the domains that allows organic application of ML is risk management for financial institutions and insurance companies. There are many questions that organizations face regarding how to apply ML to improve risk management. Here are just a few of them:· How to identify impactful use cases that can benefit from using artificial intelligence?· How to bridge the gap between intuitive expectations of subject matter experts and capabilities of technology?· How to integrate ML into an existing enterprise information system?· How to control the behavior of ML models in a production environment?This article aims to share the experiences of the IBM Data Science and AI Elite (DSE) and IBM Expert Labs teams, based on multiple client engagements in the risk controls area. IBM DSE has built various accelerators which can help organizations jump start their adoption of ML. Here, we will go through use cases in the risk management space, introduce a cognitive risk controls accelerator, and discuss how machine learning can transform enterprise business practices in this space.In 2020, multiple financial institutions were hit with fines exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars per individual organization. The reason for the fines was an inadequate risk controls state.This triggered a call for financial companies to ensure high quality of the large numbers of risk controls they have to work with. This includes explicitly identifying risks, implementing risk controls to prevent risk development, and finally establishing testing procedures.For non-specialists, risk control is a bit perplexing. What is this about? A simple definition is that risk controls are put in place to monitor risks for a company's business operations. E.g., a security risk may be that an intruder guesses a password and as a result gets access to someone's account. A possible risk control may be designed as establishing a policy that requires long and non-trivial passwords enforced through the organization's systems. As a consequence of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), public companies require means to efficiently manage such risks and, as part of this effort to build risk controls and assess the quality of these controls.An important element for risk managers is whether the controls are well defined. The assessment for this may be done through answering questions like who monitors the risk, what should be done for risk identification or prevention, how often the control procedure should be done in the organization's life cycle, etc. All these questions should be answered. Now we need to realize that the number of such controls in an enterprise is from thousands to hundreds of thousands and it is very difficult to make an assessment of the controls corpus manually. This is where contemporary AI technology is able to help.Of course, this type of challenge is just an illustration and it would be impractical to attempt covering the vast area of risk management within a single article, so we focus on a few specific challenges that practitioners face in their day-to-day practice and that were already implemented using the Cognitive Risk Controls accelerator.There are not many public risk controls databases available, so the solution in the accelerator is based on NIST Special Publication 800-53 for security controls that is available at https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53. This security controls data base is small, but it allows us to demonstrate the approaches that can be scaled to large volumes and different domains of risk controls.One of the key use case categories is to rationalize the existing risk controls: the challenge is that there may be a lot of historic aspects to how the existing risk controls were developed. E.g., some risk controls may be built by copying other existing controls with minimal modifications. Another example is that some risk controls may be formed by integrating multiple risk controls into one. Common consequences of this approach are duplicated controls and the presence of controls that are not relevant to the business any longer. One of the most difficult challenges is to assess the general state of quality for the existing risk controls. Hence, the first target from a business perspective is to build quality assessment: automatically assessing the quality of control descriptions saves huge time on routine reading of descriptions by focusing only on those which are really important to review and improve. A good question is how AI comes into the picture here. NLP-based ML models have become very effective at common language-related tasks and, in particular, at challenges such as answering questions. One type of model that can be referenced here is based on the Transformer architecture (for more details, please see an article about Transformer architecture at https://medium.com/inside-machine-learning/what-is-a-transformer-d07dd1fbec04).In the risk management sketch, the ability to answer questions about a risk control description was key to assessing the quality of the control's descriptions. From a birds-eye view, the number of the unanswered questions is a good indicator of the quality of a control description. The best news is that with the capabilities of contemporary AI models such as Transformers and with additional practical rules, this technique of asking the right questions becomes an effective mechanism to control a large volume of control descriptions by a small team with the assistance of AI.Frequently, finding duplicates in documents is considered a straightforward task and Levenshtein Distance can help find items expressed with similar wording. However, this becomes a much more challenging task if we would like to find semantically similar descriptions. This is another area where contemporary AI can be helpful - the embeddings built using large neural networks (e.g. autoencoders, language models, etc.) can capture semantic similarity. From a practical outcomes perspective, our experience has been that the identification of duplicates and overlaps may lead to reducing the volume of controls up to 30 per cent.Additionally, it became a common practice to analyze the internal structure of information through ML techniques such as clustering. This allows the business practitioners to better understand the content of controls on a larger scale and to see whether the existing taxonomy for risks and controls is well aligned with the content, or what may be missing in both.The previous use cases were focused on the analysis of existing controls. Another use case focuses on helping risk managers create new risk controls. Recommending controls for a given risk using semantic similarity can significantly reduce manual effort and provide a flexible template for building controls. Machine learning can help here with analysis of the risk description and figuring out the right set of controls to address each risk.In large organizations, it is typical that teams work on solutions and best practices which may be used by other teams. Adopting best practices across the organization requires extensive training. Machine learning can be very useful in such situations. An example may be classification of controls as preventive or detective. In this use case, we use supervised machine learning to extend the classification of controls to the whole set of controls by using the existing labeled set from a particular team, i.e. knowledge transfer is done using machine learning as opposed to time consuming training of personnel.Cognitive technology in the IBM DSE risk controls accelerator allows us to structure the risk controls, to recommend controls for the risk formulated in natural language, to identify overlaps within the controls, and to analyze the quality of controls.The accelerator delivers a cognitive controls analytics application that integrates the developed models and applies them to unstructured risk controls content.Logically, the Cognitive Risk Controls Accelerator contains several components:Let's look under the hood of the accelerator-based implementation using IBM Cloud Pak for Data.Before we do this let's briefly review the IBM platform and approach. IBM has a prescriptive approach to the journey to AI called the AI ladder. In his ""AI Ladder: Demystifying AI Challenges"" Rob Thomas (SVP, IBM Cloud & Cognitive Software) substantiated that to turn your data into insights your organization should follow the phases listed below:• Collect - ability for easy data access, including virtualizing the data• Organize - the means to cataloguing your data, building data dictionaries, and ensuring rules and policies on accessing data• Analyze - this includes delivering the ML models, using data science for identifying the insights using cognitive tools and AI techniques. This naturally requires building, deploying, and managing your machine learning models• Infuse - from a lot of perspectives, a key phase. This refers to the ability to operationalize AI models in a way that allows the business to trust the outcomes, that is, to use your machine learning models in enterprise systems in a production mode while being able to ensure ongoing performance of these models and their explainability.Cloud Pak for Data is IBM's multi-cloud Data & AI platform delivering an information architecture and providing all the outlined capabilities. The following diagram captures the details of developing an implementation in the context of the AI Ladder.It captures the phases of implementing a cognitive risk controls project based on the DSE accelerator:This article introduced one of the growing areas of application of machine learning in contemporary business - cognitive risk controls. Please do not hesitate to reach out to the IBM Data Science and AI Elite Team if you are interested in knowing more about cognitive risk controls and AI technology. Also, please contact IBM if you see that your use cases are similar to the ones presented, or if your business and technical challenges may be addressed by the mentioned approaches or tools.Authors (IBM DSE and Expert Labs) express gratitude to their colleagues for the continued collaboration and development of the business and technological approaches for cognitive controls: Stephen Mills(Managing Director, IBM Promontory), Miles Ravitz (Sr. Principal, IBM Promontory), Rodney Rideout (Delivery Executive, IBM Global Business Services), Vinay Rao Dandin (Data Scientist), Aishwarya Srinivasan (Data Scientist, IBM DSE), and Rakshith Dasenahalli Lingaraju (Data Scientist, IBM DSE).",https://miro.medium.com/max/8064/1*0CyuZfN_9hN0imokPWOKwQ.jpeg,https://towardsdatascience.com/cognitive-risk-management-7c7bcfe84219,artificial-intelligence,dc6ae0bde581fc292966a7dd9911ac9ca3744700b7f6deeb01b6e623
Watch as They Fall,"Keep an open mind to the lessons that come as giants fall.Tim Cook of Apple called Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg out for their lack of ownership in a recent speech. Watching leaders get taken to task for moral cowardice, and total abdication of responsibility was a soothing balm to an old wound I hadn't realized I had been carrying.I've had some really crappy bosses. In my 18 years of collecting a W-2, I've been verbally, physically, and emotionally assaulted - once fired for not taking a shot out of one of my female-managers bra. However, in some ways, my worst leader was one who just bugged me out of principle.Ed was the owner of a small campus café I briefly worked for in my freshman year of college. In preparation for ""Parent's Weekend"" on campus, he printed new menus with a 50% markup on most items. He made the mistake of not printing enough menus while not updating the computer system, so items rang up with the original prices. He also purchased and crammed a half-dozen new tables and a dozen chairs into the living room-sized café, managing to block an exit, the bathroom, and half the entrance to the kitchen. He did this instead of prepping additional food and drinks. Predictably, the weekend was a disaster.Students called me a cheat as I struggled to work around the messed up computer. Plates of food were spilled onto the laps of customers as we all tripped on the maze of chair legs because the tables blocked the bathroom. Still, everyone needed to use it after coming in from festivities, causing a continuous game of musical chairs. Ice, forks, and menus were strictly rationed.Ed screamed at me at one point, as yet another party of eight left the café in disgust without receiving their food. Having already turned in my two weeks notice mentally, I said in the coldest voice I could muster, ""One more word and I quit this second, and good luck managing this on your own."" He shut up.After 14 straight hours of constant running and being screamed at, Ed locked the doors as I stared at the deconstructed cafe in horror.Ed then walked to the register, took the cash drawer, and went to his office. He cheerfully shouted, ""let me know when it's all clean, and you can go home,"" before shutting the door.Cook's speech highlighted some of the best lessons I learned from Ed.I remember Ed whistling a happy tune as he tallied up his earnings from the day as I swept around the endless chair's legs, hobbling on numb and bleeding feet.  Cook pointed out the short-lived joy of claiming credit without accepting the responsibility.  It took me three hours to get that place back into reasonable shape for the morning shift. Meanwhile, Ed took a nap. And finally, Cook said,Ed's café closed a few weeks later.I was thrilled and unsurprised to see the ""closed"" sign hanging on the door. Students, who were the cafe's bread and butter, were disgusted that he overcharged their parents. Taking into account newly purchased equipment and wasted food, Ed lost more money than he earned. And it was not a shock to anyone when the staff walked out or quit days after the fiasco.  Terrible bosses make for memorable stories. Learning by example is easy, and learning what not to do is even easier.  Tim Cook has harsh words for the leaders of industry that control our lives. Watching what these giants do correctly will make for fantastic learnings. However, keep your mind open to the lessons that come as those giants fall.It can be far more satisfying.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/0*Mw81uOqTbVvLEN3i.jpg,https://medium.com/swlh/giants-fall-587e1ba8bc23,leadership,dcc5f3e2894cefc363cd28fca078fa16a2470a9747fe3bd16e4cb510
50+ Statistics Interview Questions and Answers for Data Scientists for 2021,"You've probably heard me say this a million times, but a data scientist is really a modern term for a statistician and machine learning is a modern term for statistics.And because statistics is so important, Nathan Rosidi, founder of StrataScratch, and I collaborated to write OVER 50 statistics interview questions and answers. You can check out his website here!With that said, let's dive right into it!A Z-test is a hypothesis test with a normal distribution that uses a z-statistic. A z-test is used when you know the population variance or if you don't know the population variance but have a large sample size.A T-test is a hypothesis test with a t-distribution that uses a t-statistic. You would use a t-test when you don't know the population variance and have a small sample size.You can see the image below as a reference to guide which test you should use:The best way to describe the p-value in simple terms is with an example. In practice, if the p-value is less than the alpha, say of 0.05, then we're saying that there's a probability of less than 5% that the result could have happened by chance. Similarly, a p-value of 0.05 is the same as saying ""5% of the time, we would see this by chance.""Cherry picking refers to the practice of only selecting data or information that supports one's desired conclusion.P-hacking refers to when one manipulates his/her data collection or analysis until non-significant results become significant. This includes deciding mid-test to not collect anymore data.Significance chasing refers to when a researcher reports insignificant results as if they're ""almost"" significant.The assumption of normality is the the sampling distribution is normal and centers around the population parameter, according to the central limit theorem.The central limit theorem is very powerful - it states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution.To give an example, you would take a sample from a data set and calculate the mean of that sample. Once repeated multiple times, you would plot all your means and their frequencies onto a graph and see that a bell curve, also known as a normal distribution, has been created. The mean of this distribution will closely resemble that of the original data.The central limit theorem is important because it is used in hypothesis testing and also to calculate confidence intervals.The empirical rule states that if a dataset is normally distributed, 68% of the data will fall within one standard deviation, 95% of the data will fall within two standard deviations, and 99.7% of the data will fall within 3 standard deviations.A permutation of n elements is any arrangement of those n elements in a definite order. There are n factorial (n!) ways to arrange n elements. Note the bold: order matters! The number of permutations of n things taken r-at-a-time is defined as the number of r-tuples that can be taken from n different elements and is equal to the following equation:On the other hand, combinations refer to the number of ways to choose r out of n objects where order doesn't matter. The number of combinations of n things taken r-at-a-time is defined as the number of subsets with r elements of a set with n elements and is equal to the following equation:Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing are both tools used for to make statistical inferences.The confidence interval suggests a range of values for an unknown parameter and is then associated with a confidence level that the true parameter is within the suggested range of. Confidence intervals are often very important in medical research to provide researchers with a stronger basis for their estimations. A confidence interval can be shown as ""10 +/- 0.5"" or [9.5, 10.5] to give an example.Hypothesis testing is the basis of any research question and often comes down to trying to prove something did not happen by chance. For example, you could try to prove when rolling a dye, one number was more likely to come up than the rest.Observational data comes from observational studies which are when you observe certain variables and try to determine if there is any correlation.Experimental data comes from experimental studies which are when you control certain variables and hold them constant to determine if there is any causality.An example of experimental design is the following: split a group up into two. The control group lives their lives normally. The test group is told to drink a glass of wine every night for 30 days. Then research can be conducted to see how wine affects sleep.Simple random sampling requires using randomly generated numbers to choose a sample. More specifically, it initially requires a sampling frame, a list or database of all members of a population. You can then randomly generate a number for each element, using Excel for example, and take the first n samples that you require.Systematic sampling can be even easier to do, you simply take one element from your sample, skip a predefined amount (n) and then take your next element. Going back to our example, you could take every fourth name on the list.Cluster sampling starts by dividing a population into groups, or clusters. What makes this different that stratified sampling is that each cluster must be representative of the population. Then, you randomly selecting entire clusters to sample. For example, if an elementary school had five different grade eight classes, cluster random sampling might be used and only one class would be chosen as a sample, for example.Stratified random sampling starts off by dividing a population into groups with similar attributes. Then a random sample is taken from each group. This method is used to ensure that different segments in a population are equally represented. To give an example, imagine a survey is conducted at a school to determine overall satisfaction. It might make sense here to use stratified random sampling to equally represent the opinions of students in each department.A type 1 error is when you incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis. It's also called a false positive.A type 2 error is when you don't reject a false null hypothesis. It's also called a false negative.The power of a test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false. It's also equal to 1 minus the beta.To increase the power of the test, you can do two things:The Law of Large Numbers is a theory that states that as the number of trials increases, the average of the result will become closer to the expected value.Eg. flipping heads from fair coin 100,000 times should be closer to 0.5 than 100 times.The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Eg. 80% of sales come from 20% of customers.A confounding variable, or a confounder, is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and the independent variable, causing a spurious association, a mathematical relationship in which two or more variables are associated but not causally related.There are four major assumptions:A model is heteroscedastic when the variance in errors is not consistent. Conversely, a model is homoscedastic when the variances in errors is consistent.Interpolation is a prediction made using inputs that lie within the set of observed values. Extrapolation is when a prediction is made using an input that's outside the set of observed values.Generally, interpolations are more accurate.Selection bias is the phenomenon of selecting individuals, groups or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved, ultimately resulting in a sample that is not representative of the population.Understanding and identifying selection bias is important because it can significantly skew results and provide false insights about a particular population group.Types of selection bias include:Handling missing data can make selection bias worse because different methods impact the data in different ways. For example, if you replace null values with the mean of the data, you adding bias in the sense that you're assuming that the data is not as spread out as it might actually be.Mean imputation is the practice of replacing null values in a data set with the mean of the data.Mean imputation is generally bad practice because it doesn't take into account feature correlation. For example, imagine we have a table showing age and fitness score and imagine that an eighty-year-old has a missing fitness score. If we took the average fitness score from an age range of 15 to 80, then the eighty-year-old will appear to have a much higher fitness score that he actually should.Second, mean imputation reduces the variance of the data and increases bias in our data. This leads to a less accurate model and a narrower confidence interval due to a smaller variance.Autocorrelation is when future outcomes depend on previous outcomes. When there is autocorrelation, the errors show a sequential pattern and the model is less accurate.Potential biases include the following:You would perform hypothesis testing to determine statistical significance. First, you would state the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis.Second, you would calculate the p-value, the probability of obtaining the observed results of a test assuming that the null hypothesis is true.Last, you would set the level of the significance (alpha) and if the p-value is less than the alpha, you would reject the null - in other words, the result is statistically significant.A long-tailed distribution is a type of heavy-tailed distribution that has a tail (or tails) that drop off gradually and asymptotically.3 practical examples include the power law, the Pareto principle (more commonly known as the 80-20 rule), and product sales (i.e. best selling products vs others).It's important to be mindful of long-tailed distributions in classification and regression problems because the least frequently occurring values make up the majority of the population. This can ultimately change the way that you deal with outliers, and it also conflicts with some machine learning techniques with the assumption that the data is normally distributed.An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations.Depending on the cause of the outlier, they can be bad from a machine learning perspective because they can worsen the accuracy of a model. If the outlier is caused by a measurement error, it's important to remove them from the dataset. There are a couple of ways to identify outliers:Z-score/standard deviations: if we know that 99.7% of data in a data set lie within three standard deviations, then we can calculate the size of one standard deviation, multiply it by 3, and identify the data points that are outside of this range. Likewise, we can calculate the z-score of a given point, and if it's equal to +/- 3, then it's an outlier.Note: that there are a few contingencies that need to be considered when using this method; the data must be normally distributed, this is not applicable for small data sets, and the presence of too many outliers can throw off z-scoreInterquartile Range (IQR): IQR, the concept used to build boxplots, can also be used to identify outliers. The IQR is equal to the difference between the 3rd quartile and the 1st quartile. You can then identify if a point is an outlier if it is less than Q1-1.5*IRQ or greater than Q3 + 1.5*IQR. This comes to approximately 2.698 standard deviations.Other methods include DBScan clustering, Isolation Forests, and Robust Random Cut Forests.An inlier is a data observation that lies within the rest of the dataset and is unusual or an error. Since it lies in the dataset, it is typically harder to identify than an outlier and requires external data to identify them. Should you identify any inliers, you can simply remove them from the dataset to address them.The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution that gives the probability of the number of independent events occurring in a fixed time. An example of when you would use this is if you want to determine the likelihood of X patients coming into a hospital in a given hour.The mean and variance are both equal to λ.Design of experiments also known as DOE, it is the design of any task that aims to describe and explain the variation of information under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect the variable. In essence, an experiment aims to predict an outcome based on a change in one or more inputs (independent variables).There are a number of potential reasons for a spike in photo uploads:The method of testing depends on the cause of the spike, but you would conduct hypothesis testing to determine if the inferred cause is the actual cause.Since we looking at the number of events (# of infections) occurring within a given timeframe, this is a Poisson distribution question.The probability of observing k events in an intervalNull (H0): 1 infection per person-daysAlternative (H1): >1 infection per person-daysk (actual) = 10 infectionslambda (theoretical) = (1/100)*1787p = 0.032372 or 3.2372%Since p-value < alpha (assuming 5% level of significance), we reject the null and conclude that the hospital is below the standard.Use the General Binomial Probability formula to answer this question:p = 0.8n = 5k = 3,4,5P(3 or more heads) = P(3 heads) + P(4 heads) + P(5 heads) = 0.94 or 94%Using Excel...p =1-norm.dist(1200, 1020, 50, true)p= 0.000159x = 3mean = 2.5*4 = 10using Excel...p = poisson.dist(3,10,true)p = 0.010336Precision = Positive Predictive Value = PVPV = (0.001*0.997)/[(0.001*0.997)+((1-0.001)*(1-0.985))]PV = 0.0624 or 6.24%See more about this equation here.p-hat = 60/100 = 0.6z* = 1.96n = 100This gives us a confidence interval of [50.4,69.6]. Therefore, given a confidence interval of 95%, if you are okay with the worst scenario of tying then you can relax. Otherwise, you cannot relax until you got 61 out of 100 to claim yes.Therefore the confidence interval = 115+/- 21.45 = [93.55, 136.45]. Since 99 is within this confidence interval, we can assume that this change is not very noteworthy.Using the General Addition Rule in probability:P(mother or father) = P(mother) + P(father) - P(mother and father)P(mother) = P(mother or father) + P(mother and father) - P(father)P(mother) = 0.17 + 0.06-0.12P(mother) = 0.11Since 70 is one standard deviation below the mean, take the area of the Gaussian distribution to the left of one standard deviation.= 2.3 + 13.6 = 15.9%Given a confidence level of 95% and degrees of freedom equal to 8, the t-score = 2.306Confidence interval = 1100 +/- 2.306*(30/3)Confidence interval = [1076.94, 1123.06]Upper bound = mean + t-score*(standard deviation/sqrt(sample size))0 = -2 + 2.306*(s/3)2 = 2.306 * s / 3s = 2.601903Therefore the standard deviation would have to be at least approximately 2.60 for the upper bound of the 95% T confidence interval to touch 0.See here for full tutorial on finding the Confidence Interval for Two Independent Samples.Confidence Interval = mean +/- t-score * standard error (see above)mean = new mean - old mean = 3-5 = -2t-score = 2.101 given df=18 (20-2) and confidence interval of 95%standard error = sqrt((0.⁶²*9+0.⁶⁸²*9)/(10+10-2)) * sqrt(1/10+1/10)standard error = 0.352confidence interval = [-2.75, -1.25]Assuming we subtract in this order (New System - Old System):confidence interval formula for two independent samplesmean = new mean - old mean = 4-6 = -2z-score = 1.96 confidence interval of 95%st. error = sqrt((0.⁵²*99+²²*99)/(100+100-2)) * sqrt(1/100+1/100)standard error = 0.205061lower bound = -2-1.96*0.205061 = -2.40192upper bound = -2+1.96*0.205061 = -1.59808confidence interval = [-2.40192, -1.59808]The box with 24 red cards and 24 black cards has a higher probability of getting two cards of the same color. Let's walk through each step.Let's say the first card you draw from each deck is a red Ace.This means that in the deck with 12 reds and 12 blacks, there's now 11 reds and 12 blacks. Therefore your odds of drawing another red are equal to 11/(11+12) or 11/23.In the deck with 24 reds and 24 blacks, there would then be 23 reds and 24 blacks. Therefore your odds of drawing another red are equal to 23/(23+24) or 23/47.Since 23/47 > 11/23, the second deck with more cards has a higher probability of getting the same two cards.When there are a number of outliers that positively or negatively skew the data.There are 4 combinations of rolling a 4 (1+3, 3+1, 2+2):P(rolling a 4) = 3/36 = 1/12There are combinations of rolling an 8 (2+6, 6+2, 3+5, 5+3, 4+4):P(rolling an 8) = 5/36If the given distribution is a right-skewed distribution, then the mean should be greater than 30, while the mode remains to be less than 30.You can tell that this question is related to Bayesian theory because of the last statement which essentially follows the structure, ""What is the probability A is true given B is true?"" Therefore we need to know the probability of it raining in London on a given day. Let's assume it's 25%.P(A) = probability of it raining = 25%P(B) = probability of all 3 friends say that it's rainingP(A|B) probability that it's raining given they're telling that it is rainingP(B|A) probability that all 3 friends say that it's raining given it's raining = (2/3)³ = 8/27Step 1: Solve for P(B)P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), can be rewritten asP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)P(B) = (2/3)³ * 0.25 + (1/3)³ * 0.75 = 0.25*8/27 + 0.75*1/27Step 2: Solve for P(A|B)P(A|B) = 0.25 * (8/27) / ( 0.25*8/27 + 0.75*1/27)P(A|B) = 8 / (8 + 3) = 8/11Therefore, if all three friends say that it's raining, then there's an 8/11 chance that it's actually raining.If you made it to the end, congrats!

Reading Rat's Mind,"In 2019 Tampuu et al. from Computer Science Department, University of Tartu, Estonia, and from University College London, published a paper, Efficient neural decoding of self-location with a deep recurrent network, in which they were able to predict a rat's location with RNNs (LSTM, more specifically) and recordings of hippocampal neurons. They showed that their approach is better than a Bayesian decoder for predicting a rat's location in a 2D environment. In particular, they developed a decoder that accepts neuron spike counts from partially overlapping time windows and then predicts the location of the rat in the middle of the final time window. The authors of the original paper obtained the dataset from Caswell Barry lab at UCL.The authors of this blog post (see below) aimed to expand on their approach by using the same neuron spiking data available in the original paper's GitHub repository, and try to predict the location at different times. In particular we were interested in how far ahead into the future the place cells of a rat have information about its movements and how much of the past do those cells remember.Our secondary goal was to investigate an anomaly that the original research authors noticed when examining the gradient strength in their neural networks. A brief overview of that is also provided in the last section of the current blog post.Before we get too rigorous, let's do some simple training and predicting with neural networks. This section does not delve into the details too heavily, so if you are into that, you might find the next section more enjoyable.In the original article, the researchers used a neural network with LSTM nodes in order to predict the rat's current location. LSTM (or long short-term memory) is a type of recurrent neural network. LSTM nodes also ""remember"" information for some arbitrary amount of time, perhaps similarly to what a brain does.While the rats were moving around in a 2D environment, the neuronal spike counts of their location cells were measured for each 200ms interval, so called timesteps. LSTM based RNN input was formed by the measurements at 100 of such consecutive timesteps. The network was then asked to predict the rat's location at the center of the last time window. In this way, the researchers got a pretty good approximation for the rat's current location. We can illustrate this process with the picture below.The simple approach for predicting the future is to just use this same architecture and input data but change the location we predict. For example if we have 200ms timesteps, we can ask the network to predict 200ms, 400ms, 600ms and so on into the future from the last spiking data.Notice that we cannot use an analogous approach to estimate the past location. If we were to estimate the rat's location at the center of the 99th time window, we would still have data about the rat's past location in the 99 first time windows. Therefore, we need a different approach to test if the place cells remember any location from the past. We will discuss this more in detail in the next section.So if we were to predict the future using this approach, the illustration from above would change to this:The neural network itself consists of an input layer, two layers of LSTM nodes and an output layer. Both LSTM layers also have an attached dropout to avoid overfitting. In total the model has around 3 million trainable parameters. As you may be aware, training large neural networks might become quite slow. Especially if you are using your normal CPU. If you want to achieve something in a reasonable amount of time, you should really use some GPU acceleration. Luckily Google Colab is the perfect place for this kind of experimentation and that is what we used.After training these models for 40 epochs, these are the results we got. The x-axis represents how far forward into the future we predicted while the y-axis represents the mean squared error for our predictions (the size of the 2D environment where the rats were observed, was 1 meter x 1 meter).The results look about right for what we would expect. The further into the future we predict, the bigger the error becomes. Note that we are not really concerned here with how accurate the model is, only in how the error increases in terms of how far we predict into the future (time T in ms). There is no clear cutoff point here where we can say that the given rat did not plan this far.Note that this plot is not perfect. There might be some overfitting happening and some models would perhaps perform better given more training epochs. However, we are not concerned with accuracy here. We are interested in the trendline which will probably not change even if we smooth out these plots with lots of cross-validation and training epochs.While these experiments are cool, they don't really give us a good insight for how much does a rat remember or how much does it plan for the future. We need to develop an approach which is a bit more clever.We wanted to measure, if and how far into the past and future the navigation cells have information about the rat's location. At first glance, a straightforward idea would be to just train a model that detects the relationship between the neurons spiking data and the either remembered past location or planned future location. This is basically what we did in the first section.However, as we learned from the original paper these navigation cells are encoding pretty solid information about the rat's current location at any given moment. That means that if we want to truly distinguish how much those neurons encode extra information about the past memories or future plans, we have to eliminate the effect of being able to guess those past and future locations by just knowing the rat's current location, and movement speed and direction. One way to do that is to train two machine-learning models:The idea: if the error rate of the advanced model above is smaller than the error rate of the baseline model above, we can say for sure that the neuron spiking data is encoding more data than just the rat's current location, and movement direction and speed. By training and testing an array of models this way for different time intervals into the past or future (one model per each time interval), we can determine the lower boundaries of how far into the past the rat remembers where it has been or how far into the future the rat is planning ahead its movements.For the Neuron Spiking Decoder we selected an ML algorithm that is able to detect the location signal from neurons spiking data. We want to keep things reasonably simple. Our aim is not to be as accurate as possible, just enough to see that the signal is there, so we can distinguish between baseline model and advanced model outcomes. That is the rationale to work with a simple random forest regressor learning algorithm with default meta parameters instead of a complicated neural network. Random forest is reasonably easy to use while being fairly capable in its default settings to detect complicated signals if they are present in the data.The neuron spiking data provided in the original paper's GitHub repository is readily preprocessed in multiple different breakdowns. There are measurements for multiple rats for 2 different experiments, in separate datafiles, and for each rat, the measurements are preprocessed into different time windows (which are overlapping for larger than 200ms time windows) for counting the neuron spikes.We focused on the 2D experiment - i.e. the data about the rat's navigating in a 2-dimensional environment. And from the 2D experiment, we focused on the dataset that provided the neuron spiking counts in 200ms non-overlapping time windows. In this dataset, one data point in the experiment dataset includes the spike counts per neuron as the features during 200ms, and rat's location at the middle of the observed timeframe as a label.The measurements of neuronal spiking data and rat location were taken during a 20 minute timespan.In order to train a model to guess where the rat's location has been in the past or would be in the future, we have to shift the labels (the rat's locations) along the time axis. Let's say, we want to know if rat's place cells have any memories about its location 10 seconds in the past. Then we need to shift the labels in the original dataset, so that for each data point of neuron spiking data, we have the corresponding location from 10 seconds in the past. We can then use this data to train our model and validate to find the mean absolute error when predicting 10 seconds into the past.And we wanted to generate such models for different time intervals, not just 10 seconds, to see, if and how far into the past or future the rat's location cells are aware of it's locations. We decided to scan all the time intervals, starting from 1 minutes from the past, ending with 1 minute to the future, with 200ms timesteps. So, for each single rat we generated 2 x 601 different models:So, altogether, 601 models were generated for the baseline models, and 601 models were generated for the advanced models (as described above under ""The Method"" subsection).The following figure is visualizing the results of training and testing all those models in a way as described above, for one specific rat, with codename R2192. The X-axis reflects the time range from 1 minute past to 1 minute future. The 0-point on the X-axis is the ""current time"" - this is where the input features for the predictions are taken, and then the location predictions for different times are made with all the different models accordingly.The upper chart. The blue dots on the upper chart are the mean absolute errors of the baseline models for given time ranges. The orange dots are showing the same thing for advanced models. Remember, the baseline model did not have access to the neuron spiking data, just the location, speed and movement direction.The lower chart. The lower chart shows the difference of mean absolute errors of the baseline and advanced models (i.e. MAE of the baseline model minus MAE of the advanced model) for any given time range, plus the ""boxed"" regions that indicate the signal we are looking for. The further explanations follow below the figure.In order to better understand what is going on on those charts, let's explain some observations here.Firstly, as both baseline and advanced models are including the current location, and movement direction and speed as input features, it is expected for the MAE-s of both models to drop to zero at the time point 0 (the ""current time""). It is really trivial for our models to learn to predict the current location by having the current location as an input feature, isn't it? Which is confirmed by running the model tests. Of course if both models predict the current location with no error, the difference in their errors is going to be 0 as well.What should spark our interest, is that as we move further away from the point 0 along the time axis, either to the past or to the future, we can observe, that for certain time ranges, up to multiple seconds, the difference between the MAEs of the baseline and advanced models is considerably larger than for other regions further away along the time axis. These are the boxed areas, added to the lower chart, to better locate those MAE differences. This is the signal that we were looking for. That gives us the indication (with some disclaimers of calling for cautiousness in jumping for confident conclusions), that the rat's location cells might indeed remember its past locations for some time, and also might ""be aware"" of where the rat is planning to go. This result is interesting enough that further more diligent research should be conducted on this matter.However, there are couple of other observations on those charts that call for explanations:Question 1: Why are we seeing such an oscillating trend both in the MAEs and the difference of the MAEs? This is an artifact of how the dataset for training and testing for each time-distance (past or future) is generated. As described above under the ""Data Preprocessing'' subsection, we are looking the time range from one minute into the past to one minute into the future, divided into 200ms timesteps - that means 600 different time intervals (300x200ms into the past and 300x200ms into the future). For each such time interval we are training a separate model. In order to do that, we take the featureset and cut the first 300 and last 300 rows away from it, in order to ensure we have labels for the same featureset in case of every observable time interval. However, that means that the population of the labels (the locations we are predicting) is shifting, timestep by timestep, as we look through all the 600 timesteps. That means that the statistical distribution of the labels (the locations the rat has been in) is also slightly changing for different time intervals and it does so in a gradual (i.e. trending/oscillating) fashion - that is the source of the slight observable oscillating trend of the MAEs (and the diffs of the MAEs of two different models together with it). Fortunately, the signal that we are looking for, in the close neighborhood of ""current time"" is still stronger to stand out from the oscillating noise for most of the rats (for one individual rat out of four rats the signal of the future plans, if it was present, was too overwhelmed by the MAE oscillation to stand out - see the chart for the rat R2336 below). Assuming that is the case, having more data (covering more time for the same rat) would cure the situation, as it would reduce the importance of the rat locations at those 300 timesteps from the beginning and end of the measurement window (which currently is about 20 minutes).Question 2: Why does the advanced model get worse results than baseline in regions far away from the t = 0? As we can see from the second chart, it is clear that most of the MAE differences further away from t=0 are negative. This means that, on average, the MAE of the baseline model is slightly smaller than the MAE of the advanced model. The question is why? As we know from the general machine learning wisdom, the more we pile up feature data, while not increasing the number of training instances accordingly, the likelier we are to overfit. As the advanced model differs from the baseline model by adding neuron spiking data to the feature set (in case of the rat R2192 visualized above, there are spiking data for 63 neurons, i.e. 63 additional input features), we would expect to have some neurons add more noise for the ML algorithm and thus cause some amount of overfitting.Question 3: Why do the future predictions seem to be weaker than guessing the memories about the past locations (the ""yellow box"" is higher than ""blue box"" on the chart)? That observation is not surprising since the past is a firm fact, and thus the rat should have concrete memories about it. At the same time future plans might change on the way, thus giving us the input data where the signal for future locations is weaker.The same analysis was also done on three other rats. Below are the respective charts of those:We can observe similar patterns for these rats as we did with the first one.Our secondary goal was to understand the gradient behavior of the original model. Neural networks are trained using some variant of gradient descent, where the weights of the network are iteratively modified. During each iteration we calculate the loss, or prediction error, and then update the weights in the opposite direction of the gradient, to reduce the loss as much as possible.The authors of the original paper trained a 2-layer LSTM network to predict the rat's current location based on the neural spiking data during the past 100 timesteps. The question was, how the neurons decode this information and is this reflected in the parameters of the neural network. One possibility is to look at the gradients of the loss with respect to the inputs of the model (which in this case is the spiking data of the neuron). The higher the absolute value of this gradient (gradient strength), the more a small change in the input changes the output.We would also expect the last timestep to be the most informative, with the highest gradient strength. After all, the position of the rat at the center of the last timestep was the prediction target and the spiking data during the last timestep was the last input. Since the spiking data was collected from the place cells we could expect the last timestep to contain the most information about the location of the rat at the center of the last timestep.However, the gradients of the neural network showed a different picture. Namely, there was a very distinct drop in the gradient strength in the last time window. One hypothesis was that this was an artifact from the structure of LSTM networks - maybe the LSTM with its internal cell state vectors and forget gates might avoid over-prioritising the last timestep.To investigate this possibility we trained different recurrent models. If the drop in gradient strengths persists in other models it would be a hint towards the origin of this behaviour being in the data - that is, maybe the spiking of the place cells do indeed correlate with location most intensively a little before the rat actually reaches the observed location.We trained nine models in total, each received as input the neural spike counts in the previous 100 timesteps and predicted the location at the center of the last timestep. The models were either with 1 recurrent layer, 2 recurrent layers or 2 recurrent layers and one dense layer on top of the recurrent layers. The recurrent layer architectures were either simple RNN, LSTM or GRU. In total 9 different models. The resulting graph is shown below. Each subplot is for a different network layer architecture, and on each subplot one line corresponds to one cell architecture.Each line on each subplot corresponds to the averaged gradient strength for the model, where the average is taken over all the neurons and all the test data points.As we can see from the graph, the gradient dropping behaviour exists regardless of which network we use. If we looked at the neurons separately the drop in gradients for the last timestep was still there. However, for simpler models with just one layer the drop was less significant.Since this does not appear to be an artifact of a particular network or cell architecture, it would be interesting to conduct further research to investigate this effect. One option would be to use attention models and analyze the attention weights. A simpler method would be to use data knockout, where we investigate how the prediction accuracy of the network depends on which data points were removed from the input. In such a case we would compare the loss when the last timestep was eliminated with the loss when the 99th timestep was eliminated from the input data.In summary, we would like to emphasize that all the results and explanations here should be taken as speculative. This blog post is by no means a peer reviewed scientific paper. We hope that the thoughts presented here provide inspiration for further research in similar areas.The authors of the current blog post are:The blog post has been written as an outcome of a course project in the context of Introduction to Computational Neuroscience course at University of Tartu.

How I Scored My First Copywriting Clients Even Without Professional Experience,"It's not what you know, it's who you know.Your network is your net worth. It's not about the people you know, but what they can do for you.The only way your network is valuable to you is when two things happen:Knowing this, it won't be a big surprise that not only my first client but also my second client came from my own network. Two, totally different but great projects. People that didn't know me before, but trust my expertise to help them out.It still feels a bit surreal - who would hire a copywriter with less than a year of professional writing experience? I didn't know who either, but lucky for me, I found 2 people. Not only did I get a role to play, in both projects they gave me the lead.Don't get me wrong:I know I'm good at what I do.This allows me to be confident about my own skills, but also know when to say no - to allow myself to either involve someone else that's more skilled or invest the necessary time to acquire the required skill.My interests have always been all over the place. I love writing and designing stuff. After spending the last couple of years inside tech companies at the customer-facing departments, I know my fair share about user experience, digital product management, and how to deal with customers in general. This learned me one crucial thing:Knowing how someone interacts with your product is priceless.So far, this month has exceeded my wildest expectations. Looking back, here are the three tactics that have helped me the most.The first one is always the hardest and I was terrified by the thought of it. It looked like a daunting and grueling task: selling myself to strangers.In the beginning, this can be tough as there isn't any experience to show your client. No track record to fall back on, but there's one thing I could do:Proof to my potential client I'm capable of the thing I said I was by doing the work. Let's say, a potential client needs help with their brand identity and strategy.In preparation for this meeting, I go over their resources - website, ads, blog posts, etc. - anything I can get my hands on. Analyzing what's there and identifying what isn't there. Based on this, I come up with little tweaks or initiatives in their current strategy. I'm all about overdelivering at first, to blow them away and present them the big-time value.Landing a freelance client becomes difficult when the focus is too much on your hourly rate, coupled with the actual output.I don't want to be the freelancer that has to defend every 30 minutes he's working on something. I rather focus on the value I create for them. If my work provides them with an additional 20k of revenue, it doesn't matter whether I work on it for 5 minutes or 5 hours. As long as the price they pay me stays the same. That's why charging per project is highly recommended.Then, it's up to you to make them proud.My first project?I built a website for a good friend of mine. Not actually what I aspire to do in the long term, but I helped him. Plus, I got paid for it, so I could satisfy my landlord and I gained valuable experience with the freelancing thing.Start small. Don't go after the big fish.Ask friends, family or coworkers, if you can build, design, or write something for them. For free or small pocket money. The goal is not to make as much money as possible yet. The goal is to build up a portfolio and get acquainted with the freelancer journey. Working together with real clients requires you to step up your game and provide the best value possible. Yet, if there's money to be made, never let it slip.Focus on providing value, and not so much on the output you deliver:Look at their business as a whole and show them other areas they can improve. It shows they can rely on you to find the work needed to be done. For example, I use copywriting to get in contact with clients, but in the initial phase I figure things out:Use this information to decide whether there's more opportunity to jump in. Move back and forth by giving advice on different aspects of their business. Being flexible, knowledgeable highlights your value to your client.By figuring out there are other problems at hand for the particular company, it's easier for me to position myself as an external consultant. This way, I get my foot in the door, and by giving much more value than expected beforehand, I can sell myself to them.Start seeing yourself as the expert you are.Don't get all braggy and stuff, you know what I mean. If not, this approach won't work for you.List all the skills you've acquired over the years, whether those appear to have nothing in common with the business you're talking to now. Know that they've helped you in the past, so they will in some way or form in the future.The fact you're an outsider gives you a fresh perspective. You can look at their business model and activities and give them a refreshing point of view. Plus, being an outsider comes with a certain level of freedom in terms of things you can or can't say.Utilize that.Cheesy, I know.Being a freelancer means you're on a continuous learning curve, the moment you stagnate, your product will decline as well. You're only as good as your latest work.Learn to market your products better. Provide better services. Learn to tackle bigger problems, and you can increase your price. Believe that your work is good enough to justify this and you're halfway there.You have to treat yourself as the business because as a freelancer, you are the business. Invest in yourself the same way as you'd have done in case you had inventory or employees to take care of.Therefore, I have got a confession to make.One of my current projects contains activities and responsibilities that I've never done before. Yet, I'm comfortable that I will be able to nail them. In a way, I oversold myself to this client, but I see it differently.By adding external accountability and responsibility, I know for a fact that I will study harder than I would without having a paid project tied to it. I take pride in the fact that I'm an autodidact and possess a great degree of self-discipline. Yet, sometimes it's nice to apply this extra form of pressure to my development. And, what better way there is, than earning money along the way?This approach isn't suitable for every one of us - I can understand that the risk-averse people among us get cold shivers when they of a situation like this.Being a freelancer doesn't mean you have to do it alone. Join forces and team up with other creators or solopreneurs. Join cohorts or communities. The best way to find those is via Twitter.Approach places like Medium, Twitter, or Quora as a new type of networking event and provide value, help others, and connect with people. Do this for a month consistently and see how many opportunities will arise.I'm a huge advocate of Twitter, and especially within the creator-community, it's a great online place to be. Full of people learning and building in public, elevating and supporting each other, and actually making money (you can find me here).Having an external force of accountability or support network forces you to become better. At least, that's what I'm hoping for you, considering the fact you're reading this article.Having two clients doesn't fully satisfy me yet, I'm hungry for more.Don't get me wrong - I'm not unthankful at all, I just know that relying on two streams of income isn't rock solid. Besides that, I don't want to do client work for 60 hours, even though the outlook on the matching income looks appealing. I want to build my own stuff - digital products, a community, or a cohort and help others. I feel I'm on the right path, but only time will tell if that's the case.The fact you're reading this means you're on the right way as well, keep pushing.I'm on my way to the next ladder and I hope to see you there, but that's a story for another day.Thanks for reading.Let's become friends.

Practical Advice for Leading Your Team through Today's Turbulent Times,"This article is part of a series from the Los Angeles chapter of All Raise providing guidance and advice to startup founders. All Raise's mission is to accelerate the success of female founders and funders to build a more prosperous, equitable future.The stressors of a raging pandemic, political unrest, and reckonings with systemic racism and inequality have pummeled us all in waves over the past year. It is during these turbulent times when people need strong, thoughtful and supportive leadership the most, whether that's at the top of government or at the helm of a company. And that is exactly what women CEO's at some of the best LA tech companies are delivering by offering flexible schedules, covering the costs of childcare and home offices, and supporting employee's mental and physical well being.Here are 5 things every CEO should be doing to support their team right now:During times of unrest and uncertainty, it is more important than ever for people on your team to feel connected to each other and the company's mission and vision. The easiest way to accomplish this is to bring your team together with regularly scheduled virtual meetings.""Since the very beginning, it was important to me to build a company culture rooted in connection and community"" - says Ariel Kaye, Founder and CEO of Parachute - ""With the start of working remote in March, we implemented a Monday morning check-in via Zoom for an informal team touchbase. It's nice to see everyone's faces, share organization updates, and open up the floor to employees to share what's on their mind whether it be about business, current events or a new favorite recipe. I look forward to this time together each week.""This can also be a great time to start new company traditions. When Tradesy had to shut down their office at the beginning of the pandemic, they created a Tradesy Virtual World - ""a set of events, clubs, and support groups that keep us social and connected,"" says CEO and Founder Tracy DiNunzio. A new tradition we've implemented at my company Noun Project is to host virtual get-to-know-you storytelling sessions with 4-5 teammates when new employees join the team - it's been a fun (and enlightening!) way to break up the monotony of the day and get to know our teammates on a deeper level.Outside of virtual meetings and hangouts, teams can also connect around a greater purpose, something that Shiza Shahid, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Our Place, has brought to her entrepreneurial journey from co-founding the Malala Fund. ""We try to learn and grow together through conscious activities including volunteering to feed voters at the polls and hearing from speakers on food justice and anti-racism,"" says Shiza. Her team recently exemplified their commitment to using the Our Place platform for social action by taking over billboards in crucial swing states to drive voter turn-out, showing America's family portrait alongside some brilliant marketing skills.When the world is turned upside down, it is paramount for leadership to communicate openly, frequently, and honestly. People want to know what's going on, and as a leader this is your chance to build long-lasting trust with your team. In the early days of the pandemic, one of the most beneficial things we did at Noun Project was to host weekly State of the Union meetings with our team to share what we knew about the state of the economy, our company's financial health, and our commitment to shouldering any financial losses together as a team instead of conducting layoffs.You should also encourage your team to stay in frequent communication with each other and make sure that text-based communication like Slack and email is supplemented with regular virtual connections. The inability to see each other in person can create a disconnect between just about anyone, and we all know how easily text can be misinterpreted. Now, layer on top of that the external pressures and stressors everyone is experiencing simultaneously, and the smallest of misinterpretations can result in explosive feelings. Seeing each other, even virtually through a video call, provides much needed space for shared stories and human connections, those gems that often get lost in asynchronous communication.Don't forget that what actually bonds people together is not their day-to-day tasks, but the social interactions that are so critical to building a cohesive team. Those little interactions that happen effortlessly around the lunch table or while grabbing coffee require their own virtual space in the work-from-home era. You can encourage your team to share and connect by creating Slack channels like #watercooler (for interesting Reddit finds and weekend stories), #babywranglers (share all the baby pics & parentings tips you want with other parents), and of course #cuteanimals (no explanation needed.)While providing your team with a way to connect is critical to building your internal community, keep in mind that sometimes the news can get overwhelming, especially while trying to actually focus on work. That's why at Noun Project, we created separate Slack channels for #politics, #COVID, and #antiracism. Posting to these channels rather than #general has enabled our team to take a break from the news when they need it, while ensuring they have a community to connect with when they want to engage.As a mom of two toddler boys, I'm keenly aware of the additional challenges the pandemic has placed on parents. Our family has gone from having amazing childcare coverage, to zero childcare, to various combinations of childcare that change week-to-week depending on the levels of the coronavirus in Los Angeles. No parent should ever have to choose between the health and safety of their family and their job security, which is why we've let our employees know that the company will do whatever it takes to support them with a flexible work schedule, including additional paid time off.At Katerina Schneider's health company Ritual, employees get every first Friday of the month off. Parents also receive a $200 monthly stipend to help cover costs like childcare and access to educational resources. Shilla Kim-Parker, CEO and Co-Founder of Thrilling, has also adopted unlimited paid time off for her team: ""If our folks need to take some time to take care of family, or medical issues, or just need a mental break, we trust and support them in making those decisions, and do not want them to feel any financial pressure to keep working. We are very supportive of the day to day needs of those taking care of family at home, or kids, or pets - many on our team will block out time on their daily calendars to walk the dog, or make dinner for their kids."" Shilla says the end result is that the pandemic has actually been the most productive and creative period in Thrilling's history, where ""our employees feel genuinely respected, trusted, and supported.""From the parents who've shouldered the extra responsibilities of childcare, to people whose lives have been uprooted by the inability to connect with friends and loved ones, every single person on your team is currently worried about and directly affected by at least one (if not all) of the current calamities. Most people on your team can use some time off; however, the inability to travel as well as concerns around job security have led to employees not taking PTO days. If you are in the position to do so, try setting a precedent by reminding people of the importance of self-care.At Noun Project, we mandated the entire team to take Mental Health Days during the unrest and protests that followed the murder of George Floyd and while watching the storming of the U.S. Capitol, to provide the much-needed mental space to process current events and reflect/heal. At Tradesy, Tracy encouraged her team to have open dialogues in their all-hands meetings about how stress, anxiety, and isolation is affecting us all, and supported her employees by revisiting their anti-racism efforts, hosting ongoing Town Halls about race, and changing their pay policies to be more equitable. ""We've always had a flexible PTO policy, but we made sure to actively encourage people to take time as-needed,"" says Tracy.Since working from home is the new normal (a trend that's predicted to stay), most companies are helping their employees cover the cost of setting up a home office with an average stipend of $300 to $500 per employee. You can also use what you already have in the office: ""Tradesy went fully remote after the pandemic hit, and we've done a lot to keep people feeling connected and comfortable. We delivered our office furniture to employees' homes for free, and gave each team member a monthly stipend to help cover costs like Internet and office supplies,"" says Tracy.Supporting employees' well being doesn't need to stop there. ""I'm a big believer in self-care so we offer optional yoga or pilates classes online every Wednesday morning at Parachute. This is another opportunity to build connections while we are apart,"" says Ariel.Finally, a critical step in supporting your team (and yourself) is to recognize that it is impossible for people to be focused, motivated, creative, and/or innovative 100% of the time, especially during periods of uncertainty. ""It's important to me that we have a happy, healthy and motivated team, but 2020 definitely brought up some challenges. We tackled these by listening, by communicating that it was OK to not feel OK, and by providing time-off when needed,"" says Christine Outram, CEO of Everydae. While supporting your team by keeping them connected, increasing communication, offering flexible schedules, and encouraging mental and physical well-being is important, sometimes the quickest way to bounce back to productivity is to acknowledge the challenges we face, and give ourselves permission to not be at our best all the time.As a CEO, you can't control the external stressors put on your team by the pandemic, political unrest, systemic racism and inequality. What you can control, however, is the support and leadership you offer through the turbulence. Anyone can lead during the good times - what shows your true leadership skills are the actions you take to guide your people and company through adversity. Today's challenges won't last forever, but how you handled yourself in these trying moments will be forever remembered by those around you.",https://miro.medium.com/max/7382/1*0_W7X8xkcaOdx7EofEbCtg.jpeg,https://medium.com/all-raise-los-angeles/practical-advice-for-leading-your-team-through-todays-turbulent-times-b05ff30adcfa,leadership,dd807e2066b349a8b328723c9a795d1152260e26a903bc83a9ae6fac
Brand Resonance Model: Why Marketers Should Care,"There are so many articles about brand awareness, brand equity, and brand loyalty, but just a few explaining brand resonance or the brand resonance model.Is it because brand resonance doesn't matter? The answer is the other way around.Today, let's talk about brand resonance: what it means, why marketers (and brands) should care, and how to build brand resonance.Think about this: when something resonates with us, we connect with it on a very deep level.Brand resonance is the same. It indicates how well we relate to a specific brand and how intense our relationship is with the brand.We may grow up with that brand. We love it. We want to talk about it and share it with others. It makes us feel good, comfortable, happy, joyful, and even loved. It's the only brand we trust and want to buy/use over and over again.To this point, Disney is an excellent example. You can read what Disney means to Kaitlyn Dorson, blogger at Sisters & Disney, to see how this brand is special to many people.When brand resonance occurs, it means customers feel completely ""in sync"" with a brand.In the book Strategic Brand Management: Building, Measuring, and Managing Brand Equity, marketing professor Kevin L. Keller proposed a model for brand resonance, which now becomes popular in the marketing area.Let me explain this model to you.On the left side of the triangle, Keller defines brand building as an ascending, sequential series of four steps:Notice the order of these four steps, from identity to meaning to responses to relationships. We can't establish meaning unless we've created identity. Responses can't occur unless we've developed the right meaning. And we can't form a relationship with customers unless we've triggered the proper responses from them.As marketers, we need to do something to communicate our brand with customers. We have to teach our customers who our brand is, what it stands for, and why it's unique. We have to give them the meaning of our brand so they can know how much it's relevant to them.Here's the thing: we may tell customers, ""this is what our brand means,"" but they might not think like that. So, everything in this brand development stage depends on customers. They are the ones who are making these decisions in terms of the identity, the meaning, the response, and the relationship.Look at the brand development process from the bottom to the top: all start with fundamental activities, then mindset, then emotions and feelings, and finally relationships, which are much more oriented and behavioral.On the right side of the pyramid is branding objectives corresponding to branding development stages. These objectives are what brands should try to achieve.The first objective is brand awareness. But it's not just any kind of awareness; instead, very deep and broad brand awareness.Then, we set our points of parity where we're similar to others and points of difference where we're different. In doing so, we try to get positive, accessible reactions from customers and ultimately move customers to the resonance level.The center pyramid represents six brand building blocks: brand salience, brand performance, brand imagery, brand feelings, brand judgment, and brand resonance. All these blocks build on top of each other.The next section will dig deeper into these six building blocks.When we say that something is salient, we mean it's important. It really matters.When we say someone makes a salient point, we mean their point is excellent.So brand salience means a brand becomes relevant to us. We know it out there and easily recognize it among others and recall it under various circumstances.Brand salience measures the depth and breadth of brand awareness.Some questions that can help measure brand salience:Brand performance measures how well a product or service fulfills customers' functional needs. It describes product quality, including ingredients and supplementary features, reliability, durability, customer service, style, design, effectiveness, efficiency, and price.Some questions that can help measure brand performance:Brand imagery refers to the way customers think about a brand abstractly. It depends on brands' attempts to meet customers' psychological or social needs.Imagery indicates more intangible aspects of a brand. Customers can establish associations with the brand from their experience or through advertising, or from other sources of information.Read how this customer thought about Harley-Davidson, and you'll know the power of brand imagery.Some questions that can help measure brand imagery:Brand judgments are customers' personal opinions about the brand. They may evaluate your brand in terms of quality, credibility, considerations, and superiority.Some questions that can help measure brand imagery:Brand feelings are customers' emotional responses and reactions to a brand. These feelings can be mild or intense and can be positive or negative.Some questions that can help measure brand imagery:As said earlier, brand resonance describes the extent to which customers feel they are ""in sync"" with a brand.Brand resonance can be measured in terms of four aspects:When your brand achieves this resonance, you can connect with customers in a more profound way and may get the benefit of the doubt.When customers feel resonated with a brand, they'll continue to choose and incorporate the brand into their life.With true brand resonance, you can gain significant brand equity, meaning strong customer engagement and loyalty.That's why a lot of people prefer Mac OS to Windows even though it's much more expensive.As you can see from Keller's brand resonance model, there are four steps to build brand resonance:Easy? Never. It may take you years of trying a lot of things to build a brand and make it resonate with customers. But it's worth every penny.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*Gfs_pWKaxtLXDN-V,https://medium.com/better-marketing/brand-resonance-model-why-marketers-should-care-b9ce257de854,marketing,dde462e30a736a9b2b70e6289eacc63b583432ce3457073329251492
Starting a Freelancing Career Is Not That Simple,"Many people severely underestimate the hard work it takes to get started in a freelancing career. Even those freelancers who've been doing it for a while are guilty of underplaying the effort required.You see, the key to starting a career as a freelancer is to create a product or service that your audience wants to spend money on. And that takes time.The problem is that once in a while, someone gets lucky with their product idea, and after launching it, they are bombarded with great reviews and fantastic income charts that they share in all social media outlets. This causes people to think it's just that easy, but in reality, they got lucky.Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they don't deserve their success. But the reception their ideas get is not easy to reproduce. There is no surefire way you can follow or formula you can reproduce that will yield the same results, 100% of the time.And that last part is something most people tend to forget.Here are 4 of the most common ways successful freelancers say you can start your business today but fail to explain what can go wrong.The formula behind this idea is that you can produce an ebook for free and sell it everywhere, thus turning every penny you make into actual income.The theory is appealing, but do you know what it takes to create an ebook? Because I do, I've written several books and even self-published one of them.Leaving out the fact that you'll be spending a big chunk of your time (which is also worth money) writing it, you'll have to work on:Not one of these steps is easy nor free. However, no one really covers them. It's just ""write an ebook and sell it"" as if it was just a matter of creating a 10 pages PDF file, and everyone would want to buy it.And the worst part is, even after you've finished everything, this does not ensure your book will be a hit. You need a successful marketing campaign before and after publishing it to get the traction you'd want. The problem with that? Unless you work on marketing, not everyone can do it, which means you need to pay someone else to do it.So, an idea that, in theory, meant 100% profit based on no expense is now requiring you to spend, at least, between 500 to 1000 dollars just to get your product out.This is still a great idea. After all, you write it once, and you sell it potentially, thousands of times. However, you need to consider the whole process before jumping into the ""writing an ebook"" bandwagon.This one is very similar to the book idea.The reasoning behind it: you create it once and sell it forever. Even if you sell it at 1 dollar, eventually it'll turn into profit.The problem with this approach is that not everyone knows how to teach. You can't just blurb out a bunch of definitions and expect someone on the other side to understand - even less learn - something of what you're saying.When it comes to creating a course, you have to consider several things:There is a lot of time and effort that goes into creating a course, maybe even more than what you put into creating a book - experiences may vary depending on your own experience.So really, saying that this is as easy as publishing the course and waiting for your income to grow is an insult to people's intelligence.Anyone can create a YouTube channel, but that doesn't mean anyone can live off the income produced by that.Most YouTubers will admit that they need other income sources aside from YouTube because unless you have millions of subscribers actively consuming your content, YouTube doesn't pay much.What do you need to have a successful YouTube channel, then? Let's see:And I could probably add a few more, but you get the point: you need time and money if you want to grow a channel into something with the required quality to start bringing enough viewers in. Just like with the other options, there is no insurance with YouTube. You can buy the best recording equipment, hire the perfect editor and take all the public speaking courses available, and you might not make a single dime because it's not just about the content or the delivery, but also about your marketing strategy.The phrase ""If you build it, they will come"" doesn't work with the Internet. Just because you put quality YouTube videos out there doesn't mean others will find them and like them. You need to develop a brand with a marketing strategy around it and put in the time needed to make that brand known to your target audience.Do you think you're capable of that?This one is my favorite.I get it. I understand the whole 1000 true fans theory and what it can mean for someone trying to build a freelance business. And if you manage to get the email of these true fans, then you're golden.But that's just the theory, how can you find these people? Can you request their email addresses and expect them to give them to you? And what do you do then?These are all topics that are usually not covered by the same people who list ""Create an email list"" as the single source of wealth a freelancer can have.Next time you consider the email list route, ask yourself the following questions:It might seem like an easy thing to do, but trust me, it's not. If you can't nail point #1, you won't benefit from the other two. So make sure you understand how to get people to sign up before you get started.And in case it wasn't clear, point #3 shows that you need a product - or a service - to sell. It's not just about making a list. You need to have something to sell to these people; otherwise, income will never come. So you could say that an email list is more of a supportive strategy to the others listed here than an actual strategy on its own.Starting a freelance career is not easy, no matter how much those so-called ""experts"" advertise it. Yes, maybe they've found a way to exploit these techniques in a way that works for them, but what you're not seeing and what they're not telling you is the amount of work, effort and time spent before they managed to succeed.Just make sure you understand how deep the freelancing pool is - and what it really takes to grow a business - before you make the jump.A 5-day email course with tips on budgeting, investing, and productivity for 20-somethings.

"A day in the life of a woman who lives on the rugged Svalbard Islands, where it's dark 4 months of the year and locals run into polar bears","Cecilia Blomdahl is from Sweden but moved to Svalbard, an island near the North Pole that's the northernmost place you can live, five years ago.By Sophie-Claire HoellerCecilia Blomdahl, 31, originally from Sweden, moved to the rugged Svalbard Islands in the Arctic Ocean with her boyfriend in 2015, planning to stay only a few months. While she fell out of love with him, she fell head over heels for Svalbard and has lived there for five years now.Svalbard is a small Norwegian archipelago that sits about halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Longyearbyen, its largest settlement with around 2,000 residents, is the world's northernmost town.While anyone can move to Svalbard visa-free, it's not an easy place to live. Polar bears outnumber humans, temperatures range from 6.8 degrees Fahrenheit in winter to 42.8 degrees Fahrenheit in summer, and there are 24 hours of complete darkness per day from mid-November to late January.In fact, Blomdahl went viral for a video she posted on how exhausting simply walking a dog on Svalbard can be, from spending 15 minutes getting dressed for arctic temperatures to braving pitch-black darkness in the middle of the day.This got us curious about what life there is really like. Luckily, Blomdahl was happy to give us a glimpse into an average day for her.Blomdahl lives in a cabin without running water outside of Longyearbyen. She said that this is somewhat unusual: Most people spend weekends in such cabins but live in town full-time.She said that she has electricity, as well as some of the fastest Wi-Fi in the world thanks to a fiber optic cable that runs from mainland Norway.Blomdahl and her new boyfriend, whom she met on the island, lug home 5 gallons of water every day, which is what she said they roughly tend to use in a day. There's a water heater in the kitchen, and she says they make sure to use environmentally friendly liquids since they throw used water outside.""You'd be surprised by how easy it is to live without water, as long as you just have the right mindset. The view here is worth so much,"" she said about her decision to live on the outskirts of town without running water.""Now, during the polar night, I'm super strict on my sleeping schedule because if you're not it's just chaos with your brain, because you have nothing telling you when to go to bed or wake up because it's dark all the time,"" she said.Her boyfriend gets up at 5 a.m. for his job in logistics, so she usually has mornings to herself.Grim needs to be on a rope while outside in order to let the wildlife, such as foxes and reindeer, roam undisturbed. Blomdahl said that if a polar bear was nearby, Grim would alert them.Blomdahl is a photographer and videographer, but she also works part-time in the town's only women's clothing store.She used to teach a drone class at Svalbard Folkehøgskole, a local school, but now mostly focuses on her growing social-media presence.She explained that the school is mostly about how to survive in the arctic. ""It isn't like math and science - everyday life on Svalbard is kind of the education,"" she said, adding that it's mostly 18-year-olds from the mainland that come for a year to learn about arctic expeditions and such.As Blomdahl notes in her viral TikTok, even walking a dog is an adventure in Svalbard.First, she checks the weather and gets dressed accordingly. She says it usually takes her around 15 minutes to get dressed, as she typically puts on thermals, a thick wool sweater, expedition pants, a down jacket, hiking boots, a wool buff, hat, and gloves, and maybe ski goggles depending on the wind.Because it's so dark during the winter, she dons a headlamp and dresses Grim in a high visibility vest and blinking lights.Read more: A woman's exhausting TikTok reveals what it's like to walk a dog in the world's northernmost town, where it's dark 4 months of the year and you're likely to run into a polar bearBlomdahl told Insider that outside of Longyearbyen, rifles are mandatory.""If you don't have one, the government will come and yell at you because you're putting yourself in danger,"" she said, adding that she's encountered countless polar bears in the last five years: ""They're everywhere, but we try to do our best to stay out of their way.""She also said no one on Svalbard holds their dog's leash - they attach them to their belts to keep their hands free in case they need to use their rifles. ""If you have a leash to hold on to, and a bear comes, how are you going to handle your dog and the gun?"" she said.She said that this time of year she likes to eat porridge with chia and hemp seeds.""Because we don't get any vitamins from the sun, it's really important to try to put them into your food. I eat supplements, but you do want it integrated into your diet,"" she said.""You just need to drink coffee and keep the spirit high,"" she said.""That can literally go on for like five hours or at least until my boyfriend comes home,"" she said. He usually comes home around 2.30 p.m. and then takes a nap, she said.The gym is currently working with reduced hours as a coronavirus precaution, Blomdahl said, adding that Svalbard has yet to see a case.""We're living pretty normal - we go to restaurants, we go to the gym. There are precautions, but no restrictions,"" she said, adding that there's a 10-day quarantine for most incoming travelers and that the island is doing a lot of testing.""I think we're just taking it so seriously that so far we have managed to not get a case,"" she said, adding that there's a lot of natural social distancing on Svalbard, where people tend to meet outside anyway and are usually bundled up to their eyes because of the cold.Svalbard can't afford to take risks: Longyearbyen, the island's most populous town, has one small hospital with a single room for patients with infectious diseases, according to a local report from March 2020.""When I look at the rest of the world, I don't even know what it means to have COVID in your life in that way,"" Blomdahl said. ""We're very lucky.""Blomdahl lives on a pretty isolated road, with just four other cabins nearby.She describes Longyearbyen as incredibly ""vibrant"" as it's home to around 50 different nationalities, thanks to its visa-free situation. ""It's like a metropolis, people come here from all over the world,"" she said.Despite being small - there's only one main street with a few shops and restaurants and only one supermarket - Blomdahl said she rarely runs into people she knows, and that before the pandemic there were always new people coming to visit.Read more: What life is like on Norway's rugged Svalbard Islands, where anyone can move without a visa""You can never plan your meals out before you've gone to the store,"" she said, because of shipping and weather conditions.""It means that you can have a week without bananas or six days without chicken because everything depends on when the boat comes in,"" she said. ""You'll just find a little note that says 'chicken will be back in three days.'""Groceries are expensive, too. Svalbard has a high cost of living because of its remote location and the fact that everything needs to be imported, but this is offset by a low-income tax and the fact that it's a customs and tax-free area.""Svalbard is in some ways super expensive and in some ways really not. Like if you want to order something online, it's going to be cheaper because it's tax-free. But milk is going to cost you half of your bank account,"" she said.Blomdahl said that she and her boyfriend spend about $900 on groceries a month, no matter how much they try to spend less.Alcohol on Svalbard is regulated by quotas. Blomdahl said that this is an antiquated rule from when there was nothing but coal mining on Svalbard and miners' alcohol intake had to be limited in order for them to be able to do their jobs safely.She said each resident has a little card from the government they must present when purchasing alcohol. ""If you're having a party, you need to get together and buy together,"" she said.While necessities from snowmobiles to sleds to expedition gear can be bought in town, Blomdahl said for ""anything else you go online to buy and then you wait.""While items can arrive in as soon as three days, the timing depends on flight schedules and weather conditions. Sometimes, nothing will arrive for weeks, she said.Blomdahl's boyfriend is a chef and usually cooks some sort of protein with a side of vegetables.Blomdahl said that she usually meets friends for snowmobiling, hiking, or skiing.

13 disappointing photos of van life from my weekend road trip in a camper van,"After spending a weekend in a camper van, an Insider reporter reveals the most disappointing sides of van life.By Frank OlitoWhen it comes to the growing van life movement, reality rarely meets expectations.Before renting a camper van for a weekend road trip from New York to Philadelphia in January, I was expecting a scenic journey with some carefree adventure - that's what I've seen on the van life hashtag on social media for years. But after a weekend filled with mishaps and frustrations, I quickly learned there are some disappointing sides to the van life movement.Here are photos of 13 disappointing moments from my short stint with van life.When I took my weekend road trip, it was the middle of winter, so many campgrounds and parks were closed for overnight parking. Instead, I had to sleep overnight at a Cracker Barrel parking lot outside of Philadelphia in one of their designated spots for RVs.This is a common practice among RVers and vanlifers. Many stay overnight at Walmarts and Cracker Barrels all over the country despite never showing it on social media.I had to park the camper van in one of the RV parking spots at this Cracker Barrel, which happened to be directly across from the restaurant's garbage dumpsters. Unfortunately, a garbage truck came into the parking lot in the middle of the night to collect the trash, which startled me awake.Read more: I spent a night in camper van in a Cracker Barrel parking lot, and the experience revealed a surprising side of the van-life movementI stayed at the Philadelphia South/Clarksboro KOA, which was a large campground in Clarksboro, New Jersey. Although the campground came with full RV hookups, a pool (which was closed for winter), a playground, and a lake, I thought the $60 per night price tag was high. If I planned on staying there for the full month, it would have cost me about $1,800, which is more than I pay for my Brooklyn apartment.Most vanlifers avoid cities and explore national parks and other natural landscapes, but if I was living in a camper van full-time, I would want to go into a city from time to time.I quickly learned that isn't a real possibility. Maneuvering this large vehicle, which was 24 feet long, through city streets was a bit challenging, and finding parking was near impossible.My social media feed is filled with images of vanlifers opening their two back doors to showcase a picturesque landscape. In reality, those people aren't staying there overnight or waking up in those locations because parking there is illegal.When I woke up in the campground, I took a photo of my back view. There was no beautiful beach or alluring landscape. It was just an empty parking spot and an RV.You don't see photos like this anywhere on the van life hashtag.Read more: Social media makes living in a camper van look like the simple life. The reality is a lot more complicated.Before renting this camper van, I knew there were some systems that I would need to learn to turn this vehicle into a tiny house.When the owner gave me a 30-minute tutorial on all the systems, I was surprised by just how much I needed to know. There were buttons all over the van that all had different functions. Under the bench, there was an intricate system of wires and machines that I realized I needed to understand if I wanted the camper van to run smoothly.During my weekend adventure, the heat in the van broke, so it was unbelievably cold. Since I didn't understand how to fix the system myself, the owner told me via phone that I should turn on the burners to create heat. Although it helped fix the temperature issue temporarily, it felt unsafe to keep the burners going for an extended period of time.I was surprised by how much the windows fogged up in the van. Although it wasn't a major inconvenience, I did have to wait for the condensation to clear on the huge windshield before driving each time.Read more: 10 things I wish I knew about van life before spending a weekend in a camper vanNot every camper van has a full bathroom, so when I saw that the one I was renting had a toilet and a shower, I got very excited. When I saw it in person, though, I was disappointed. The bathroom space was smaller than the width of my body, so I couldn't fit inside it without sticking my leg or arm out of the door. It was impossible to fully stand up inside it, and the toilet felt like a child's chair every time I sat on it.Some vanlifers instead go to the bathroom in bottles or use public bathrooms, but the luxury of a bathroom on board isn't too much better.This was the first time I used a composting toilet, and I would never use one again. Whenever someone went to the bathroom, the whole van smelled like a public bathroom for a few minutes. If the scent got too strong, I had to place a pink pod into the toilet, which is meant to mask the smell, but it never eliminated the stench quickly enough.Also, I had to deconstruct the toilet at the end of the weekend to empty it. The process was much harder than it sounds, and carrying a composting toilet to a public bathroom to empty it somehow feels like a demoralizing act.In the camper van I rented, I had to convert the two back benches into a large bed. First, it was difficult to find a place for the large cushions in the van when I had to unfold the platform. Once the bed itself was built, I had to put the sheets on the bed, which was another hassle. Since three sides of the bed were up against a wall, it was very difficult to put on a fitted sheet.For my weekend road trip, I packed a small duffel bag and a backpack. When I put both of those items in the overhead storage bins in the back of the van, all the available storage space was taken. The rest were filled with machines that help the van run, kitchenware, and first aid kits. I couldn't imagine fitting my entire life into the limited storage space even if I did downsize most of my belongings.Read more: I tried living in a luxury camper van for a weekend during the winter, and I'll never do it againFor more great stories, visit Insider's homepage.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2600/0*VdUGG08-snlHvQRf,https://medium.com/insider/13-disappointing-photos-of-van-life-84142e6e54eb,travel,df477010f724461233bae31bd8fea2ec31f911ad400facd852f06f21
Bottomless,"Had her mother not been dying, the visit would have been Will's best homecoming ever. Although just nine, Becky exhibited a maturity that might have been disquieting in a more ordinary family, and she made an excellent companion on Will's tramps in the wild. One morning, Will let her niece lead the way, and she chose an old, familiar route.They crossed a wooden bridge and stepped onto a path leading into the trees. They walked in silence as the air grew dark and the path narrowed. Becky stopped frequently to add wildflowers to her basket, but still managed to stay several steps ahead.Will wondered if her niece felt the same pull into the woods that had drawn her as a child. It was sad that she didn't have a little sister for company - or a cousin, she thought with a stab.Becky clambered down a muddy trail to the stream, and Will followed. They moved swiftly and silently toward their destination and soon found themselves in a clearing where the stream ended in the Bottomless Pool.Will didn't know if she had actually named the spot or if she'd overheard it from someone else, but decades later, ""the Bottomless Pool"" was how everyone in the community knew the deep water hole. It was far from picturesque. The grass was a little greener around its perimeter, but no wildflowers grew there, and Will never saw woodland creatures stopping by for a drink - not even birds, in spite of the profusion of insects.Will and Becky stood close to the edge, looking for anything of interest in the murky depths.""If you dove in, would you come out in China?"" Becky asked. ""That's what Ryan said.""""It's not really bottomless,"" Will replied. ""Just deep. That's why the water looks so dark. I would have to have my scuba gear to breathe, of course. Even then, I probably would just get tangled up in a bunch of weeds and stuff. I wouldn't travel very far at all, and there wouldn't be much to see or do.""""I would like it if it did come out in China,"" Becky persisted. ""Then, if you were on an expedition there, you could still live with us. Just jump in to go to work, and jump out to come home.""Will idly wondered why Becky wanted to consign her to a future of deep-sea diving in China. Then again, maybe her ruined reputation wouldn't follow her there. She felt a mosquito on her arm and smacked it. Its plump body popped, leaving a smear of her own blood.""Okay, kiddo, let's move on before we get eaten alive.""They continued on the path through the forest to a clearing lush with wildflowers - blue gentians, brown-eyed Susans, Queen Anne's lace. Becky began reciting as she gathered the blooms, her voice high and melodic:""There is a willow that grows by the brook, that shows its leaves in the glassy stream...""""That's very good, sweetie,"" Will interrupted. ""I'm impressed. Where did you learn that?"" Of course, she knew.""It's Ophelia - one of Mr. Shakespeare's girls,"" Becky said. ""Gran tells me everything,"" she added, as though sharing a secret.""Does Gran tell you your future?"" Will probed.""Uh uh. Not so much."" Becky's face clouded. ""Just 'in your darkest hour, you must never give up.' She says that a lot.""""Oh."" Will saw the strained look on Becky's face and felt a flash of anger toward her mother. ""You don't have to worry about that, Beck. She's talking about herself - not you. I guess this is her darkest hour, because she's so sick.""An uncomfortable silence grew between them.""That's not right,"" Becky finally said. ""Gran's going to the light. It gets brighter every day. Don't you see it, Aunt Will?""Will did see it, she realized with a jolt. She just refused to believe it - like so many things. She pushed the thought away.""You're right. Gran's going to heaven to be an angel,"" Will said lightly. ""She's going to the light. So no more talk about darkest hours, okay? No more sad stuff.""Becky's eyes narrowed. ""Don't you get it?"" she blurted. ""Gran knows stuff. It's a warning, and it's for us. It's important. For cripe's sake! She knew you wouldn't listen!""Becky stalked away, leaving Will utterly perplexed. I have to get her out of this place, she thought. She hoped it wasn't too late.Will's immediate plan of action was to keep Becky from being alone with her grandmother, ever again. So she joined in the ritual bedecking with flowers that afternoon, waiting apprehensively for Cora to say something unacceptable to the child. Will was ready to pounce with her only weapon - her scientific logic.She was a little deflated when Cora contrived an excuse that sent Becky from the room after a cheerful, giggling fifteen minutes that ended with the young girl all smiles and the old lady working hard to cover up her fatigue. Will felt a moment of tenderness for her mother, and the accompanying flow of guilt over her own stoniness.""Do you remember Copernicus?"" Cora asked.""Sure,"" Will said.""Your first death. You were inconsolable."" Copernicus was a muscular orange tabby whose favorite sleeping arrangement was on top of Will's feet. He had kept them toasty warm.""Then your father - """"Please don't,"" Will said. Any guilt she might feel over speaking rudely was overwhelmed by the threatening tidal wave of anger and grief she had been holding at bay for years. She wasn't about to let it come crashing down now.""You didn't shed a tear. Not in public, anyway. My guess is not in private, either - am I right?""Will turned away and went to the window, where she could look at anything that would allow her to tune out the conversation. Sunlight glancing through one of the hanging crystals fractured her face into prisms of colored light.""That was when you stopped loving me,"" Cora said matter-of-factly.""That's not true.""""I have been patient with you, daughter, but I'm running out of time,"" she said sharply. ""I wanted you back, but I'll settle for you present. Now stop working so hard to shut me out for a minute, and pay attention.""Okay, this is it, Will thought. She's going to say it anyway, so I might as well get it over with. But she stayed at the window.""You have to take Polly and Becky home,"" Cora ordered.That was it? Her dying pronouncement? Will turned toward her mother. Her anxiety evaporated, and she saw her for the confused old woman she was. She walked over to the bed and tentatively picked up her hand and held it in her own. It was an awkward gesture, but it helped Will feel in control again.""They're here, Mother. We're all here.""With unaccountable strength, the old lady squeezed Will's hand until it hurt.""None of us is home,"" she hissed.This is Excerpt №8 of The Darkest Eyes by Mick BradyRead previousRead nextStart at the beginning",https://miro.medium.com/max/4000/1*7nJicjSxSU6QaXCqTzIZhw.jpeg,https://medium.com/an-idea/bottomless-3eafe8675b3d,fiction,e1b04e92daa573ad3c9c9e8dec04707de4d7e1887c0fbe26b490083e
How to Plan With People Who Don't Like to Plan,"To me, planning is a fun part of life - what's better than figuring out how we'd like to spend our time, and then turning those desires into reality? - but I know that, oddly enough, not everyone shares this love.I was reminded of this recently when I listened to an episode of the Best Laid Plans podcast, a show all about planners and planning, in which the host, Sarah Hart-Unger, addressed a question from a listener named Erica: ""How do you encourage others to plan, or is it futile? Asking for my husband.""The short answer, Hart-Unger noted, is that for the most part, it's futile. You can't really make people do things they don't want to do. With friends who seem allergic to committing things to a calendar, the most you can really do is can shrug and enjoy their company when you do run into them.With a partner, though, it's a different matter, especially if there are kids involved. Erica is not alone in having a spouse who refuses to plan. Fortunately, there are ways to plan with people who don't like to do it - especially if you emphasize the benefits which we planners know that even a spontaneous sort will see.In the context of family harmony, the fact that someone doesn't like to plan doesn't matter much. As grown-ups, we do all sorts of things we're not naturally inclined to do because they make our lives run smoothly. And non-planners with complex lives are almost always already benefiting from a planning process.""If there's somebody that says 'Oh, I don't have to plan, I'm doing bigger things than that,' they're probably having a ton of planning done for them by others,"" Hart-Unger said in her podcast. She calls this an expression of ""planning privilege"" - the non-planner can believe that babysitters just show up when you need them, that family members and friends get seen regularly, that vacations just happen, and that children's weekend schedules are naturally coordinated to ensure that multiple children get to simultaneous playdates and soccer games on time.That's fine if everyone agrees to this family division of labor (or if the work is done by a paid personal assistant). But if the planner feels resentful that their work is being treated as if it's magic, then they absolutely need to speak up.Raising this issue doesn't require a fight, though. As Dale Carnegie once wrote in How to Win Friends and Influence People, you can often convince another person that a change is their idea, or at least to their benefit. In his words, you can ""arouse in the other person an eager want.""The key is to recast the concept of planning. Many people resist making schedules ahead of time - particularly in their nonworking hours - because they assume that scheduling is only for things they don't want to do. But many wonderful activities require figuring out logistics in advance. Eating at a favorite restaurant might require reservations (and childcare). Attending a sporting event might require getting tickets and arranging a work schedule to allow for the possibility. In Covid times, safely seeing friends outside means planning around the weather.To shift someone's thinking, you might bring up something you know they want to do, but haven't been able to. Sample script: ""I know you've been missing going for long bike rides on weekends because we've been so busy with all the kids' activities. If we make a weekend plan ahead of time, we could probably work it out for you to ride and for me to run with my running group too.""Even if the non-planning person wants to spend their free time doing nothing this, too, requires planning in a busy life. That's because ""doing nothing"" often means autonomous hours spent relaxing and not being responsible for kid requests and the like. So you might try this script: ""If we think through this weekend ahead of time, we could trade off, with each of us getting a few hours to ourselves to do whatever we'd like."" Mention that you really like to anticipate your fun, and you suspect that your non-planning family member might too. They get to look forward to doing hours of ""nothing!"" Yep, it's a plan - we just don't need to call it that.Of course, even if the other party recognizes the benefits, non-planners often find discussions of details and logistics tedious - meaning they'll put those discussions off until they're no longer useful. So the second tactic is to promise to keep planning time to a minimum.I'm a big fan of a weekly planning meeting of 30 minutes or less. Both of you get out your calendars. You talk through what's coming up and divvy up responsibilities. You talk about fun future things you'd like to arrange and assign any logistics. And then - this is key - you don't talk about logistics and plans until the next meeting, unless absolutely necessary. This lets the planner relax because he/she knows there is a time for working out all details. And the non-planner doesn't have to worry that any of the other 167.5 hours of the week will turn into a discussion of calendars.There may still be some grumbling, but so it goes. No one likes to relinquish their privilege, ""planning privilege"" included. The grumbling will lessen over time. If not, you can always offer this option: The party that refuses to be part of household planning has to be okay with whatever the other party comes up with. Sometimes this can be enough to nudge an anti-planner into the game.",,https://forge.medium.com/how-to-plan-with-people-who-dont-like-to-plan-e360a92cd683,productivity,e1f8749dc99b537a9903b62e64be91374c5f5fa206ecfb3dda965212
A Fun Way to Keep Your Memory Sharp,"Memory slips loom larger as people grow older. Forgetting why you walked into a room, or what you were supposed to pick up at the store can provoke nagging anxiety - not to mention dark humor about impending decrepitude.If your next search for the car keys sets off such thoughts, keep in mind two reassuring facts. First, some loss of memory is completely normal. Second, there's a simple, enjoyable technique that can minimize age-related decline.The specifics vary from person to person, but the idea is the same: Change things up.""As adults approach retirement age, they come to a fork in the road,"" says Michael Yassa, PhD, director of the Brain Initiative at the University of California, Irvine. ""You've been intellectually and emotionally engaged for a very long time. You can choose to cease that engagement, or you can plan a rich retirement filled with activities.""We see clear differentiations in brain function for those who get out and about and do lots of new things, as opposed to those who decide to stay at home and watch TV.""The comfort of settling down into a predictable pattern may be enticing, but the brain craves stimulation, says Dana Boebinger, a neuroscientist and PhD student at Harvard University and MIT. ""In order to keep your memory sharp,"" she reports, ""you have to do exciting, interesting, challenging stuff.""From a scientific perspective, memory can be broken up into three components: encoding, the act of absorbing a piece of information into our memory system; storage, the process of retaining the information; and retrieval, getting the information back into our conscious awareness. The normal aging process can slow, or inhibit, each of those steps.""In general, memories are a compressed version of reality,"" says Yassa. ""With age, they're even more compressed. You lose a lot of details. You may remember what happened, but not when and where it happened.""This compression is even seen in short-term memory: ""In the laboratory, we have individuals look at images that are similar (but not identical) and ask them if they're the same thing they've seen before,"" he says. ""Older adults are more likely to say, yes, it's the same thing. That suggests their initial encoding of the memory was not at the highest level of detail.""Yassa emphasizes that, unless a brain is diseased, these changes tend to be subtle, and don't impair a person's ability to live a normal life. Indeed, some types of memory loss - such as having the name of a person or object on the tip of your tongue, but having trouble retrieving it - are common and nothing to worry about.The time to be concerned - and see a doctor - is when you experience ""a pervasive pattern of decline over time,"" he says. ""The mild forgetfulness we all get as older adults is perfectly fine.""But if you wish to remain as sharp as possible, he recommends creating ""an enriched environment"" by engaging in activities that involve ""a little bit of physicality and a lot of social interaction.""Granted, ""social interaction"" can be a challenge during a pandemic, but there are many high-tech ways to stay in touch with family and friends. And those hours spent at home can be utilized in brain-boosting ways.""Learning new dances, a new language, new skills - all of those are incredibly valuable"" for people who are approaching, or have reached, senior-citizen status, he says. The combination of novelty and light exercise is ""a kind of fertilizer that surrounds brain cells with nutrients.""Whenever we encounter something unexpected, it prompts the release of dopamine, which is ""very good for the brain,"" according to Yassa. Sabina Brennan, PhD, an Irish neuroscientist and psychologist and author of the book 100 Days to a Younger Brain, agrees. ""Novelty is a critical element of neuroplasticity, the human brain's amazing capacity to adapt and change across the lifespan,"" she says.""Stretching yourself a little, doing things beyond your comfort zone, or pushing yourself into situations that require you to cope with challenges will change your brain chemistry. This will impact positively on your mood and your brain function.""This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective: noting and retaining new information enhanced humans' prospects of survival. But how far must we stretch ourselves before we see results? Are small shifts sufficient, or should we try something radically different?Yassa admits there is little research on that specific question, but he agrees with Brennan that a key factor is whether the new activity elicits positive emotions. ""I think people have to go out of their comfort zone a little bit, but not so far out of their comfort zone that they get frustrated,"" he says. ""If a novel experience such as switching from reading one genre of book to another is exciting and interesting, it's a winner. If it's frustrating or annoying, it's not going to be beneficial. If you're a musician, you may not have to learn a new instrument - just learn new pieces all the time, or perform in a different group.""Both Yassa and Brennan have another, somewhat surprising recommendation: Participate in activities that stimulate as many senses as possible. ""This is what we instinctively do as children,"" Brennan bemoans. ""But, alas, when we go to school, we are discouraged from touching, tasting, etc. Actively engaging your senses can play a powerful role in embedding memories in your brain.""For example, cooks who experiment with a different cuisine will expose themselves to unfamiliar smells, which tend to linger in the memory. ""The olfactory system evolved together with the memory system of the brain, so it has direct access to it."" Yassa says. ""It's very privileged! Olfaction is one of the most powerful stimulants for our memory system.""Indeed, in a recent New York Times essay, neuroscientist and best-selling author Daniel Levitin, PhD, revealed that, as part of his effort to keep his memory sharp, ""I go to new parks and forests where I'm more likely to encounter the smells of new grasses and trees."" He also samples new artisanal chocolates whenever possible, stimulating both taste and smell. That recommendation should not be a hard sell.Trying new podcasts - Brennan has one called Super Brain - could also provide valuable stimulation. In addition, she endorses an everyday behavior that will be novel for many of us: staying mindful.""Our ability to form memories for recent events does appear to decline with age,"" she says. ""But in many instances this might not be due to failures of memory, but rather failures of attention. If you haven't attended to where you put your keys then you can't encode the memory, and it is pretty much impossible to recall a memory that wasn't encoded.""So, to keep a sharp memory as we grow older, the key steps are clear. Be present. Stay physically active. Keep challenging yourself, in fun, engaging ways. And above all, stop that internal chatter that says, ""I'm really getting old.""""People who classify themselves as older and who expect memory to decline with age actually perform more poorly on memory tests,"" Brennan says. ""You can shape your brain not only by the actions you choose to take, but also by the way that you think about and approach life.""That's good to remember.",https://miro.medium.com/max/11520/1*5tEnopkRnW8LT0m_LsaCuw.jpeg,https://elemental.medium.com/a-fun-way-to-keep-your-memory-sharp-5977de7e53fe,neuroscience,e2c6e758cacb08d134633fa049e38192ab86189c0e7d3496f70b2269
Should We Write Off Family Members For Their Political Views?,"I can always rely on my mother for her unwitting contribution to my blogging content. I could write for days about her odd behaviors and emotional baggage and the challenging nature of our relationship. I have periods where I cut off communication with her for my own sanity. I haven't spoken to her in several weeks after a disagreement. Last night she sent me this random text message:Her words don't shock me at this point. The last few years have proven that her mental stability and grasp on reality are compromised, but this message struck me as odd. She seems to have things entirely backward. I can't even pretend to find any sound reasoning in this if I would ever want to.It is no secret that the relationship I have with my mother is tumultuous at best. The last four years have proven to be a catalyst in my choice to remove toxic family members from my life. Yet, lingering guilt still surfaces as I reflect on my choices. Where do we draw the line when it comes to how family members behave?It seems transparent enough. We wouldn't tolerate bigoted, racist, hateful behavior from people. However, we tend to accept deplorable behavior from our family in the name of ""love"" or loyalty. Blood ties tend to come with a set of blinders, where we continually look the other way when our loved one behaves in a problematic way.The political climate under #45 has brought forth a barrage of people we likely knew existed but were kept in the shadows by a decades-long shift in American prowess. We had fought long and hard to abolish racism, bigotry, homophobia, and hatred. While these battles were far from won, the once emboldened fringe societal members who held ugly and hateful ideals were pushed back into darkness. Or so we thought.My Grandfather was a card-carrying Republican, a longtime member of the NRA, a Fox news enthusiast, and a devote Catholic. He fit the right-wing stereotype perfectly. I often ponder over the very likely possibility that if he were alive today (he passed away in 2011 after a brief battle with cancer), we would not be on speaking terms. I wonder how a man so kind, gentle, and giving to every person he encountered, could hold alliance to ideologies so vile in nature.Having very little cultural perspective and residing in the same small town she was born and raised in, my mother aligned her political viewpoints with the men in her life. She chose the side of my grandfather, and while never one to hold much interest in politics, turned into a different beast all together come 2016. She proudly shared that she registered to vote, for the first time in her life, to cast her ballot for Trump.Over the last few years, I have listened to her spew all the typical Trumpisms and Fox news headlines. She regurgitated all the cliche' propaganda and lies. Despite my best efforts, she refused to listen to reason and dismissed all my attempts at providing her with facts.She never hid her contempt for Barack Obama. She was repeating the things she had heard from my grandfather or the right-wing media. The nature of the hatred she felt for him was glaringly obvious: it was because he is black. At one point, she even told me that my grandfather had begun to refer to him as ""[the extremely hateful and derogatory word used to demean black people]-in-chief."" After hearing her say this, I gave her several choice words of my own, hung up, and didn't speak to her for months.While I didn't hide my feelings towards her views, I attempted to avoid the topic of politics altogether. I knew where she stood on things, and I had no desire to go down that road. Inevitably she would bring up two topics that we would never see eye-to-eye on: politics and religion. I think that she genuinely enjoys riling people up and causing a fight.Unfortunately, we don't get to choose our biological family. We are born into a group of people, and as children, we unknowingly assume that these people are good and kind. They mold our thoughts and behaviors and impact the type of adult we become. Only when we become adults do we fully see the truths that we couldn't see as children: our beloved family members can be some pretty awful humans.Some will defend bigotry and hate as generational. Baby Boomers are being constantly ridiculed, and whenever someone behaves poorly, they are quickly labeled a ""boomer."" Sure, things were different during their time. Intolerance, segregation, oppression, racism, and sexism ran rampant. Yet, history has long proven that just because something appears normal in society, doesn't mean it is morally acceptable.Defending deplorable actions from those that we love are emotionally daunting. It is dissonant and in conflict with living a peaceful life. When we endure bad behavior in our relationships, it slowly deteriorates us. We are left questioning our truths, even though we know that truth and ethics should always prevail. It isn't our responsibility to bear the burden for our family members; to carry the weight of their hateful words and actions, all in the name of honoring our blood.I haven't replied to my mother's text. I don't intend to. I plan to continue living my life surrounded by people who are committed to living morally and decently. People who can see the facts, who learn and grow, and admit they may have not always been on the right side of history, but that they are committed to ensuring that they are from each day forward.I can't deny the lingering loss I feel from shutting out members of my family. It hurts to let go of people you love. I wish I could call up my mother to tell her good news or cry to her when things are bad. Yet, the pain and conflict that came with that relationship outweighed the good. I can lay my head down at night knowing that I made the best choice for myself and my daughter and that I stood up and spoke out against hate - even if that hate came from someone I love.As I write this, I am watching on television the Inauguration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., our 46th President. I feel a wave of pride and relief washing over me. A light dusting of snowflakes falls on the crowd standing before the Capitol Building. Music plays, and smiles are visible in the eyes of the masked group. It is a drastic contrast to the Capitol several weeks ago, stormed by Trump-incited, violent insurrectionists who left destruction and chaos and several dead.The beauty in humanity seems visible once again, and I am reminded that goodness will prevail when we stand up and speak out.

"""It's insane that we can't get these masks to the people who desperately need them.""","The family-run business DemeTech is a medical suture maker based in Miami that pivoted to manufacturing N95 masks in response to ongoing shortages of protective gear for frontline medical workers. Despite sinking tens of millions of dollars into new equipment, navigating a nine-month federal approval process, and ramping up production, DemeTech has not been able to secure enough buyers to sell its surplus of 30 million N95 masks.As The New York Times reports:There are myriad reasons for the domestic sales and distribution conundrum, including ongoing competition with Chinese-made masks and general lack of awareness of newer American-made mask manufacturers. Hospitals are used to certain medical supply distributors and are wary of testing out new masks. Online ad giants, like Facebook and Google, were also banned from advertising N95 masks early on in the pandemic to prevent profiteering and to ensure enough masks for frontline medical workers. As a result, regulators may soon have to intervene, per the Times:In recent days, health experts have been more vocal about upgrading to medical-grade masks in an effort to slow the spread of new coronavirus variants.Read the full story below:Further reading:",https://miro.medium.com/max/12758/0*vfo4TkCNsUrGUgEx,https://coronavirus.medium.com/its-insane-that-we-can-t-get-these-masks-to-the-people-who-desperately-need-them-6cca30bbc9a0,science,e5a86dad660129f8b941019e31bcf5fbcdbc7baeb9925a8076ea443f
Is Your Organization Racially Illiterate?,"Five questions to ask to assess the status of your organization's diversity and inclusion programsby Charles Barrett AdamsWeekly - and sometimes daily - I find myself in an awkward position: breaking the news to company leaders that, while they've implemented some diversity, equity and inclusion efforts into their organizations, they likely aren't as racially inclusive, committed or ""woke"" as they think they are.These are leaders who are used to - and expected to - measure and track performance, achievement, revenue and/or impact goals, but aren't sure how to go about the new, or at least newly highlighted task of tracking the success of newly instated DEI efforts or measuring and evaluating the ever-shifting racial climate within their organization. So, I see and welcome the many well intentioned leaders who have done some amount of work to try to level the playing field under their purview.Many of them have made a concerted effort to hire more Black and Brown employees, they've stood up a Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) committee, and they've started recruiting at a broader array of colleges, including historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).So, when I suggest that there's more that could be done, they're eager to take the next steps necessary to make their organization better and ask, ""What should I do?"" or ""What might we do?""Here are five questions I started asking to help them consider the big picture of racial literacy within their organizations - and uncover how they might be able to do more. It may seem like an insurmountable task to tackle all of the facets and dimensions of work focused on equity, racial literacy and the seemingly overflowing bucket of DEI at once, but they must remember that building an inclusive and racially diverse organization requires a team approach and a lot of repetition, practice - and is completely worth the work.Question 1: What is the makeup of your leadership team?Given the fact that there are only three Black CEOs at the helm of Fortune 500 companies (and 37 women - only one of whom is Black and is a recent addition to that group), it's obvious that there's a racial (and gender) gap in corporate leadership. In the nonprofit sphere, Black people make up about six percent of organizational leaders, according to this 2017 Battalia Winston report.For context, the Black population in the United States is more than 13%.The disparity is clear. And the odds that your organization also lacks diversity in its positions of power is high. Paying attention to your leadership team is especially important for leaders of organizations who have higher overall diversity numbers, yet the people of color tend to be concentrated in lower-level positions.In addition to examining your leadership team, review your managers in the organization. Take a look at the board members. And review those in the organization who have been recently promoted, received public or organization-wide recognition or earned special awards.While you're at it, why not review salaries and tenure? Are they equitable? Are people who hold the same position and have similar years of experience earning the same amount? Or, is there a difference between what men, women and underrepresented team members are receiving? It may be time to take a holistic look at your compensation and benefits, and then set benchmarks and predetermined salaries based on position and responsibility, not identity or ingrained presumptions about race.Question 2: Do you proactively provide a time, place and space for people to discuss racial interactions at work?When you consider this question, what do you notice? How do you feel? Do you feel resistance? Or are you already aware that your workplace is no place for discussing racial tensions and interactions?Discussing race at work feels uncomfortable to us because we're often taught from a young age to avoid these conversations at all costs. However, I argue that noticing and processing these interactions is imperative if you're interested in building an inclusive, diverse and sincerely committed organization.At Lion's Story, we believe this willingness and ability to successfully name and then discuss racial interactions is how people and organizations build ""racial literacy."" Just like you'd learn any language that's foreign to you, developing a racial literacy requires practice, relevant tools, and a willingness to forge ahead when it gets difficult or you're feeling discouraged. Do note, both of those may happen.Not talking about something, we all know, can have a long-term negative impact on our psyches, not to mention our physical health. This is especially true for your Black and Brown colleagues. Time and time again, research shows that people of color feel they can not bring their whole selves to work, especially when their organization is largely comprised of white colleagues.In fact, according to Being Black in Corporate America, a research report by the Center for Talent Innovation, Black professionals are ""nearly four times as likely to encounter prejudice as white professionals are (58% vs. 15%) ... [and] Black professionals in the West and Midwest are even more likely [to experience prejudice], which could also be due to lower Black population levels in those regions. Without as much exposure to Black people, colleagues have fewer opportunities to correct for stereotypes they've picked up.""It's important to note that examples of prejudiced behavior aren't always obvious or blatant - these less seemingly noticeable actions are considered ""microaggressions"" and can create a toxic environment for your Black colleagues:· Telling a Black colleague they are articulate or ""talk white""· Not making time to mentor Black employees or junior staff· Stating you're not racist, are ""color blind,"" or have Black friends or family members· Telling a Black colleague he or she is ""not like other Black people""· Asking a Black colleague to weigh in on Black-centered issues and cultural norms or explain them· Using inappropriate and racially charged language or telling race-based ""jokes""These microaggressions add up; 30% of Black employees are more likely to leave an organization than their white peers. Not only does this cause a potential PR or, possibly, legal issue for an organization, it's also incredibly costly.All that said, not talking about race and race-based interactions is a mistake no matter how you look at it. Not only should leaders prioritize and set up ways for employees to communicate with one another for goodwill, equitable opportunities and because it's the right thing to do, they should prioritize the practice to ensure continued (and increased) profitability and growth.Question 3: Similarly, do managers and leadership talk about what's happening in the world as it happens?George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Walter Wallace, Jr. Ahmaud Arbery. #BlackLivesMatter. Systemic racism. Storming the Capitol. The rise of white nationalism.Are you talking about these things and the current state of our country as a leadership team and then addressing them as they occur? Is your leadership team taking the time to host town halls, listening sessions or release statements on each of these historic headline news items to publicly support Black people and denounce the ugly underbelly of racism in America? Are you sidestepping the obvious and downplaying the most serious examples of racism and white supremacy?According to research from Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, between 2015-2020, the percentages of Black Americans killed by police, sadly, stayed steady. The findings, which were published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Public Health, show that Black people were killed at 2.6 times the rate of white people.These are things that need to be acknowledged, addressed and given the time and space they warrant. Similarly, on the other hand, outside of the short 28 days of February, are you taking the time to celebrate Black people and their achievements? These are markers of growth and building blocks of victory felt by the Black community - and space should be provided for reflection.Question 4: Do you hire for ""fit?""In the past several years, organizations, of all sizes and across industries, have touted cultures that hire for ""fit."" The job descriptions go something like this:""We're looking for ambitious, smart go-getters who share our commitment to excellence, customer service, and are fueled by caffeine. While skills are important, we believe that the right person can learn the tools needed to be successful in this role, but you can't teach fit. For that reason, we are hyper-focused on selecting the right candidate who will seamlessly join our team and share our penchant for impromptu meetings over coffee, an occasional happy hour and an appreciation for a casual dress code.""What's the problem here? ""Fit,"" for a mostly white workplace, may connote sameness and, ultimately, in many cases, lead to a team that's singularly white.Not only does sameness - of color, of gender, of preferences and of motivators - set up a homogeneous culture, it's more likely to make your organization less competitive than others who focus, instead, on true diversity.""The case for establishing a truly diverse workforce, at all organizational levels, grows more compelling each year,"" writes Vijay Eswaran for the World Economics Forum. ""The moral argument is weighty enough, but the financial impact - as proven by multiple studies - makes this a no-brainer.""The article cites research from global consulting firm BCG, which found that ""companies that reported above-average diversity on their management teams also reported innovation revenue that was 19 percentage points higher than that of companies with below-average leadership diversity - 45% of total revenue versus just 26%.""It's really a win-win - you're doing the right thing and being rewarded for it.Question 5: Does your diversity, equity and inclusion program include ongoing opportunities for training, discussion, learning and skills development?It's estimated that 74% of organizations nationally have DEI programs in place, but how effective these programs are remains unclear - and there is certainly a need for a cohesive, strategic change management effort to ensure real impact is made organizationally.That is, it's one thing to have a DEI program in an organization - but if it takes the shape of an annual online tutorial with a self-paced quiz at the end, it's not doing enough. Here's a few things to consider:To make true progress in diversity, equity and inclusion requires an ongoing, well-funded and results-based effort that works its way purposefully into a company's culture. In the best case scenario, DEI work becomes woven into the fabric of an organization - and employees, managers, and leadership understand the expectations of themselves individually and collectively to support its goals. And, when individuals betray the DEI mission, they're held accountable for their actions.Moving towards racial literacyUrgent action is needed, to be sure, but it is important to think strategically about how to implement some real changes in the system. In reality, current systems will require leaders who aren't afraid to tear them down and start from scratch if that's what it takes.But it all starts with a conversation, and then the intention is supported by ongoing dialogue, be it uncomfortable or not. Learning how to develop racial literacy within your organization on an individual and team basis is a necessity, not a nice-to-have.About Lion's StoryWe help nonprofits, small and large businesses, government entities and community organizations across the nation learn, develop and use the skills to have productive conversations about race.

Strategies for Ethical Decision-making,"When designing a building, an architect uses a methodical process to draw up blueprints that illustrate the structure from several points of view and explain how the building will look when it's finished. A similar process should be used when making ethical decisions. By following a series of steps, you can examine your options from different points of view. As a result, you'll reach ethical decisions that you can explain and defend.A typical process for ethical decision-making includes four steps: gathering facts, identifying stakeholders, recognizing consequences, and prioritizing values.Gathering facts - Decision-makers begin by gathering facts. Information about a decision-maker's alternatives may come from reports, news sources, conversations, or interviews.Identifying stakeholders - Stakeholders are people who have an interest in the outcome of a decision. To choose the most ethical alternative, the decision-maker must identify all the people who will be affected.Recognizing consequences - Decisions have consequences. Decision-makers should ensure that they recognize how decisions will affect all stakeholders.Prioritizing values - Once decision-makers have examined the consequences of their decision, it's time to decide on a course of action. Decision-makers may find that different solutions to the problem support competing values.Consider a chain of fast-food restaurants giving away small, inexpensive toys with each children's meal. The chain contracts an independent consumer's group to test each toy and ensure that they're safe for small children. Recently, the chain's marketing manager learned that the plastic egg-shaped packaging for the newest toy has caused injuries to six children at different stores.The marketing manager must decide whether the company has an ethical obligation to recall the toys. He's been advised to gather all the facts, identify all the necessary stakeholders, recognize the potential consequences of each decision, and prioritize the company's values.Gathering facts - The marketing manager collects production and shipping reports to learn how many of the toys had been made and shipped to restaurants. He refers to sales reports to estimate how many had been given away. Finally, he interviews restaurant managers to learn about customer complaints.Identifying stakeholders - The marketing manager lists the people and groups that would be affected by his decision. Departments in corporate headquarters would have to participate in a recall. Restaurant managers would have to execute the recall. Parents of children who had received the toys would also be affected.Recognizing consequences - The marketing manager evaluates how each solution would affect the company and other stakeholders. For example, he calculates the cost of recalling the toys, and he projects the number of children likely to be injured if the toys were not recalled.Prioritizing values - The marketing manager prioritizes the values by ranking the importance of each:You may already be contemplating a current ethical dilemma in your workplace. Now that you know the appropriate steps to making ethical decisions, you'll learn how to use them when faced with an ethical dilemma of your own.Gathering relevant information about the issue helps prepare decision-makers to evaluate the usefulness - the utility - of their options.There are some traps to avoid when gathering information. Decision-makers must avoid selective information that supports only one point of view. They must also be careful to focus solely on the facts at this stage, not opinions.Decision-makers now need to identify the internal and external stakeholders who'll receive the benefits or incur the costs of the decision. It's usually easy for decision-makers to identify these stakeholders as they can simply use the company's organizational chart and ask questions of colleagues.It's more difficult to identify stakeholders outside the organization. Decision-makers might identify some external stakeholders from the facts they gather, but they also need to think more broadly. For example, they could check people or groups who have a history of complaining about the company's actions.After decision-makers have gathered facts and identified stakeholders, they must recognize the consequences of their actions. Although they can deduce some consequences on their own, others will be identified by stakeholders.Decision-makers should also judge whether the benefits and costs of their decisions are distributed fairly to stakeholders. Once the consequences have been realized, decision-makers must prioritize the importance of competing values.In general, ethical decision-makers give a higher priority to values that support important relationships. If decision-makers ignore relationships, their decisions may produce unforeseen reactions from stakeholders.The word ethics refers to the values a company shares with its employees, customers, suppliers, and even competitors. When decision-makers consider ethical questions, they should examine those questions from many perspectives.The decision-making steps are gathering facts, identifying stakeholders, recognizing consequences, and prioritizing values. Following these steps can help decision-makers examine ethical questions from appropriate points of view.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*HyBODDjTxyUf29fpj9n_Zg.jpeg,https://medium.com/loud-updates/strategies-for-ethical-decision-making-5c3ccc8afc23,leadership,e7cb0d4c9f01ea72f3d60e11f705620b7367fa051aed86c2ada95faa
AI Hypothesizes What Is At the Bottom of the Sea,"A few weeks ago while scrolling through social media, I came across a fun fact that totally shocked me:This was crazy to me and left me wondering about all the possibilities of what might exist at the bottom of the sea? In that 80% of unexplored territory? What creatures have we yet to discover? I fantasized about sea dragons and giant megalodons and who knows, maybe they do exist down there. But I wanted to take it a step further than just fantasizing about these creatures. As someone who is fascinated by the possibilities of computer science and AI, I decided it would be interesting to take a computational approach to hypothesize what these sea creatures might look like.In order to achieve these goals I had to learn some new machine learning concepts:GANs are a machine learning model that are used to map the distribution of data. So, for example, all faces have a relatively similar distribution of features. They have two eyes which are above one nose and one mouth, etc. When it comes to my sea creature project I was curious to see what features the AI would pick up on since the distribution of data for a fish vs a jellyfish vs an eel would all be a bit different.GANs are made up of two competing neural networks: The Generator network and the Discriminator network (or adversarial). The generator takes in random noise and returns an image. This fake image is fed into the discriminator along with real images from whatever dataset it is being trained on. After processing an image, the discriminator returns a number between 1 and 0 showing the probability of the image being real. 1 is real and 0 is fake. If the picture the generator creates gets a probability of 50% (0.5) or higher from the discriminator, the generator has officially fooled it. The goal is for the GAN to reach equilibrium, where the generator's fake images are indistinguishable from the real ones by the discriminator, and the discriminator has no choice but to randomly guess whether an image is real or not so it returns 50% (.5).At the start, both neural networks pretty much suck at their jobs. But over time they continue to learn by being in competition together. Just remember, in this competition both neural networks have different goals: the discriminator is trying to maximize the number of images it gets correct while the generator is trying to minimize that amount.Neural networks were developed in the 1950's in order to simulate the network of neurons in a human brain so computers would be able to interpret information similarly to how a human would. Neural networks are comprised of anywhere between dozens to millions of these simulated neurons, called units, which are arranged in a series of layers.The first layer is the input layer, which unsurprisingly receives the input. The output layer predicts the final output. And sandwiched between those two layers exist the hidden layers, which perform the majority of the computational algorithms in neural networks. Most neural networks are fully connected, meaning that they have connections to the layers on either side. In the diagram above the connections are represented by arrows. These connections each have a weight, which is either a positive or negative number. The higher the weight the more influence one unit has on another.A neural network learns by having patterns of information fed into it through the input units, which triggers the hidden units, and ultimately ends up at the output units. This is called a feedforward network. When the input from the left unit is passed on to the next unit to the right, those units are multiplied by the weight of the connection the input traveled on. Each unit adds up the input it has received and if it adds up to a certain threshold value the unit triggers the unit on it's right. Through a feedback process called backpropagation, the neural network is given feedback based on it's expected output and the actual output it produced. It then takes this feedback and makes adjustments to the weights of the connections, and keeps making these adjustments every time until eventually the expected output and the actual output is the same.If this learning process by minimizing margin of error seems familiar, you are correct! The generator and dicriminator in the GAN architecture are both neural networks.The last concept I should explain before moving on to the code is Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN for short). DCGANs are an extension of the GAN architecture that incorporate deep convolutional layers to extract specific features from the images in a power efficient way. You can see the convolutional layers clearly labelled in this diagram:DCGAN architecture used by Radford et al. [1] to generate 64x64 RGB bedroom images from the LSUN datasetThese make the GAN more efficient by having every neuron in the layer scan a different part of the image and extract features, instead of having every neuron scan every pixel. The more layers you stack together and use, the more complex the features that you extract will be. It's really helpful to make a GAN more efficient because these machine learning projects often take many hours, even days, to run.This was both my first time using PyTorch and Jupyter Notebooks. Figuring out how to use both of these was very difficult and required a lot of trial and error and surfing Stack Overflow for hours in search of help! But eventually I got both of them working together and followed a PyTorch DCGAN tutorial from the PyTorch website to generate celebrity faces.It was then time to input my own dataset. I had to change a few aspects of my code since the sea creature dataset was a bit different from their celebrity faces dataset. I've never done a coding project however where I haven't run into at least a few errors so this was totally expected.First I comprised a dataset of 500 sea creature images. I pulled these off the internet and added them to a folder. I then resized and centered all the images.An important thing to note about these images is that they all have a black background color. If you look back to where I went over my goals for this project I mentioned wanting all of my images to appear similar enough that it is clear they are a part of the same project. I did this by making their backgrounds the same color, black. This also helps the actual image of the sea creature to stand out.For the rest of the code you can follow the PyTorch tutorial. There were a few lines I had to change but overall it was nothing big. I did run my image dataset through a for loop to generate each of the image in various orientations and add them back to the dataset so that it would have more images to train on. Generally the more image you can train your model on the better the results turn out.Once the images were generated I chose the best ones (a lot were just random color splotches). The ones that I liked I ran through an online image clarifier so they would be higher qualitity.Now... on to the part that you've all been waiting for...Tada! At first glance this little sea creature might look a little strange but I definitely see a pair of eyes, a mouth, and two flippers. I can definitely picture it existing in the ocean.These were two separate pictures but when I saw them I immediately drew the connection that they would be of the same species.This creature looks like a fish to me. I love it's vibrant colors!At first I was disappointed by this image because I couldn't picture how it was a real sea creature. I thought it was too abstract. But through further observation I realized on the right side of this creature there seems to be some kind of tail. It may be strange but it still has recognizable features. Furthermore, I realize there are so many other sea creatures that we think of as normal because they have already been discovered but are actually really weird looking: sea urchins, star fish, jellyfish, etc. Nature is full of surprises.I have no idea what this creature is but it is totally cool!So pretty!These aren't all!

I Ate Nutella Mixed With Cheese,"Step 2 in my new life as a digital nomad is Mexico. Specifically, Playa del Carmen. After three weeks in Lisbon, it's a radical change. I really liked Lisbon, but now I feel like I'm finally where I'm supposed to be. I feel at ease when it's hot outside and the water is never far away.After a good morning's work, I felt like taking a walk. I like to walk just for the sake of walking. I can put one foot in front of the other for hours at a time, going as I please. But I also like to have some kind of goal.This afternoon, I was on a quest for food. I roamed the streets looking for the street vendors of Nutella mixed with cheese.Marquesitas are not sold in fixed points. That's what made my quest exciting.This treat is sold by street vendors. I had found information online. Most often, they are located between 15th and 20th avenue, crossing 8th and 10th street. That's about right above the center. It's easy to find your way in Playa del Carmen. It is a straight city, made up of grid streets. There are no turns other than 90 degrees.At 3 pm, I was outside in the heat, rocking my shorts and t-shirts, happily sweating. I was in a quest for food. There's almost nothing that makes me happier - especially when it's food that I've never tasted before. Or, even more interesting, some food I never thought to try.That was the case with Marquesitas.Marquesitas are crispy rolled pancakes filled with Nutella and Edam cheese. This is the most common version, along with the cajeta version, which is a kind of caramel. But they also exist filled with chocolate or jam. They have about the consistency of a waffle. But drier, and rolled.I would never have thought of associating Nutella with cheese. I was extremely intrigued by the mixture. Especially since it's a popular dessert here, mainly eaten in the evening, while walking around town. I had to try one.I walked for miles looking for these street vendors, without seeing any. But I didn't want to give up. I knew they were around, and I was determined to find them.Suddenly, as I crossed two streets, I saw one. It was free of people, and the word ""Marquesitas"" was displayed in bold, colored letters. I was thrilled.The man put some dough between two pans placed on a fire and turned them over several times. I watched his movements with attention. I didn't miss a crumb of the preparation. The sun was shining on my back, while the heat from the pans warmed my face.After a few seconds, he opened the jar of Nutella and spread a large spoonful of hazelnut pasta over the pancake. Then he grated some Edam, a lot in fact, and sprinkled it on the Marquise. I was surprised by the quantity. All the more so when, after rolling it, he put some on top, and even stuffed the end of the roll with it.He put it in a cone, with a towel, and went around his stand to hand it to me.I gave him 40 pesos, less than 2 dollars, thanked him, and went to sit in the adjoining park to try this stuffed, sweet, greasy thing that excited me so much.I took out my GoPro to record that moment. The recording's going to be fun to watch: the moment I bit into the hot pancake, it crumbled and I covered my forearm, my shorts, and my shoes with shavings of grated cheese. You can see the result on the floor in the photo above.After laughing at myself, the taste spread in my mouth. The two flavors blended perfectly. There was the sweet, burning taste of Nutella, with the comforting, salty kick of the cheese. Both melted and mixed in my mouth, the salt of the cheese making the sugar in the chocolate soar. The crispness of the pancake added a bit of dynamism to the whole. It was terribly good.My only comment would be that I would have liked to taste a little more the Nutella, which was perhaps a little concealed by the amount of cheese. I plan to try some more, from other vendors, just to see how different it tastes. Maybe they'll put more Nutella on it?It was simple. It was cheap. It was weird.But it was raw happiness, a raw taste of life. Food makes me so happy. I could literally travel the world merely to try as many different dishes as I can.If you ever get the chance to try Marquesitas - you're more likely to find them in Yùcatan since it's a specialty here - don't think twice about it. Nobody worries about calories, sugar, fat. Just order one.Whether you like it or not, you have to know what it is. To me, it was like a warm cloud of happiness melting in my mouth.Receive 5 free tips to unlock the next stage of your life!Sign up for our new newsletter to stay informed with up-to-date curations from our editors:👇",https://miro.medium.com/max/3872/1*zWwO8iwli8i_RP5EO7EUTg.jpeg,https://medium.com/world-travelers-blog/i-ate-nutella-mixed-with-cheese-fc641b938578,travel,e8ec7824c81a402f41b8b5411a698f5f14dcf24f69a9d4bde9171c66

And fast forward today, it has raised Series B funding at an evaluation of $1 billion. Clubhouse had 600,000 users in December 2020 and has crossed the 2 million mark in January 2021.The platform has attracted entrepreneurs, startup founders, venture capitalists, journalists, and many celebrities.Clubhouse is an audio-based social networking platform - free from photos, videos, and texts. It is an exclusive application.The application is available only on iOS as of now. Another evidence of its exclusivity is that it is invite-only. To join the application, you need an invite either from existing users or from Clubhouse itself. But you might have to wait an eternity to receive an invitation from Clubhouse.Once you join, you'll be asked to choose from a variety of topics. Clubhouse will then recommend individuals and rooms based on your interests.You can create/join rooms dedicated to specific niches/topics of your interests. You can exchange ideas, listen to experts, connect with others through the app. Every room has speakers, listeners, and moderators.The excitement and hype cannot be understated. Clubhouse has had the likes of Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah, Kevin Hart, and Ashton Kutcher who have joined the platform.While Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Oprah Winfrey are hosting conversations on the platform, Clubhouse has become the buzzword.Also, the reason behind keeping the platform invite-only has served its purpose. People are pretty much interested in joining the platform so that they don't miss out on the opportunity to be a part of the next big thing.People have started looking for opportunities to monetize on the platform. Clubhouse might bring in a creator program for people to monetize, benefitting not only the creators but the app itself.Discord is another social networking application that has been around for quite a while. Discord was released in the year 2015. It has been valued at around $7 billion.Discord is mostly used by gamers for real-time communication will fellow gamers. The focus is on real-time conversations. It is not something where you set up a topic for conversation or discussion in advance. Instead, the conversations are spontaneous.Clubhouse, on the other hand, has the trust of many celebrities. You can find rooms hosted by your favourite celebrities. The content on the app is more like the podcasts.The big players can co-exist if they keep innovating and look different.Clubhouse is on the way to become the next big thing. There has been a rapid growth in the user base that wasn't anticipated. Clubhouse has to keep up the growth and has to maintain its exclusivity at the same time.Over the years, we have seen social networking sites bringing the same features as that of other social networking platforms. Snapchat brought in the concept of disappearing stories. But later, Instagram, Facebook, and even LinkedIn introduced disappearing stories.TikTok, a video-sharing social-networking platform helps users create short videos and share them with their network. Later, Instagram too introduced Instagram Reels with similar features.Twitter already has plans to take on Clubhouse. Twitter will start testing voice chat rooms later this year. Facebook also isn't very far behind. Facebook has plans for a Clubhouse-like platform.Content moderation has already started haunting the team. With unchecked conspiracy theories around COVID-19 spreading on the platform, Clubhouse is learning it the hard way. Though CEO and co-founder Paul Davidson said moderation is a top priority.It will be interesting to see how Clubhouse deals with the challenges and whether it will make be able to make it big.",https://miro.medium.com/max/9000/0*jBd3JuZ7HW2xmGYX,https://medium.com/the-shadow/silicon-valley-startup-clubhouse-is-deemed-to-be-the-next-big-thing-da23a26929f7,social-media,e9f2698beefc1e54f94673d50b265380baf68e3085a2297dc1443aed
Half-Life Alyx theory,"If you haven't played the game (or seen the ending), you better stop right here, as the following contain spoilers.After finishing Half-Life:Alyx, the role of G-Man became clear to me and all pieces simply fell in place. This theory may not explain every bit of the Half-Life plot, but it will let us understand the basic concept behind it. If you are expecting a 100% realistic answer you may be disappointed, as this theory has a more abstract approach. If you're familiar with David Lynch, you'll feel right at home. The quotes below are from G-Man at the ending of Half-Life Alyx. Here it goes:The G-Man: He represents Valve, the story writers and developers, those who decide the future of Half Life. He's the tool via whom stuff happens in the Half-Life universe. If for example a DLC needs to me made, G-Man will do what's necessary so that the game has a plot and a reason for existence. He's the cog between Valve and stuff happening inside the game.You can hear him admit this:""Some believe that the fate of this world is inflexible. My employers disagree. They authorize me to nudge things in a particular direction from time to time"".If you think about it, whenever a new Half-Life game has to appear, G-Man does his magic on the background. For example, he's the one who wakes up Gordon Freeman. His employers are Valve and the game developers.Gordon Freeman: He used to represent the player. All players playing the game connected with the Half Life universe via Gordon's eyes. Between Half-Life 1 and Half -Life 2, 6 years elapsed. During this time, Gordon was in a ""hibernation state"" .When Half-life 2 began, his consciousness (us, the players) is brought back to life.Gordon served the series well, but after HL episode 3, the series went on a halt. Valve worked on lots of prototypes with Gordon that led nowhere and got canceled.This is why G-Man says:""A previous hire has been unable to perform the tasks laid before him""""We have struggled to find a suitable replacement. Until now""After 13 years of effort, Valve turns to Alyx for the protagonist of a new game. And she seems to be suited for the job. She's much more than what they originally thought. And hence Half-Life Alyx comes to life.""You are aware that you've proven yourself to be of extraordinary value"".Indeed, Alyx managed to bring back Half Life from the dead.Alyx asks a favor from G-Man. She wants the Combine off earth. G-man can twist the plot a bit, but he can't do this particular favor because the Half-Life series would cease to exist.""That would be a considerably large nudge.Too large, given the interests of my employers""The interest of Valve is to make new Half Life games. If the Combine are gone, there would be no interest for a new game. So, Alyx asks to save her father. This is a nudge that can be made by G-Man. Valve has no issues with that, as it would push the plot forward and create an opportunity for a new game.So, what about the vault where G-Man was trapped? I think that it represents a place with no time or space as the game is concerned. It's like a simulation, closer to the game engine and the developers. If this was Matrix, it's where the architect would be.Until the next game is released, G-Man hibernates Alyx as he used to do for Gordon.Subject: Alyx VanceStatus: hiredAWAITING ASSIGMENTSo probably the next game will be with Alyx??",https://miro.medium.com/max/5122/1*Jg38MZH1b5tMo9f5OH_LSw.png,https://petrakeas.medium.com/half-life-alyx-theory-b2c2fbb43a10,gaming,e9fb192625413aebdd1b428b79184cae9d039b8e3bcb2e185c947855
Alzheimer's Will Steal Your Mind,"The elusive brain-destroying illness refuses to be detected, but new research may have found a few clues to its discovery years before symptoms appear.The thief begins its work early in your life. No one knows how early the work begins, but it is constant, relentless, and devoid of effective impairment. Without our awareness, it is systematically stealing that which is most precious to you - your memory.A warning about its inception and progress came from Dr. David Snowden in his groundbreaking study of cloistered nuns in Minnesota. Snowden developed a hypothesis for early learning and education as a move against the memory-killing intruder.As assessed by biographical sketches they wrote earlier in life, Snowden's perspective regarding early cognitive ability was again found in later research.Without biomarkers, neuropsychological tests such as The Boston Naming, The Trail Making Test, The Blessed, Clock Drawing Test, The Dementia Rating Scale, The Bender Gestalt, ADAS-Cog, and the more involved Halstead-Reitan and the Luria Nebraska Neuropsych Battery have traditionally been used to diagnose Alzheimer's and a variety of other neurological disorders. As an aside note, it has been said that Luria noted that it would take five years to learn to administer his test adequately.But none of the tests is an absolute diagnostic, and only on autopsy can a somewhat definitive diagnosis be made. Here, too, experienced pathologists have misdiagnosed SDAT with CJD. The latter is a highly infectious disease.The testing also takes its toll on persons with dementia who may become frustrated and have little patience to perform tasks that elude them. One woman I watched as she was tested used her humor to try to get by. Her incredibly patient aide tried to coax her with a promise of lunch after the testing was completed.Asked to name the city in which the testing was being administered, the woman responded, ""Why, dear, don't you know?"" Her face lit up with a big smile as she asked the question. A former college professor, she had problems with the most basic question, such as her own birthday.The search for a more robust, definitive means of diagnosing Alzheimer's has been in existence for decades. Brain banks have been set up (what does morphology really tell us?), and gene banks with samples from Alzheimer's patients' relatives are collecting bits of the puzzle. But the puzzle is far from anywhere near fully formed, and the search goes on.Where are we now? According to the researchers, one drop of blood may hold the answer to an extremely early diagnosis of future Alzheimer's - 30 years in the future. Do you want to know you're destined to get a debilitating disease that results in death with no cure or effective treatment?Ah, yes, you live in the hope that a ""cure"" or an effective treatment may be created within that timeframe, but what if this doesn't happen? Do you want that test? Would you want a death sentence hanging over your head for all of those 30 years? Better not to know? Questions that present only more questions, and yet they want you to take the test. It's similar to families of Huntington's disease.The blood test is based on the belief that beta-amyloid is the culprit in Alzheimer's, but some research questions that conclusion. These plaque formations have been found outside the brain, so why think it's the reason you develop Alzheimer's? Prior research has indicated aging, a weakened blood-brain barrier, bacteria, and a virus could be involved in creating an Alzheimer's damaged brain. Even fungal infections have been viewed as having a possible relationship to SDAT.Bill Gates pledged $100 million for the detection and possible cure of Alzheimer's. The investigation is serious because the world's aging populations will mean exponential increases in healthcare, even if we discount the human misery associated with it.Longevity may mean a long and happy life for a family, but it also brings concerns that must be faced. We know that many older individuals want to remain in their homes, which underscores the need for more in-home care. Others will require a greater degree of assistance in nursing homes for their daily living, increasing the need to pay for this care. To whom will it fall; family or government?Early detection, cure, and/or treatment for Alzheimer's isn't simply science being successful, but a more normalized life for everyone.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10944/1*uUY2gdDBDomEGW9Pme70vg.jpeg,https://medium.com/beingwell/alzheimers-will-steal-your-mind-a3b7b3242aa,neuroscience,e031bc15ee99b9531b11f888c13d0bf848161f322ae75f57cead1d6e
What I've Learned in One Year of Freelancing,"It's hard to believe it's really been a year since I started writing as a job. I've been telling stories forever, and when I published my novel in 2018, I never expected it to spark a full career. But here I am, in 2021, a full-time writer and the author of six published titles with more on the way.How the hell did I get here? I've got to say, it isn't easy. There's no ""you won't even feel like it's work!"" feelings for me. Freelancing is definitely work - it's grueling and annoying at times, and will occasionally make me want to scream at the sky in frustration - but oddly, despite all that, it's turned out to be work I happen to enjoy a lot.It feels reminiscent of how I feel when I'm acting; it's hard work but it's worth it, in the end, to see what I've created. Even when I'm writing about things I don't have much passion for, the actual act of writing itself is fun for me. I consider myself extremely lucky to have found a career I can love like this.Essentially, my motivation for freelancing can be boiled down to one thing - flexibility. I wanted to do all the things people generally talk about when they float the idea of becoming a freelancer; I wanted to set my own hours, be my own boss, set my own wage, and decide my own workplace. I was planning to move, and wanted a job I could bring with me. I wanted a job I could bend to my schedule rather than having to bend to someone else's constantly.Initially, I hadn't considered freelancing to be a viable career path for me. Who wants to read my ramblings? I considered myself average at best. It wasn't until I worked on an unpaid project (a fan project for a YouTuber I liked) that I discovered that, much to my surprise, people really did like my writing, and more than that, I liked the work.I discovered that I was capable of turning out high-quality pieces that people actually liked and wanted more of, and were willing to pay for. I eventually stumbled across Upwork, I can't remember how anymore, and from there, I was on track.I've already written about avoiding scams on Upwork, but I haven't really talked about how I use the platform productively for work.The clients I've worked with on Upwork are frequently more than willing to continue working with me directly after our contract is up. This has helped me build a network of clients that understand and can vouch for the value of my work.It's also an excellent portfolio builder; your Upwork profile is structured around proof of value in the form of previous work and client testimonials. There are sections to show off your education and other qualifications, write a short bio about yourself, and set a public per-hour work rate.Upwork is an excellent space for managing multiple projects at once. Its job journal is perfect for keeping track of when you're working and how much you're earning, as well as when your set-payment contracts are due.It's also got a brilliant messaging system that makes it easy to keep in touch with your clients when you need to give or get information from them quickly.It hasn't all been perfect. Freelancing isn't as easy-breezy as a lot of entrepreneurship blogs would have you believe - you're going to fall on your face occasionally. I definitely have.Because I was applying for work all the time, I would occasionally have multiple contracts come up at once. I've definitely overloaded myself and caused a drop in productivity because of that many times.I've had to learn to accept only the work I know I can dedicate all of my time to. While some projects might have been extremely lucrative, that doesn't mean I would have been able to give them the attention they deserve. I'd rather be turning out quality work than a huge quantity of work.Once in a while, I still get pulled into too-good-to-be-true projects. The budgets look great, the clients are nice, I do the work, and suddenly I'm ghosted. It's not that I'm doing anything wrong, necessarily, it's just that, sometimes, bad judgment calls happen.I've learned a lot from my encounters with faulty contracts - I've written about them extensively - but they still hurt when they do happen. The best I can do is get up and try again, reading the fine print a little more thoroughly the next time around.Now we come to the part of the article everyone clicks in for. How can I do what you're doing? How do you get into freelancing and make it work? What's your secret?!I don't have one. All I've got for you are common sense tips to keep you from getting stuck or swept away in the overwhelming sea that is freelancing.Yes, you are your own boss! You get to set your hours! Work on what you want, when you want!You still have to work. You do still have to put in the hours. This is one of the hardest parts of freelancing to me. I'm not good at keeping a consistent schedule for myself, and that means that having a lot of projects with different deadlines working at the same time is a bit of a logistical nightmare for me.I keep track of my work using a couple of different things.And I mean everything. Every penny you spend and each one you earn, where they're going, when they get there, who sent them, the color of your favorite pen, everything. Write it all down and make it easily accessible. Have backups of your backups' backups.Trust me when I say that when tax season comes around and you're scrambling for information, having a budget document will be a lifesaver. I use the Annual Business Budget Tracker from Intuit Quickbooks to keep everything in one place.No matter how much you love it, doing the exact same thing all day can be exhausting. It's a good idea to have a variety of work available to you to rotate through so that you can keep your creativity going without exhausting it all in one go.I tend to try and take on a variety of projects, from article writing to website copy to game writing and more. I also make sure to take time for my personal writing, such as on my blog and on Medium, as well as my other fiction and poetic works.You can't undersell your work. I know it sounds cliche but I have to reiterate - you absolutely do not have to drop your rates to rock bottom to get good projects, and you do have negotiation power, especially if you have an edge in your niche.You are talented, and people are paying for that talent. You're also working hard, and people are paying for that work. Don't ever let someone devalue your time and effort because of a perceived lack of experience. Your work has worth. Period, the end.Originally published at https://www.catwebling.com on February 7, 2021.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*9fKmqS6CZlwb8vWe.jpg,https://medium.com/blankpage/what-ive-learned-in-one-year-of-freelancing-32c8f5235e7a,freelancing,e47febaf04812355ec102e036f8251be03e9275890d573054f657b55
Understanding UX: A brief introduction to the concept,"How many times have you heard the term user experience design being thrown around loosely? Yet, the result is a few poorly sketched up designs without any user participation or feedback. I wrote this article at my current company in an attempt to bridge the gap between the disciplines about this commonly misused concept. I strongly believe that everyone that provides a service or product to a customer, regardless of role, should at least have a basic understanding of what the concept means. So here goes.UX or User experience includes all aspects of the end-users' interaction with the company, its services, and products (Don Norman and Jacob Nielsen, 2006). To achieve an exemplary user experience the following must be considered. Firstly, to satisfy the exact needs of the customer. The golden rule of user experience is to understand the end-user and design with her needs, expectations, and ambitions at the center. Secondly, design with simplicity and elegance in mind to produce products that are joyful to use. True user experience goes far beyond giving customers simply what they ask for and ending the delivery once the customer considers the solution to be good enough. To achieve a high-quality user experience in a company's offerings there must be a seamless merging of the work performed by the different disciplines, for example, UI-design, UX-design, frontend, backend, project management, etc.McKinsey & Company published The Business Value of Design in 2018, a report that aims to investigate how design impacts revenue and shareholder returns. McKinsey tracked the design practices of 300 publicly listed companies over five years. The senior business and design leaders were interviewed or surveyed, and more than two million pieces of financial data and 100,000 design actions were collected.The report presents that firms that embraced UX-design generated 32% more revenue and 56% more shareholder returns during the five years. The results applied to the three different industries examined: Medical technology, consumer goods, and retail banking. Implying that the importance of useful design remains regardless of industry type.Evidently, well-designed user experiences result in organizational profits which highlights the importance of having designers with the required competencies. Giving UX tasks, sometimes unintentionally, to individuals who might lack UX education, experience, expertise, or natural talent, is a short-sighted strategy that can lead to poor productivity, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Nobody would want an inexperienced developer to code solutions for a customer, because we understand that it would lead to drawbacks from a long-term perspective. So why do we assign UX tasks to people that lack competence? It relates to the first misconception about UX, ""They just draw boxes on pages, how hard can it be?"".The mindset ""UX is just drawing boxes"" entails the assumption that anyone can do it. However, the wireframing phase of a formal UX design process only describes a fraction of the work performed. To draw boxes, the designers first need to research the area of interest with the purpose to answer questions like, who are the users? What motivates them? What are their pain points? And what do they need? These questions can be answered by conducting formative research. There is a wide range of various research techniques, but two that are commonly used are primary and secondary research.Secondary research is often, despite the name, performed initially by examining existing data such as previous work, and case studies of similar work. The secondary research serves the purpose to build a foundation whereas questions arise regarding the user group and context of use. Then, primary research is done to validate the insights gathered and to complement any uncertainties derived from the secondary research. The primary search includes conducting user interviews and surveys to truly understand the users and how to efficiently design to satisfy their needs. This is especially important since every project, use case, and customer is different. Therefore, the research needs to be adapted to the specific case.A common misconception regarding UX is that it revolves around the user interface (UI) design. There is no educational overlap between a degree in UX and UI. A person who is great at UX might be a poor artist and vice versa. UI plays a key role in delivering a great user experience and studies show that a beautiful user interface makes the user more friendly and permissive to bad UX. But what is the difference between UI and UX? User interface design is a strictly digital term, it is the point of interaction between the user and a digital product. Unlike UX that covers the full experience, as presented above, including everything from the delay in loading data to the ability to carry out a task in the interface. UI design covers all the visual, interactive elements of an interface, such as typography, spacing, color schemes, etc. The goal of UI design is to visually guide the user through the interface, it's about creating an aesthetically pleasing interface while ensuring that the design choices are consistent and coherent.We just distinguished UI and UX, another misconception is that UX is directly translated to usability. Although usability, much like user interface design plays a key role in the total user experience, is simply a fraction of the broader concept of UX. Usability is a quality attribute that describes how easy user interfaces are to use and can be defined by five quality components (Jacob Nielsen, 2012).Usability is nowadays recognized as crucial to the success of an interactive system or service. A system that users find too difficult to learn and operate will most likely be underused. The worst-case scenario is users that are forced to use a poorly designed system due to their current working methods. Ultimately creating frustration and reduced productivity, work satisfaction, and costs. A usable system should support the user's preferred way of working, thus allowing for customization, and should follow the quality components mentioned above. Providing a service to a customer that exhibits an inadequacy in any of the quality components, greatly improves the risk of losing that customer to a competitor that offers said qualities. Delivering a technically genius solution becomes irrelevant when the user cannot successfully use the system.User experience design is not a one-time happening, and launching a product or feature is not the end of iterating. UX is a never-ending loop of attaining user feedback and tweaking accordingly. So, the next time you are implementing a feature, take a moment to ask yourself ""Is this what I personally think is the best solution, or what the end-user needs?"".I hope that you enjoyed the reading.

How I Keep Myself Swimming in Freelance Work,"All too often, I see freelance writers bemoaning a lack of work. Why? I have freelance work running out my ears. I'm swimming in work. I have too much work. I have a waiting list and I'm turning down projects. Frankly, I have enough work that it's become a problem and I'm overworking myself. So why isn't that the case for every other freelancer out there?I'm nothing special. I'm a good writer and a professional freelancer (ie, I don't leave clients hanging and I meet deadlines; I'm also flexible enough to meet individual clients' needs), but I'm not a wildly outstanding writer. I'm not writing for high-paying, high-profile publications. Most of my work is for small businesses and small publications (by choice).So what am I doing that's different? Here's what I can gather.I think this is one of my biggest strengths as a freelance writer. I'm not picky. I'll write about just about anything and I'll write for just about anyone. Seriously. One of my very first gigs was writing online profiles and marketing copy for call girls. Someone's gotta do it.What I am picky about? Money. I won't take gigs under a certain amount. I have my limit. Otherwise, anything is fair game. You want me to write it? I'll write it. I know that being picky means, often, being poor.You cannot rest easy as a freelancer. You can't become comfortable in whatever you're currently making. You never know when a client is going to go belly-up. I just this week had one client that was routinely paying me $1,000/month lose one of their clients, which means they no longer needed me to work on their behalf.But if you're constantly pitching and constantly looking for new work, you'll never run out. Even now, when I literally freaked out this afternoon because I'm not sure how I'll do all of my work scheduled for next week, I'm still trying to get more work. Because I know that's a better boat to be in, than the no-work boat and I know I'll figure it out. Something always falls through and then too much work becomes just enough work.My habit is to...This results in me, often, getting around 3-5 new gigs or assignments per week. On top of my regular, reoccurring work, as well as my wait list, that leaves me in a great spot.Okay, so this gets me into trouble. It gets me into trouble often. But where it doesn't get me is out of work. I'm always saying ""yes"" to clients. Even if I don't immediately know how I'll get something done, I'm always saying I can, because I know that I really can get it done. I might not know how currently, but I'll sure as hell figure it out.So, the next time a client proposes a scary, new-to-you project, go ahead and say ""yes."" Have a little faith in yourself and your skills. You'll figure it out.(Disclaimer: Don't say ""yes"" to something you literally cannot do; I do not say ""yes"" to design work, for example. Do say ""yes"" to things you're just somewhat scared to do.)If you want to be a high-volume freelancer and you want to have a continual flow of work, there's one thing you're going to have to do: you have to put efficiency over effectiveness on occasion. That means not every single piece is going to be a work of art. Sometimes, you'll have to churn out a so-so piece if it means getting your client all of the work they need, when they need it.It also means that you have to pay attention to how you work and then you have to ""hack"" your work style. If you work best in the morning, work more in the morning, even if it means dragging yourself out of bed and to your desk at 5 a.m. If you know you can't focus with others around, it means making sure you always have a solo spot to work, every. single. day. It means putting your work style first and not making any apologies.That's literally it! Now, keep in mind that I've been freelancing full-time for more than two years. So, if you're just starting out, you may have to tweak my ""always pitching"" schedule and do quite a bit more pitching at first; you might also have to take a lot more work that you don't want to take, for a lot less, until you build up a client base and portfolio.However, if you put in the work, you, too, can be swimming in work. Of course, that also depends on if you want to be swimming in work. Some freelancers don't prefer this work style and that's fine. Just don't complain when you don't have any work in your pipeline.Holly Riddle is a freelance travel, lifestyle and food journalist and copywriter who dabbles in fiction.

Love Apptually - The Dating Game in the Age of AI,"As Valentine's Day approaches, I wonder how many of you are flirting with the idea of watching Love Actually. I won't have time for my one of my favourite romance movies as my husband surely has a candle-lit dinner planned (hint, hint).But that's ok. While I'll miss Hugh Grant dancing through the halls of №10 Downing Street to Jump, I'll gladly avoid reliving Emma Thompson's character's heartbreak - it kills me every time! If only she'd had artificial intelligence to help pick her beau...The business of online matchmaking is a hugely profitable one, with an estimated value of around £3 billion. It's growing fast too, with new entrants to the market every year and a soaring number of people choosing to meet a significant other this way. It's no surprise that to remain competitive, the biggest players are turning to the hottest couple in town for help: AI and big data.If the likes of Bumble, Match and Tinder are to outstrip their rivals, they have to better understand users' dating preferences. Today's love-hunters are much more particular about what they need and want from a relationship. The problem is, they're less willing than before to put in the work.Taking the burden of the search off the user, dating apps collect an abundance of personal data before leaning on artificial intelligence to do what humans can't do quickly enough - analyse it. Once the data is analysed, they're deployed in various ways, for example, it is used to:There's even a completely voice-operated dating app called AIMM, which replicates the intimacy of a human dating service. Its AI chats to users for a week to gain a good understanding of how they select a partner, subsequently selecting potentials, making introductions, and coaching people through the whole process. It takes users from an initial phone call through a face-to-face rendezvous and then onto follow-up. I'd say that's about as personal as matchmaking gets without involving an actual human, no?Of course, many of the features noted here are totally irrelevant right now, with Covid restrictions sadly clipping the wings of would-be lovebirds all over the world. But it won't be long before they're able to spread those wings and fly to each other, gripping red roses between their...beaks?By the time life is back to normal maybe dating apps will have access to way larger and richer stocks of data - after all, we have spent a great deal of our waking hours online in recent months, and that's where the data is collected. Put simply: the more data there is, the more artificial intelligence can do for singletons.I think the capabilities we've seen so far are merely the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we can hope to accomplish using AI in this area. In the future, artificial intelligence could move beyond all of the above towards matches influenced by data-based insights gleaned from interactions with smartphones - such as assessing swipe patterns, conversation initiation rates, message response times, and so on.However, for those on the lookout for love, what we have at the moment - which is pretty impressive in itself - will just have to do. If you want to find the Martine McCutcheon to your Hugh Grant then sign up to the app that makes the most of artificial intelligence. Let me know how you get on.For now, though, I'm off to drop another not-so-subtle hint to my husband about that Valentine's meal - if he doesn't take it, it'll be more Love Apptually than Love Actually for him!",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*IeQyyAECLgmlL98WitN_Iw.jpeg,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/love-apptually-the-dating-game-in-the-age-of-ai-f65e4c8792f1,artificial-intelligence,e78d8d61f818e9d0167ef686e5acd29ef60a2fd3323c97213ba69743
Is Your Website the Equivalent of a Blind Date From Hell?,"""He was adorable, but then he opened his mouth.""I still remember the look of horror on my roommate's face as she described her blind date.""Like, at first glance, I was so hopeful. He had a nice smile - smelled great. But as soon as he started talking... ugh. It was like he didn't know how to be a human being.""Ouch.Nobody wants to be described like that.And it's not how you want your website described, either.Technology has made it easier than ever to create beautiful, functioning websites. Gone are the days of spending a fortune hiring developers or learning how to code.That's the good news.The bad news is too many people believe a nice looking website is all you need to get your customers excited.But unless you want to be like that adorable jerk from college, you can't forget your website's essential role: to start a conversation.Because a website, especially for first-time visitors, is like a blind date. You can't just show up looking nice and think your work is done. You've got to say the right things. Build trust. Learn about the other person.And like a first date, you only get one chance - a couple of sentences- to make a good first impression.But too many sites forget basic etiquette and end up only talking about themselves, telling stories with no context, and leaving their readers confused and frustrated - wishing they'd never clicked over in the first place.So let's take a look at three websites from actual small businesses to see if they pass the first-date test. Are they more than a pretty face? Do they speak to our interests and needs? Do they leave us wanting more?Spoiler alert: They all fail to impress. But with a few tweaks, I'll show you how they could easily win a second chance.Note: I've stripped away any identifying elements while keeping the copy and overall design the same.The good:What to fix:This site asks you to jump in without providing any crucial details. There's no clear indication of what's provided, who it's for, or the expected value/outcome someone will receive. All we know is the person's name and something about counseling?It's like a marriage proposal after just saying, ""hi.""Reading through the testimonials gave a lot more insight into the practitioner and her process. But she needs to get people interested faster, or they'll never venture over to those reviews.This new tagline generates hope and prompts you to keep reading. The headline clarifies that she's helping a specific group of people - those struggling with depression or anxiety.With a clear headline and promise of an outcome, the ""I'm ready"" feels like a natural invitation to learn more.There's still work to do to build trust and authority. But now, there's enough information to continue the conversation.The good:What to fix:This website doesn't just avoid conversation. It kills it. There is no clarity, no value provided, and it leaves us with too many unimportant questions. We're definitely swiping left.The most challenging thing about any spiritual type business is pinpointing specific values and benefits. It's hard to describe the intangible. The clearer you can be on the benefits and outcomes you provide, the more likely people will stick around to learn more.""Your BEST you"" is still a little vague, but it speaks to the organization's overall mission. As a tagline, it produces enough curiosity to move you toward the headline, which provides more specific benefits and outcomes.I used the call-to-action to encourage a deeper dive. ""Take a tour"" sounds like a sunny invitation to explore all the goodies inside. It helps keep the audience interested long enough to get a better sense of what they can expect to gain from services that are not always easily defined.The good:What to fix:The main problem with this site is that it's all about the owner and not the reader. And yet, it doesn't even do a great job telling us who the person is or why we should care. If this were a date, warning bells would be blaring.After a lot of digging around, I discovered this influencer's goal is about helping women build confidence. Unfortunately, that is another one of those hard-to-define concepts that usually leave businesses clinging to clichés and vague terms.First, I changed the focus from the influencer to the reader. Then I connected the idea of confidence with superpower and success to create more emotion and an actual outcome.Since the site has so many options for someone to choose from (podcasts, blogs, courses, etc.), I used the main call-to-action to encourage the reader to subscribe so the owner can continue to nurture the relationship and build trust.A pretty website is like a handsome face - nice to have, but only part of the package. If you want to seal the deal, you need to take a good look at the message your website is sending.What's the value you provide? Who's the target audience? How can you make those first few seconds reveal all the good you have to offer?Never underestimate the power of well-crafted copy. Just like in life, plenty of ugly and average-looking folks attract incredible partners by knowing how to speak from the heart and serve the people they love.It all starts with a conversation. Are you saying the right things?",https://miro.medium.com/max/9662/0*q0ntSuuRZVbyHQSl,https://medium.com/better-marketing/is-your-website-the-equivalent-of-a-blind-date-from-hell-bee8cea96e7,marketing,e81ebdce31733ad3e7392dab54e7188b0adc2a5e7a6cfde0fec3b68b
Keeping Your Focus While Using Social Media,"Spending hours on social media? Focused on building your platform?I get it.But here's the hard truth: you're likely wasting your time. Don't get me wrong, social media can be great for maintaining and even building relationships.But it also is a MASSIVE TIME SUCK.Let's be even more honest: it's likely the number one time suck, right? You go to Facebook (or wherever) and have intentions of doing something. And then what happens?That's right, you fall into the rabbit hole.Sound familiar?Eventually, you come to your senses and realize what it is you need to do. But by that point, how much time has passed? And, more importantly, how much mental energy did you use?Mental energy matters more than anything else. I'd even argue it matters more than time. If you're drained of mental energy, more time is required to do the work.Now I know what you're thinking.Say that you use social media for business. I get that. I do too. Let's look a little bit closer at that.Glance at these stats from Wordpress:Out of all that search traffic, 91% of the traffic goes to sites listed on the first page of results.Google is still king. Search is how people go to your website. As far as finding new customers and getting traffic to your website, it's the absolute worst.Am I saying abandon all social media? Nope. Not at all. But something absolutely has to change. Here are a few ways to shake up how you use social media that are never talked about enough.The first thing is shockingly simple. Use RecurPost. RecurPost is a social media scheduler with built-in content planning, curation, and scheduling tools. You connect your social media accounts, create content libraries, set up a schedule, add your content, and more.And the best part is this... RecurPost has a very generous free plan.All of these things are free.Is RecurPost worth trying out for free? Absolutely. But there is a bit of learning curve to it. You still have to schedule out your content. What's another alternative?If This Then That is another great option worth considering. You simply set up a trigger and then when one specific event happens, another event happens. For example, you might want to connect Twitter with Instagram.Or you might want to sync Instagram updates with a Pinterest board.These kinds of options really can help you limit the time you spend on social media. Another great option is Zapier. It's a lot like If This Then That, but on steroids. Everything is based on ""zaps."" What's a zap? I'm glad you asked. Here's Zapier's definition.I highly encourage you to try some of these options. Otherwise, you'll spend all of your time on social media and not be able to do anything else. And that's just not a good combination. Do more of what it is you want to do and live the life you want to live.👋🏼 P.S. - Want to know how you can blog, write a book and build a platform at the same time?➡️ Grab the free cheatsheet right here.Jim Woods is the co-author of the bestselling books Ready Aim Fire and Focus Booster.

What It Takes to Be a Successful Entrepreneur,"As someone who aspires to be an entrepreneur (or rather, work for myself), I've always been fascinated by people in business, technology, sports, entertainment, and/or creative industries who seem to embody the kind of personality that enables them to succeed. It wasn't until I made a conscious effort to learn more about entrepreneurs from all types of industries that I soon realized how little I knew about the struggles of entrepreneurs.To be an entrepreneur requires a lot more than a certain type of personality. It has very little to do with upbringing and more to do with persistence, passion, dedication and the ability to handle rejection and failure with utmost humility.These are some of the lessons that I've gained in the past month learning about entrepreneurs, from listening to the entire 2020 lineup of the How I Built This podcast. Hosted by Guy Raz, HIBT interviews entrepreneurs from all disciplines about their journey towards success. 113 episodes and 80+ hours later, I realized there is no 'ideal' image or type of person who is most likely to succeed as an entrepreneur - rather, there are commonalities across most, if not all, of the entrepreneurs interviewed on the show.Below are the 13 most common traits from the world's most successful entrepreneurs and who they are.1. Most of them had no prior knowledge or experience about their product and/or service.Brandon Beck & Marc Merrill became friends when they met at a summer camp in high school, bonded through a shared love of video games. Later, they ended up at the same college and became roommates. After college, they remained friends. Perhaps out of curiosity or determination, they decided to form a business together - Riot Games. They had an inkling that the future of video games is a 'freemium' model - where games were free to play but people would purchase certain things, called skins, within the game, allowing them to be monetized. Neither one of them had technical skills or experience. So they focused on hiring the best team they could possibly hire, and together, developed one of the most popular PC games of all time, League of Legends. Turns out, their inkling was right.""We believed that people would try it if it's free and buy it if it's great.""2. They got rejected ALOT.Tim Ferriss, author and podcaster, got rejected 26 out of 27 times when he was shopping around for publishers for his book, The 4-Hour Workweek in 2006. The main reason? He was a never-published-before, unknown author. The one publisher that did take a chance on him was right. His book ended up on the New York Times bestseller list for four years in a row, making it one of the most successful business productivity books of all time.Ever since then, Tim has published four additional books and started his own podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show, one of the most popular podcasts to date.""I've brought myself to the brink of destruction many times.""3. The majority of them are highly focused, obsessed with detail type pf people.Dave Anderson, founder of Famous Dave's BBQ, had an obsessive focus on detail. When he started his business, he wanted to have the best barbecue place in town. At the time, this was Hayward, WI in 1994. So he studied the art of barbecuing with great fervor to ensure that everything would fall into place. The result: he took a family love of barbecue to great heights - he had lines out the door during the first year of operation.Dig deeper, and you'll find that Dave's journey was not without challenges. He grew up with undiagnosed ADHD; he struggled in school. Prior to founding Famous Dave's BBQ, he had a terrarium business, where he lost a lot of money, so much that he could not afford to buy his infant son milk. ""Back then, I was digging through the seat cushions to find money to buy my son milk. It was tough,"" he said. Later, while working on building Dave's BBQ off the ground, he developed a drinking problem - it got so bad that his family staged an intervention. That intervention led him to go into treatment, after which he was able to focus more on his business.""I always tell people, life is not always on top of the mountain; it's the valleys and it's the struggles that you have to come back from, where you learn things. I think that's how you grow.""4. They all had a business partner or two.To be an entrepreneur (or start a business) means realizing that you cannot take on the endeavor by yourself. All of the entrepreneurs on the show understood this, and as a result, chose a business partner (or two) to help them get it off the ground. A lot of them chose a family member, a friend, a spouse, or a colleague whose skills complement theirs.One of the longest lasting friendship-turned-partnership is the one between Ben Cohen & Jerry Greenfield, founders of Ben & Jerry's ice cream. In the late 1970s, they took a risk - a big one - by opening an ice cream shop in Burlington, VT after taking a correspondence course in ice cream making. As business partners, they had complementary skills. Ben was more spontaneous and entrepreneurial, while Jerry was more practical and simple. Together, Jerry made the ice cream and Ben did the tasting. And together, they marketed their store and products so well that Time magazine called them ""the best ice cream in the world"" in 1981.""We were really bad at portion control. We wanted to keep people happy.""5. Many of them are not natural salespeople.While it's true that some of the entrepreneurs did work in sales, being able to ""sell"" their product or service was a skill that they learned along the way. Many of them did eventually land at the investor's table, pitching their idea to venture capital, often being the only woman in the room, or a person of color.The late Tony Hsieh, former CEO of Zappos, considered himself an introvert. That's why he purposely surrounded himself with people whose personality are opposite of his - extroverts.When Tony joined Zappos in the late '90s, we were living in an era where people were reluctant to buy shoes online. He knew that and worked on a plan to revolutionize the shoe buying process - by focusing vehemently on customer service. He knew that if you could win a customer over on the phone, they would buy no matter what. He was right. By focusing the company's mission on exceptional customer service, it changed people's buying behaviors and created a sense of trust. That's ultimately what customer service is all about.""When you want your brand to stand for something or have a purpose.... You do things that are nonsensical, that your competitors wouldn't do.""6. Many of them had a learning disability and/or were troublemakers.Perhaps the most endearing story comes from Jo Malone, founder of Jo Malone London, a line of luxury fragrances, that speaks to the nature of resilience. Jo grew up in the 1960s, in a working class suburb of England and lived in public housing with her family. She had a severe case of dyslexia that went undiagnosed. School was a big struggle for her, so she left when she was 16 to take care of her mother, who later had a nervous breakdown. Tensions arose between the two women when in her early 20s, she moved back home to help with a skincare business that her mom had started. They had a major blowout, and ultimately Jo decided to leave. By the time she was 24, she had taken on her mother's debt.Despite failures in academia, Jo knew that she had a keen sense of smell, something that she took seriously and drawing upon her experience with the skincare line, started a fragrance business with her husband, Gary. They elicited enough excitement about the products that they had lines out the door by the time they opened their storefront in 1995. Within a year, they hit their revenue goal, without any investors.""You have to create the buzz, you have to create the voice, you have to create the want ability.""7. Many have failed at other things in life.As a kid, Michael Kirban, founder of Vita Coco, weren't very good in school, due to his ADHD and dyslexia. He was told that he would never amount to anything. His goal was to get C's. His parents split up when he was nine, and he went to live with his father, who owned a roller skating rink. Later on, his father dabbled in other types of businesses, including vacation rentals, where he helped out. Therefore, he always knew that risk taking was in his genes.After a failed attempt at college, he held random jobs. Then he went to Brazil and discovered coconut water and that was the beginning of his business journey. The idea was easy - to bring coconut water to the United States to sell. But legal issues arose, the main one being distribution, and later, a lawsuit from a competitor that taught him about humility and loss. Despite his failures, he continued the business and emerged as a top-selling coconut water brand in the U.S.""I was told quite a bit as a kid that I'm never going to be successful. So what's the worst that I can do- fail, like everyone thought I could or would? I think that sparks a little bit of the risk taking needed to be an entrepreneur.""8. They all had a day job prior to founding their company.Prior to founding their company, method soap, Adam Lowry & Eric Ryan, two childhood friends who grew up in the same neighborhood amidst the auto industry boom in Grosse Pointe, MI, had regular day jobs. Adam was doing research on climate change and Eric had a job in advertising. It wasn't until their serendipitous reunion on an airplane that reignited their friendship, and together, they decided to form a cleaning products company that focuses on natural, environmentally friendly ingredients in eye-catching bottles. They even went so far to ensure the ingredients weren't toxic by having Eric drink the bottle!With cleaning products, Adam & Eric saw an opportunity to change people's minds - that cleaning products can be pretty and functional at the same time. As a result, they dispelled the notion that ""green doesn't clean"" and turned it into one of the hottest cleaning brands on the market.""There's no such thing as low interest categories, only low interest brands."" -Eric Ryan""You don't need to figure out what you want to do with your life. You just need to figure out what to do next."" - Adam Lowry9. A lot of them came from working class and/or immigrant families.When you grow up in a motel like Shazi Visram did, you learn a little bit about business. Shazi's parents were Indian immigrants who operated a convenience store in Canada first; later, they moved to the United States and bought a motel, where she and her family lived for many years. Despite having parents who were small business owners, Shazi never planned on being an entrepreneur. She went to Columbia University with the intention of becoming an artist.It wasn't until she ran into a friend who was a mother in 2003 when she learned that new parents wanted a different kind of baby food for their infants and toddlers - food that was healthy, organic, and wholesome, not in a jar. Thus, Happy Family Organics was born. She began her journey with no experience in food. Her first try at baby food in frozen cubes was a failure - it was only when she pivoted to rice cereal and food pouches that her company became a success.""I think you make your own luck by showing up, fighting for what you believe in, and being there when those opportunities do show up.""10. Many of them experienced a traumatic event when they were young.Tope Awotona, founder of the online scheduling service Calendly, grew up comfortably middle class in Lagos, Nigeria. But when he was 12 years old, his father was killed suddenly in a carjacking incident, leaving him behind with his mother, who was strict. As a result, he experienced trauma, lost his appetite and became an insomniac. Later on, they moved to the United States, where he attended college at the University of Georgia. In college, he had a job as a door-to-door salesman, where he quickly discovered that he enjoyed the sales process and was good at it. The idea of entrepreneurship lingered on his mind for years, but he kept his day job selling software for technology companies.It wasn't until he ran into a problem setting up meetings with multiple business executives that he came up with the idea for Calendly. But prior to that, he had started two businesses that failed miserably - and he lost a lot of money and passion as a result. However, with scheduling meetings, he realized a lot of services were designed for brick-and-mortar businesses, and he wanted to make it easier for people to schedule meetings. Calendly became his ultimate passion project.""The key to success is the execution, not so much the idea.""11. None of them were motivated by money.When you live in a rural area like Mike Radenbaugh of Rad Power Bikes did and your high school is 16 miles away, you had to figure out a way to get to school every day. Your parents couldn't drive you to school - they had their own things to worry about. So Mike came up with a solution - to revamp old mountain bikes and turn it into electric bikes. A little trial and error later, he found himself a business owner right out of high school. Besides a fascination with motor parts, he was also motivated by the opportunity to provide ease of transportation for the rest of the world. He knew what it felt like to not be able to get around, and he wanted to give more people the freedom to travel as they wish.""It's not just transportation; it's health and wellness as well.""12. They all knew how to take advantage of an opportunity.Katia Beauchamp, founder of Birchbox, a monthly beauty subscription service, took a bet when she opened for business in 2010. At the time, people got beauty samples for free, from makeup counters and stores. But Katia was convinced that people would pay for the samples because she saw an opportunity for a trend that was on the rise - curation and customization. Even if people didn't know what they want, they still want someone to choose for them. Hence, the idea behind Birchbox - you get a box full of samples of brands that you would never otherwise have found for yourself. And if you like the products, then you can go on their website and buy the full-size version. That was how they made money.Today, the idea of curation and customization is still hot. Through Birchbox, a lot of people have been introduced to new brands, new products, and new loves. A year after founding the company, Birchbox raised $10 million in venture capital. Later, the concept proved so successful that within two years, it reached $40 million in revenue.""What a scary life to not know what you're capable of. That's terrifying.""13. Most importantly, every single one of them had a problem they wanted to solve.Justin Gold, founder of Justin's Nut Butters, a popular brand of almond butter, had a problem. He was a vegetarian who had trouble finding nut butters that he liked. At the time, the market was dominated by Skippy and Jiff. He wanted something different - an almond butter. Because he couldn't find anything in his local stores in Colorado, he decided to make his own. Over the course of a year, and a lot of experimentation in his kitchen, he developed an almond butter that tasted good to him. He labeled it ""Justins"" and soon discovered that his roommates were eating it with great enthusiasm. Soon, a lot of people began telling him that he should turn it into a business. So he did. The rest is history.""I was always positive. I was always thinking that this was going to work. I just didn't know how or when.""",https://miro.medium.com/max/13440/0*r1nfFnnHcDI7Z3Z7,https://hoangsamuelson2.medium.com/what-it-takes-to-be-a-successful-entrepreneur-3139e55286ea,freelancing,e267a84d3e596fb66ed5d5f9a844cf99213df88deb12601286917bf0
"Go Ahead, Change My (AI) Mind","Have you ever tried to change someone's mind? Of course you have. After all, it's fundamentally what much of communication is about. It's also incredibly difficult.It's even harder when it comes to the deep-seated political, religious, or social beliefs that have shaped us, because they tend to be tied to our own identity. Many beliefs are even completely unconscious and can only be elicited through indirect means. There is no telling if the job application I'm handing out will be treated differently because of my race or gender since the person I hand it to may not even be aware of their own biases. And if they are, they can easily conceal them. Changing someone's mind in a consistent, enduring way takes years and dedication, particularly when a belief is grounded in someone's emotional experiences.Not so with AI systems. For all their flaws and biases, one thing that distinguishes AI systems from human decision systems is that it is comparatively easy to lay bare their biases and change their mind.If you wanted to uncover biases in someone's evaluation of job applicants, the right approach would probably be to give them thousands of applications to review and measure the statistical difference in outcomes based on the attributes you seek, controlling for all others. While this is routinely done at the group level when there are enough applicants going through a standardized process, it is impossible to do this for any single decision maker, which makes it very hard to intervene, except at the policy level. You just can't have one person review thousands of applications and get statistically significant results. You can't ask a decision maker about their biases, because they may not be conscious of them, or they may have a vested interest in concealing them.AI systems, on the other hand, can handle being fed thousands or millions of test samples. In fact it's this very scalability that makes them the subject of so much scrutiny: it is easy to poke at them, and any flaws can generally be uncovered with acceptable p-values by increasing the sample size. It's a good thing too, because it enables us to deeply examine systems that have the potential to have a tremendous impact on people's lives in various ways.But this availability bias is not often recognized: since similar bias studies are extremely hard to conduct on people, they're simply rarely performed. And much of the narrative we hear around AI biases exists precisely because that's what we can measure, while the vast majority of decision systems that affect the world today are human, opaque and resistant to statistical scrutiny.And when we do find a bias in an AI system, we can change their mind on the spot. We have control over the data and facts they're exposed to in order to build their knowledge base. As a model designer, we can modify which inductive biases we encode into it, and the cost function that it attempts to optimize. And we're getting better and better as a community at improving our understanding of the relevant knobs we have at our disposal. For instance, studies have shown that with very few grounding statements, you can affect the entire 'belief system' of a very large neural model. You can also finely tune the tradeoffs an ML system makes to ensure equitable outcomes at no cost in performance. This is remarkable, particularly when you contrast it with how nearly impossible it is to have any agency on our largely unconscious human cognitive biases.There is also an intrinsic fairness in the consistency of outcomes. Decisions that change for no fundamental reason are inherently unfair, which is why automated decision systems don't necessarily need to perform better than human counterparts to provide more fair outcomes, as long as they reduce the variance in outcomes. AIs don't suffer from decision fatigue.Some would argue that the bar here is not human decision systems, but rule-based systems which are also arguably consistent, controllable and auditable. But therein lies another trap: worse is never more fair. A system which performs worse at its task, even if simpler and easier to reason about, is generally disproportionally worse in terms of fairness of outcomes. I used to work on automatic speech recognition, and in the early days those systems didn't work well at recognizing spoken English. But it wasn't the US-born middle-aged white male in their perfectly silent office setting that was most affected. It was the young and elderly, the non-native speakers, people in challenging, noisy acoustic environments. Arguing for coarser, simpler models in the name of transparency and inspectability often ignores the simple fact that a better decision system generally positively impacts the 'long tail' dramatically more than the dominant modes of the distribution. In fact, for all the concerns being raised around using ever-larger and more intricate language models, there is strong evidence that the better they get, the more aligned they become with shared human values.One could actually argue that the work being done on the fundamental performance of AI systems has had a much more profound impact on fairness outcomes than much of the literature that directly targets AI fairness, though if there wasn't the substantial body of work there is today on this topic, we would not be in a position to even evaluate that impact. More of our collective work in this space should increasingly become less targeted at merely exposing their flaws, and more at exploiting this agency we have over AI systems, and our unprecedented ability to change their minds towards fairer and more equitable outcomes.(With thanks to Ed H. Chi for his invaluable feedback on this article.)",https://miro.medium.com/max/9212/0*THBUTO-diXFjVFGM,https://towardsdatascience.com/go-ahead-change-my-ai-mind-89f64feab8eb,artificial-intelligence,e505e244d8bce601bb3ffc873b7a91687d93c9dd92e6b8980cb69a16
MacGyver Science: SOS + Hazmat + Ultrasound + Frequency + Malihini,"Breaking a Padlock With Two WrenchesYou know, locks don't actually prevent people from entering a place. They are just a deterrent. Given enough time, pretty much any lock can be circumvented. But the question is time. Can you get past a lock quickly? In this case, it's a padlock. MacGyver grabs two wrenches and uses them to pry the lock apart.It's basically a simple machine that uses torque. When he pulls the ends together, the distance the ends move are greater than the rotating distance of the tiny wrench part at the end. Since the torque is equal on both ends, a long torque arm with a tiny force produces a GIANT force with a tiny torque arm. This is enough to break the lock.It's real.Finding a Hidden Vault Room With GravityHow do you find something heavy, like a safe-room? MacGyver removes the swinging balls from a Newton's Cradle (one of those fun swinging ball toys) and rolls them across the floor. When one of the ball deviates from its straight path, that's an indication that there is something heavy there.There's actually two ways this trick could work. The first is with a gravitational force. Gravity is an interaction between any two objects that have mass (so, pretty much everything). However, it's a super weak force. We notice the gravitational force due to the interaction with the Earth because the Earth is very massive (5.972 x 10²⁴ kg). But you won't notice the force between you and a person standing near you.What about the force between a ball and a massive room? It would still be tiny. However, tiny forces CAN make a difference. If you have a small force on a rolling ball, it's possible the ball could deviate a little bit. But wait! There's an even better example of tiny forces - the Cavendish Balance. This is a device that measures the gravitational force between two masses. The idea is to use a horizontal rotating rod that can move with very tiny forces. Here is my explanation.OK, there is a second way this rolling ball trick could work. It's possible that the safe room bends the floor - even a tiny little bit. With a small bend in the floor, a ball might not roll straight. A curving ball would indicate a bent floor due to the safe room. This method isn't as much fun since we don't get to talk about gravity.DIY Gas ChromatographMacGyver wants to use gas chromotagraphy to find out what's in the air causing people to get sick. A gas chromatograph is a complicated, but useful device in chemistry. The basic idea is to take a sample and separate different chemicals based on their evaporation rates and then use a detector to figure out what chemicals you have.Here is MacGyver's version.But is it possible to build a DIY version. Yes. Check this out.Food in a Refrigerator as a Control GroupSuppose the whole illness problem is caused by air borne bacteria. These could also be present on food. But there's always bacteria in the air - that's why food gets messed up when you leave it out. However, if you look at the food in a fridge - it could be separated from the rest of the building (because the door is closed). If you find significantly more bacteria on the food OUTSIDE of the fridge, that could indicate some type of extra stuff in the air.This is the idea behind a control variable in scientific experiments. You can break experimental data into two groups: experimental and control. The experimental group has something extra added to it, but the control group does not. Then you could look for differences in the two groups. That's whole idea of a control.Bacteria StainYou can't see bacteria - it's too small. Instead, you need to use a stain to distinguish between different types of bacteria. Here is a homemade stain.UV FluorescenceWhy is there a UV light in a water filter? Well, ultraviolet light can destroy bacteria and other bad stuff in the water - so, you have a UV light. But what does it do to the bacteria stain? The idea is that when UV light hits some materials, they fluoresce. That means they emit different wavelengths of light. Yes, this is the same thing that happens when some clothes look weird under a black light (a black light is a UV light).Here's how that works.Sonic WeaponsYes, they are a real thing.Sonic Weapon DetectorsThe idea is to use an ultrasonic transducer to detect the sonic weapon. If you want to know WHERE the source comes from, you can use triangulation. That's what they are doing here.Since sound travels at a finite speed, the sound waves from the source should arrive at the different detectors at different times. Just think about this simple case with just two detectors and a sound wave.Since detector 1 (in this diagram) is farther away, it would hear the sound after detector 2. Based on the time difference and the distance between the detectors, you can find the angular direction of the source.So, why do you need a 3rd detector? If you know the time difference between detectors, there are actually two solutions for the location of the source. There's the one shown above and then there's one on the right side of the detectors. Having that third detector eliminates the other solution.Audio Feedback and ResonanceMacGyver uses the sonic detector and connects it to the alarm speakers in the garage. When the bad guys use their weapon, this creates a feedback loop. Here is a demonstration of real feedback.But wait! There's more. Since they are in a closed room, the sound reflects off the walls and interfere with other sound waves to make it even louder. This is exactly what happens with many musical instruments - like a flute. A resonance is created in the closed tube of the instrument.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2732/1*jmM1kBGbqggw0pFbAdDlQQ.png,https://rjallain.medium.com/macgyver-science-sos-hazmat-ultrasound-frequency-malihini-699e06d1694,science,e0915a5994bae714dde12f38c3750353f26ee88861217755fcbed817
Bowser's Fury Review: Nintendo's Open-World Mario Experiment,"Mario games of the Wii U generation were seemingly lost in time due to the Wii U's lackluster performance, but rereleases for the Nintendo Switch have given a second-life to titles such as Mario Kart 8 and Super Mario Bros. U. The latest (and arguably, most anticipated) addition to the plethora of Mario rereleases is Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.Bowser's Fury is a bundled add-on to Super Mario 3D World, thus being dubbed by Nintendo Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury. Nintendo's redelivery of the game opens up the experience once more to newer Mario fans while bringing something fresh for those who already played through the original release of 3D World. With that being said, if you're planning on skipping out on 3D World because you already experienced it once before on the Wii U, it's best to reconsider and take a closer look at Bowser's Fury.Super Mario 3D World had a new power-up with a feline theme, making it the showcase power-up of the game. Players could snag a ""Super Bell"" and transform into a cat, granting them the ability to scratch and slide into enemies. When in cat form, Mario and pals could also climb up walls and goalposts, making the power-up an extremely useful item to hang on to if players aimed to search through every nook and cranny throughout levels.This new item is, without a doubt, my favorite power-up introduced in a Mario game. There's a special feeling that comes with scratching a goomba, one that isn't replicated when stomping on its head - especially when that goomba, too, has feline features. The only bias for me when it comes to 3D World and Bowser's Fury is my affection for cats, so reader beware of many cat puns ahead!Despite being called 3D World, the game is a hybrid between 3D and side-scrolling Mario titles, like Super Mario Bros. U. Three-dimensional environments offer literal depth to the worlds and make them far more interesting to explore than your usual side-scrolling title. The add-on to this exciting experience, though, is something much more enticing.Bowser's Fury is, in a way, the successor the 3D World. Instead of opting for more levels in the original game like the rereleases of Super Mario Bros. U, Bowser's Fury offers something different that maintains the themes of the original game. Super Mario 3D World's hybrid side-scrolling adventures are quickly dwarfed by the fully-committed 3D open-world of Bowser's Fury.An incident outside of Peach's castle results in him falling into a blackish goop hole in a Kingdom Hearts intro-like sequence, where he ends up in an entirely new world plagued with more black goop. Mario finds himself in a world based entirely around cats; it's straight out of Studio Ghibli's The Cat Returns. Everything in the game - everything - is a cat. Cat trees, cat bushes, cat goombas, cat koopas, and more all populating the world. One might think Nintendo should have titled the game Bowser's Furry.Within this paw-some world is a threatening new version of Bowser; one corrupted with the same goop that happens to be infesting the cheery cat dimension. After being enlisted to help by none other than the concerned child, Bowser Jr., Mario sets off to collect ""Cat Shines"" to ward off the destructive new Bowser. After this, Mario and Bowser Jr. set out to explore the cat paradise together, teaming up to save Bowser from the corruptive goop and get home.While Bowser Jr. partnering up with Mario is an awesome idea and, in my opinion, adorable (dear Bowser Jr is worried about his papa), I often forgot he was traveling with me. His main use is to paint in question marks around the map that grant Mario an extra power-up. A second player can also take control of Bowser Jr. and aid in your adventure. This option doesn't have many features, but it's a neat addition, and welcome nonetheless.Speaking of power-ups, my favorite addition to this game is an inventory system. Mario can carry up to five of each item in his pocket activating them at any moment to benefit his journey. If you already have a power-up active, instead of being wasted, it will shift back into your inventory. This made the game so much more interesting, as I found myself constantly swapping between power-ups to help with whatever challenge I was up against. These challenges can be simple, like bringing a calico cat back to his crying mother, but more complex ones include battle arenas where you fight a bunch of enemies.Mario himself controls as you would expect from any other Mario game. With that being said, coming from the fluent abilities Mario can enact with Cappy to traverse the worlds of Super Mario Odyssey, I had to remember that I couldn't do those in this game. An upside to not being like Odyssey is the reintroduction of power-ups, something that was missing from the Switch's big Mario title. As expected, Mario can don his cat form in Bowser's Fury, fitting the feline theme. Scaling the walls of the various islands provided for some creative and, at times, difficult platforming.The world is filled with various levels that Mario can explore to collect Cat Shines, fueling the cat-eared lighthouses at the end of the level. These can vary; one level is a downwards slope that Mario skates down, while another is a giant snow-covered windmill that you climb. Mind you, this is all cat-themed, so expect many pointed ears atop the differing structures. As you progress, Mario can make his way back to previously explored levels to do newly unlocked challenges. More intriguing and innovative, though, are the indestructible blocks hiding more Cat Shines behind them.The only way Mario can destroy these new blocks is by waiting for Bowser to attack. During these attacks, a thunderstorm and approaches, and Bowser rains fire from above to take Mario out. Cleverly, players can take advantage of this by making a mental note of the Bowser blocks and returning to them when the storm begins to brew. At best, the Bowser intrusions were exciting and thrilling, but at worst, they were intrusive and inconvenient, making me drop what I was doing to quickly seek out the Bowser blocks (even if I was in the middle of a level).While the open-world is fairly large and boasts many locations to explore, I often found myself taken out of the moment to deal with the Bowser issue. This is a pro and con of the system, but overall it's a new idea that pushes the Mario 3D platforming genre forward, which I'm all for.There are tons of surprises to come across as Mario and Bowser Jr. adventure across the cat decorated isle, like the helpful aquatic dinosaur Plessie, who Mario can ride on the back of to sail across the open ocean. Plessie's return even provides more challenges for Mario to take on, like ocean races and bunny chases, both of which grant more Cat Shines.As with any collectible based 3D platformer, the more one explores, the more collectibles you come across. The decision to unlock a new challenge each time Mario returns to an island had me constantly shifting between locales, ultimately allowing me to experience everything the game had to offer.Bowser's thundering attacks on the cat islands can be utilized to unlock new areas and, in turn, new Cat Shines, but there's another massive feature that Nintendo introduced to make this game like no other: a catastrophic duel between Cat Mario and Corrupted Bowser.When Bowser begins to unleash his fire attacks on Mario and Bowser Jr., a giant Super Bell shrine unlocks, turning Mario into a massive lion to challenge the misbehaving Bowser. This happens a few times throughout the game, and each occurrence unlocks more of the map. These fights are flashy and turn the entire map into an arena, dwarfing the world players were exploring mere moments before. A new bell unlocks when Mario and Bowser Jr. reach a specific milestone of Cat Shines and the fights can happen whenever the player chooses.By the end of Bowser's Fury, I managed to collect 64 out of the 100 Cat Shines available. Immediately after finishing, you're given the opportunity to hop back in and continue your adventure with Bowser Jr., cleaning up anything you left behind. I plan to jump back in and 100% the game as the experience has largely been enjoyable.What Nintendo provides to players in Bowser's Fury isn't your run-of-the-mill Mario experience. It's similar enough to not confuse players, but different where it counts, harboring innovative ideas like the waning Bowser storm. For a simplistic series about a plumber eating mushrooms and stomping on turtles, Nintendo is constantly restyling and renovating the Mario style, keeping the series stirring, compelling people to come back with each and every installment.Is Bowser's Fury worth $60? That's entirely up to you. I found the bundle (two games I had never played before) absolutely worth it, especially with 3D Land's new online cooperative mode. If you're looking for family fun, something to do with your partner on Valentine's Day, or just a bit of 3D Mario escapades, I highly recommend Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.From the little cat lighthouses dotted across the map to the massive and intimidating cat volcano, the world introduced to players in Bowser's Fury is purr-fect 3D Mario fun that pushes the genre forward ever so slightly. While the experience is fur-miliar enough to reintroduce those who already experienced Super Mario 3D World on the Wii U, Bowser's Fury is a contained adventure that many will look back at fondly. Especially my fellow cat lovers who want to retreat to this cutesy cat paradise!",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*rZ1dBI34V1w9KpcsrOvJbw.png,https://medium.com/super-jump/bowsers-fury-review-mario-s-ingenious-innovation-3447c1c61701,gaming,e5005fb21c20f16d576775d03557e68c916d918480a4372eb7af2c87
How to Love Your Limitations and Use Them to Better Yourself,"There's an old Jewish proverb that goes, ""If God is omnipotent and omnipresent, what does he lack? Limitation.""Limitations are hard to accept. I wish I were smarter, didn't need to sleep, and could generate unlimited income at a whim. Limitations don't seem that great to those that have them. Who wants to be a pawn when you could be a queen?If the chessboard were nothing but queens, there would no longer be a game worth playing. Because pieces are limited in odd ways (knights do a damn L), there are more possible chess games than there are atoms in the universe. Strange how limitation somehow creates hugeness.Learning to love your limitations is opening up this paradoxical hugeness in you. Here's how it works so you can implement it in your life today:I love music. I tend to get obsessed with one band at a time and play them over and over. I get bored and eventually move on. Lately, it's The Killers.What would happen if I played two songs at once? Obviously, it would be a noise-jumble. What if I played all songs ever recorded at the same time? Then it would just be white noise. Shh....Without the limitations of who we are, we would be everything - and nothing. By being something specific, limited, and even cursed in various ways, we allow ourselves to unlock a sort of paradoxical infinite access. Would you rather be a Beatles song or white noise?Would you rather be you? I hope so because your song is unlike any other song.My friend told me a story about a great musician who refused to play on anything other than a C. Bechstein (great piano brand).A woman in a small town loved this musician. She owned a little bar with a spot in the corner for musicians to play. She saved her money for years and finally wrote the musician a letter. ""PLEASE come to my town and play. I can pay your full price. I love your music, and if you came to my bar, it would make my whole life.""Against all odds, he agreed to come. She knew he needed a C. Bechstein piano. She lied and said she had one.When he arrived, he was shocked by the old, out of tune piano she had to offer. ""Please play tonight anyway. I knew you wouldn't come if I told you the truth.""""You were right. And I refuse to play on that piano."" He left the bar.Later that night, he reviewed her letter. He considered what it meant to her and how far he had come. He sighs and returns to the bar.He arrives just in time for the show. She is overjoyed. He sits down to play.What happens next is like something out of a movie. The great musician gets lost in his performance. It's the best he's ever played in his 40-year career. He works around the sour notes and odd tones. He becomes one with the limits of the piano. Everyone there remembers it as a religious experience unlike anything else in their life.Without limits, we have no greatness.I remember an Olympic performance from when I was a kid. One gymnast does a routine. She runs, flies, flips, and lands perfectly. Not a single flaw. Human greatness in motion. The crowd applauds, and the judges give her a 9.8.The next girl steps up. Oh no. The girl in front of her had done better than she had ever done in practice. She was also stronger and faster. There was no possible way to top it. What does she do?She runs. She flips. She is moving just beyond what her limits are. One tiny mistake, and she will break a leg. She is hovering just near disaster. The crowd gets absolutely silent. She twirls. She isn't perfect, but she is pushing herself. She is riding the limits of her smaller and weaker frame. She is using creativity and spontaneity. Her moves have an unexplainable flair of passion and drive.She lands perfectly - tears in her eyes. The crowd LEAPS TO THEIR FEET IN UNISON. They didn't have to check in with one another. 10,000 people know what they just saw was human greatness. They can sense it in their bones. They know they just saw the force that makes humans special. They scream and cheer.I have tears in my eyes just typing this out! There is something magical about limitations. That's what makes us great.Find your limits and push them. If you do it with your whole heart, people will leap to their feet to cheer you on.I love my dog. Why?Sometimes, I wish I didn't have to take him out to the bathroom all the time. What if I removed that limitation? I wave a wand, and he can use my toilet. Other times, I wish he were a little bigger so that I don't have to worry about other dogs hurting him. Wave the wand; he's now wolf-sized. I also wish he could feed himself, speak to me, and teach me to play guitar. Let's also make him made out of metal, so he never dies.What happened to my dog? He turned into a robot-wolf-super-AI. He certainly doesn't need me anymore. Everything I loved about the dog is gone.Strangely, we love our animals because of their limitations. They need us, but it's more than that. They are fragile - precious, and they don't last forever. They don't suffer (to the extent that they don't) because we love and care for them.When you die, people are going to remember your faults fondly. They may want you to be all you can be, but if they really love you, they love your faults and limitations, too. It's a strange paradox about love and humanity.Without limitation, we can't love.Another strange paradox. Put yourself in a box, somehow get freer.When I was a kid, we would play Cowboys. Even though it was the wild west, we had rules. If you got shot by the imaginary gun, you had to drop ""dead"" for the round. Why would a kid do that? Why wouldn't he say, ""I have armor!"" and keep playing?Because somehow, he knows rules create freedom. By sticking to the rules in good faith, he makes it a game that all the kids want to keep playing. That's amazing social behavior, first of all. Second, it means that disciple toward the rules gives kids to play a fun game - which is freedom.The type of kids that break the rules don't get invited to play next time! If you don't have discipline, even as a 9-year-old, you don't get to play.The same is true for us adults. We are all playing games. It might be the ""writing on Medium"" game. It might be the ""9-5"" game. Whatever it is, there are rules. By following the rules and being ""fun,"" you get invited to play more and more. The more you play, the more fun, status, and money you get.No matter how old you are, you don't get to play without discipline. Discipline is self-imposed limitations that, paradoxically, create infinite potential.Embrace limitations in all forms - become limitless.No matter your limits, the quicker you embrace them, the quicker life starts working out in your favor. Here's how:Energy towards resenting limitations is a waste.Your height, intelligence, talent, looks, family, and gender are all limits that set you free.Stop comparing yourself to other people and start embracing what you are.Stay in touch.(This is where you get first dibs and deeper dives.)",https://miro.medium.com/max/10160/1*qT7uh8OjamB7rAwChs68bg.jpeg,https://medium.com/the-ascent/how-to-love-your-limitations-and-use-them-to-make-you-better-9d17837c7bac,mindfulness,e16216fe134619c13a37e0012d1311f026d4a022d30456596c94a1d2
Visiting Curaçao on a Layover,"Have you heard of the ABC Islands? They are a set of 3 islands just north of Venezuela; Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao. Of course, in order, they are actually called Aruba, Curaçao, Bonaire, but that's beside the point. Here's what they look like on the map.In 2016, I sailed from Virginia to Aruba and then flew to Bonaire for two months to get my DiveMaster Certificate. Curaçao is often a stopover on the way to or from Bonaire. I have often thought I needed to go to Curaçao to learn more about it but had never had the opportunity to do so.In June of 2019, after sailing around the world from Panama and ending up in Columbia on my return passage, a friend asked me to fly back to Grenada to assist him with getting his boat to Bonaire. It was a nice trip on a nice boat and it went smoothly.On the flight back to Colombia there was a longish stopover in Curaçao, so I decided to take a tour of the downtown area of Willemstad, specifically the historic district of Otrobanda.I took a video of the bus ride down to this area of town. There aren't any highlights, perse, but rather just a view of the area as I rode towards Punda and Otrobanda. Just a look at the area for those who have never been there. The bus cost around $1 for the 5-mile trip. The currency used in Curaçao is the Antillean Guilder (ANG), also called the Florin, however, they appear to also accept US dollars without hesitancy.Otrabanda en Punda, means ""the other side of the point"" in Papiamentu, the Portuguese-based creole used widely throughout the ABC islands. Punda is an area in Willemstad, considered the ""eastside"" and the old city center. Otrabanda is divided from Punda by the Queen Emma Swinging Bridge, a floating pontoon bridge that swings open for ferries that come through the Sint Anna Bay. Here's a detailed map of the area.Punda was established in 1634 and Otrobanda in 1707 and it was connected by the swinging bridge in 1888. The locals like to call the bridge the Swinging Old Lady. There are over 700 UNESCO listed buildings in this downtown area, which creates a visual delight. Here are some shots of Otrobanda from the Punda side, getting ready to cross the bridge.Otrobanda was originally developed because they were running out of space in Punda. Eventually it became quite populated and Rif Fort was added to defend against pirates in the 1800s.Once you cross the bridge and enter into Otrobanda, your are met with colorful and beautiful streets and buildings that are a feast for the senses. It's a wonderful little area and more than worth the bus ride to see it. Once I arrived I found myself being disappointed that I didn't have more time to spend than the couple hours allotted based on my layover. I have decided that I will return and spend more time in this beautiful old city as well as discover the rest of what Curaçao has to offer.While I was on the pontoon bridge, a ferry came in and it was fun to watch it swing wide for the arriving boat. It caught me off guard. I was about halfway across the bridge when I heard a siren, and realized if I didn't get off quickly, I was going to be part of the swinging action. In the end, I made it to the end of the bridge but was unable to exit the area because they put a gate up, keeping people out of the swinging bridge area. It was a little nerve-wracking at first, but it really wasn't dangerous.If you get the chance, you really should go visit this beautiful town and country. For me, it was a pleasant day and I felt very welcomed by the people of Curaçao. They were warm and helpful. Not everybody spoke English but some of the Spanish I knew helped a little with the Papiamento. Plus there were plenty of people who did speak English and they tended to go out of their way to help. The bus ride back was $2, but that's because it was a smaller bus that went more frequently, allowing me to get back to the airport in a more timely manner.If you enjoyed this read, take a look at a couple of my other articles.

The tale of the 50 minute stand-up,"Is it a meeting or just purgatory?For those of you familiar with Agile, I would like you to think about something. What is a stand-up meeting? I only ask because nobody I work for seems to know the answer. In a company I recently worked for, a stand-up meeting consisted of 10 minutes of waiting for everyone to show up, then 15 minutes of everyone scrambling to make up an update that will satisfy their superiors, all followed by a 30 minute discussion by said superiors about minutiae that nobody else cares about but must suffer through anyways. When I hear people sing the praises of Agile methodology I want to shake them and make them sit through my meetings. Of course, the reason I feel this way is probably because the company I worked for did not really use the Agile method as it was meant to be used.So, according to Agile methodology, why do we all have to suffer through this crap on a daily basis? Why is this the thing I loathed about my last job (even more than the retros) more than anything else, more than the boredom, the constant emails and calls, and my complete lack of benefits, vacation time, and work-life balance? Hell if I know, but if I was a gambling man I would put my money on this: stand-ups at my company were a huge, rotten, festering waste of time that felt like being in a high school social studies class. You are always expected to contribute but you don't care about any of the stuff being said and none of it helps you. It probably even slowly kills your soul.I remember very few stand-ups that actually followed the many definitions of a stand-up meeting I have read. I have listed a few so that you can get the gist of what a stand-up was meant to be.A few notes. First off, I would like to stop calling a daily meeting a 'stand-up' if the members are not even on the same continent, let alone the same office. I have never had a so-called 'stand-up' in the presence of other people because the company I worked for had teams in 4 countries and everyone worked from home. Maybe we can call this kind of meeting 'Daily Updates' from now on?Next point of interest: Since we didn't have to follow the pain in our legs for timing, why are 'Daily Updates' not being timed? Why does it inevitably turn into the manager blathering on for 30, 40, 60 minutes? It's probably because nobody wants to cut the boss off, especially if said boss has a tendency to make work personal.The 'stand-ups' I endured clearly deviated from what a stand-up was originally supposed to be. Here is what I remember from most of our stand-ups:Something is very wrong when stand-ups even get close to hitting the hour mark. It makes it painfully clear that the higher-ups don't actually care about Agile methodology (not that I really do either) beyond its ability to push employees to work harder to meet tighter sprint-based deadlines. Woo-hoo, progress.When I think more about it, I remember the most absurd stand-up I ever had the misfortune to participate in. The meeting was delayed a full day 5 minutes before the meeting was supposed to start, then delayed by an hour the next day, and then to top the whole thing off the stupid meeting itself went on for 60 minutes. I think I was half asleep the whole time and I definitely remembered none of the content because my time was not being respected at all and very little of value was actually said.On that note, I just want to clarify one thing. Sure, I did not ever have a stand-up with other people in the room. But I certainly stood during many stand-ups, since they were like little stressful recesses in which I could wash the dishes, fold laundry, or feed the dogs. The only thing I couldn't really do is actually work because that would require focus that was being spent on listening to make sure my name didn't come up.Of course, maybe I was just a terrible employee. I probably was, so let's ask somebody else. The Agile Alliance, which sounds like they should be an authority regarding Agile methodology, has this to say about common pitfalls when running a daily stand-up:""Perhaps the most common mistake is to turn the daily meeting into a ""status report"" with each member reporting progress to the same person......a second common pitfall is a daily meeting which drags on and on......a third common issue is a team finding little value in the daily meeting......this often reveals a lukewarm commitment to Agile""Well, darn. Nobody ever told me that. If you had asked me to define a stand-up six months ago I would have told you that a stand-up is a meeting in which a bunch of people take turns appeasing their boss before having the pleasure of listening to the boss micromanage everyone for at least 15 minutes.And don't question my commitment to Agile. Is it a religion now? You can count me out of that; I have no commitment to Agile. Agile was simply used as a tool to squeeze as much value from the underlings as could possibly be squeezed. Agile held no value for me as a worker but instead opened the door for a flood of frustration. I'm glad I'm not a developer - Agile methodology seems to be really useful when building a digital sweatshop.I don't, by the way, think Agile is bad. I think Agile can work great when it is implemented correctly and the values of peer-to-peer sharing, collaboration, and adaptation are held by everyone, especially the managers. In fact, in the company I work for I saw Agile work really well for a different team working on a different, smaller project. They worked closely together and got stuff done. They seemed to love it.But let's go back to the 'commitment to Agile' I mentioned above. Just because a company says that it uses Agile does not mean that it actually follows Agile methodology nor does it mean that the people running the company actually understand what Agile really is.. Did my company really adhere to the Agile ideology? Is the yellow snow really lemon-flavored just because I say so? I don't think so.What are the takeaways from this, for any manager who happens to be reading this article?1. A stand-up should not wait for anyone. When it happens, it happens. I should not need to wake up at 6:00 in the morning for a 7 o'clock standup with a team halfway across the world, only to need to wait another 15 minutes for everyone else to show up.2. Standups are not for explanations and are not for discussions. Standups are for updates and questions directly related to the updates. Nobody wants to sit around and listen to a few people discuss things that are not relevant to anyone else in the group.3. If a boss/manager/higher-up is in the meeting people are going to try to cover their asses. There is no way around this apart from bosses not being in stand-ups with their employees.4. If standups tend to run 30 minutes too long and I am expected to attend three or four a week, that is at least a couple hours a week in which I am staring slackjawed at my computer screen with my mind in the clouds, excluding a few little moments relevant to myself and my team. Just keep that in mind.5. Stand-ups are not meant to be status reports to management. I have never participated in a stand-up that did not take the form of everyone giving management a report of what they did, about which management would ask questions and, well, manage. This flies in the face of what stand-ups are supposedly meant to do.Agile sure sounds nice in principle but makes some gross misunderstandings about human nature that make implementation nightmarishly difficult.

These Monday Motivation Cues Are Like Fiery Ginger Shots For Your Brain,"Somewhere in the vast universe, an alternative realm exists where everyone loves Mondays. They wake up with a smile, do a little dance, and accomplish everything they have set out to do, without it even feeling like work.Most of us can only imagine what life would be like on that planet.One of the greatest human minds once said: ""A perfection of means, and confusion of aims, seems to be our main problem."" It only takes one look inwards to know Albert Einstein was right.The perfection of means is for the most part a lifelong effort. But removing the confusion of aims can be an easier nut to crack. Many of my workdays still aren't perfect, but these Monday motivation cues help me get closer every week. I see my ambitions clearer. My goals are more achievable. And the best bit? The incentives are flexible enough to work a treat for anyone.My corner coffee shop makes these fiery double-shots of ginger juice, cayenne pepper, and orange juice. I love to chug a shot whenever I lack energy or feel a sore throat coming. It works wonders every time (once I've caught my breath and wiped my tears).And thinking about my absolute ambition always does the same for my hazy Monday morning mood.But this is not just about goals alone. It's about the entire thousand-piece-puzzle of your complete ambition. This includes everything. The whole bigger picture - your why, your life goals, your career goals, your talents, your finances, and yes, your dreams. The full shebang.Surprisingly, the whole package changes more than I thought it would; and reviewing it consistently every week makes my actions and choices a lot less impulsive. It gives me the chance to keep calm as I decide where and how to invest my time and my energy.Alert: Danger of getting lost in prolonged daydreaming. Setting up your Pomodoro alarm clock will help.Only recently I've discovered the beauty of assigning an actual rank to each process and task. I decide which biscuits can best feed the beast and then start from the top. I also limit the priorities I must get done to only two.""How well do you work under pressure?""""Unfortunately, I get discouraged and tend to panic when overwhelmed.""This is the least likely answer I (or anyone) would give to a potential client or employer. But in my case, it's often true. And when planning your own workload, honesty matters. Only you know how you perform best. Only you know your ideal conditions and your limits. You don't have to broadcast them to anyone else. Just be real with yourself.Because at the end of the week, it is always better to have two priority tasks ticked and off the table. You don't want to be drowning in a chaotic mess of half-baked biscuits and inedible dough. Set your bar lower just to start with, and if you finish early, you can always add more.In 1977, an ""ordinary"" sound-engineer Robbie Wedel pushed a button. He has been toying with the Moog Modular 3P synthesizer in a recording studio for days. At that time, this machine was only ever used to create a rhythmical baseline for classical composers. Robbie Wedel, however, sensed something strange and magnetic hiding in the guts of that box. He could not leave it alone.Then one day, he finally grasped what kept him awake at night. And as he did, he created the legendary, first of its kind bassline to Donna Summer's I Feel Love.That button has always been there. Other people worked with the Moog Modular before Robbie. That stomping sound was a tool, never intended for use on its own. Robbie was the only one who questioned it. And he created the future. I Feel Love birthed a new epic era in the history of music. It pushed the whole game to the next level. It became the blueprint for what we now call electronic dance music. Goosebump material.Extraordinary breakthroughs of epic dimensions are rare. But an open mind always keeps you growing as you learn. People who learn the most are open to twists. They question. They like unexpected turns. They consider the widest range of possible ideas.Most original ideas make little sense at first. Until you give them a chance. Until you feel the invisible force that suddenly won't settle for anything but. It won't let you sleep. Risk is no longer an issue. You must see the idea through.Alert: Danger of unforeseen spikes in your heart-rate BPM.You can't chase a ball you don't see. And it's impossible to keep running without at least some sense of progressing forward (it's why I hate treadmills).According to many cognitive scientists, setting up a tangible reward within a foreseeable reach can stretch your dedication and motivation much further. While steering clear of possible overindulgences (as they could make you achieve the exact opposite), rewards can be amazing tools when dealing with a challenging task that seems like too much at first.Timing is everything. Your reward has to be reachable fast. No point setting a reward system in which your first milestone is months away. So minimize the gap between the effort and the gain. Just make sure not to sacrifice quality.Stay realistic, but keep your prizes exciting. Think of them as dividends. Whether you meet your milestone early or late, reward your efforts with something you love. And mix the rewards up each week to keep your experience healthy and fresh.Most of us tend to think of mistakes and possible failures negatively. Well, as failures. As a result we fear them. But there is another side to failure we often overlook.The learning curve.We need the learning curve to grow. Sometimes it's a chopstick in the eye. Sometimes, things really bloody hurt. But it always teaches us something in the end.Failure is feedback.And when it comes to work, building a business, building your life, know that you're not alone in your stumbles. Great inventors make mistakes. Millionaire entrepreneurs make mistakes. Legendary people everyone knows also make legendary mistakes.This is a powerful reminder. You know that whatever happens this week, you will be wiser at the end of it. But now, on Monday morning, you can control which direction you want to take. Because you have the full power to decide the actions most likely to push things in the right lane.Think the Friday feeling, but not just in the ""let's kill a bottle of wine"" kind of way. Add the impeccable zing of accomplishment to the mixture. And for a moment, become the person you will be once you get there.Imagine yourself lightminded, pleasantly tired, and excited knowing you have completed your top two priorities and more.Imagine the you who is proud of your work. Imagine the you who is satisfied looking back and passionate looking forward. That's the version of you headed towards groundbreaking ideas and a dreamy future.Imagine the moment when you kick back as usual on a Friday night, but this time something is different - the guilty nagging voice is absent. Your mind is calm. You know you have done enough.And not just any version of enough, but enough according to your own absolute ambition action plan.But don't stop there. Next Monday, give your morning another cayenne and ginger shot of motivation. And make every week a week of fiery results.We're offering a free course to all of our new subscribers as a thank you for your continued support.

Economics of the brain 💵,"As I've mentioned in previous articles, I'm a big fan of intuitive models, especially those that draw parallels between different fields. What better way to understand complex phenomena than some good ol' analogies? Ideology aside, I hope this article provides you with some insights into the brain through the lens of economics. 😊· Table of contents· Bridging micro and macro· Land, labor, capital ∘ Land· Labor ∘ Capital· Allocating scarce resources ∘ Attention ∘ Oxygen and glucose· Inflation and bankruptcy· Inflation· Bankruptcy· Takeaways· About the author· Sources and further readingEconomics is largely about decision-making. Whether it's individuals, corporations, governments, or regions in your brain, economics is about how these entities assign value to different actions and make choices accordingly.I was listening to an episode of The Knowledge Project the other day with angel investor Naval Ravikant. At one point, he says that macroeconomics - which functions at the level of governments and countries - is just as good as astrology. There are so many factors to consider that predicting trends is as fruitless as analyzing the daily horoscope.Rather, he said, you should embrace microeconomics, which concerns the decisions of individuals and businesses. Focus on decision-making you can actually understand before trying to tackle grand and abstract economic dilemmas. Individual choices scale up to change the world.I don't know if I'd go so far as to say that macroeconomics is BS, but I'll give you an analogy: In the context of neuroscience, microeconomics is like using calcium imaging to study the firing patterns of neurons, while macroeconomics is like using psychology to study the behavior resulting from the combined efforts of your hard-working neurons.You see, some people - especially those who are self-proclaimed aficionados in the ""hard"" sciences - say that psychology is a ""soft"" science and relies too heavily on subjective measures and experiences, just as Naval Ravikant might say macroeconomics is useless. (See this article for some rebuttals.)But no matter your view on the efficacy of psychology, you must admit that there is value for investigation of neural dynamics at all scales, ranging from the electrochemical signals that traverse your synaptic landscape to the reasons why you despaired at the thought of getting out of bed today. Otherwise, you can't figure out how the scales connect.Due to the nature of my own research on the brain, I tend to take a microeconomics perspective, and the tools of analysis I use (game theory and the solution concepts of Nash equilibrium and Pareto optimality) stem from the field. My research concerns how the brain allocates energetic resources and how this strategic allocation (""decision-making"") changes under different circumstances, particularly when constraints are imposed on available resources. In this sense, it has given me insight into how actions on a smaller scale, such as the ""decisions"" of neurons to fire or functional networks to activate, lead to macroscale phenomena such as cognition.Much neuroscience research still concerns disentangling high-level phenomena to their distinct sources (for example, the forward and inverse problems in EEG) and determining the relationship between macroscale behaviors, mesoscale psychophysical signals, and microscale biophysical details.But it's not as simple as you think. The brain demonstrates emergence, meaning it has properties its constituents do not have on their own. The interaction of lower-level parts, such as neurons, leads to unpredictable high-level outcomes, such as thoughts and behaviors. As you can imagine, this makes connecting the levels pretty damn hard.The same goes for microeconomics and macroeconomics when describing the decisions of individual consumers and the fluctuations of the stock market, for instance. Finding the links between what you do understand and what you don't is key.You might remember from your economics class that there are three main factors driving production: land, labor, and capital. The same goes for the production of thoughts and behaviors.The neural territory of your brain is quite valuable, especially considering that the expanse of ""land"" (grey and white matter) your brain has to operate on decreases with age and disease.Grey matter, named so because it appears grey to the naked eye, is made up of the cell bodies of nerve cells. Several studies report an association between general intelligence and the volume of grey matter tissue in regions of the brain responsible for memory, attention, and language. Along the same lines, decreased grey matter tissue is found in conditions such as language impairment.Grey matter is usually the subject of most research on changes in the brain with age and disease, but let's not forget about grey matter's counterpart, white matter. White matter mainly consists of myelinated axons that transmit electrical signals between neurons, and several studies have shown white matter structure is altered when you learn a new skill. Decreased white matter is associated with old age and impaired cognitive functioning, just like grey matter.The labor of your brain's worker neurons is what drives the execution of all processes in your brain. Different neurons are responsible for encoding different types of information, and are recruited for specialized tasks based on which systems they belong to. For example, neurons in the auditory cortex are responsible for processing different frequencies of sound, while neurons in the visual cortex are responsible for processing visual information and representing objects.By forming ""unions"" and harnessing the power of synchronous firing, these tiny employees produce an incredible variety of activity patterns. But when your neurons decide to regress to a state of anarchy (for example, by forming a cult of overly-synchronous followers) or go on strike and starve to death (for example, by refusing to use glucose in the case of neuronal insulin resistance), it's bad news for your brain. Fewer functional workers =less efficient processing and communication of information, which is a signature of neurological diseases.Capital is the liquid gold that runs through our veins and capillaries, the so-called ""currency of neural transactions"" - energy. Well, I call it that. While the term is a bit vague, we're most often referring to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A good circulation of ATP capital is extremely important, as the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides is highly expensive. In fact, the brain consumes ~20% of the body's energy budget, an exceptionally large amount relative to its small body mass.More capital is put into circulation by the consumption and metabolization of glucose by neurons. Specifically, ATP is produced through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation that occurs within the neuron. ATP production rapidly adjusts to changes in energy demand so that more energy can be generated to sustain neural activity. In fact, neurons may be able to increase their own glycolysis in response to stimulation.In economics, scarcity refers to the gap between limited - that is, scarce - resources and theoretically limitless wants. People are forced to prioritize basic needs over frivolous spending and allocate time, effort, money, etc., accordingly.Our brain functions in the same way, as it is constantly operating in an environment of scarce resources. Take, for example, multitasking, which is a misnomer since the brain is physically incapable of simultaneously performing multiple tasks. You simply cannot divide your attention, which is why in actuality, your brain is just switching between different tasks really quickly.To this end, the brain has evolved to have systems (i.e., the frontoparietal control, dorsal attention network, and ventral attention networks) responsible for deciding what's important and what's not. (Unfortunately, this sometimes fails in the case of texting while driving. Stay safe, kids.)The point is that your brain can't go around swiping its father's credit card at every store it wants. When the cashier tells your brain that the card has been declined, this means you're either burnt out or dead, depending on what the resource in question is.The example above discusses attention as a resource, but let's talk a bit more about two more critical resources: oxygen and glucose. The brain has to be really careful about using its supply of oxygen and glucose wisely. Remember when I said, ""you're either burnt out or dead, depending on what the resource in question is,"" a few sentences ago? Well, in the case of oxygen and glucose, the consequence of careless spending is death, or at least accelerated death.Here's the deal. Every moment of every day, with every task you undertake - whether it's doing laundry or watching a movie - different brain systems are being recruited to help you perform those tasks. When the worker neurons in the visual cortex department receive a request to help you watch a movie, they'll fire exclusively to features of this task.As long as the request is in place (the task is not completed), these neurons receive glucose and oxygen to help them sustain their activity. Once the resources stop flowing, the neurons return to their inactive states. They're not gonna work no overtime shifts if they're not compensated.If the neurons don't feel like they're getting enough resources to sustain activity during execution of the task, they kick into union mode and call for an immediate increase in wages. In more technical terms, the neurons' increased consumption of resources triggers a signal which results in more resources being allocated to their system. Supply and demand, baby.You might be wondering who's the big cheese, the top banana, the kingpin, the one who's deciding the second-to-second budget. Well, neuroscientists call this mysterious but powerful figure the Central Executive System (CES), whose role is to coordinate the systems involved in the different tasks. Various studies offer models for the CES's process of making decisions regarding resource allocation (see this paper for a cool mathematical model). But in general, the CES tries to maximize performance while minimizing expenditure - in essence, an optimization problem.So we've talked about how glucose is a vital resource in the brain, how it's the primary source of fuel neurons. But what happens when there's inflation and your one unit of glucose is now worth a fraction of its original value? Or when the Federal Reserve of Glucose goes bankrupt?Just as inflation in economics is a fall in the purchasing value of money, what I call ""glucose inflation"" is a fall in the fueling power of glucose. Glucose inflation occurs when you flood your body with so much glucose that your cells become resistant to insulin (a hormone that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood) and can't use sugar for energy. This is what happens in the case of type 2 diabetes.People with diabetes are more likely to develop neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, which is now being called type 3 diabetes. A growing body of evidence from studies suggests that the insulin resistance you see in type 2 diabetes plays a role in the neurodegeneration you see in Alzheimer's.""Glucose bankruptcy"" occurs when you enter a state of starvation or ultra-low glucose consumption, such as when you're on the keto diet.Now, this may sound bad, but the Federal Reserve of Glucose always has a backup plan - in particular, a secret stash of ketones to be used in case of emergency.Here's an excerpt from another article I wrote to explain how it works:Here's the interesting part: Bain effects of insulin resistance can be counteracted by using alternate metabolic pathways, such as metabolizing ketones rather than glucose. Insulin-resistant neurons that ""starve"" as they lose their ability to use glucose can potentially use ketones as an alternate fuel source. In other words, adopting the keto diet can help people with insulin resistance get the nutrients they need and fuel their brains.Does this mean you should throw out all of the carbs in your fridge and pantry and buy a week's supply of T-bone steaks? No, or at least not necessarily. The best thing you can do is maintain a healthy, balanced diet. And, of course, consult with a doctor before you make any drastic changes.

Welcome to Educating: How to nail home-schooling after half term!,"Reassurances from a teacher out of the game; exams, rote learning, desk time. Home-schooling is the most difficult thing you will encounter as the modern parent especially after the 'holidays'. Tackling the task after half term with some tips from an ex-educator on how to get on track with your teaching with less stress.I bet you're feeling completely exhausted already with the idea of homework and trying to recall calculus and exactly how many types of adjectives there are. That's right...there is more than one type of adjective, several types of noun, a multitude of words that you don't know; generally every piece of information you were promised was the most important thing you would ever learn has slowly dripped out of your ear.You vaguely remember 'Romeo and Juliet' because of Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes...and Gatsby bares a striking resemblance to Romeo...regardless of the couple of centuries difference. The French revolution was accompanied by a dramatic overture, full orchestra, several costume changes and lasted only 2 hours with a 20 minute interval to reinforce the barricade- curtain drop at 180 degrees angle at a speed to match the final crescendo and that is determined by the equation...wait-what?Worry not intrepid, ""untrained"" educator! These are actually some pretty amazing platforms to begin lessons! I'm not going to recommend that you deviate entirely from curriculum but I am going to advise you to chill out. Seriously...chill out. Home-schooling is daunting but there are a few things you can do as a parent to keep yourself sane throughout the process.   First, lets acknowledge three things:  1. No teacher ever spends 100% of the time giving 100% of their attention to your little angel, and neither should you. So don't feel so bad about not having eyeballs in the back of your head. You're allowed to get frustrated, especially as you aren't even being -paid- to do this! And you're allowed to be bored of it. So, so super bored that even you are propping both sets of eyes eyes open with matchsticks.   2. Children are not learning avoidant; they are school avoidant. Because school, aside from play-time, is a boring exercise of opening your mouth and swallowing the spoon full of curriculum and regurgitating it onto paper. Kind of like being forced to eat the same soup over and over and over. Eventually, you lose your appetite.3. No teacher, doctor, yoga instructor, carpenter, psychologist has ever made it through an entire day without either planning for certain questions to be asked, or holding off on answering questions in order to haul their butt to Google.The government has handed out resources; online classes, interactive education time with the teacher, peer-to-peer networking through zoom and organised playtimes within bubbles. Fantastic! The ""new normal"" only appears ""new"" unto the ""old routine"". Teaching is taking a step back in time. There are likely to be many teething issues...and temptations to confiscate Fortnight/Animal Crossing for days, weeks, months (""UNTIL THE END OF TIME!"")   At the end of 2019, the common family routine for the average child was thus:  7:00 am: Breakfast 7:30 am: Teeth n dress 8:15am: Drive to school 8:30am: Drop off pending traffic WORK WORK BREAK WORK LUNCH WORK (sung Rhianna style) 3:15pm: Pick up from school. 3:30 pm: Insert home routine of choice but usually dinner at 6:00 and bed by 8:30/9:00pm 2021 has given you something incredible; a moment to observe. You, as a parent, do know your child better than you have ever known them before. Typical scenario, you had a part in making their cells, otherwise you've imprinted all your little eccentricities and weirdness onto them. If you're new to home-schooling, it's likely they will surprise you with what they can do and what they can do. You will feel, at times, like the best parent and worst teacher; at others, the worst parent and the best teacher.I bet you didn't know they could name every dinosaur in alphabetical order. And I also bet you didn't know they could nail a head shot with a pencil sharpener from 20 feet (several times in a row) but you do now!If I have learned anything working across a multitude of settings, by the two-week post holiday mark, you'll think you'll have it nailed and then they will turn the tables on you and you're going to be partially bald trying to force down that extra ladle of the alphabet.You are not screwing up; family ethos and morals do not, in the slightest, line up with curriculum or statutory policy. Even if you're paid to be objective, even if you've known the sticky fingered monster all your life; it is humanly impossible to make that child finish the plate every single time.Your urge to fulfil the curriculum is constantly met with 6 major obsticals:  1. Your individual mood2. Their individual mood3. Your mood towards them4. Their mood towards you5. Your perspective on what you're teaching6. Their perspective on what they're learningIn the ideal word, a teacher wouldn't sacrifice any of the above for the sake of a test score. I don't think I'm alone when I say, as an educator, how much I cannot stand standardized testing. I hate exams, I hate strict curriculum and, my top personal loathing, children asking permission to use the toilet. Let's be honest, I know I only went to the toilet a handful of the times I asked and, I'm pretty sure every single one of my teachers thought I had chronic cystisis!I'm going to harken to a time long past when war was with guns and an entire village was destroyed. Reggio Emillia, long standing Italian community, was a bombed-out wreck and the first thing the community did was rebuild the school building. With a dramatic decrease in resources (and teachers), the village was forced to pull together and teach as one society. Children learned practical, useful skills while gaining confidence in their community, and in themselves. Cooking, firefighting, carpentry, knitting, agriculture, prctical mathematics.This was using something I call TAC. TRUST in AUTONOMY and CONFIDENCE. And It relies so much on that very first word which, for a parent who subconciously trusts in spoon feeding, or a child who is used to being spoon-fed, is not the easiest thing to grasp. Trust. In the safe environment of a school, and in this case, your home, it generally doesn't matter a toot where your child is going to do whatever it is they want to do as long as they say ""I will be back in 10 minutes"".   Unless you live in Disney World, the chances are that your child will return, ready to learn more. Children are only human which means, sometimes, they will want to do the child derivative of making a cup of tea to avoid things that they find boring or annoying. Including looking at your face (I'm sure you're beautiful, too).You, as a now home-schooling parent, are in the fortuitous position of trusting them to do so without a SENCO, a headteacher or the janitor reporting a rogue child. You won't be hauled into head office for not tackling them and ramming a protractor down their throat.So here are a few tips for home-schooling:1. Build a routine that works for all of you; regardless of what classes are scheduled that day and when. These are not ""normal times"" or ""normal days"". But most importantly, there is no such thing as a ""normal family"". If you are all terrible at getting up early, start at 10:30am. If you naturally make your way to bed at 10:30pm, form your day around the natural life of your family. Routine is vital to child development; but relative to when you are all prepared to learn and prepared for a break.  2. If you're bored and are struggling to manage teaching without falling asleep, imagine how bored your child is. Take your attention span and quarter it and then add impatience. So change it up! Look at your child and consider that you could be doing the writing on the sheet while they tell you the answers. You could be narrating a story to build their vocabulary but they have to write it down for you. Reverse roles, change it up and throw out the old ideas of what teaching was.3. Use your own hobbies, your own space and your own resources to be more inventive with learning. The best classroom is no classroom at all, 4 walls and a roof are limiting! Create safe-spaces, inspiring places for free and open learning.  4. Trust your older child! Here's some history for you! There was once an entire educational school founded by a dude named Maxwell based on this: Children actually learn better from their more knowledgeable peers than they do adults. It's called the Zone of Proximal Development (or ZPD). Not all the time. If you have a spare 10 year old, take advantage of that; delegate! The great philosopher Willy Wonka once said """"I don't want a grown-up person at all. A grown-up won't listen to me; he won't learn. He will try to do things his own way and not mine. So I have to have a child.""5. Use your community! When you think broadly, the things we are taught in school are information without context; strike that and reverse it and you can begin giving a child the ability to apply practical knowledge while learning. Children under the age of 18 are not formally required to shield (though I thoroughly recommend the highest safety measures of a mask, hand washing and limited travel) as so contact a green thumbed neighbour, your baking buddy, your arty friend, and see if they are willing to share an hour to engage in a practical class!6. Learning can be fun nearly 100% of the time. It's perseverance that tends to be the thing children struggle with. If you, as their teacher, take care of your mental, physical and emotional well-being and teach what you understand to be important, or teach what they believe to be important, there is far less resistance to learning.Parents have the great fortune to teach their children in a way that we old fossils in education never could. It is a golden age for learning and understanding your child. Forget the exams and focus on enjoyment in teaching, and your children will focus on learning for enjoyment!",https://miro.medium.com/max/11136/0*XByFVEM46TF_becv,https://philippa-cooper88.medium.com/welcome-to-educating-how-to-nail-home-schooling-e259f25293f9,education,ebc7cd1caa498f25940b9f4b63772c87a614c4218595461a79a6706f
How To Diversify Your Income As A Freelance Writer,"After a somewhat faltering start, I've finally broken through the noise on Upwork and landed my first ""gig"" as a freelance writer there.Thanks are due to the advice received from the wonderful community at /r/freelancewriters and a couple of participants in particular (to protect people's anonymity, they will be left anonymous). Thanks are also due to the diminishing container of caffeine pills on my desk and spending a lot of time sending in proposals over the past few days.Signing up to Upwork was not a natural decision for me. To date, I have preferred to cultivate clients from direct sources. Periodically, I have explored working on Upwork and then thrown in the towel in frustration.But I believe it's worth trying to land business there for no other reason than that it provides freelance writers with another source from which to land clients.This, in turn, speaks to the importance of diversifying one's income. Which any investment advisor will tell you is an axiomatic principle of sound financial planning.Here are some of the ways in which one can diversify one's income while still participating in the crazy world of freelance writing.This week, I have gone from working exclusively with direct clients to opening another channel of working with clients through marketplaces.In addition to Upwork, one can find freelance writing projects on Fiverr and a long tail of smaller marketplaces that connect those providing freelance services and those buying them.I've discussed the various ways in which one can find freelance clients on this publication before.They include:Inbound marketing - such as using content marketing to market your content marketing writing business! - is the one that a lot of writers neglect. I joined the party about four years late and wish that I had got going sooner.If you're currently only relying on outbound (or inbound) to land business, then open up the other channel in order to widen your exposure.I'm going to be transparent here.When people tell me that they only work with local freelancing clients - because doing business internationally is ""too difficult"" - I sit there silently judging them. Yes, really.Does that make me a judgmental and disagreeable person? Quite possibly. But I mean well (I think).These days services such as Zoom, TransferWise, and Payoneer have all made it easy to work with clients both in your local market and across the ocean. Yes, one faces the threat of currency rate fluctuations by doing so (and right now the USD:NIS currency pair is particularly volatile). But I believe that that is a small price to pay for broadening the pool of clients you could be working with by an order of magnitudes. Think big. Trade globally.I've written before about how pigeon-holding yourself into one writing niche can mean that you end up writing about the same topic over and over again. This gets boring fast. Trust me.""Niche down"" is one of the most basic pieces of advice that gets bandied about in writing forums. But equally I believe that one can go too far and limit oneself to too small a target market.Those mathematically-minded could probably model exactly what level of niche is optimal (if you're done the workings, please be in touch). As I'm not a market analyst I will leave you with the suggestion to ""go niche, but not too niche.""Freelance writing authorities differ in terms of the ""maximum client income percentage"" that they suggest one should aim for. I've never seen anybody call it the MCIP, but I'm happy to coin the term (just remember who you heard it from first!).Common recommendations, however, are 20% and 33%. That is to say that no one client should constitute greater than that amount of your income.One obvious way to lower your average MCIP is to take on more clients. There are those who suggest that a well-diversified portfolio of freelance clients can provide one with better income stability than working a job can (in which case one's eggs are in the basket of one employer). Although I can't say that I've gotten to such a lofty position, I tend to agree with that idea.Of course, no matter how many countries you work with and channels you receive leads from, you're inevitably going to run into the realization that you only have so many hours in a day with which to work. Even a prodigious supply of caffeine pills cannot circumvent that limitation.This is where passive income comes into play. Note: I am suggesting, including to myself, and not teaching: at the time of writing I have no significant passive income sources.Common passive income sources which freelance writers develop include:Freelance writers are currently navigating a precarious time in the market with a glut of supply from those recently joining the race for quality clients.While the globalized nature of the freelance marketplace is in some respects a challenge, in others it can be thought of as an opportunity. There are more sources to tap than was previously the case and remote work has been normalized thanks to the pandemic.Widening one's lead sources, working with different geographies, and developing passive as well as active income sources are just some of the ways in which freelance writers can diversify their income.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1790/1*TMwEA355EIPgUgKS7ONmFw.png,https://medium.com/freelance-writing/how-to-diversify-your-income-as-a-freelance-writer-13a7c15844ad,freelancing,ec90b9b22deb9f6eff9b768b52cbe8c8be2aea5d5fa7aa759321ce02
"Supporting Diversity, Inclusion and Equity in Neuroscience","More than 300 biomedical researchers came together virtually this summer for CZI's annual Neurodegeneration Challenge Network meeting. While there was plenty of cutting-edge research on the agenda, there was also critical dialogue about the field itself, including a conversation about fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in science with Gentry Patrick and Gene Yeo, who are both professors at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego). Patrick is a Professor of Neurobiology who is spearheading an effort to increase diversity in STEM fields called PATHways to STEM (PATHS), and Yeo is a Professor of Cellular and Molecular Medicine who recently launched the Diversity and Science Lecture (DASL) series to celebrate the achievements of underrepresented graduate students and postdocs.""Science and STEM fields are not immune from the forces of systemic racism, prejudice and lack of inclusion. We have a duty to look at our own communities and figure out what we as a network and as independent labs can do to support DEI in neuroscience research,"" said CZI Science Program Officer Katja Brose, who facilitated the conversation.The Neurodegeneration Challenge Network is a collaborative research network that brings together scientists, physicians, and engineers to understand the biological roots of neurodegenerative diseases and develop new ways to prevent and treat them. The vision is a community and network that is more than the sum of its parts. By bringing together trainees, early career researchers, and senior scientists from around the world and across research fields, the Neurodegeneration Challenge Network aims to open up new possibilities for understanding neurodegeneration and support the work of talented and motivated people who are moving science forward.Patrick and Yeo believe that the first steps to action and change are listening and learning. With that in mind, they shared their personal experiences and the work they have each been doing to create more diverse and inclusive communities in science. The following is an edited excerpt of their conversation.Katja Brose: Gentry, can you tell us how your childhood experiences shaped who you are today?Gentry Patrick: I grew up in South Central Los Angeles, in Compton, California. My mom had me when she was 16 years old, and I didn't know much about science or how to pursue a scientific career. When I look back now, as a full professor, it's hard to figure out how that happened. But when I dig into it, I know the most important things along my career path were to fall in love with science, find my STEM identity, and realize that I could excel at science - and ultimately, that I might be able to impact other people's lives through access, mentorship, and advocacy.While I was training to be a scientist, three passionate women neuroscientists - Erin O'Shea, then Li-Huei Tsai, and my postdoc advisor Erin Schuman - were powerhouse supervisors and champions for my career. They weren't just mentors - they were advocates. Their advocacy was really important, because even though I was a smart kid, there are lots of smart kids from my community who didn't end up where I did. Having these amazing mentors and advocates really made a difference. Sure, some of my success was serendipity, but that was paired with finding my community and taking the opportunities that came with it. Mentorship and community drive success, especially for young scientists who are finding their STEM identities.Brose: You mentioned there were a lot of smart kids in your community. How do you take luck out of the equation and create a world where more capable, hardworking kids can achieve similar opportunities?Patrick: Like I said, I'm not an anomaly. There are a lot of young kids who can contribute to the world of science, including neuroscience and neurodegeneration research. It's a matter of providing them the space. If you think about someone like me, coming from the inner city where no one in my family had gone to college and science was an unknown, one interaction with a scientist isn't going to be enough to propel that person to a full career in science. They're going to need multiple interactions - and not just interactions, but also help defining how science is important to their self-identity and to their career.Brose: Gene, you also have a successful career in science. How has your background influenced your work?Gene Yeo: First, let me add a comment about the idea of serendipity or luck. Louis Pasteur said, ""Fortune favors the prepared mind."" In a sense, there's an ability to build structures that create more opportunities for luck.I was born in Singapore. When I was growing up, it was a developing country of two million people. There were no bathrooms in my parents' homes. Fast-forward to today when every kid in Singapore has an iPad or computer. How did it happen? Some people tell us it's luck. But that's not true. Echoing Pasteur, I think structures can be developed to minimize risk and favor more opportunities.I'll give you an example. After Singapore became independent in 1965, one of its biggest problems was housing. How do you house a multitude of people who came together from all over the world? The government decided to fund housing publicly, but they designed it so that every housing block had the same ratio of people from different ethnic groups. The government wanted to minimize enclaves where only Chinese or Indian families or Malays lived, because then you don't learn from one another or build racial and religious tolerance.In Singapore, men also have to do military service. We all go through basic boot camp, no matter your race, religion, or economic status. In a way, it levels the playing field and creates opportunities for individuals to meet one another across societal barriers. And you make friends that you would never have met if everybody continued on the career path that your economic background enabled you to. Those friendships are critical for maintaining a common vision for how you succeed together.Those are the lessons that reverberated with me when I was growing up and that made me think about how to create equity. And I think they can help us as we build our own labs.Brose: That's a good segue to the diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives you are both working on, and how what you've learned could be applied to other institutions. Gentry, let's start with your work on the PATHways to STEM (PATHS), an expansion of the Meyerhoff Scholars Program, which helps to inspire, recruit, and retain underrepresented students pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees in STEM fields. How did you come to develop this program at UC San Diego?Patrick: Around 2015, I was working in my lab and got stuck in a bit of a rut. I wanted to do more. I wanted to impact the community, both locally and across the country. I started to think about what I could do to begin to change the way we bring in and train underserved students in STEM fields. I looked at my life and experience, and out of that, I extracted the three pillars of the PATHS program: access, mentorship, and advocacy.For me, it really was about access, and with that access, I began to grow my self-identity and make use of the mentorship that was in and around me. I found the common threads that allowed me to take advantage of that community.At PATHS, the students get a four-year scholarship and personalized academic support. We build a family unit, so there are graduate advocates and academic coaches for math, physics, biology, and writing. We take a holistic approach for personal, academic, financial, and community-based support - and I will say, it is working.Brose: Where is PATHS today and how have recent events, including George Floyd's murder and the subsequent protests against police brutality, influenced your thinking about the program?Patrick: We have two PATHS cohorts at UC San Diego right now - rising juniors and rising sophomores. They are doing extremely well, breaking out of the mold or out of what's typically expected for students from the fourth and fifth quintile or from underserved populations. Typically, you hear stories like, ""I went to college and I had a really rough first year, two, or three, and then I figured it out and I climbed back."" But that's not what we want for these students. We want them to achieve academic success early on and to help them understand where they're going to go and how to get there and find that story for themselves.We don't have all the answers. However, I believe that the current U.S. reckoning with racial injustice is not a moment. It is not a movement. It is really an awakening from which we can begin to create a community that drives success for everyone.Brose: Gene, how are you bringing conversations about diversity, equity, and inclusion to a broader community at UC San Diego, including people who may have only been peripherally attentive to these issues in the past?Yeo: One thing we quickly initiated is the Diversity and Science Lecture (DASL) series. It provides a forum for the community to teach each other about these issues and share our own experiences. Very early on, we decided that students and trainees should be empowered. We want to hear from the students and trainees about their science as well as their personal experiences growing up, including the challenges they have faced. The goal is to raise awareness and help others surmount similar barriers in the future.So far, the students and postdocs organizing it are doing an amazing job. They came up with the principles of being instructive, gracious, and joyful: instructive, by focusing on the science but also by using the science to introduce concepts of diversity, inclusion, and equity; gracious, to make sure that in these sessions and panel discussions, people are gracious; and, lastly, joyful, as a model of celebrating contributions and mentorship.UC San Diego, the Scripps Institute, the Salk Institute and Sanford Burnham Conrad Prebys are contributing speakers, and we're thinking of expanding this beyond science but also to the humanities.There are many initiatives underway, but DASL is an example of how we have tried to harness what initially were very hostile emotions into something positive and creative.Patrick: I just want to add that that simple title - ""Diversity and Science Lectures"" - actually means a lot because most people don't consider academic excellence and diversity as going hand-in-hand. So when we showcase that, when we lean in and seek to understand other people, then we find those common threads that bring us together.We're doing a similar thing in biology that we call Connections, where a faculty member and a graduate student or postdoc share their stories in science. Storytelling is something that allows people to see each other through their entire career trajectory, from a kid with a paper route to becoming a famous scientist. That's the type of thing that breaks down the barriers and allows us to find our humanity in all of this craziness right now.Gentry Patrick is a Professor of Neurobiology in the Division of Biological Sciences at the University of California, San Diego, where he studies the role of protein degradation in synaptic plasticity. He is also the founder and Executive Director of PATHways to STEM (PATHS), an expansion of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County's Meyerhoff Scholars Program. With CZI support, UC San Diego and the University of California, Berkeley are implementing aspects of the nationally recognized Meyerhoff Scholars Program.Gene Yeo is a Professor of Cellular and Molecular Medicine and a Co-director of the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Graduate Program, also at UC San Diego, where he helped launch the Diversity and Science Lecture (DASL) series.

Why You Should Always Pick Content Marketing over Paid Advertising,"There is no right or wrong here as both types of marketing are essential for most businesses. As a B2B or B2C marketer, you can still generate plenty of leads using content marketing or paid advertising, as both channels can be very effective.However, let's be realistic - not everyone can afford paid advertising, similarly like not everyone has the time and patience to wait for the results from content marketing.When you are comparing paid advertising and content marketing, look at the long-term gains.I heard a great comparison between content marketing and paid advertising. It's like comparing renting your home and owning it.By paying your rent, you get the benefits immediately - a place to live, access to facilities, ""free"" equipment that comes together - but it has no long-term gain.Meanwhile, each mortgage payment has a benefit for your future. Nevertheless, by owning your own home, you don't have to abide by your landlord's rules.Similarly, content marketing gives you the freedom in terms of word counts, image sizes, or messaging. You are likely to build a stronger brand affinity and engage with the customer. Content marketing also allows you to create something that is much more personal and beneficial to your customer.So, in the end, are you looking for a quick gain or a long-term benefit? Often, a combination of both is what companies could choose; however, don't ignore the importance of content marketing.Originally published at www.edgaraskatinas.com",https://miro.medium.com/max/7176/0*MgYNg4pGC8ZVMp3R,https://medium.com/swlh/why-you-should-always-pick-content-marketing-over-paid-advertising-12af11119572,marketing,ece232177df86408a5f2330f643dbd8411ca9fac58279e6e4574dee7
10 Habits of Likable Leaders,"Likability isn't required in leadership, but it sure does help.I've been studying and practicing leadership for 25 years. I was thrust into it as a young Marine recruit who found himself in charge of 75 other recruits. It was a trial-by-fire introduction but I soon learned to relish it.Since then, I've run a business, led in corporate and government settings, and served as a volunteer baseball coach and Cubmaster for my son's Pack.I've seen leaders people didn't like who got the job done. But the ones people did like got a lot more done in a more efficient way and everyone was a lot happier doing it.In other words, likability is the icing on your leadership cake.Here are a few ways I, science, and Einstein have found to be a likable boss.It's really hard to like someone who doesn't like you. Likable leaders like people first.A scientific principle called the reciprocity of attraction proves exactly this point - people like people who like them.It's hard to like everyone as a leader. Some people are just abrasive. Some are just socially unaware or rude. So what? That makes them unique.Some people have a good reason for being difficult. Maybe marriage problems at home or kids in trouble at school. A lot of things can make people seem less likable. But when you realize they have struggles you may never know about, your heart can soften towards them. This enables them to like you back.Try to like everyone no matter how likable they are. You'll find something to like in everyone eventually if you keep looking.When the people who work for you are judging you as a leader, the first things they look for are warmth and competence according to this study.They look for warmth so they know the quality of your intentions for them. They look for competence to know whether you can deliver on those intentions.I've always thought of these two things as components of the ""happy warrior"" concept. I define a happy warrior as someone who works hard and effectively, while keeping an air of can-do hope, optimism, and goodness around them despite circumstances.It's easy to follow a warm and competent ""happy warrior.""When we are brave enough to drop the camouflage of conformity, we appear as we truly are - uniquely ourselves.Most people are afraid to let themselves shine through. They've built a mask they think they need to get by socially. Most of us do this to some degree so it's OK, but when we see someone brave enough to really be themself, it's inspiring.If someone's immaturity or fear has them clinging to conformity, they may resent your boldness, but don't let those wet blankets discourage you from being you.Admitting when you are wrong is another way to be authentic. Those bosses who never admit fault simply aren't authentic people. Acknowledging imperfection is a likable trait in a leader.So be you. Even if not everyone likes it. Most people will. The people who matter will.It's better to be hated for who you are than loved for who you're not.So just be you and let the chips fall where they may - they fall favorably more often this way.A boss who can't walk in the shoes of those they lead will never be a great one.Empathy is one of the most critical soft skills in leadership. When a leader doesn't have it, they often can't make wise decisions about strategy.Like a mountain-climbing rope, empathy is the thin, yet strong bond that keeps the leader and their people on the same course. If that bond is broken then the boss and the team wander apart and can never reach the summit.A boss should always be thinking about what they'd want a boss to do in any situation, then do that.If a leader can always keep one foot in their follower's shoes, they'll always know which way their followers are heading, then can correct course if needed.A leader is like a symphony conductor of emotions and motivations. A leader always sets the emotional tone. A good leader sets a positive one.Emotions are proven to be contagious, especially from leader to follower.This is called emotional contagion and is defined as:Your followers will receive the emotions you project, internalize them, then reflect them. So choose wisely what you project.The best leaders project hope, resolve, competence, enthusiasm, humility, truth, and even love.The fires of failure and fear can be extinguished with hope.A good boss always looks for the seedlings sprouting through the ashes, then waters them. I've never known any good leaders who wallow in despair.They acknowledge difficulty or failure but meet both of them with hope and optimism.Anything less than hope is a form of despair. And no one wants to follow a leader on that dark path.You aren't better than those you lead.Without them, you could accomplish nothing. Remembering this puts a leader in the mindset of humility.The best leaders project a confident humility.Arrogance, the opposite of humility, is simply insecurity wearing bravado - not a good look on a leader.Likable leaders genuinely care about those they lead. They ask real, not pandering, questions and listen hard to the answer.Think of the last time someone gave you their undivided attention - phone down - lips closed with no words ready to gush forth. Eyes fixed on you.It's a special occasion and so rare, especially today with our i-umbilical cords of information always at the ready.I know that the people who listen to what I say the most are also those I like the most - probably not coincidence!Albert Einstein said:He knew that no one should be put on a pedestal above anyone else. Sure, we all have different accomplishments, but so what. That's surface stuff. Our souls are all on the same plane.My mom showed me this growing up. She rubbed elbows with some pretty important people in her work, but she treated the disabled man who sold flowers on the corner with the same kindness and genuine respect she showed the power-brokers she worked with.We can take a lesson from my mom and Einstein.Treat EVERYONE with the respect and dignity they deserve as human beings.""When I look at a person, I see a person - not a rank, not a class, not a title."" - Criss JamiThere's a phenomenon called spontaneous trait transference which means:Are you as a boss complaining or gossiping about your boss or that customer or that lousy person over there?If so, that negativity is being applied to you by all listening. Sure, you need to blow off steam and call out horrible actions but limit how much you degrade other humans, even the bad ones.Instead, talk people up. Talk all about how good the good people you know are. This way, all that goodness is now being attributed to you.To other people, you are what you say others are.In this way, you can choose how people see you by what you choose to say about others.Choose positive things to say more often to be more likable.Like I said in the beginning, you can lead without being liked, but it's so much better to be liked. So much easier. Likability is your leadership cake's icing.To recap:If you do these things, there's simply no way you can't be a more likable boss. Doing these things makes you more than just a ""boss"" though.It makes you a leader people want to follow.A leader people truly love to follow.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10000/1*8HVckbp_9qiHqmTg3RG26g.jpeg,https://emaxklein.medium.com/10-ways-to-be-a-more-likable-boss-92c08c1daa6d,leadership,ee1dafd9f574888824b4b349b5f360d9bc0b333426c46502a7cedf40
A Small World? WhatsApp's Big Misinformation Problem,"by Stephanie Hankey""We just want to keep it small,"" were the words I heard from the representative of the messaging service WhatsApp, now used by over 2 billion people worldwide. I was standing in Menlo Park, California, in the middle of a street lined with shops serving muffins and pizzas. But there were two strange things about this street: firstly, everything in the shops was free; and secondly, it was bustling with thousands of Facebook workers. This is what it is like to step inside the real world of Facebook - as well as Instagram and WhatsApp, which they own and with whom they share a headquarters. On one level it looked and sounded the same as the world most of us inhabit, but fundamentally nothing is quite the way the rest of us experience it.Before entering this street I had to wait in a room wallpapered with protest posters, staffed by a man in a relaxed uniform who shouted 'welcome in!' in a celebratory tone to all who entered. I stood at a touch screen and scrolled through pages of small print before being prompted to sign 'I agree'. Like getting access to a secret world, once I signed, I could enter. Despite being a critic of the big tech platforms, it was not the first time I had been allowed in to the free 'Facebook street', which feels like a mix between the Truman Show and The Circle, but it was the first time I had met a representative from WhatsApp. The representative, from their communications and policy department, engaged in earnest tones. We talked about the report my organisation Tactical Tech, and its partners in Brazil, Colombia, Kenya, Malaysia and India, had published on the negative use of WhatsApp in elections. In these countries, many experience WhatsApp as the internet and receive the majority of their news and election materials through it - whether real or not. It felt like a cordial walk and talk with a sensible colleague. As our half hour drew to an end, the man who worked for a company that earns over $500 million a day and has over 25,000 employees turned to me and said: ""We'd love to do more, but we just don't have the resources.""Two years later, I wonder what that street looks like now. Deserted, like the streets of all other cities. The engineers, designers, marketeers, managers, researchers and policy people are no longer sitting on benches next to manicured green spaces while munching free snacks, but wearing their corporate hoodies in the shelter of their home offices, looking at their global community from the vantage point of their laptops. The free street has emptied out; yet the rest of us, behind our closed doors, are more reliant on WhatsApp than ever.For most of us, coronavirus is the topic we want to avoid at dinner and the one we wake up in the morning and realise still exists. The current health crisis is bringing to the surface all the things that already barely work in our lives and societies and stretching them to breaking point, from strained domestic arrangements to overburdened credit cards, from gig economy workers to greedy landlords, and from neglected communities to under-resourced health services. The crisis emerging on WhatsApp is no different. Although WhatsApp may help us feel like we can do more with less, this moment of dependency from so many communities also amplifies its faults. With all eyes on the parent company, Facebook has downplayed WhatsApp's significance in the public eye and not done enough to identify and fix challenges in advance. WhatsApp has certainly taken steps to 'introduce friction' in messaging, continuously reducing the number of recipients to whom you can easily send a heavily forwarded message (from 250 at once a few years ago down to 20, then five last year, and as of today just one at a time). This change has served to reduce the intentional and easy dissemination of malicious misinformation. However, content shared on WhatsApp is truly viral - a contact point of one person at a time still works much the same way as the pandemic itself. Yet WhatsApp has known about this problem for some time. Putting in place new measures in the middle of a crisis, rather than beforehand, suggests that they are only acting now in order to save face. The real question is: what more should they be doing, now that the spotlight is on them?The buzzword at Facebook is 'community'. It indicates a shared purpose: Zuckerberg's vision of 'connecting the world one community at a time'. As a self-appointed goal, it's admirable. Communities are for the good times - the joy of connection, love of sharing and solidarity with others - and we have seen that more than ever in this global pandemic. We might feel closer to our own personal community of friends and family than before the lockdown. WhatsApp now brings me my brother from Australia straight into my living room by video, twice a week - I drink a coffee, he drinks a beer - we chat about politics and life, just like the old days. It's a small world. What's not to love? We don't even have to know the people WhatsApp brings us to feel the sense of community. They are there in your hand as you watch a video of thousands clapping from balconies in appreciation of health workers, in a city you've never been to, filmed by people you don't know, yet witnessed at the precise moment it is convenient for you to engage with the world. A mini theatre of human kindness and faith. It's a beautiful thing.Now we have proof: WhatsApp can facilitate feelings of community amongst its users during the good times and the bad. Yet, as with many things in Silicon Valley, 'community as business' is at best a metaphor. The last few years have shown that big tech companies can't only sell us the benefits and ignore the challenges. Facebook has struggled to rein in a range of public scandals, from Facebook Live being used to broadcast a tragic massacre of 51 people in New Zealand to the thousands of people whose personal data was abused by Cambridge Analytica. They have left us wondering how a company that claims to know so much about community knows so little about people. Yet, despite the efforts of many civil society groups and journalists to highlight the impact of Facebook-owned WhatsApp on hate speech, misinformation and elections worldwide, WhatsApp has escaped the same scrutiny. The smaller sibling has sheltered under the shadow of its bigger brother. Until now WhatsApp has largely gone unscrutinised.WhatsApp is so powerful because it is so deeply intimate. Messages you really want to read are mixed with those you don't. Rumours, gossip, leaks and inside jokes are pushed to you directly. The fact that these images, videos and soundbites are visibly amateur - the highlighted screenshot, the shaky mobile phone video or the badly recorded Skype call - makes them feel all the more 'evidential' and somehow more 'authentic'. This is partly why misinformation on such platforms gets so much traction with an older generation who may not have developed the same level of digital scepticism as their children and grandchildren. To social media users this may all sound familiar, but WhatsApp gets to us in a different way. It has all the characteristics of something you would trust, yet none of the qualities.The media reports daily on misinformation and fake news, but these still play on our deepest hopes, fears, biases and values. Crisis is teaching us that there are lots of types of misinformation on WhatsApp:As the crisis goes on the examples will change but the problems will remain. Some of these misinformation nuggets are harmless but others create public confusion, entrench differences and extend generational and political divides. Some may even cost lives. In places like Brazil, where WhatsApp is zero-rated - without data charges on a mobile phone - these stories are even more powerful as users can't always verify them elsewhere. As coronavirus misinformation is reshared and embellished, its validity becomes stronger in an ever-tightening social loop: is Paracetamol better than Ibuprofen? Who knows anymore?The elephant in the room is encryption. Because messages are encrypted, WhatsApp can't read what people are saying, but they can still see who is sending messages to whom, from where and how often. This is why WhatsApp cannot use automation to identify and remove fake news, as Facebook and others do. The inability to read content algorithmically is now the main argument used by those who want to remove encryption for national security reasons. Yet this is misguided. Focusing on encryption as the problem threatens to remove WhatsApp's strengths - privacy and the protection of its users from targeted advertising - without successfully countering its weaknesses.We need to start by looking at the systemic nature of the problem. It is important to create simple checks and balances that slow down the unnecessary malicious spread of misinformation, but we need to do better than that. We cannot allow a company to talk about a platform with 2 billion users being personal and 'small'. Equally, in looking for solutions, we cannot treat digital platforms as though they don't mix. It cannot only be companies self-imposing solutions one platform at a time. Information moves from encrypted channel to non-encrypted channel and back again. My 70-year-old father can find a video on TikTok (yes, he uses it), forward it to my family WhatsApp group, and my mother in a different part of the country reposts it to her friends on Facebook. That's how misinformation really moves. Platforms are just the surfaces on which our viral information sits before it is picked up and passed on. Much ado has been made about the 'like' button in the 'attention economy' but it's time to start talking about the 'share' button in the 'misinformation economy'.We have to fundamentally change the way all platforms work and start holding them to account in their dual role as neutral content carriers and media providers. As a long-term battle on this issue plays out in the policy world, we need to start working on misinformation resilience in the real world.Trusted local and global institutions working in health and community participation need to be given limitless support across platforms to distribute expert information without users being tracked. There needs to be 'no-strings-attached' support to the trusted independent media institutions that many governments and digital platforms have destroyed, allowing them to do their job gathering evidence and providing well-researched stories. Independent fact-checking efforts should be strengthened and made widely accessible (Agence France-Presse (AFP) Fact Check's daily resource 'Busting coronavirus myths' is an education in itself). Citizens themselves need to become more resilient, and independent non-profits need to be given the resources to ensure users are digitally literate and can understand, verify and make their own choices about what they are seeing.When it comes to WhatsApp, they need to invest in their team. They need to own their widespread impact on the world and echo this with a diverse, cross-discipline team with real-world global experience and a range of ethical, social, cultural and political expertise that works in collaboration with engineers and designers, not just on policy and PR. They need to invest in countries where they have a negative impact, but do not have offices: collaborating with and acting on the advice of local groups who know and understand their own environment and the challenges they face.That day in the sunshine two years ago, standing on the 'free street' at Facebook's headquarters, WhatsApp was already a problem waiting to happen. They chose to do the minimum possible. Now it is time to turn public scrutiny towards WhatsApp, along with all the other platforms. And it is time for Facebook to own the responsibility that 'keeping it small' brings with 2 billion users across the world.Stephanie Hankey is the Executive Director of Tactical Tech, an international NGO working in public education on the impact of technology on society.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2048/1*JVSGpzgk_XU7VnaDBi1Q2A.jpeg,https://medium.com/@Info_Activism/a-small-world-whatsapps-big-misinformation-problem-52171fd21f7f,social-media,ee5d603111ab3b28e79e349c5196bfbeadc02da95b3ce85325bad634
Talk with Your Customer,"Here's a harsh truth: you can survive for a while with usability or performance issues, but without the core value of a product, you have nothing. Customers don't have to buy your products and users don't have to use your features. They will only do so if they perceive real value.That's why you should spend the majority of your efforts accessing the value of your product. And, for this, you need to be an expert on the customer/user: their issues, their pains, their desires, how they think, etc. You're shooting blind until you understand those.One great tool you can use to get this deep knowledge is talking with them. It sounds very easy on paper, but there are a few hacks you need to know to make these conversations worth it.Before you can serve everyone, you have to serve someone. When you don't have a clear sense of who you're serving, you end up talking to a lot of different types of people, which leads to confusing signals.Getting specific about who your ideal customers are allows you to filter out all the noise that comes from everyone else. If you aren't finding consistent problems and goals, you don't yet have a specific enough customer segment.If you don't know what you're trying to learn, don't waste now your conversation shots. You won't be able to moderate the conversations and you won't be able to make sense out of the answers.First, think about what your current big questions are and make a point to face the scary ones. Think about what would need to have happened for your product/idea to be a big failure. And, in the opposite direction, think about what would have to be true for your product/idea to be a huge success. Validating these might be your learning goals.You've sliced a specific customer segment and you've got a tangible sense of who you can go talk to and where you can find them. You also know what you want to learn from them. If conversations are the right tool, then it's time to go and ask for conversations.But how do you do it? Isn't it awkward to start this kind of conversation out of the blue? Well, the right explanation and framing can do wonders.The important bit is to provide context without any bias. Your idea never needs to enter the equation, and shouldn't.Great news, you landed a batch of conversations! People are willing to talk and help you. Now you have to make those conversations as useful and truthful as possible.I have a few tricks and tips to help you with that. (Most of them I read them first in the book The Mom Test, go on and read it as well.)It's easier to start with what you shouldn't do:Awful question. Here's the thing: only the market knows. Everything else is just opinion. And anyone will say your idea is great if you're annoying enough about it. People will lie to you if they think it's what you want to hear, that's how nice they are.You're not here to collect compliments and the main source of compliment-creation is seeking approval. But people's approval doesn't make your product better.Another awful question. Of course they might, someday. That doesn't mean they will. Anything involving the future is an optimistic lie.You don't need to end up with what you wanted to hear to have a good conversation. You just need to get to the truth. To get toward this truth, reject generic claims and promises. Instead, anchor them toward the actions they're already taking (more about this below).You can't count on customers to tell you what to build. They don't know what is possible. Historically, in the vast majority of innovations, customers had no idea that what they now love was even a possibility.You'll hear a lot of requests though. What should you do then? Instead of writing it on your to-do list and then move on, take a moment to understand the motivations behind the request.Customers might not know the best way to solve their problems, but they know what their problems are. Don't waste this opportunity to dig around to find the root cause.Now onto what you should do:A useful conversation should give you concrete facts about your customers' lives. The idea is to be fishing for their problems, cares, constraints, and goals. Addressing those, in turn, will allow you to improve your product.Quick note: before zooming in into something they share, make sure it matters. Most people have lots of problems which they don't actually care enough about to fix, but which they'll happily tell you the details of if you ask them.If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, it's not that big of a problem and you shouldn't spend much time on it.When diving into details, we already know that opinions on the future are worthless. To get real data, you need to ask about their life as it already is. You need to ask about concrete examples in the past.Last but definitely not least, actively listen and give as little information as possible about your idea. The more you're talking, the less you're learning, and the more you are biasing the customer. Your responsibility is to ask good questions to nudge the discussion in a useful direction.If you are ever stuck with nothing else to ask at an awkward timing, encourage them to keep on going or pick up on something they were emotional about before.After a batch of conversations, your goal should be to have the learnings in your team's head and not only yours. Everyone will benefit from it: it will keep you all in sync, prevent arguments and lead to better decisions.Make sure to review the main takeaways of the conversations with them, as well as any problems you ran into. You'll probably want to write them down as well, for future reference.Does it end here? Sure not! You'll have to update your beliefs and plans. Also, check what could be improved on the conversation's process and decide on your next learning goals.",,https://claudiatd.medium.com/talk-with-your-customer-6e8ff84f98d8,ux,ee16d20186102c10cc0c43897cf56625f0b1d17f3ec5e8f192e6d76a
We Are Going To Be 10 Years Old Again This Valentine's,"I am single, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to sulk my way through Valentine's day.Just as love is powerful, so is friendship. And that's what I'm going to do for that time of the month for the first time due to the pandemic.Reuniting with my two best friends virtually.We were always together back then, and nothing seems to be able to keep us apart.How we were first able to connect was because we had the same hobbies and interests, and we just loved to joke around in class that made the teachers angry. There was a time they even had to separate us into different classes because we were just inseparable no matter which desks they assigned us to. That was probably how we became close friends ever since.Today, we managed to meet and feel like we were still the 10-year-olds we met in school all those years ago even if the three of us live in different parts of the world. We did lose touch at some point but for some reason, it just seems like we missed each other no matter the distance. We were and are truly best friends.I suppose I should tell you how we were able to get back to each other after all those years of not being able to keep in touch for a while.It's funny how asking a friend whether they have time for us is like begging someone to be in a relationship with us. Because the truth is, it kind of feels like it.Ever since we all graduated college, we weren't able to contact each other as often as before. We were so busy with our own lives, getting along with new friends, and a little bit of forgetting the past.We also have a group chat, but it's very silent, only ringing during New Year's or Christmas. I think we once tried to keep in touch with each other, but we were all so caught up with our own lives that we didn't reply to each other, thus the origin of rejection. So keeping in touch was once in a blue moon.When the pandemic hit, it gave me more reason to contact them again.Around August of 2020, the hype of the game ""Among Us"" began booming. People were sharing their stories on social media on playing the game with their friends, even school friends!So I thought of doing the same thing. I asked my friends again whether they'd like to play this game together, and thankfully, they said yes.We picked a date to free our time so we could all meet up, and on that day, we saw each other via Discord. That was when we were all able to reunite and played together again like we used to.Although the game's trend didn't last long and we only played it twice, it gave us a chance to be able to talk to each other. While we were playing, we were able to have a short conversation.I think it's because we knew each other very well, we didn't care about each other's status. All we cared about was that we got to see each other and played together again like we used to.When we were young, we'd usually meet up in each other's house and play video games together or just play online games together. We played a lot of things - back then, we were crazy about Pokemon, Dragon Nest, Call of Duty, Left 4 Dead, and so many other games we were able to play together.Now that we are in our 20s and able to reunite and play together again is like having a time machine that takes us back 11 years ago. We played together like we were kids again, we were so competitive, eager to win, and cursing amongst ourselves. That moment alone was very special to all of us.But unlike when we were kids where we only spoke about the game, this time, our session was way different.The thing about growing up is that our conversations became more personal than just about hobbies and interests this time. Unlike last time when we did manage to keep in touch for a while during college, we were mostly talking about the games we played and what's going on around the world.But now, I felt like we were opening up to each other.Unlike last time, I think we knew the importance of keeping in touch again.After we played, we had enough time for each other to speak about how we're doing in our lives, and I felt, from the conversation alone, it seems we were closer now.This time, we also shared our problems together like it was a therapy session. We talked about how we were struggling with our jobs, the people we had to deal with, how we were all feeling with those. We have never done this before, being this open was never what we intended to do, it just happened. And from that alone, we became closer.In a reunion, this was bound to happen, and I'm glad it did.We shared our memories together. All the things we did in the past, we brought it out to the table. It mostly consisted of silly stories, all the crazy things we did at school, and how it got us into trouble. It was the funniest moment to share as we retold our past.The best story we shared was the time when we were in Primary five when the teachers tried to separate us because we were constantly talking to one another. Our form teacher assigned our desks to be far apart from each other and this kept happening until we were in eighth grade where we were assigned to different classrooms. That was probably our highlight during our school years, driving the teachers insane that they had to find a way to separate us.It really felt like it was just yesterday when we retold these stories. It didn't feel like 10 years had passed, and we were all acting like a bunch of fools laughing at each other and just spending a great time together. And this time, without video games.This Valentine's Day will be the first time we meet up for it and I've never been this excited about it even though we are still single. Just like when the teachers tried to separate us, life tried to do the same thing.Except that we would constantly get back to each other and act like little kids. And our adult lives aren't any different.We set a time to meet up virtually since we all live in different time zones and planned to bring chocolate and wine. This way, we can enjoy the things most couples would enjoy giving each other during Valentine's as we, once again, share our stories together.Valentine's Day means that we need to express our love to the person we care about. But that doesn't always mean we need to be in a relationship to enjoy the day.Reuniting with my best friends last year taught me it's okay to be single and we can still celebrate that day together.I love my best friends, and I am happy to be able to celebrate Valentine's with them. I love our moments together where we laugh and talk about silly things that made me feel like I was that 10-year-old kid during simpler times.And I definitely can't wait until Valentine's Day arrives this year.",https://miro.medium.com/max/7306/0*_Dy1llC2tgIAOYsa,https://psiloveyou.xyz/we-are-going-to-be-10-years-old-again-this-valentines-94f5b95c27dc,gaming,eeba5a486f8ef2e63fc1739b07d9ef8e1355e4f7b72d74005dd3fe52
The Dark Side of the Gig Economy,"8 Ways the Gig Economy can sink you""At least I have a job.""That's what a lot of workers tell themselves when they take on part-time, temporary employment. Better to stay on with a company as an on-call worker than risk not finding another contract, better to be furloughed than fired. These are decisions many have had to make since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. But while part-time gig work is a life-line, it can also be a liability, as more and more of us accept job insecurity and poor labor standards as just another fact of life.How did we get here?The term ""gig"", initially used by jazz musicians to refer to performance work, started to be used in reference to the job market after the 2008 financial crisis, when young graduates entering the workforce could only find temporary ""gig work"", as opposed to traditional fixed-term employment.Since 2009, the on-demand labor market has only grown, with an estimated 35% of the U.S. workforce engaged in the gig economy in 2016.The International Labor Organization reports that part-time ""un-standard"" employment is a growing trend worldwide that many accept because they have no other viable options. In 2016 61% of men and 63% of women in the E.U. admitted they were working on a part-time basis because they could not find full-time employment. While The Brookings Institute estimates that informal labor arrangements are already the de facto model in many developing countries.Digital platforms make cross-border employment easier than ever before. You can just as easily hire a web designer from Cambodia as Canada. While U.S. based digital platforms such as Upwork and Freelancer were the first to facilitate cross-border on-demand hiring, developing countries are not far behind, with the appearance of regional platforms such as Zhubajie in China and eRezeki in Malaysia. Some countries have even gone as far as creating their own digital platforms to help people find gig work, such as The Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC). While crowd-sourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk also make it easier for companies to outsource a growing array of technical work.In developed countries, it is estimated that half of all new jobs created are in the gig economy. In the US, an estimated one in every three workers is a gig worker, a workforce collectively generating an estimated $1 trillion in revenues, or 5% of GDP every year.In her 2016 book, The Gig Economy, Diane Mulcahy writes that the gig economy allows workers to ""arc (their) own journey and create (their) own path"" whereas ""(f)ull time employees are the most expensive and least flexible source of labor for companies"".Every day articles appear online detailing the ongoing ""revolution to the workforce"", telling us how ""flexible work"" is changing how we all live and work for the better, allowing us to earn more while enjoying more free time. In 2019, CNBC reported that, on average, skilled freelancers make 70% more than their traditionally employed counterparts, while countless surveys conducted by freelancer platforms extol the benefits of the gig economy.So, isn't it all good news?Unfortunately not. If you scratch the surface of the gig economy, you find things aren't as rosy as they seem. There are several pitfalls for gig workers that much of the literature glosses over.The pandemic has drawn attention to the fragility of an economic system that chooses on-demand labor over long-term economic structural reform.In the U.K., the Association of Independent Professionals and Self-Employed (IPSE) and PeoplePerHour estimate that self-employed workers have seen their income fall by at least 25% across all sectors since the beginning of the pandemic.In the US over 22 million workers have lost their jobs, bringing the unemployment rate to close to 15%. However, while traditionally employed workers who are laid off receive unemployment benefits, many gig and self-employed workers receive no such indemnities for cancelled contracts and lost work opportunities. Even after the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program passed in the US, only half of US states chose to pay unemployment assistance to gig and self-employed workers.Knowing your labor rights and what costs to expect while working in the gig economy is complicated by the fact that gig workers may be classified in several different ways. While some may have ""contingent"" contractual arrangements - meaning they do not have an implicit or explicit contract for long-term employment, others may have ""alternative employment contracts - such as independent contractors, consultants, and freelancers.Others still may be classified as self-employed, including so-called ""nonemployers"" -entrepreneurs who are self-employed and operate very small unincorporated businesses with no employees. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of nonemployers rose by nearly 1 million in the U.S. between 2003 and 2013.There are costs involved in all forms of gig work, from self-employment tax to health care expenses, vehicle insurance to savings, and pension schemes; gig and self-employed workers are at a disadvantage when it comes to the scope and scale of costs they have to cover out of pocket. For this reason, many put their savings into their businesses, leaving them vulnerable later in life. In the U.K., estimates suggest that over 55% of self-employed people do not have pensions and that in the coming ten years; over 3.3 million more won't have retirement savings.Login to any freelancer platform and you'll find prices and time frames continually being slashed. A White Paper in 24 hours for under $50? Sure, no problem. A 1,000-word article for under $15? Okeydokey.In an environment where more and more gig workers compete for fewer jobs, how can you avoid a race to the bottom?With a surplus labor force competing globally for jobs, basing your services on price alone can get you into trouble, leading to a downward spiral of cutting corners, selecting the cheapest production options only to generate more of the same generic content already out there in the market.Instead of focusing on price, Seth Godin argues you should concentrate on a critical service or product currently unavailable in the market that will allow you to build a 'minimum viable audience' to sustain your business.Gig workers are often treated like employees without receiving any of the benefits.The number of gig workers continues to grow in large part due to the increasing number of employers choosing to convert traditionally employed workers to contract workers. This trend is rising amidst the pandemic, and some sources estimate that over 50% of the U.S. workforce will be freelance by 2027.A report by the Institute for New Economic Thinking investigates companies' double standards when down-grading employees to independent contractors. The INET study, focuses on the courier-service Dynamex and highlights the deteriorating working conditions for couriers after being converted from employees to contractors. Under the new contractual arrangement, couriers were expected to wear the company uniform and respond to delivery dispatches within 24-hours or risk being liable for losses to the company while having to cover their own vehicle and insurance costs and receiving none of the pension and healthcare benefits of regular employees.Some lawmakers have recently cottoned on to these employment double-standards and tried to pass legislation to protect contract workers. However, attempts to strengthen employment laws to protect gig-workers often backfires, as recently happened when California legislators passed a law to protect gig workers that ended up costing two hundred freelance writers their contracts with Vox Media.A 2018 Paypal survey reported that 51% of freelancers have experienced not getting paid for their work, while a survey conducted by the IPSE in the U.K. found that, on average, freelancers lost an estimated £5,934 a year by working for free.Companies often hire contractors to solve particular problems or work on short-term projects to enhance a specific business segment. But these projects can often prove to be a massive loss of time and investment all around, with gig workers compensated on a part-time or hourly basis while working on a project that requires a much larger real-time investment to complete.These kinds of projects can often degenerate into a vicious cycle of unrealistic expectations and poor remuneration prospects. Worse still, a company may often dangle a contract extension as an incentive, or threaten termination, to keep a gig worker trapped into delivering more work faster.Pitching for work, providing free content, getting your name out, there are standard things you hear when you're starting out in the gig economy. Those starting out will spend a lot of time pitching for work, with some estimates suggesting as much as 70% of a gig worker's time is spent on marketing in the early stages of business, which leaves them little time to focus on responding to their existing clients and developing new products and services.Constantly having to pitch for work can feel like speed dating and gives both the gig worker and the prospective client minimal incentive to invest in a long term working relationship, with the feeling there is always a better client or gig-worker out there, if you just keep looking.While companies continue to cut costs by outsourcing 'non-core' business segments, from I.T. to Human Resources, many restructuring plans involve projects, that while being meticulously planned, are often unsuccessful in achieving their objectives. The on-demand labor market leads to contract speed-dating that often translates into a lot of wasted time and energy, with evidence suggesting many projects are never completed.A study carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers of 10,000 projects conducted by 200 companies in thirty countries across various industries found that only 2.5% of companies completed all of their projects. Similarly, Harvard Business Review found that 70% of I.T. projects run over schedule, with 27% going 200% over budget.In his book The Fissured Workplace, David Weil argues that the process of outsourcing jobs leads to more outsourcing, creating a fissure in the workplace, leaving ""many without fair and decent wages, a career path, and a safe work environment.""Weil argues that a worker's earning-potential falls dramatically when he or she is converted from a regular employee to a contract worker. In particular, low-income contract workers work under increasingly difficult labor and safety conditions and no longer have the prospect of working their way up in a company over the long run.The most insidious aspect of outsourcing jobs is that those who are earning the least are affected the most. As profit margins decrease the further down the chain you go, it's common for companies to cut corners on labor and safety standards for those who are already in a precarious economic situation.In the U.S., the minimum wage has stagnated at $7.25 since 2009 despite inflation and a continued recession. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage in 1968 was $10.90, nearly $4 more than the current rate. As a result, some of those most affected by companies' growing propensity to hire temporary contractors over full-time employees have been those doing ""unskilled"" labor-intensive work.Financial insecurity among gig and self-employed workers is a significant source of stress, anxiety and depression. Research indicates there is a strong correlation between job loss and the inability to find work or return to the labor market and mental health issues. A recent survey of music industry workers recently found that financial instability was a significant cause of mental health issues among artists and industry professionals with close to 70% reporting high levels of depression and anxiety. While a Canadian study reported that nearly three out of ten millennials are depressed or anxious as a result of their employment situation.Recently there has been more discussion about improved labor standards and safeguards for workers within the gig economy, but it's still early days. In April 2020, the International Labor Organization (ILO) published a paper suggesting ways to protect gig and self-employed workers.The report highlights the need for more precise employment definitions to avoid workers being falsely categorized and excluded from benefit schemes. It goes on to suggest some protection safe-guards, such as allowing for the portability of social protection rights and entitlements, which would allow gig and self-employed workers to contribute towards pension plans and receive adequate social security payments later on.(1) Avoid delivering a final product / service before you've been paid.(2) Always use a contract, specifying the scope, time frame, and payment schedule. You can find many free contract templates online, including this one.(3) Avoid difficult clients, a.k.a clients with unrealistic expectations, clients who are unwilling to pay standard rates for your services, and clients who consistently require you provide them with free work (or samples).(4) Avoid discounting. Contrary to popular belief, it undermines your work and the value of your services.(5) Focus on finding a few quality clients and stick with them.(6) Join associations in your area of business; they can provide a wealth of information and support and can, in some cases, help you with collective insurance and savings plans.Value your time, value your work. Don't let the gig economy sink you before you can swim.",https://miro.medium.com/max/7364/1*UOcX6RMoNOzKxzh2TLzHwA.jpeg,https://medium.com/blankpage/the-dark-side-of-the-gig-economy-e60b91e00535,freelancing,ef89863e1437bf3e6bb5b29a334aa0107a932f7d810e3a7b78912ec2
Jonathan Fishbeck of EstateSpace: 5 Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before Became A CEO,"As part of my series about the leadership lessons of accomplished business leaders, I had the pleasure of interviewing Jonathan Fishbeck,, Founder & CEO of EstateSpace.Jonathan B Fishbeck is the founder and CEO of EstateSpace, LLC, a technology platform that enables and simplifies how you handle lifestyle management service and operations to maintain real-property assets to help reduce risk and protect wealth succession. EstateSpace is a licensed Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP) in order to support our enterprise clients.Before devoting his work fulltime to EstateSpace, Jonathan served as the Founder and CEO at a design-build firm whose focus was advising, designing, constructing and operationalizing sizable estate properties for ultra-high net worth families and family offices. It's this experience and expertise combined with Jonathan's technology background that was the genesis for EstateSpace.The firm is family funded and operates as a modern business model (MBM) consisting of three main components. Packaged offerings with a multi-sided subscription model, a marketplace for all sides to interact and AI machine learning to personalize each experience.In addition to being a technology provider, Jonathan serves a number of philanthropic organizations where his passion for helping veterans, children, and cancer research shines through. These positions and organizations include Co-Chairman, Fisher House Foundation, Board Member, Children's Voice International and Board Member, There Goes My Hero, respectively.Thank you so much for joining us! Can you tell us a story about what brought you to this specific career path?Out of college, I had a passion for art and science, and found a beautiful marriage of the two in design-build construction. It was during this time where I was able to serve UHNW families, work with private service professionals and family offices, and gain insights into the operational aspects. I also witnessed the good and the bad that came with estate management, from lavish parties to sibling divorce of real-property assets, and knew technology could help people through these situations. This was the inspiration for EstateSpace, the idea that we could help everyone we ever met come together and design family asset management to best serve everyone involved, while creating an everlasting positive impact.Can you tell us a story about the hard times that you faced when you first started your journey?Each time I started up a new venture, all the same challenges came with the journeys. Figuring out where to start this particular venture was by far the hardest challenge. The vision is enormous, the market is endless, and staying focused seemed impossible at first.Where did you get the drive to continue even though things were so hard?We exist to help people. Some of these people even included our own family members and personal family asset management. So, after years of research and development we knew that no one before ever got it right, and that no one quite got exactly what we were going to do with estate management and how we were going to do it (even after sharing the vision). Our hardest moments were met with great people who came into our lives. We also got great advice, at the right time, and we listened.So, how are things going today? How did grit and resilience lead to your eventual success?Today we're still in the beginning stages of business for EstateSpace, but things are going very well. Never giving up is easier said than done. It's actually exhausting. But we stay motivated by loving what we do, having a peerless drive to help the families we service, and working with an amazing group of people. We all believe this company is on a path to be the world's #1 private platform for luxury business and family offices. Those are the things that make it easy for us to never give up.Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?Prior to starting my first company, I wanted to present well. I had business cards made and shirts, hats, and other apparel designed. Then I decided the name was wrong, my title was incorrect, and that I didn't like the logo. So that business became known as a ""t-shirt company,"" one of two in my career. Yes, I made the same mistake twice.What do you think makes your company stand out? Can you share a story?We always go back to the ""why we exist."" Simon Sinek has been a great inspiration in this aspect of the company, which has led to an amazing culture at EstateSpace. We believe in building relationships and that by leading with the ""why"" you surround yourself with likeminded people. We believe that within seconds you can know if you like someone, within minutes you can know if you want to keep talking to them and know if you ever want to talk with them again. If you start with your why, you save yourself time. This has served me well.Which tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not ""burn out""? This is one of the 5 things I wish I knew before I started...""Slow Down to Speed Up"" is something I learned only a couple of years ago. By slowing down, you can take a breath, be methodical, and really think through the path ahead. Then you can execute a well thought out plan the first time. I believe that everything is 70% preparation and 30% execution. This will do two things for you: 1) it saves time and eliminates a tremendous amount of rework and 2) it allows you to be even more agile. If you're intimate with every detail in the plan, you can process new information and apply it with a higher degree of confidence. I have a couple of great mentors to thank for this great lesson in business and life.None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story?Most of my life, my mentor was my father, a successful entrepreneur whom I was able to absorb, observe, and listen to for the past 30+ years. Most recently, Mark Wallace and Barry Libert came into my life at the exact right time. The company was not where I wanted it to or intended it to be. This was one of the hardest times in business I have had in almost 20 years. I lost focus, exaggerated the situation, and lost the vision in the clutter.As I sat in Barry's kitchen outside of Boston, he continued to ask me the same question over and over until he heard the right answer. I didn't fit Barry's typical client. Knowing this, I asked him why he took me on. He said, ""You're a smart guy, with a great idea and most importantly you're a good person."" These two men helped me get back to clarity, turn the business around, and find success. It took 20 months to clutter it up and every bit of that time to get back in focus. I'm forever grateful for them. The best part about this story is that professionally things are better but personally my relationships are improved beyond measure and that is what life's all about.How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world?Looking back on everything good in my life, more than anything I want to be a better husband, father, son, and friend. I've had service in my heart for as long as I can remember. At a young age I got really good advice from my father on philanthropic ventures, ""if you have the passion for something and the time to commit to help a cause, then go for it."" From there I joined my first board and have served countless non-profits with time, money, and experience for 18+ years. We've helped raise over $35M in that time and have touched so many lives. This is the legacy that I want to outlive any of my professional accomplishments.What are your ""5 things I wish someone told me before I started leading my company"" and why. Please share a story or example for each.First, find a mentor who can help you personally and professionally. I mentor entrepreneurs who are trying to get started. No one part of a business is harder than the next, it's all tough, but getting good advice when you first start can be the costliest of lessons.Second, take care of yourself first, then take care of your family, then go to work. You're human and can only do so much. Start with taking care of yourself and your family. The work is hard enough but even harder when you're sick or preoccupied.Third, keep a flat model and work with people at all levels. Stay active, work with everyone in the company, set the ethical standard with your effort, and listen to your team. You're not perfect and you will make mistakes. A good team will tell you what they think, so you better listen and apply feedback. This makes you a better leader and the team feels heard (#thisisabigdeal).Fourth, be an active founder and leader, stay connected to your business, listen to your clients, and engage with your team.

A brief history of ion traps (for quantum information processing),"Springtime has come for the field of quantum computing. Researchers around the globe are hard at work, governments are announcing large-scale projects and new facilities, while start-ups and companies are popping up like mushrooms after the rain. One of the promising technologies for the implementation of a useful quantum computer is trapped ions. But what are these ions? And how are they trapped? Here I will try to give a brief (and by no means exhaustive) history of ion traps, and their evolution across the years toward becoming one of the building blocks for quantum computers.Our story begins in the Netherlands, in the 1930s. A young physicist named Frans Michel Penning had been conducting his doctoral research on the thermodynamics properties of gases. He was fascinated by the behaviour of different gases and discharge at very low temperatures and under specific conditions. After completing his doctoral work, he joined the Phillips research laboratory, where he was tasked with continuing research on discharge of gases. The main application for his studies at the time was the development of new lamps! While investigating discharge, he invented a device, called the Penning gauge, which used magnetic fields to accelerate electrons through a tube, and allowed a precise measurement of the pressure within the tube, a vacuum gauge [2].Fast forward to 1949, across the ocean, the physicist J. R. Pierce described in his book ""Theory and Design of Electron Beams"" an electron trap, which was able to confine electrons in a specific region of space, using a combination of electric and magnetic fields [1]. The work caught the attention of the german physicist Hans Dehmelt [5] , who was at the time working on his doctoral thesis and would move to the Unites States shortly after. He developed more in detail the mathematics describing the motion of the electrons when trapped, and was able to create the first ""magnetron"" trap and trap electrons in 1959! He named the device the Penning Trap, honouring the first efforts in studying the effects of magnetic fields on discharge by Penning. The Penning trap would later become the tool of choice to perform high precision measurements of the properties of particles such as electrons and protons.Meanwhile, back in Germany, another physicist was curious about techniques to confine charged particles. The field of mass spectroscopy, in which atoms would get ionised, and subsequently accelerated towards a detector, had been active for several years. A combination of electric and magnetic fields pushed and deflected ionised atoms on the detector according to their charge to mass ratio, allowing for a precise determination of the mass of specific substances. Wolfgang Paul [6], while at the university of Bonn, proposed in 1953 a ""New mass spectrometer without a magnetic field"". Not only this mass spectrometer did not need a magnetic field, but for certain geometries it was able to confine charged particles, opening up the opportunity of trapping ions, much like in a Penning trap, but without the need for a strong magnetic field. The Radio-frequency ion trap, also called the Paul Trap, was born.A few decades later, in 1989, Paul and Dehmelt were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics ""for the development of the ion trap technique"" [3]. Their early discoveries has given scientists the chance to study in detail the properties and spectra of atoms, as the Nobel Prize committee writes:""The properties of atoms are determined by laws of quantum mechanics that say they can have only fixed energy levels and that electromagnetic radiation with certain frequencies is emitted or absorbed when there are transitions among different energy levels. Opportunities to study the properties and spectrums of atoms are improved if individual atoms can be isolated under constant conditions for longer periods."" [3](A fun fact which amused me about Wolfgang Paul: he used to refer to Wolfgang Pauli as his imaginary part if their surnames were considered as complex numbers.)Now that we know a little about the history, let's take a closer look at ion traps! We already know there are two main kinds: the Penning trap and the Paul trap. Both kinds utilise static electric fields to confine the ions, however the static electric fields on their own cannot create a trapping region in all three dimensions. If the ions are not trapped in all directions, they can easily escape in the direction which is not confining. To ensure that the ions are trapped, one extra field is required. While the Penning trap uses a magnetic field for this, the Paul trap uses an oscillating electric field [4], [7].The original geometry for the Paul and Penning trap was the Ring 3D trap shown on the left in the illustration above [8]. The Paul ring trap had a static electric field applied to the endcaps and an oscillating electric field applied to the ring. The endcaps created confinement along the trap axis, while the ring trapped the ions in the radial plane, the plane perpendicular to the trap axis. For the Penning trap, a magnetic field was applied in the direction of the trap axis, and all ring and endcaps had static electric fields applied to them. Similarly to the Paul version, the magnetic field had the role to create confinement in the radial plane. In both cases, the ions would be trapped in the very middle of the ring.The 2D linear trap was an extension of the 3D Paul trap, but did not confine the particles along the trap axis unless extra endcaps were included. This trap was used as a mass spectrometer in the 2D configuration [7], but became the basis for later design developments for 3D Paul traps.By now, you might be asking yourself ""why is there a (for quantum information processing) in the title, and when is that stuff going to come up? It feels like we are still talking about mass spectrometers!"". Hang in there, we are getting to it!With the ability to confine charged particles in a stable manner for extended period of times came the opportunity to start studying in detail the properties of the particles, and to study their interactions with their environment and external fields. Several techniques were developed to allow scientists to control the trapped particles and manipulate them, reaching regimes which were previously inaccessible, with David Wineland being one of the pioneers of the field. One such technique was laser cooling, thanks to which the energy of the trapped ions is lowered by its interaction with laser light.The field was very exciting and offered very interesting avenues not only in the field of spectroscopy and precision measurements but also towards studying quantum mechanical effects. In 1995, Ignatio Cirac and Peter Zoller, proposed a way to implement the quantum equivalent of a classical gate, a quantum gate, using cold trapped ions [9]. Their proposal ignited a whole new research direction: quantum computation with trapped ions. The field has been growing ever since, and has focused not only on trapped ions but on a variety of other platforms such as superconducting circuits, solid state-based quantum systems, neutral atoms, photons etc.As the needs and expectations from the humble trapped ions changed and grew, it was time to rethink the original Paul trap design. The linear Paul trap with endcaps was transformed into the rod trap, made up of cylindrical segmented rods, and later into the blade trap, to allow for a larger optical access angle, to send in and collect light emitted by the ions. These traps were still macroscopic, with dimensions in the order of centimeters in size.As trapped ions showed better and better performance as qubits, or quantum bits, the long term goal of building a quantum computer out of them imposed requirements on the size of the traps. It became necessary to be able to shrink down the devices and work on making them more scalable. The macroscopic Paul trap was miniaturised, and two main microfabricated designs emerged: the 3D microfabricated trap and the surface (or planar) trap. Microfabricated traps went from centimeters to millimeters in size. The ions were now trapped tens to hundreds of micrometers away from the electrodes.Microfabricated 3D traps are made by stacking a number of individual wafers on top of each other. The wafers are either made of conductive materials, or insulating materials that are subsequently coated in metal to create electrodes. The ion sits at the centre of the stack, and sees a field landscape very similar to that generated by the original linear trap. These traps create deep trap for the ions, and can be operated at room temperature down to cryogenic temperatures of a few degrees Kelvin. However, their fabrication and assembly is fairly troublesome and the reproducibility is low.On the other hand, surface traps are made of a single wafer which is patterned using commercial technologies and lithography techniques. The ion(s) is trapped above the surface, and can be as close as a few tens of micrometers to the surface of the electrodes. Due to their relatively easier fabrication, these traps are a promising candidate when it comes to scaling up the devices to be able to trap many ions.The design of innovative Paul traps is an active field of research, and as new fabrication technologies are developed, more opportunities present themselves. Lots of exciting developments are unravelling, such as the integration of optical elements in the trap wafers themselves to deliver the necessary laser light to perform quantum gates.And what about Penning traps? While being extensively used in precision measurements, they have also found applications in quantum simulations and many-body physics such as in [11], and are following a similar trajectory to Paul traps in the realm of quantum computations.Lots of engineering efforts, research collaborations and innovative design will be necessary to transition from trapping tens of ions to trapping thousands of them, the coming years will be full of really exciting research!About the authorChiara Decaroli is a physicist working towards her PhD in the field of trapped-ion quantum information processing. She focuses on designing and fabricating ion traps. She is also a freelance scientific illustrator and loves all things sci comm.

"5 Content Writing Tips For Beginners To Get 10,000+ Monthly Views","Finding the best content writing tips for beginners online is hard for two reasons:We're all caught up in following the ""basic rules of content writing"" as well that we don't pay attention to actually writing sh*t that's dynamite. That has flair. That shows our unique personality as bloggers.We're just trying to follow a system, but that doesn't matter all that much.If you're brand new to influencing, here's a few content writing tips for beginners.These days we hear so much about Wordpress that we forget about places like Quora, LinkedIn, and Medium to get more views as a blogger.For me, I can spend 15 minutes answering 4 questions on Quora in the morning and have about 20 extra views to my blog pour in over the course of a day.That's huge, because those 20 visitors turn into roughly 40 views, as many of those visitors end up visiting other parts of my blog while they're here.That's about 1,200 views per month right there from 15 minutes of work every day. Imagine if you spent 30 minutes. An hour?You see, you can be a content writer on Quora as well. In fact, that's how famous writer Nicolas Cole built his following online. LinkedIn is the same game. If you get 10 or so likes on a LinkedIn article, you can expect to get 200-300 views EASY.My favorite underpriced platforms are Quora, LinkedIn, and Medium. Use all of these places to your advantage as a content writer.This one's easy, but often overlooked. Make sure to insert 3-4 links to recent blog posts in every new article you write.Have a Youtube channel? Put a link to a video in there, too. Instagram? That, too.Some visitors genuinely want to read all the stuff you got on a certain topic. Make sure to give it to them.This will double your content reach in and of itself. Implement it immediately.My first two content writing tips for beginners have revolved around strategy. This one revolves around headlines.Great blog post headlines stem from understanding human psychology. In essence, we want to know how to maximize our potential while avoiding our greatest weaknesses.Basically we want to know where life's land mines are and also where life's gold mines are buried.So that's why articles that promise to ""make you a better person"" or ""increase your productivity by 200%"" do so well online. We want to know how to get better.Consequently, the articles that tell us why cell phones might be causing cancer or about the ""5 driving mistakes you're probably making"" do so well also. We want to know what we're doing wrong just as much as what we need to do right.I've written over 500 blog posts online, and trust me, this is the only lesson you need to keep in mind when writing your own headline. 99% of online content boils down to this.The best of my content writing tips for beginners is this one.NETWORK. I am a top writer on Medium with 50,000 followers or so, and I'm good friends with Anthony Moore, Niklas Göke, Michael Thompson, and so many other top writers with more than 20,000 followers.We help each other out. We shout out each other's blog posts, tell people about each other's webinar, and generally drive lots of traffic to each other's work.This is the BIGGEST mistake I see content creators making. You need to get help from other people.If you're on LinkedIn, try to find a bunch of creators that put out regular content and make a ""group"" where you share your articles. You can then decide to ""like"" them when appropriate or even share them to your own audience.Create Slack Channels. Facebook Groups. I don't care - just get going with meeting other influencers - this is the best time investment you can make to be honest.My biggest pet peeve with content writers is that they're essentially just robots. They stuff a bunch of keywords into a post, follow a structure, then post and leave it. They respond to comments with a nice:""Thanks!""But never anything more. In other words, there's no substance there. There's no way for the audience to ""access"" who these people are to build trust. And they need that, because without this, ain't nobody coming back to read you.So make sure to respond thoughtfully, have conversations, and even, *gasp* shout out people who may have commented on past blog posts in new ones or even write new content based off questions they asked.I promise, this content always seems to do the best in the long run.Those are just a few content writing tips for beginners.What did you think?",https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*pUtE2uIC-j1Vqrnh,https://medium.com/finding-tom/5-content-writing-tips-for-beginners-to-get-10-000-monthly-views-b68409cb2a0f,marketing,f6b69bc3ccfd70a9d27f7593c1bde2a4a9dd376133336ec313402a21
Let's Get It: Author Motivation 101,"When I look at the money I make from writing, I can hardly believe my eyes. So I don't. I turn on Thug Motivation 101, and listen to Jeezy say the same thing he said when I was in high school, ""You gotta believe...""There's a reason the stereotypical image of the starving writer exists. If you want to make money, go into finance or tech. Like music, writing is a blockhead's business. But if you're a blockhead and you want to go into business, then all you can do is count it.The day I seriously started figuring out how to make money as an author, the first place I started was how I spent my time and energy - and what money that made. This is the equivalent of looking at my credit card bill, wondering how it got so high, and looking at it line by line. It's like an expensive credit card bill. If you're frustrated and wondering why you're not making much money, start here...First off, there's a simple way to calculate direct earnings. For me, pitching and writing a piece for a publication can easily take 10 hours by my count. So if I'm writing for $200 per piece, then the rate would be $20/hour. That's the simple count of how a freelance writer makes money. I was always reluctant to track my time input, but I found it really useful. My time tracking app is a piece of paper and a pen. My lifehack is leaving extra lines on the page so I can add more lines - unexpected revisions, etc.But ultimately, it didn't provide an accurate picture of how much money I was earning, or how much value I was creating.Like Ryan Leslie says, you also need to count it while it multiplies. (#DOTHEMATH!) To gauge my hourly rate from direct income is simple, but it leaves out a lot of the other bread. Here are two examples:1. Residual earnings. Medium payments are a good example. Publishing a piece with a publication might earn me a $200 bonus, but it also earns me money in perpetuity as long as the Medium Partner Program is around. So let's say, for example, after two months, I've earned an extra $100 from the piece (a total of $300). My adjusted rate then would have actually been closer to $30/hour. This is tough to track - sample size is too small for a good average - and the number is thankfully constantly moving up, so I'm figuring out how to perfect this.2. Promotional earnings. If writing a piece for Fast Company takes an hour, and on average I can sell one copy of There Is No Right Way to Do This from each piece, then it's worth $30 plus. So that rate would also be around $30/hour. I've neglected to calculate the value of credibility, links, etc.Anyway, all of this has been miraculous so far, because I suck at math and literally a decade of tutors only got me here. (Let's spin it, I'm breaking stereotypes!) The more indirect income you can make from your direct efforts, the higher your ""real"" adjusted rate will go. There are a lot of other quantitative possibilities, which I'll save for another blog post.I finally got a taste of what it felt like to be a Kanye hater: hate the tone, love the music. I didn't love the tone of William Deresiewicz's book, but I loved the subject matter. Systems and incentives have turned artists into producers now - and I think that's super true. It's how I approach my writing.Out of the tons of ways to make money writing (coaching, teaching, bundling with tech), I chose to make my writing as the product. The business model is simple. I write and sell stuff (e.g., books, reports, etc.). I promote them. I build a reputation as a writer by freelance writing and blogging. That's pretty much the model... I gave you the quantitative before, but here's the qualitative:In that sense, all five types of writing have different goals, and should be approached with different styles and time commitments. After all, I have 40 hours worth of work per week. If I put all the time into fun writing, I probably would make very little money, but if I put all my time into freelance writing then I'd be chasing a market and wouldn't have a clear direction (as was my problem with Lifehacker, where I wrote about poop, apps, saving money, career advice, and posture).These days, if I pitched every article the way I pitched a freelance piece or brand building piece, I would never be able to write this blog - I'd get fixated - and I can't think of a better way to stomp the fun out of writing. All five types of writing also have different processes and criteria.I used to apply the same set of criteria I have for craft writing to everything else, only to realize that was a brutal way to spend my time, and absolutely unnecessary. With the amount of content my strategy needs - a quantity-driven approach to quality (allowing quality to happen through a vast amount of quantity) - the criteria was too intense.Eventually, I plan to add more types of activities there. I didn't count my consulting. There are also courses and speeches. So yes, writing is the same, but not all writing is the same. Some things I noticed:As I wrapped this up, I realized that I totally missed out on another vital aspect of this, which is the value that my writing provides. It's called the lifetime value of a post. And that's what the next blog post will cover, which I'll link to from this. If you don't want to miss it, I can send it right to your inbox. Let me know!But I read a ton of books for my work, and I recommend the best three each month. Sign up for the Best of Books reading newsletter, where I send three great books to your inbox.

Why I Paid a Higher Salary to My Employees Than Myself,"Everybody that starts a company does so because they want to make a living on that. They want to make money so they can pay for the things they want. To make a company grow, they will probably have to hire employees. They cannot do everything by themselves. And to hire employees, they will need to pay for them.A typical picture in everybody's heads is that the boss is supposed to be the person that makes most of the money in a company. We are used to seeing employees complaining about money when the boss is driving a fancy car. That is how capitalism is supposed to be, right?After my company became profitable, I had a cousin that was starting a business. He was shocked that I was paying more to my employees than myself. He wanted to make a lot of money for himself but wasn't willing to invest in other people. His company never grew, and he had to close it.For many, capitalism is the land of greedy entrepreneurs and exploiters. The capitalists' main occupation is to take advantage of the needy in an attempt to maximize profits without any kind of ethical scruple, destroying human beings and the environment in the process.""Entrepreneurs are not to be trusted. They are explorers who take advantage of employees and customers."" This conclusion is false, which also creates confusion about the source of the profit. Certain individuals think that profit comes from exploiting the weak. In fact, it comes from the provision of strength.I did an 18-months internship in a gaming startup while I was doing college. It was the founder and three interns working on it. I barely was experienced, and all of a sudden, I had a lot of responsibilities. For me, it was an excellent experience as I had the opportunity to learn many different things. Unfortunately, the startup never succeed.When I started my own startup, I didn't want to hire interns. I have been working with experienced professionals and getting a lot done. I wanted to keep that happening in my company. As I was starting, I didn't want to hire people with no experience.When we start a company, we usually don't have money to pay for expensive employees. However, when we begin to make some money, we should invest in our company instead of giving ourselves better salaries. An excellent way to make more money is by hiring experienced professionals. It always amazes me when I see other entrepreneurs trying to save money by hiring less experienced professionals. Experienced professionals are expensive, but they get much more done, and by getting work done, you will make more money.When I moved to Chile in 2014 to join the Startup Chile program, I still didn't have a profitable company. At that time, I had three senior employees working with me. I was by myself living in Chile, and they were working in their homes in Brazil. Remote working was not widespread yet. I needed great professionals to help me to transform my company into a profitable one.By the end of the program, in June 2015, we achieved the goal of being a profitable company. I wouldn't have achieved that if I haven't had experience employees working with me. We were able to get much work done in seven months. If I had less experienced employees working with me, our speed wouldn't be the same, and we would end up without money.You may think that I was paying too little for myself, but that wasn't the case. I made the same amount that the employee with the lower salary. The difference between the lowest and the highest was small at that time. I was paying enough for me to survive. Although I was yet living with my mother because I didn't make enough money to afford a place by myself, I believe the investment would pay off in the future.I had my second experience with accelerator programs in the second semester of 2015. During this time, my company grew a lot, and I increased everybody's salary. It could be an opportunity for me to have the company's highest salary, but I didn't believe it was time for that yet.The three experienced employees that I had working with me made more money where they were working before. I sold them a dream, and they believed in me. My goal was for them to have their highest salary in their lives. For that, I needed to keep reinvesting money in the company and themselves.Although my three employees believed in me, I don't think they would keep working with me if I didn't show appreciation for their work. Imagine if I increased my salary much higher than theirs and start spending on fancy stuff. They would notice that and would get disappointed with me acting like that. By showing appreciation, they had much better performance and became evangelists of my company, which was very good when I hired new employees, for example.Great professionals like to work with other great professionals. They like challenges, and they like to see their work generating results. During 2016 we kept growing, and in 2017 we raised US$1 million, which helped us to grow even more. I was able to give small increases for a few quarters in a row until I finally reached my goal of providing the highest salary in the lives of my employees. I was thrilled with that. It was just after raising US$1 million that I was able to leave my mother's house and start to live by myself. I was making good money but still had some employees making a little bit more than me.We grew from five to 12 people in 2017. Paying more to my employees than myself allowed me to do that. I wouldn't have the same money to invest if I started to pay more to myself and my partners earlier. We knew that we needed to hire great professionals to keep growing. Great companies invest in developing their people and in themselves. That was what we did in 2017. As Zig Ziglar said:When I started the company in 2012, it was tough to pay for great professionals. I talked to many people, and most of them didn't want to make less money than they were making. I remember that when I asked a prospective employee how much money he was making, his answer usually shocked me, as I was far from being able to afford that amount. I am very grateful for the three employees that believed in me. I am sure they are happy with their decision as they ended up making much more money than they were making before.In 2017, I was in a completely different situation than in 2012. I was able to afford much higher salaries. As I interviewed people and asked how much they were making and how much they would like to make, no answer shocked me anymore. It was much easier to hire great professionals by having the means for that.Daniel Pink, the author of the book Drive, says that the best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table. People have to earn a living. Salary, contract payments, some benefits, a few perks are called ""baseline rewards."" If someone's baseline rewards aren't adequate or equitable, her focus will be on her situation's unfairness and the anxiety of her circumstance. You'll get very little motivation at all.After hiring, I had to keep them happy working with me, so they don't leave. I am proud to say that nobody at my company asked to leave as they did enjoy their work. People feel happy at work when they feel respected, listened to, valued, supported, entrusted with challenging and meaningful jobs that allow them to contribute to the company's mission with autonomy, power, and integrity. That is what psychologist Abraham Maslow called ""self-fulfilling work.""By paying more to my employees than myself, I was able to grow my gaming company. When we started to pay salaries above the market average, we decided it was time for the partners to make more money. We elaborate a plan to make that happen, and by the end of 2018, I had the highest salary in the company.Many people believe that capitalists and entrepreneurs can't profit without exploiting their employees. Fred Kofman, the author of the book The Meaning Revolution, believes that conscious capitalists have the deliberate intention to profit in others' service. They seek their own well-being by promoting the well-being of their investors, customers, employees, suppliers, and all those who trade with them. They understand that, in doing so, they benefit many others they don't even know.

"How 2 South Korean Companies Have Managed to Terrify Ford, VW, and the Biden Administration","This is a story of cutthroat technological war, unfathomable corporate animus, a new kind of economic nationalism, and great power competition between the two most powerful leaders in the world. The likelihood is that the rare drama will end in a settlement that could lay low one of South Korea's most powerful companies. But before then, it is a nerve-wracking spectacle that reflects the newfound tension rife in international batteries and electric cars.In a case involving two relatively unknown South Korean companies, the International Trade Commission (ITC) , on Wednesday, barred the import of batteries meant to power the new electric Ford F-150 pickup, the most popular line of vehicles in the country for four straight decades. The batteries, made by South Korean giant SK innovation (SKI), were also intended for VW's new crossover SUV, called the ID.4, which the German carmaker has planned to make in the U.S. to compete with the Tesla Model Y. But now, both companies must find another battery.The draconian ruling favors LG Chem, SKI's blood enemy in the ruthless South Korean battery business. Their loathing is perhaps understandable: they are both at the very cutting edge of current lithium-ion technology, and competing for the lucrative business of the same global automakers in what is thought to be one of the most important future industries - electric vehicles. Both are also tinkering with the same chemistry - NMC, the go-to battery formulation for most electric vehicles-but have landed on different ways of pushing it to better performance.On Twitter and elsewhere, the case has captured the attention of the battery and EV communities. A key issue raised has been the geopolitics- an impression, misguided in my view, that the case threatens President Joe Biden's intention to get the U.S. fully into the global battery-making war. It has also highlighted the fierce contest among the automakers to be dominant in EVs. A primary reason for my own interest, though, has been the high stakes and naked ambition of the multiple parties.The broad strokes of their fight go like this. In 2018, SKI achieved a coup: It managed to sell its version of NMC to both Ford and VW, snagging the lucrative U.S. contracts for both. But LG cried foul - it accused SKI of relying on its trade secrets to make the battery. It said SKI had poached some 100 of its workers, some of whom it said had taken with them important data. LG alleged that, in one case, a former employee provided SKI with core LG manufacturing recipes for 57 types of EV batteries. When LG decided to sue, SKI went on a document-destroying frenzy, ordering employees to get rid of anything containing LG's name, the complaint alleged. SKI admitted that documents were destroyed but said it was a normal culling of unnecessary matter and that everything germane had been preserved.In Wednesday's decision, the ITC upheld a default judgement rendered previously against SKI. Elizabeth Rowe, a law professor at the University of Florida and a specialist on intellectual property, told me that the ITC judge probably studied both the merits of the case and the allegations of document destruction, and that both appear to have gone heavily against SKI.The ruling bars SKI from importing its batteries and other components for 10 years, which would be a body blow to the company given the size of the U.S. market. It softens the damage for the automakers themselves by allowing Ford to use the SKI batteries for four years, and VW for two years, while they search out another supplier. SKI can meanwhile appeal the ITC ruling and has said it will proceed with building the plants, which are being built in Georgia.All along, SKI has said it would seek help from the White House. It has appeared to be acutely aware of the keen eagerness in both the Trump and Biden administrations to jumpstart the U.S. battery industry. There is a 60-day review period in which Biden can overturn the ruling, and SKI appears to believe it has leverage in which Biden may do so.It is true that electric cars are at the heart of Biden's economic policy, an infrastructure bill that he hopes to push through Congress after the current Covid-19 relief package. He wants to add 500,000 EV charging points, extend $7,500-per-vehicle federal rebates, and incentivize the construction of new battery-making plants. All of this would underpin a new green industrial policy, while also making the U.S. competitive in EVs against China, currently the leader in sheer numbers in the manufacture of electric vehicles and batteries. As of now, the U.S. battery-making market consists solely of Tesla, LG, and Envision, which produces a small number of batteries for Nissan. SKI would be in addition to them.But while Biden could overrule the decision, he won't. If Biden overruled the ITC, he would be helping a U.S. company (Ford) get the electric version of its fabulously popular pickup truck into the market and keep it there. But he would also be setting an irretrievably horrible precedent that could forever destroy the seed corn of the greatest U.S. competitive advantage, which is its record of invention. If Silicon Valley and the rest of the American creation machine could no longer rely on the sanctity of its trade secrets and patents, they would harbor doubts about the value of billion-dollar investments and years of time spent on difficult, already-risky, and very tricky research. Biden would not take that risk.In an appeal yesterday over Twitter, Ford CEO Jim Farley asked SKI and LG to find a settlement between themselves. And that's the most probable outcome.The two companies may wait the full presidential review period, but once they start talking, LG will be in the driver's seat. The pressure on SKI will be immense. Ford will be a primary source of it: it will tell SKI that it doesn't care whether the company makes money or not, about its feelings, its pride, or its animus toward LG. It will say it cares only about its flagship vehicle, the F-150, and the shift to electric. So SKI should go to the negotiation table and reach an agreement that results in Ford getting access to its batteries until it no longer wants them.But that won't be all: LG too, will intensify the pressure. On the strength of the ITC decision, LG will insist not only on barring SKI's batteries from the U.S., but globally. It may not succeed in the courts, but the threat may be sufficient to push away automakers, fearful that they could end up embroiled in litigation. ""Automakers are so risk averse, they will no doubt think twice about partnering with SKI in the future,"" said James Frith, head of energy storage for BloombergNEF, a research firm for green energy.The Biden administration will push, too. Short of a settlement, ""the biggest winner is the Chinese battery industry,"" said Sam Jaffe, managing director of Cairn Energy Research ""American buyers might have to order a lot of Chinese batteries over the next few years, tariffs and all.""Therefore, SKI will settle - it will have to. LG, highly unlikely to be compassionate, will seek to exact a high price. No one outside the companies themselves has any idea what that settlement will look like. It could be a licensing agreement in which SKI pays LG out the wazoo, even 50% or more of its U.S. and global revenue for the battery. But it would save SKI, along with the string of parties attached to the drama.",https://miro.medium.com/max/11136/1*iyjNwpPaCKZ08lkEyS2q_w.jpeg,https://themobilist.medium.com/how-two-south-korean-companies-have-managed-to-terrify-ford-vw-and-the-biden-administration-2d498ae92142,economy,f8c36d7f0ef5d8ec9aad9fc7581141f8ad18e0091729f1e20d6bb4d2
Big Short Big Shot Shoots Bitcoin Bet,"Michael Burry, one of the main characters portrayed in the movie ""The Big Short"", shoots down Tesla's big bets on Bitcoin.Burry had his 5 minutes of fame (maybe 2 hours and 5 minutes if you include the movie) because he famously made a huge fortune betting against the housing market in the early 2000s. He was one of a few that made the correct prediction for home prices, and therefore was spotlighted in the Adam McKay-directed comedy. Burry was played by Christian Bale.""The Big Short"" of course is Hollywood's docu-satire of the mass delusion we now know as the housing bubble. Everyone including bankers, the banker's bankers, appraisers, homeowners, homebuyers, realtors, the whole whole freakin' real estate ecosystem, suffered the mass delusion that home prices would keep on going up, and thus justified poor financial decisions.Wisdom of crowds? There is no such thing.Keep this mass delusion effect in mind.We will see it again. It is human nature.The specific action that put ants in Burry's pants was Tesla's disclosure of a $1.5 billion bet on Bitcoin. This action spurred Bitcoin's price to spike to $48,000 on Tuesday (from less than $30,000 in early January).Bitcoin is a digital currency (cryptocurrency) where individual coins are stored in a powerfully protected and networked computer database called a blockchain.Bitcoin value is not anchored to any physical assets like gold or pork bellies. Bitcoin's value is not tied to future cash flows the way most investments are. The value of Bitcoin is purely based on speculations of future price increases: one person thinks someone else will buy Bitcoin for a higher price tomorrow or the day after.Exactly like homeowners during the bubble of the early 2000s.This is ironic because Bitcoin was spurred in part due to the idiocy of the bankers who played a big part in the financial system collapse which followed the collapse in housing prices.This is what Tesla has bet $1.5 billion of its cash on.Burry is famously short Tesla stock, meaning he thinks Tesla stock is likely to go down significantly in the near future. This is the same idea as the bet he made in 2005 on the housing market (he bet that home prices would decline).This is a very brave bet because many people were short Tesla stock over the past several years, and they have lost a tremendous amount of money.Remember, shorts are opposite - they make money when prices go down. Most of us make money when prices go up.But instead of going down, Tesla's stock price has been going up. Tesla gained about 700% in 2020. That is a lot of short-blood in the streets.Unlike Bitcoin, whose price is set by speculators hope of future fools buying at ever higher prices, Tesla's stock price is anchored on the exponentially accelerating sales of their best-in-class vehicles.The enormity of the risk taken on by short sellers is worth emphasizing here.Let's contrast (simply) the two ways to invest in a stock like Tesla: you can be long or short.If you are long Tesla, you are hoping the price increases. Your worst-case loss is 100%, but your possible upside in unlimited.For example, if you bought one share of Tesla stock at the start of 2020 at $100, and at the end of 2020 it was $800, that 700% gain of $700 is your profit. The worst-case possibility is if Tesla goes bankrupt and shares go to $0, you lose at most $100.If you are short Tesla, you are hoping the price decreases. Your worst-case loss is unlimited! But your best possible upside is capped at 100%.For example, if you short one share (actually you must short 100-share blocks) at $100 in early 2020, and the shares shoot up to $800 as they actually did, you lose the difference of $700. Your loss is 7 times higher than your investment of $100. The best-case scenario is if Tesla goes bankrupt, and you gain at most $100. Does that sound like a smart bet to you?Short sellers lost $40 billion betting against Tesla in 2020.This is the bet Burry is making on Tesla.At the end of 2020, Tesla had $19.384 billion in cash and cash equivalents. A little less than 10% of that has now gone into Bitcoin. In a recent 10K filing with the SEC, Tesla stated:Tasha Keeney of ARK Invest believes using Bitcoin will relieve Tesla from some of the usual risks of dealing with many different and often volatile international currencies. She notes that several other companies have already converted some of their corporate cash to Bitcoin, and that Tesla is following a cryptocurrency trend among corporate users.What's wrong with Tesla buying and using Bitcoin?Tesla explicitly states the risks of investing in Bitcoin in their recent 10K filing:If Bitcoin's price evaporates, Tesla will feel a noticeable bite, but it won't cripple the company. If Bitcoin increases in value, Tesla will benefit. In the last year, Bitcoin appreciated almost 400%. Will the crypto do that again this next year? Who knows?But I think Tesla thinks they know.What do I mean?To answer this, let me describe a purely imaginary scenario.My imaginary scenario is based on a real team: Tesla has one of the most aggressive and high-powered machine-learning (ML) teams in the world, run by Stanford grad Andrej Karpathy. Karpathy's team is leading the charge to develop full self-driving (FSD).I am imagining a small team within the larger FSD team tasked with researching the latest ML technologies. I am further imagining the research team using asset-price prediction as a test-bed for checking new ML algorithms. One of the younger engineers decides to use Bitcoin prices as their testbed. This kid discovers that their program seems to do a great job in predicting Bitcoin prices a day, week, month ahead.Elon has been vocal in his support of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and Dogecoin, over the past year. Our kid-genius has visions of ML glory and emails Musk directly, lobbying for time to showcase his Bitcoin-prediction engine.Musk is smitten. Musk hauls the kid in front of the CFO, the board.Shortly after, Musk invests a good chunk of the company's cash in Bitcoin.No one really knows.Short term, I believe Tesla and Bitcoin will ride a Musk-hyped positive feedback loop higher and higher.This is the scenario that Michael Burry, the investor who has shorted Tesla, is fearful of. He sees Tesla and Bitcoin amplifying each other - and the pain of that increase will hurt him.We already saw the Bitcoin's price boost. That boost is a benefit to Tesla (but only recognized when Tesla sells Bitcoins).As Tesla begins to use Bitcoins in transactions, Tesla will benefit from their positive feedback loop and recognize the profits from their bet.As long as no more than 10% of Tesla's cash and cash equivalents is Bitcoin, then I see little downside.But I believe the rapid increase in Bitcoin price will embolden even the smartest engineers at Tesla including Musk. Risk mitigations will slip. The amount of cash in Bitcoin will naturally rise, and the risks with it.Cryptocurrencies are (I believe) fated to be assimilated into each country's centralized currency. Standalone decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will gradually, country by country, be banned. Bitcoin and their ilk will always have a place for illegal transactions, just as they do today. But the price of Bitcoin will plummet when centralized national cryptos happen because the total transactional value will become so much smaller than the total value of normal transactions.Recall the final risk Tesla noted in their 10K:The regulatory status of cryptocurrencies is the key to their long-term value.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12032/1*V8abrY-CeoJ958Bt2yqgPg.jpeg,https://medium.com/predict/big-short-big-shot-shoots-big-df36469ca8af,economy,f9a0b8fca24cf4daff548a7383206aa2188e83e0e3cca0472c939114
The Time is Now to Chase The Impossible,"At the start of 2020, I set out with one goal in mind: release a project of my own into the world, regardless of how big or small it was. I wasn't sure exactly what it would end up being, but I knew it would have something to do with Artificial Intelligence. AI has been a passion of mine since I was first introduced to it in 2018 when I saw Google's ""Duplex"" technology. When I first saw Duplex at Google's ""IO"" event, I was lost for words and became instantly hooked. Fast forward to October of 2020, I released a project I call ""clevrML"" (I often refer to it as just ""clevr""). clevr started off as a platform for building, deploying and editing AI models using a technology I built called ""Active Memory Learning"" (AML). The summary of AML is that it can build AI models with as little as 3 samples, 10 seconds of computing and can operate efficiently on a CPU.You may be wondering why I'm brushing over that last point I made about AML, and that's because I'll be talking a bit more about it later in this blog. Mainly, this blog is about something else: clevrML's mission.For me, this isn't actually anything new because I have had this mission in my head from the day I started clevr. It wasn't until recently that I was doing some self-reflection and realized that I've never actually verbalized this mission publicly. With that being said, this is clevr's mission:As I said in the title, It's time to chase the impossible.I had one goal in mind when I started clevr, which was to make AI easier for everyone to get started in. While that goal is still there, the core mission and focus have shifted (or rather just been said publicly). The new focus is to research new AI methods that have the potential to lead us closer to Artificial General Intelligence. What do I mean when I say Artificial General Intelligence? This question is widely debated among people in AI, but I'm going to give you my definition of what it means to me:Artificial Intelligence that can perform many domains of tasks that are better than a human.This differs from what we have now in AI, which is ""Narrow Intelligence"" (ie: AI that can do one task like recognizing images).Getting back to my first point, clevr is now focusing on methods that will lead us closer to Artificial General Intelligence. This does not mean clevr will only focus on General Intelligence and nothing else, but general-purpose AI algorithms. Let me explain in more detail in the next section.The AI industry is going into a transition period where the AI we know is going to start looking very different than before. AI algorithms and methods are going from Narrow to General in nature. What do I mean by this?Let's use an intuitive example of AI and images. If you don't know, narrow AI techniques (ie: AI that we have now) are very good at categorizing images and recognizing objects. Right now however, you need to train separate AI models for doing different types of image tasks. So for example, if you wanted to build a model to understand what a picture of various animals looks like, you would need to train it for several hours on images of animals. However, If you wanted to use this same model for object detection (ie: circling the animal itself in the image) this would not be possible.Now let's use our scenario of understanding animal pictures but with our general-purpose model. With our general-purpose model, you would have to train it on recognizing images of animals. The key difference would be seen if you wanted to apply this model to do object detection of the animals. In theory, our general-purpose model would be able to do this with minimal change or possibly without any change.This is the fundamental difference between the future AI models and what we have today. Before we see full-fledged General Intelligence, we will see general-purpose models in one context or, general-purpose methods (later in the blog). I strongly believe these general-purpose models will be a catalyst in moving towards General Intelligence.Now that we have covered the philosophy behind clevrML's mission, I'd like to tell you how this mission will look practically.clevr is a project that started with offering fairly basic Machine Learning APIs for developers. Now, clevr will be focused on researching new AI methods and technologies that pursue Artificial General Intelligence. However, every breakthrough will be published on our public API for developers to use. Why would clevr do this?This comes down to a personal thing for me. When I started in AI, I was super passionate and wanted to try out the latest technology companies were deploying. However, most AI companies do either one of two things: Make their papers so ambiguous that only people with many years of experience can replicate the model or, the models are so large that no one has the financial backing to even run the models.This should be the exact opposite in my mind: everyone should be able to copy and paste a small snippet of code to use an API with cutting edge tech for an affordable price. This is exactly what I want to keep doing with clevr going forward: Cutting edge APIs for developers at an affordable price.As I mentioned earlier, I have already gotten the ball rolling towards this mission. clevrML is home to a breakthrough method called ""Active Memory Learning"" (AML), which can build classification models of several different data types with one architecture.AML models are a subset of a developing AI field called ""Few-Shot-Learning"", which means being able to learn with only a few examples. It's important to note, AML is not a different type of Neural Net, it's a brand new architecture from top to bottom. For this reason, AML models come with some very big advantages:With all these advantages, AML is truly a breakthrough method compared to Neural Nets in the context of classification.The most transformative technology of our lifetime will be Artificial General Intelligence, but it will also be one of the hardest. This is exactly what excites me about pushing towards this vision: the challenge, uncertainty and what might come along the way. General Intelligence will not be an overnight task and it won't come for a long time, but the technologies that will come out of clevr's cutting-edge research will beneficial to many. As I said earlier, I want all the cutting edge technology to be in the hands of many, not a few.A future with general-purpose methods is here with Active Memory Learning, and it will continue with even more cutting edge developments. If you are interested in following along with clevr's progress, head over to www.clevrml.com to keep up with the updates. Along with this, check out the APIs and give them a try. Every time you use an API on clevrML, you are not only telling us that you like the product, but you are also supporting further research on this endeavor.If you enjoyed this blog or you align with the mission of clevrML, give this article a share and make sure to visit the site!

We are nature learning to be itself,"Nature evolves. That is what it does.Nature shapes itself to fit the conditions it creates, as automatically as a river winding its way towards the sea. There is no effort in such an action. This is just what rivers do, because this is just what rivers are. So too does nature evolve.To call anything in this universe ""unnatural"" is to miss the point. There is nothing beyond nature. Everything around you has come from nature, is made by nature, is made for nature. All of it evolved along with you, being conditioned by you or conditioning you, as nature irrevocably does to itself. This can be said of the forests and the ocean, your dog or your iPhone or your false eyelashes. There is nothing unnatural about any of it, because you, too, are nature.In each new way we shape our surroundings, we are contributing to evolution, actively. While applying false eyelashes may not seem as natural as a river finding its way to the sea, it is -it's still the process of nature shaping its surroundings. Evolution created self-aware sentience, consciousness in a being that is aware of itself as itself.If that was confusing at all, think about yourself. Were you able to do so? Congratulations! You are consciousness aware of itself. To say ""I am"" is to be self-aware.Consciousness becoming aware of itself is nature becoming aware of itself. What does nature do? It evolves.Even if you are a theist, you can't argue that nature evolves itself. If God exists, God is a part of existence, and is therefore natural. Like rivers flowing to the sea, nature simply evolves - its pattern is written into what it is. Whether or not you view that action as written in by chemicals or compounds or by a divine consciousness named God, the result is functionally the same: nature's capacity for shaping itself is inexorable from what it is.What we can likely all agree on is the following. 1) Nature evolves. 2) We are nature. 3) We are aware that we are nature. 4) We are aware that we evolve. And now, 5) We are aware that nature evolves itself.What we are coming to understand is that we evolve ourselves. We have the capacity to evolve, consciously. We can create and catalyze evolution, as nature always has. Everything we create - from technology to art to relationships to experiences - evolves us. We create it as it creates us. It shapes us and is shaped by us.Just as we are consciousness becoming aware of itself, we are evolutioneers becoming aware that they are evolving and are catalyzing evolution.Naturally, we are reckoning with having that power, and with learning how to wield it. Of course our early attempts at self-aware and conscious evolution are sloppy and lurching and rough. Of course we're nearly killing ourselves in the process. Of course we are playing God, or, playing Mother Nature. That is what we are. Being nature is our birthright, inexorable and inalienable. Nature evolves itself. We evolve ourselves.Nature was always going to get here. We know that because it happened, through no influence by anything but nature. No part of this is unnatural.Does that mean we should keep polluting the planet until we have to #OccupyMars? Of course not. Does that mean we should tolerate genocide? Of course not.Just as we are nature learning that we have the power to shape itself, we are learning what shapes actually fit us. We are learning what is healthy for us, and what is harmful. We are learning what we like and what we don't like. We are learning what we feel and what we think, as a collective. In becoming aware of each other, we are learning that what we call other is still us, because we are nature. Only nature, aggregated together into an inseparable whole, knows what's truly best for it.I can't tell you what that is. I am not aware of the totality of nature. The closest thing I have to an answer is that the more we talk to each other, the more we empathize with one another, and the more we make decisions cooperatively with others - the closer we are to aggregating consciousness.But I am but one part of consciousness, and I cannot choose our best direction on my own. I need you, all of you, as you all need me too.So, what I can say for a conclusion is this: if you find yourself asking, ""What exactly should I do with the awareness that I am creating evolution in every action I take?"" - you are asking the right question.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10944/0*J6vXrVCmLBsUi2dB,https://medium.com/dogs-with-buddha-nature/we-are-nature-learning-to-be-itself-5fd9d3ed27e,mindfulness,f052bc309861911faba34aeebbb707770f1ecdf1c3762055f747334d
Jeff Bezos Just Pulled a Rockefeller,"In the late nineteenth century, John D. Rockefeller faced an insurmountable problem. He was the world's richest man, but he (and his family) was plagued by stress-induced illnesses and was reviled by the public for decades of immoral and illegal business tactics. Moreover, his gigantic multinational corporation, the Standard Oil Company, was about to face an onslaught of anti-monopoly lawsuits that would eventually land them at the Supreme Court.Being a shrewd fellow, he decided to retire at the top of his game.By all accounts, John D. Rockefeller was not a good man. (He was a money-hungry skinflint who even charged his children for being late to morning prayers.) More importantly, with the use of predatory pricing, financialization, monopolistic coercion, democratic usurpation, and illegal railway kickbacks, Standard Oil bankrupted thousands of businesses, put an untold number of people out of work, and set a precedent of crony capitalism that turned America into the corporatocracy it is today.Unlike the hundreds of thousands who died in poverty at the hands of Standard Oil, John D. Rockefeller didn't suffer in his retirement. His health returned, his family was reinvigorated, and when the Supreme Court broke his monopoly into 34 separate companies, his wealth skyrocketed.If this story sounds familiar, it's because we're watching the 21st-century reboot play out in real-time with Jeff Bezos.John D. Rockefeller wasn't a particularly brilliant businessman, and his products weren't light years better than their competitors. By all accounts, without his shady tactics, he never would've been more than a mildly successful Cleveland oil refiner. So he cheated.In our times, Jeff Bezos became the world's largest hoarder of extreme wealth because he was the first person in online tech to fully weaponize financialization in order to destroy his competition and decimate democracy.The cold hard fact is that Amazon wasn't significantly better than all the other online shops at the time; they just had access to more capital, and the discipline to use it to strangle them all to death and then leverage their position to extract additional gains from the commons by dismantling democracy. It's a model that many tech companies like Uber and Lyft now use to devastating effect.But no one has done it better in our day than Jeff Bezos. It's quite disturbing to think of how voracious this one man's appetite has been. Books weren't enough. Retail wasn't enough. Nor entertainment, groceries, health, cloud computing, the space race, or invasive surveillance. As Amazon evades taxation and sets itself above the law, it has become its own de facto virtual nation. As Steve Levine recently put it:It's a hellish template he's created.With a market cap of $1.6+ trillion, its hands in the CIA's servers, its total dominance of the infrastructure of the Internet, its anti-competition business practices, and its ongoing siege of democracy, it's no wonder that Amazon has entered Congress's crosshairs, just as Teddy Roosevelt aimed his anti-trust long-gun at Rockefeller's Standard Oil.Rockefeller was 63 when he retired from Standard, handing over the reins to his son John Jr. and VP John D. Archbold. Let the young Turks fight in court for a decade or more. Bezos, just 57, probably doesn't relish the fight against a new generation of creative and hungry pro-democracy activists.So what does he do now?In his old age, Rockefeller used a sliver of his gargantuan wealth to whitewash his reputation with very public acts of philanthropy. It was a textbook move at the time - the murderer Andrew Carnegie bought his legacy with 3,000 libraries, while African colonist Cecil B. Rhodes did the same thing with his scholarships and war profiteer Alfred Nobel did the same thing with his peace prizes. By the time he died, Rockefeller had endowed the University of Chicago, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, and Spelman College, along with huge donations to Yale and Johns Hopkins and dozens of grants to other institutions. Today, he is essentially remembered as a benign philanthropic tycoon.Jeff Bezos will now spend his days becoming the nation's beloved Mars guy.Jeff Bezos's company has yet to be broken up, and now he'll head off into the sunset with several hundred billion to his name. He'll whitewash his reputation from all angles - space, philanthropy, the arts. He'll become a pater familias, an elder statesman, an éminence grise.He should be taxed.His company should be broken up.The truth about his company should become public record.Corporations should be banned from interfering with democracy.Rockefeller left behind broken men, bankrupted businesses, and an untold number of suicides. America rewarded Rockefeller for corporatizing and monopolizing the country, and the nation still hasn't righted the downward trajectory.Jeff Bezos now leaves behind a model of marauding financialization, predatory conglomeration, and exploitation the likes of which Rockefeller only dreamed.

COVID-19: Winners and Losers,"I think it's highly likely that the dust will clear eventually and that our economy will come back to life at some point in the next two or three years. I know there are certain disaster scenarios that can't be ruled out, but I think they are unlikely. I'm not going to guess when things will return to a semblance of normal. Really, no one knows.The question for now is: what will that economy look like?A few things, I think, are clear. The economy will not grow back up to its trend line prior to the pandemic. This, for example, from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, is what happened after the financial crisis and Great Recession:Not only did actual GDP fall, but the trend line of potential GDP fell as well, costing the economy trillions of dollars of output. Behind that loss of potential GDP is an enormous human cost. Recessions cause permanent damage to people who lose their jobs and to recent graduates who can't find jobs.There will also be a certain amount of psychological scarring that will affect the economy for at least a generation. People buying safety stocks of dried beans and toilet paper may give the consumer goods sector a one-time boost. But those with enough income will save more, depressing demand, and people will also be much more reluctant to start small businesses.Amazon will be a big winner, of course. A large proportion of the population, particularly among the affluent, already reflexively shopped for everything at Amazon. (I used to, but now I try to find things elsewhere first, basically for political reasons.) The pandemic is pushing more people to try to fulfill all of their consumer needs online, and they aren't going to stop when the coast clears.More generally, big chains will expand their domination over the economy. Tens of thousands of small businesses will vanish, never to return, wiped out by weeks or months of zero revenues. Large corporations will have the capital to swoop in and steal their customer base. Family-owned restaurants will be replaced by national chains. Sporting goods stores will be replaced by Dicks. Electronics shops, if there are any left, will be replaced by Best Buy. Bookstores ... well, there aren't many of those left, anyway.The other winners will be private equity funds with the nerve to buy assets on the cheap. After the financial crisis, investment funds bought up single-family homes in foreclosure, becoming some of the nation's largest landlords. This time, the bargains will be found in small businesses desperate for capital and commercial real estate hammered by defaulting tenants.The business sector will become more concentrated. Inequality will increase. The fundamental trends that have reshaped the American economy over my lifetime will accelerate. The survival of capitalism depends on a large enough proportion of the population having a stake in its survival. For how much longer?Originally published at http://baselinescenario.com on March 29, 2020.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*dJC_LbvHNF2DjjECHmlFyw.jpeg,https://jamesykwak.medium.com/covid-19-winners-and-losers-6eb537eb608,economy,f77ed3908c6e2229859fe275a6f4724504d2194f73f284041c46005e
Transformative Professional Development Through Integrated STEM,"By Percy Canales, Knowles Teacher Initiative and Katey Shirey, Knowles Senior Fellow, Knowles Teacher InitiativeOriginally published in the Fall 2020 Issue of Kaleidoscope: Educators' Voices and Perspectives by the Knowles Teacher InitiativeIntroductionHaving taught math for nine years, I (Percy) needed to find more in-depth and individualized professional development and decided to embark on a full-time master's degree in mathematics education program. I wanted to know everything there was to know about student mathematical thinking, and it was eye-opening to realize that there was such a huge world of mathematics education research that I had never heard about that was helpful for my practice.Upon graduating, I hoped to build bridges between my math teacher colleagues and math research in order to continually refine our knowledge of student thinking. I wanted teachers to consider what it is that we do as math teachers, why we do it, why the students need it, and how to make our teaching better. However, I soon recognized that, because they were so busy with daily responsibilities, encouraging my colleagues to bring research into their practice was a challenge.In my 13th year of math teaching in 2016, I joined a new kind of team of teachers, one that I'd never been on before but had heard about for years: an integrated science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) teaching team. We were responsible for teaching students through three years of a brand new three-block integrated STEM course, and we were supported by external collaborators from the Knowles Teacher Initiative. I was suddenly immersed in developing and teaching the Global STEM Challenges Program in Fairfax, Virginia.Integrated (or sometimes ""integrative"") STEM learning is ""problem-based learning that purposefully situates scientific inquiry and the application of mathematics in the context of technological designing/problem solving"" (Sanders, 2009, p. 21). The integrated portion means we are not just math teachers but science, engineering, and technology teachers too. We came to the conclusion that, in order to make this program work, we couldn't be driven by our own disciplines. Instead, we needed to be driven by student thinking: striving to find out what it is and how to improve it.Through teaching integrated math in the program and in close collaboration with my team and Knowles collaborators, including my co-author Katey Shirey, my understanding of student thinking improved tremendously, both in and out of the integrated STEM course itself. In particular, I learned how exploring mathematics through its many applications and using multiple modalities for learning helps to unveil misconceptions and contributes to teachers' understanding of student thinking.Together, Katey and I have unpacked my reflections over the years in informal conversations as well as in formal meetings, classroom visits, and planning sessions. As collaborators, we've discussed the many ways that teaching integrated math has shifted my thinking about how students learn. I've come to recognize that teaching integrated math has had a more positive influence on my understanding of student thinking than traditional, non-integrated professional development (PD). Realizing this is an important outcome, Katey and I are excited to share in this article what we've uncovered and how it might encourage other teachers to try integrated math teaching.The Pitfalls of Traditional PD for Teacher Development and Instructional ChangeLearning how to teach integrated math in our school's STEM program has not involved PD as teachers usually define it. While there is coaching and reflective support, we're not experiencing an external intervention of the kind that's usually impressed upon teachers in a typical PD. Instead, we're collaborating as a team to design and to teach the integrated math, science, design and technology course material in a novel environment that is rich for learning about student thinking.Typical in-service PD and higher education coursework are designed to help teachers acquire knowledge about how students learn and adapt it to their contexts (Darling-Hammond & McLaughlin, 2011). We know that teachers hope to expand their teaching skills, defeat stagnation in teaching, improve student learning, and learn new pragmatic and usable ideas for their classrooms during PD. However, it doesn't take a research base to tell us that PD often receives lukewarm reception from teachers. Teachers' negative reactions to PD is due to inconsistencies between the needs of teachers and the design and outcomes of the PD, which results in low implementation (Guskey, 2002).PD sometimes ignores research on adult learners, lacks actual classroom-related content, or discounts best teaching practices in its delivery (Borko, 2004; Guskey, 2002). For instance, say you go to a professional development training on student learning through multiple modalities. You might spend an entire hour listening to someone read a Powerpoint presentation on multiple modalities with lots of examples and ideas, and yet you recognize that this instruction is being conveyed through only one modality-oral.In my experience, three things might happen after training like the one I've described. One, as a ""seasoned"" teacher, you feel you rarely get anything out of PD, so you tune out the training and your teaching doesn't change. Two, because the presentation was overloaded with information on several current trends in multiple modalities instruction, you leave the training feeling so overwhelmed that you end up trying none. Three, you leave the PD determined to use one new approach for leveraging multiple modalities in your instruction. However, since you used it to repackage old unit material, the application of what you learned is merely superficial. Teachers who fall into the third category believe that the training included good ideas but become frustrated and overwhelmed because it took a lot to come up with a brand new approach for just one unit. They realize they can't keep the effort up all year, so they revert back to their old packaging and begin to doubt the utility of the material presented at PD training in general.In PD sessions like the one I described above, we teachers are expected to learn ""new knowledge"" and incorporate it into our work. PD in this sense is a form of filling in the gaps or adding new practices, so-called ""additive PD."" Additive PD leads to an emotional response: an overwhelming feeling of needing to do more and profound insecurity about what to actually do. Eventually, we might also experience feelings of defeat because our learning was so superficial that our implementation lacked staying power.Integrated STEM instruction as a transformative PD experienceIn contrast to additive PD, ""transformative PD"" (Thompson & Zuili, 1999) seeks to make holistic transformations in practice that are more sustainable and useful (Barlow, et al., 2014). Teaching integrated math has been a transformative professional learning experience for me. In our school's integrated STEM courses, we introduce math through the contexts of solving real-world engineering challenges that require a combination of math, science, technology, designing, and problem solving. The contextual nature of integrated STEM instruction provides opportunities for me to learn about and use meaningful applications of math in my instruction, to gain experience with multiple student modalities, and to reveal student misconceptions. Below, Katey and I discuss three of my teaching practices that were transformed by teaching integrated STEM.Creating meaningful applications for math through connectionsConnections is a National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) process standard (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000). Yet, in my single-content math classes, it is rare to see how the students take the content and apply it elsewhere. Furthermore, it can be challenging as a content expert in math to invent opportunities which lead to deep and meaningful connections from math to other subjects or phenomena.In our integrated STEM program, however, my students are presented with wildly open-ended problem spaces that require them to work from all STEM perspectives-science, math, technology, and engineering-on one problem. The choices that the students make create connected contexts for math applications as they work without me having to contrive the connections.For instance, in one project, students are asked to create a chemical heating or cooling device for an application of their own choice. (Readers might recognize the idea at the center of this unit as a common chemistry endothermic/exothermic lab where students optimize a hand warmer.) Student projects have included coffee heaters, reusable self-heating gloves, an avalanche-melting helmet, self-warming baby blankets, and self-cooling t-shirts for the gym. Students' focus as they find rates and functions to describe their experimentally-derived heating curves is much more intense than when I teach math content areas out of context. Because the students are able to choose the application they will explore, they pick something with meaning to them. I've also noticed that students interrogate their data for mathematical patterns more intently when they are invested in a context that they control.Overall, I've found that when the mathematical application has more personal meaning, students forge stronger connections back to the concepts embedded in the challenge and their new math content knowledge. I always knew this type of teaching would work, especially after reading about the link between context and learning from authors like Jo Boaler (1998), but I never really saw it work until I experienced the integrated context. I used to say ""plug in a number"" to help my students connect abstract expressions to more relatable numbers, but integrated STEM brings the connection into physical reality. Logarithms are much more concrete when used to describe hydrogen ions present on the pH scale; trig functions more relatable when used to describe the tides, the orbit of the moon, or the rotation of a windmill. Since teaching integrated STEM, I've even started to ask my non-STEM International Baccalaureate® math classes, ""Who's taken physics?"" because I know that it will be more valuable to connect calculus to physical motion and vectors when possible.Accessing multiple modalitiesMy integrated STEM teaching team quickly realized that accessing multiple modalities when we teach has a profound impact on student learning in our program. Building on multiple intelligences (Gardner, 1999), individualized learning (Dunn & Dunn, 1972), and cognitive science, the term multiple modalities refers to the various techniques that teachers can use in the classroom to address their students' needs as learners. Examples include lecture-based teaching, skills-based teaching, technology-enhanced teaching, individual teaching, group teaching, and inquiry-based teaching (Bransford, et al., 2000). It was clear to the team that we could understand more about students' thinking if we restructured both instruction and assessment using multiple modalities as a lens.By providing lots of student agency, we found we created a wide variety of teacher-led and student-led learning opportunities. The choices our students get to make mean that their thinking is explored and expressed within their favored modality as they work- which allows me to better understand their thinking. Among our integrated STEM teaching team, ""multiple modalities"" has become shorthand for the variety of ways that students choose to interact throughout each day and with each unit. By observing their choices and the artifacts we produce, we are able to learn more about how students are processing and learning.One method we use consistently to provide space for multiple modalities is under-defining our design challenges and problem-solving procedures; this way, students have to proceed within their own modes of working and learning. For instance, our 10th-grade students are asked to design a digital tool for communicating information from a large Chesapeake Bay dataset to local stakeholders. First, they must select information to analyze based on stakeholders' concerns and decide what kind of communication platform they'll design (i.e., programming phone apps, storyboarding websites, or illustrating a children's book and teachers' guide). I can take advantage of their comfort and interest in the platform they select to discuss with them how they will share the data most efficiently in that mode and for that audience. As a result, students develop a nuanced fluency about the dataset and make decisions while justifying their choices, all while using and communicating appropriate data analysis.Our STEM classes also capitalize on multiple modalities by using common science representations in math and technology applications across the program. We strive to express quantities and relationships with graphs and algebraic expressions in addition to numbers. We also ask students to write sentences to describe mathematical relationships; reviewing the writing provides insight into students' understanding of the phenomena at hand. These modalities are automatic in STEM and flatten the notion that graphs or equations only belong to one discipline.I was surprised by how naturally this all developed out of integrated math instruction. I'd learned from Nicholson-Nelson (1998) in her celebrated book, Developing Student's Multiple Intelligences, that ""by knowing our students' strengths and weaknesses, we can tailor individual projects and activities to help students learn in their own way"" (p. 71). I've found that integrated STEM goes well beyond the expectation that I should differentiate the learning experience for my students. Instead, I'm learning that student choice in modalities and application allows the students to tailor the math learning for themselves! I just try to keep up by providing more, different, or contrasting skills and perspectives to keep nudging them along toward mathematical mastery.Unveiling student misconceptionsIn my master's program, I learned about Piaget's theory of cognitive development and the enormous body of research dedicated to student misconceptions in math and science (Confrey, 1990). I had been under the impression that ""once the student misconceptions are identified, teachers can work to remedy the faulty conceptions with appropriate instructional approaches"" (Gurel, et al., 2015, p. 993). I was taught to look for common misconceptions in student work or assessments so that I could highlight, interrogate, and correct the misconception. But by teaching integrated STEM, I've had more access to student thinking, including identifying misconceptions, than traditional math instruction allows.Since the STEM program's design challenges are open-ended, students are less inhibited to share what is truly in their minds. They are more inclined to share their thoughts through their perspectives, in their own chosen modality, and using their own terminology. Instead of looking for a particular, known misconception, I can pick up on ways that students might be misinterpreting a relationship, a concept, or inappropriate tools based on their own words. In my math-only classes, students are frequently tuned into the math that they should be using because it is the topic of the lesson or unit. In integrated STEM, the bounds for what math is appropriate to use are loosened, and students are asked to bring forward whatever math that they need for a given problem or situation. If I notice a misconception, or a lack of skills that might be helpful, I can adjust my instruction to deliver a useful lesson or reminder. For instance, when students discuss data and designs, I often hear them pose questions that might be better answered with different mathematical tools, which I can then teach them in a responsive way. By listening and responding to student mathematical needs, the math I'm teaching is immediately relevant.I can use the context of the challenge to learn more about student confusions regarding the underlying math. For example, we teach a unit that involves defining the motion of space debris falling from low Earth orbit to teach kinematics, which incorporates both physics and calculus to describe the relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration. Often, we think our students understand the rules that connect accelerated motion through calculus when they can recite ""velocity is the derivative of position"" and ""acceleration is the derivative of velocity""-so we move on.During a recent kinematics lesson in the space debris unit, I heard students discussing acceleration due to gravity with some misunderstandings laced throughout. One student said, ""When you throw an object in the air it goes fast then slow and then fast again so acceleration must not be constant."" Whoa, I thought, let's see where this goes! Other students agreed and disagreed explaining their reasoning. Okay, I thought, the students are confusing acceleration with velocity, and speed, which I can address. But to me, even more exciting than identifying their confusion was finding it through their conversation! I didn't have to wait until a difficult question on a quiz or test prompted a long conversation to reveal that my students really did not understand how acceleration affects velocity. Instead, their confusion was raised during a group's discussions while the students were expressing a need and desire to want to find the answer.Potential ConcernsKatey and I wrote this article with the hopes that other teachers will try integrated STEM for the reasons articulated above, but we also recognize that teachers might have some concerns. For one, teachers might be afraid that they don't have enough knowledge in the other STEM fields to pull this off. Rest assured, your primary content knowledge is adequate to get started, and you'll learn a lot about the other subjects as you go. I have personally learned so much about science and technology from collaborating with my colleagues and listening to what students bring to the challenges, that I consider this a learning opportunity for me!Teachers might be concerned that they'll never be able to tackle all of the needed STEM content in a math classroom. Fear not, your students have additional assets that they will draw upon: other teachers, other student teams, and other hours of the day. I feel much more secure knowing that I am not solely responsible for resolving all of the students' concerns in an integrated unit. In fact, it might be an asset that I can't resolve all of them-it makes the students take more agency for their learning.Finally, teachers might worry that if they're not doing the math curriculum in some known order, optimized for maximum efficiency, then their instruction won't maintain rigor or pacing. This is a false dichotomy. Revisiting content throughout the year as an actual project when needs arise gives credence to the usefulness of mathematics; it's not simply a unit that once tested can be forgotten. I've not seen any lack of rigor when the instruction is responsive instead of following a traditional sequence. As math teachers have always known, there is math everywhere and connected to everything, so there is no shortage of appropriate mathematical content to teach. By planning with my colleagues, I can ensure that we will have time to do what I hope to do while staying in sync with the team.ConclusionTeachers of integrated STEM can learn so much about how students learn and how to support them from teaching this way. Learning math in a STEM classroom context feels genuine to students and creates opportunities to work within multiple modalities, increase their ownership of the learning process, and feel empowered to make decisions. Students are required to express the mathematical reasoning for their decisions and how math is used in various contexts. As a result, I have been able to access a more authentic representation of students' productive reasoning along with their misconceptions.Through my experience of teaching integrated STEM, I have come to appreciate it as an opportunity for transformative PD; it is relevant to my teaching context, addresses my students and my own learning needs, aligned with math standards, grounded in reflection, and experienced within a community of teachers. For my colleagues and me, this experience has been more beneficial for our professional growth than traditional PD.For more information on Percy's integrated STEM course, visit https://edisonhs.fcps.edu/academics/stem.To learn more about how this integrated STEM course was planned, visit https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809917307403.Download ArticlePercy Canales, a math teacher in Fairfax County (Virginia), has 15 years of math education experience ranging from junior high to college settings.

How I Used Cognitive Restructuring to Overcome an Eating Disorder,"Growing up in a diet culture-filled world, I lived under a system of beliefs that promotes weight loss, demonizes fat people, and moralizes health. As a result, I feared two things: food and being fat. Under those umbrellas, I also feared hunger, as normal as it is, as well as weight gain and ""junk food."" I feared being judged for what I was eating or how I looked. And frankly, I don't remember a time when I didn't dislike my thighs or have anxiety over food. When I was 8 years old, I told people I was on a diet.This worsened as I got older. When I was home alone, I would ""stock up"" on food, eating for as long as I could. I also flirted a good bit with restriction, skipping meals and limiting how much I ate. When I got to high school, the ""stocking up"" turned into full-blown binging, and the skipping one meal turned into skipping multiple meals in a row.While my eating disorder truly had all the control, I thought I did. After all, in our society, people pride themselves on eating little and losing weight - which is what I was doing, at least in front of others. I felt comfortable in my skin because no one could judge me over what I was eating or how I looked - unless they realized the harm in my behaviors, which was far from my concern.I'm grateful I can say I'm mostly recovered now, thanks to loved ones, therapy, and educational books. I struggle less with disordered thinking about food and weight; I eat enough and what I want, and I don't weigh myself anymore. I know my value is in who I am, not what I look like, and my life is about so much more than food or the lack of it.However, this took time and work, especially from where I was at my lowest. Keep reading to learn more about how I realized I needed help and how to engage in cognitive restructuring, a therapeutic tool that essentially saved my life.While I told myself what I was doing was ""healthy"" and ""sustainable,"" I always knew, deep down, that I was experiencing an eating disorder. When you're sticking your fingers down your throat, especially, and even if only a few times, you can't help but have one resounding and terrifying thought: This is wrong; this is dangerous.When I looked up the criteria for an eating disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), I realized I had an other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED). I didn't quite meet the weight criterion for anorexia, the disorder my behaviors looked most like, which meant I had OSFED. When I turned 18, a psychologist administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, a 567-question test that helps determine a diagnosis, for me; she later confirmed I had an eating disorder, anxiety, and depression.But it didn't take a formal diagnosis for me to know I was a) sick, and b) sick of being sick. The binging-restricting cycle I was stuck in caused me a lot of stress and kept me from fully enjoying time with friends, something I value deeply. I also didn't want to be chained to the scale every day, my mood depending on if the number was higher or lower than it was a day or even 30 minutes ago.""I have one question,"" I remember texting my dad quite dramatically one night after having those realizations. ""How much does a shrink cost?"" As much as I thought my eating disorder ""helped"" me cope with my emotions, I knew I was out of control and the time to recover had arrived. The constant worrying about food and weight exhausted me, and I felt like God was telling me it was time to get better.After looking through Psychology Today's mental health professionals database, I found a therapist nearby who specialized in eating disorders. While I felt hopeful about getting better, I didn't realize just how much therapy with her would help me. When we started, I told her I loved doing therapeutic worksheets and talking things out, so we engaged in both. Additionally, we practiced cognitive restructuring, a tool found in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Cognitive restructuring is a process in which you work to change negative thoughts into more positive, helpful ones by looking at the evidence. A helpful technique for practicing this is ""putting your thoughts on trial"" in which you look at the facts on both sides and then determine the ""verdict."" Below is an example:As mentioned previously, cognitive restructuring is a tool in CBT. CBT helps change the ways people think, feel, and behave so they can respond to difficult situations in more helpful, productive ways. CBT believes that someone's perception of a situation can affect their reaction more than the situation itself.CBT is one of the most effective kinds of therapy for people struggling with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders - all of which I had. This is probably because all three disorders share a common symptom: cognitive distortions, or irrational thoughts that can affect your emotions. The particular distortions I experienced most within my eating disorder were magnification, catastrophizing, magical thinking, mind reading, emotional reasoning, ""should'' statements, and all-or-nothing thinking - so basically, almost all of them. Below are personal examples that explain what those can look like for someone with an eating disorder.Cognitive restructuring helps people realize the false logic behind those anxieties and disordered thoughts. Through its process, you find facts that back up why those distortions are, well, distorted. Here are some corrected thoughts I realized through practicing this skill:My therapist first brought up helpful truths like these in normal conversation. ""I feel guilty about eating so much fried food,"" I remember saying to her. In response, she said this: ""What if you don't see food as having moral value, but simply just as food?""Having never heard this before - which is a wild thought, because I now preach it all the time - I was a bit taken aback. I felt relief, because that's exactly what I needed, but also a bit of fear, because I'd be going against everything people had taught me my entire life. However, I knew what I'd learned about food over the course of my life had only hurt me, so I welcomed her suggestions with open arms. I'll always be grateful I did.Besides our conversations, she also gave me worksheets and activities to do both in session and at home, knowing I had an interest in using them as a tool to recover. One of the most helpful assignments was writing my thoughts and then my arguments for and against them. This helped me figure out the actual truth and how it could help me in my recovery journey.I later learned this practice is the ""cognitive restructuring"" skill I've been talking about. While it didn't completely cure me and while it took practice, how much and how quickly it helped both encouraged and impressed me.To help you implement cognitive restructuring so you can live an eating disorder-free life, I've explained the exact steps I took and examples that can help get your brain going.What thoughts are you having that are giving you distress or triggering you to engage in an eating disorder behavior? Some examples include:This step may be emotionally difficult. You're having to confront and address what may be some of your deepest anxieties, and your eating disorder voice may convince you that those anxieties are correct. My advice here is to write what you can, regardless of whether you truly believe it's a distorted thought, all while being as honest with yourself as possible.Write down truths you know that support or back up your original anxious thoughts. What experiences of yours make you believe those anxious thoughts could be true? For this step, you're essentially pretending you're a prosecutor, arguing why your anxious thoughts are factual. Below are examples you might find relevant with the thoughts in step one, respectively:I want to make sure you know it's okay to feel emotional as you write these down. Eating disorders are difficult mental illnesses that often stem from serious, hard-to-fix situations. You're allowed to feel sad for yourself and for the world.Next, either below or beside those arguments, list some facts that negate your distorted thoughts. What do you know to be true that proves those anxieties wrong? For this step, you're acting as the ""defense attorney,"" trying to prove why your anxious thoughts aren't based in fact. Below are examples of ways you can disprove the thoughts in step one, respectively:This step may also be hard, especially when you're deep in your eating disorder. If you can't think of anything to write for this section, I encourage trying free support groups or reading examples like those above. You may not totally believe the truths you read, or you may have to repeat them to yourself over and over for them to stick. However, I can tell you that after practicing this for years, it gets a lot easier, in which you think of disproving truths more quickly.Those facts will also feel more true to you over time. For example, you may continue to gain weight, and your friends will still want to hang out with you. You'll continue to eat and nourish your brain, and you'll realize that life is about more than just food and weight. In other words, continue practicing this tool as patiently as you can, and you will see results in time. Recovery isn't linear, but it gets better as you get stronger.The last part of this exercise entails looking at both sides you've written and figuring out what the actual truth is - which likely incorporates some aspects from both sides. Using the examples above, here are some realizations you may come to in the end:As you can see, these final realizations don't negate the validity of either side. The goal is to write truths that are honest and lead to healthy, helpful choices. You also want to aim to go through this process for each anxious thought you wrote down, but don't feel bad if you struggle to do so. Creating these statements may be harder at the beginning, but don't be afraid to reach out, whether online or with someone you know in real life. You don't have to believe your ""verdicts"" fully yet, but write them down anyway. You also don't have to write something down for every single anxiety; just write as much as you can.As I mentioned above, this process takes time. While I wish we could remind ourselves of those helpful truths just once and be recovered, it doesn't work that way. Eating disorders are sneaky, insidious, and convincing; they creep in when we're already feeling vulnerable from other stressors. The only way out, unfortunately, is through.Repetition is an integral part of this experience, both in CBT's reliance on it and in what I know helped me. The more we hear something, the more we believe it, and I've seen this in my own life. When my therapist first told me food doesn't have moral value, for example, the concept was new. I mostly believed it because I trusted her knowledge, but I still felt heavy guilt when I ate ""bad"" or ""unhealthy"" foods. Now, I can confidently and easily say that food has no moral value - it's just food - and I eat what I want without a second thought.Additionally, engaging in further research that backs up those above helpful truths played a crucial role in my recovery. I'm currently reading (and loving) ""The F*ck It Diet"" by Caroline Dooner, and I plan to read ""Anti-Diet: Reclaim Your Time, Money, Well-Being, and Happiness Through Intuitive Eating"" by dietitian Christy Harrison next. Repetition can't come from only ourselves or others; it's best when we can experience it both internally and externally.Six years have passed since I started recovery the first time, and I still struggle. I still feel guilty about what or how much I eat sometimes, and I don't always feel great about my body's size. But when these thoughts arise, I can quickly change them to be more helpful. I remember that my food intake doesn't change who I am as a person, and that I'm loved for who I am, not what I look like. I struggle a lot less, and I keep fighting. I engage in cognitive restructuring probably every day, because eating disorders can be an ongoing battle, but I know they're an opponent worth fighting against. I'm also less tired from doing the work because it requires less from me now. For example, I don't have to write my thoughts down anymore - I just think about them. They come to me naturally; I don't have to try so hard.I've been in active recovery after a minor slip for about a year now, and I don't see myself going back to my disordered behaviors. I know they aren't sustainable or healthy. I can also better discern when my thoughts are coming from my eating disorder, which wants me to be stuck worrying about food forever, and I ignore them. I also reach out to loved ones and other resources to support me in this endeavor. Through changing my disordered thoughts internally and with others' help, I have a more positive, healthy relationship with food in which I don't fear it or feel guilty after enjoying it. If you told me a few years ago I could order whatever I wanted off a menu without worrying about the calories, I wouldn't have believed you - but that's where I am today.I want to be clear that I have a lot of privileges that many don't have. With my family's help, I could afford therapy and educational books. I'm also a white woman with thin privilege, meaning people believed me when I told them about my struggles, and I face less identity-based oppression. While cognitive restructuring probably saved my life, it may not work for everyone. If this tool or another tool doesn't work for you, it's not your fault - we all have different experiences and feelings that shape our different needs. Don't feel guilty or shameful, just respect yourself and know you're not weird or hopeless.Possibly most of all, however, I want everyone struggling with an eating disorder to know this: You can overcome your eating disorder, and you are worth recovery. Your eating disorder won't serve the same purpose it used to, but that's okay, because you'll learn new coping strategies and truths that can help you live a happier, freer life.

Therapy Session,"The door creaked open, and Nnamdi walked in.Dr. Nnamdi. Right. My boyfriend turned therapist was insisting on the title.'Close your eyes.'I adjusted on the wooden bed set at the side of the empty room- where we would regularly sneak in to eat the forbidden fruit in my mother's absence- and closed my eyes.The sound of Nnamdi sitting down on the only other piece of furniture - a half-eaten sofa and rustling paper, filtered into my ears. Today's session had started.'Tell me about the last time you were happy.''The last time I was-''Happy. Yes.''But I am happy, Nnamdi. I am with you,' I insisted.He coughed. 'Dr Nnamdi. The last time you were truly happy, Joan. You know what I mean. Today I am happy to let you talk without interruption. This will be my only question.'I sighed. This was one cranky Dr Nnamdi.'The year is 59' and my father is alive. I am happy.'I opened my eyes slightly to see him reclined back into the chair, eyes closed and facing the ceiling. 'Are you listening? Where are your notes, Doctor?''I am listening, Joan; it helps the experience. Close your eyes. Continue.'I rolled my eyes and settled back into the most comfortable position I could conjure on a wooden bed.'The year is 59,' and it is filled with roses. We had a rose garden at the back of our house. The scent was scintillating, therapeutic. We used to sit on the verandah every evening - me on his laps- hoping the wind would waft the roses' smell into our nostrils as we spoke on everything my 8-year mind could handle. We spoke politics and music, family problems and farming. It was random, but I believe there is no subject we did not touch.'After we had exhausted our speaking energy, we would be quiet for the rest of the evening, just staring at the roses and beyond at anything and everything. You see, it was like a rule-no-talking period. I would eventually sleep off, and when it got dark, he would pick me up and go inside. He would lay me on the couch, and when my mother tried to wake me for dinner, he would say, 'Leave her, she is tired. She will eat, but she has eaten.' I almost always woke up about 30 minutes later, very hungry.''Sometimes I would come out at night, to use the pit toilet outside, and I would see him in the living room, sitting like a log of wood, without moving. When I was done peeing, I would come back to the living room and tap him. He would lift me into his laps without saying a word and lay my head on his chest, rocking me to sleep. 'Don't let them take me, Inem, he would mutter. I never understood what he said; I was only interested in sleeping.'Joan opened her eyes to look at Nnamdi - whose eyes were transfixed to the ceiling - and coughed. Nnamdi barely responded with a flick of his hand, indicating she continued.'On my 15th birthday, there was a knock on our front door, and a giant of a man, about 6'6, came in when I went to answer him. I stared at him dumbly - unable to say a word - till he smiled and asked me where my father was. I promptly left to fetch my father and told him someone was looking for him.Father stepped into the parlour, and his expression looked as if he had seen a ghost.'Ebuzor!'. The giant had made himself comfortable in our living room and now stood to greet my father, who just moped at him. He turned to look at me.'How- Who opened the door?''Now, now Ebuzor, nwanem, relax, ehn? Imela gi? It has been long.' He bared a set of blackened teeth.My father's pale expression hadn't changed. 'What is it now?'The giant collapsed back into the sofa, grinning. 'Is this what we are now, eh Ebuzor? You won't even offer me kola nut.'I scampered out of the living room to get it. I needed a reason to leave there. I was done in a few seconds and returned to stand at the kitchen door, peeping.'Cut the pleasantries, Okonkwo. What do you want?'The grin vanished, and he rubbed his hands together. 'General says you are to resume in the quarters by Friday.''What?!' It was Tuesday.'You know how he is, Ebuzor, impulsive. It's the war. He's got worse.'My father took two weak steps forward. 'Okonkwo, I'm not going anywhere. I have a family to take care of. I have a daughter. I'm done with the army,ị ghọtara m?Okonkwo sighed and scratched an ear. 'General will not hear of this. You already know what he will do.''No.''Yes. Your wife. Dead. Your child. Prison.'I released a gasp, and my father whirled around to see me standing with the plate of kola nut.Okonkwo stood up. 'I'll be expecting you.' He let himself out.Friday came, and my father packed his bags. We said our solemn goodbyes, and when it was my turn to hug him, the tears spilled. I held him tightly and kept crying.My father held me and kissed my head. 'I will come back, Inem.'He would come back. So we waited.We moped around the house in the weeks following his leave. Waiting. Our ritual was the same. There were house chores, and then there was my mother sitting in the living room, staring at the door intently, as if someone would walk through there any moment. I cried every day in my room.We waited. We waited 3 weeks.Then it was time for him to come back. I joined her in the parlour, holding hands. They had sent a messenger on Sunday to say he would return before the next market day. And we waited.We were in the parlour every day, hoping, waiting, crying. And looking at the door like someone would walk in any moment.Nobody did. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.Thursday. Friday. Saturday.Saturday, there was banging on the gate. I tapped my sleeping mother and led her by the hand to the gate. It was the giant. His eyes were red. My mother gripped his singlet weakly. 'Where is my husband?'He was silent. Then he turned around and walked. We chased him, teary and blurry-eyed, confused, till he turned the corner. There were roughly a hundred men gathered there, heads bowed.Okonkwo turned to us. 'The war was a disaster. They had help, allies from outside the country. The first battalion went down, and then they riddled us with bullets.'He lifted his singlet, and there was a large gauze plastered over his stomach, soaked in blood. He had been shot. 'I'm a dying man. I will be gone by Monday.'He dropped it. 'Ebuzor was in the third battalion. It was bombed. Then they raided it for survivors.'He choked, hardly able to continue. 'They beat them and cut their throats. I watched in hiding, injured and unable to move. Ebuzor was the last to die. They bashed his brains out.'My mother and I moped at him, shivering, shaking. My head was pounding, and bright flashes of light momentarily blinded my vision.He turned to where everybody stood. There was a table with boxes atop them. 'Please. Don't go there.'His eyes rolled to the back of his head, staggered, and then dropped to his knees, holding his stomach. Blood gushed out around him, and about ten people gathered around him immediately.I was still shaking, looking at my mother and back to Okonkwo dying in our front. Her eyes were glazed over, and she said nothing. Then she dropped.I screamed.I lay down beside her, shaking her head. 'Mama! Mama, wake up! Nooooooo!' Someone lifted me from her while others crowded her and covered her from my view. I couldn't believe that any of this was happening.I shook the person off. I was dizzy. Everywhere was turning. I turned for a couple of seconds and held my head to make it stop. My eyes landed on the boxes Okonkwo had pointed to earlier.I walked towards them with intent. Nobody paid attention to me: two dead people were sucking it up.I reached into the boxes and grappled with the lid of the first one. It didn't budge, and then I saw there was a name labelled on it. Isaac. They were all labelled. My eyes ran over the rest and landed on one.Ebuzor. Everything was moving faster now.I allowed my legs to carry me to it, and I lifted the lid. Then I saw it.One side of my father's head was open, with maggot-infested squished brain falling out of it. Worms and flies covered the rest.And it stank.I dropped the lid back carefully and stepped back. Slowly.Then everywhere went black.'1959 was the year roses grew. 1959 I was young. 1959 my father was alive.' I sniffled.I heard the chair creaking. Then Nnamdi was beside me.'There is nothing I want more than for the smell of roses to take me where my father is. There is nothing that would make me happy anymore. I'm tired.'He put a hand around me and pulled me in, running nose and eyes, and held me tightly. His free hand ran over my hair, and he said nothing. It was all I needed.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*Cf8N2b2aFhkCp4-A,https://medium.com/theoracleafrica/therapy-session-e692a00aa5e7,fiction,f505bf6a2b06d0f2372ceb3dfb2a526846885798a31df0b3b695755c
Coordinating Center Of The Brain- Cerebellum; Explained,"Image: Drawing of the Human Brain showing cerebellum and pons.| By Henry Vandyke Carter • Public domainThe cerebellum (Latin for ""little brain"") is a major feature of the hindbrain of all vertebrates. Although usually smaller than the cerebrum, in some animals such as the mormyrid fishes it may be as large as or even larger. In humans, the cerebellum plays an important role in motor control. It may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language as well as emotional control such as regulating fear and pleasure responses, but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established. The human cerebellum does not initiate movement, but contributes to coordination, precision, and accurate timing: it receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and other parts of the brain and integrates these inputs to fine-tune motor activity. Cerebellar damage produces disorders in fine movement, equilibrium, posture, and motor learning in humans.Image: View of the cerebellum from above and behind.| Dr. Johannes Sobotta • Public domainAt the level of gross anatomy, the cerebellum consists of a tightly folded layer of cortex, with white matter underneath and a fluid-filled ventricle at the base. Four deep cerebellar nuclei are embedded in the white matter. Each part of the cortex consists of the same small set of neuronal elements, laid out in a highly stereotyped geometry. At an intermediate level, the cerebellum and its auxiliary structures can be separated into several hundred or thousand independently functioning modules called ""microzones"" or ""microcompartments"".Anatomically, the human cerebellum has the appearance of a separate structure attached to the bottom of the brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.The strongest clues to the function of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, on the same side of the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.Before the 1990s the function of the cerebellum was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have brought that view into question. Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown interactions between the cerebellum and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex, and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the cerebellum. In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children. Estimates based on functional mapping of the cerebellum using functional MRI suggest that more than half of the cerebellar cortex is interconnected with association zones of the cerebral cortex.Kenji Doya has argued that the cerebellum's function is best understood not in terms of the behaviors it affects, but the neural computations it performs; the cerebellum consists of a large number of more or less independent modules, all with the same geometrically regular internal structure, and therefore all, it is presumed, performing the same computation. If the input and output connections of a module are with motor areas (as many are), then the module will be involved in motor behavior; but, if the connections are with areas involved in non-motor cognition, the module will show other types of behavioral correlates. Thus the cerebellum has been implicated in the regulation of many different functional traits such as affection, emotion, and behavior. The cerebellum, Doya proposes, is best understood as predictive action selection based on ""internal models"" of the environment or a device for supervised learning, in contrast to the basal ganglia, which perform reinforcement learning, and the cerebral cortex, which performs unsupervised learning.The comparative simplicity and regularity of the cerebellar anatomy led to an early hope that it might imply a similar simplicity of computational function, as expressed in one of the first books on cerebellar electrophysiology, The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine by John C. Eccles, Masao Ito, and János Szentágothai. Although a full understanding of cerebellar function has remained elusive, at least four principles have been identified as important:Image: Model of a cerebellar perceptron, as formulated by James Albus| Albus, J.S., NIST • Public domainThere is considerable evidence that the cerebellum plays an essential role in some types of motor learning. The tasks where the cerebellum most clearly comes into play are those in which it is necessary to make fine adjustments to the way an action is performed. There has, however, been much dispute about whether learning takes place within the cerebellum itself, or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote learning in other brain structures. Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the cerebellum are derived from the ideas of David Marr and James Albus, who postulated that climbing fibers provide a teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber - Purkinje cell synapses. Marr assumed that climbing fiber input would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened. Most subsequent cerebellar-learning models, however, have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber activity would be an error signal, and would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be weakened. Some of these later models, such as the ""Adaptive Filter model of Fujita"" made attempts to understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal control theory.The idea that climbing fiber activity functions as an error signal have been examined in many experimental studies, with some supporting it but others casting doubt. In a pioneering study by Gilbert and Thach from 1977, Purkinje cells from monkeys learning a reaching task showed increased complex spike activity - which is known to reliably indicate activity of the cell's climbing fiber input - during periods when performance was poor. Several studies of motor learning in cats observed complex spike activity when there was a mismatch between an intended movement and the movement that was actually executed. Studies of the vestibulo - ocular reflex (which stabilizes the visual image on the retina when the head turns) found that climbing fiber activity indicated ""retinal slip"", although not in a very straightforward way.One of the most extensively studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a blink before the US, a conditioned response or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place - these facts taken together make a strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.The large base of knowledge about the anatomical structure and behavioral functions of the cerebellum has made it a fertile ground for theorizing - there are perhaps more theories of the function of the cerebellum than of any other part of the brain. The most basic distinction among them is between ""learning theories"" and ""performance theories"" - that is, theories that make use of synaptic plasticity within the cerebellum to account for its role in learning, versus theories that account for aspects of ongoing behavior based on cerebellar signal processing. Several theories of both types have been formulated as mathematical models and simulated using computers.1) Delay Line Hypothesis:Perhaps the earliest ""performance"" theory was the ""delay line"" hypothesis of Valentino Braitenberg. The original theory put forth by Braitenberg and Roger Atwood in 1958 proposed that slow propagation of signals along parallel fibers imposes predictable delays that allow the cerebellum to detect time relationships within a certain window. Experimental data did not support the original form of the theory, but Braitenberg continued to argue for modified versions. The hypothesis that the cerebellum functions essentially as a timing system has also been advocated by Richard Ivry.2) Tensor Network Theory:Another influential ""performance"" theory is the Tensor network theory of Pellionisz and Llinás, which provided an advanced mathematical formulation of the idea that the fundamental computation performed by the cerebellum is to transform sensory into motor coordinates.Theories in the ""learning"" category almost all derive from publications by Marr and Albus. Marr's 1969 paper proposed that the cerebellum is a device for learning to associate elemental movements encoded by climbing fibers with mossy fiber inputs that encode the sensory context. Albus proposed in 1971 that the cerebellar Purkinje cell functions as a perceptron, a neurally inspired abstract learning device. The most basic difference between the Marr and Albus theories is that Marr assumed that climbing fiber activity would cause parallel fiber synapses to be strengthened, whereas Albus proposed that they would be weakened. Albus also formulated his version as a software algorithm he called a CMAC (Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller), which has been tested in several applications.",https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*2GVV0OfJW9YH5pYc1Y9dCA@2x.jpeg,https://medium.com/neuro-science/coordinating-center-of-the-brain-cerebellum-explained-642e84f1701a,neuroscience,f3509fc04f7c65fb4a2ca084c0c18457b7024989c40b96adf7c59ce7
Clubhouse and its hockey stick growth,"Clubhouse's rapid growth has taken it to more that six million registered users (active users or those who have downloaded the app to reserve their name) as of February 1, putting it at the center of cultural phenomenon that takes social audio to heights of popularity that many years of podcasting apps and platforms have never managed.As Jeremiah Owyang discusses in his analysis of Clubhouse, a live audio social app is ideal for when video is too much and text is too little. But Clubhouse's rampant growth, despite still being iPhone-exclusive, invitation-only and without even a decent website, has seen it emerge as the outright winner in a category in which there were no fewer than 25 competitors - from upstarts like Twitter Spaces or Sonar, to the likes of Chalk, Discord, Locker Room and many more - but in which none stood out.Clubhouse's growth model, based on invitation only, reminds us of launches we hadn't seen for a long time: the app first appeared online in March 2020, but it wasn't until April that it debuted on Apple's beta testing app, Testflight, garnering 10,000 users before being released on the App Store in early October. In late November, Clubhouse gave 20 invites each to beta testers on Testflight, which triggered growth and kicked off the near vertical part of the hockey-stick shaped graph: after that, an event with Lion King actors staging a live broadcast on Clubhouse continued the upward growth of an increasingly well-known app whose next notable event was the appearance of Elon Musk, which has given it even more traction. A significant part of recent growth has been driven by Chinese users, who still have a chance to use an app that has escaped the attention of the authorities, and who are able to talk freely on it.There is now a constant succession of events announced on Clubhouse, along with all kinds of casual chats with larger or smaller audiences. And there are many other possibilities for those who dare to explore them. Obviously, not everything is wonderful: there are skeptics, there are those who complain about the poor moderation, there are many boring conversations, and many others that are simply not worthwhile. From personal experience, the issues that need to be addressed involve setting a duration for the activity of a room, so as to avoid the feeling of ""we're going to be here all day"", along with moderation, which means not accumulating too many speakers at the top of the screen (those who have already had a chance to intervene should be returned to the bottom as audience) and perhaps imposing a time limit per speaker.We should bear in mind that Clubhouse's current popularity has to be seen in the context of its subscription business model, revenue from which will be partly spent incentivizing content creators who are able to maintain traction, following a model similar to Ev Williams' Medium. If that ends up being the business model, the company will need very high growth to be able to keep going when users unwilling to pay a subscription abandon it.That said, this is one of the few truly brilliant adoption phenomena in the tech sector for a long time, and that so far hasn't been bought or copied by one of the big players.It will be interesting to see how Clubhouse evolves. If nothing else, social networks now have something that could be a killer app for live two-way voice, opening up a new communication field - like live radio, but with no entry barriers.This article was previously published on Forbes.(En español, aquí)",https://miro.medium.com/max/4936/1*jXMLnqVSWJa3QMLCQo23Lw.jpeg,https://medium.com/enrique-dans/clubhouse-and-its-hockey-stick-growth-c97fc3c0ac75,social-media,fa393e774ac5af9d326afcf2b3fb308564f405e09163c8ed14396d99
Who Doesn't Love ABBA?,"When the ox, led by a small girl, trundled onto the stuttering plane, Marcel wasn't entirely sure if he was just imagining it or if it was a practical joke sent directly from Mr Zarapastra himself.Momentarily, he stood transfixed by the large beast, shimmering black hair catching in the reflections of the Mexican sun that beamed through the plane windows and off of the tarmac runway. The ox, seemingly caught between placidity and unrest, steadied its head and gazed at Marcel as if recognising an old enemy; the two large beasts, one a dark-haired animal, the other a man of a tattooed muscular frame, were seemingly held in a standoff. The ox's young companion pulled herself closer to an upright ear, a beacon of distress, and gently hummed. Slowly, caressed by the tuneful murmur, the animal was lulled into a state of increasing sedation.Marcel was struck by the familiar hum, ""I recognise that song.""""Most people do."" The girl replied, not turning away from the ox's ear.Her voice was increasingly difficult to hear over the dissonant cacophony of sounds around them - the vibration of metal sheets, harsh spinning of propellers, an engine bellowing.""Well,"" Marcel reached into the nearby medical kit and began to pull on two latex gloves, ""Spin this cow around.""The gloves snapped with delicious tautness and Marcel took in a deep breath in an attempt to still his stomach. He had done some questionable things up to this point, a career as a drugs smuggler was always going to throw up hurdles, but he hadn't expected that he would be elbow deep in an-""It's an ox."" The young girl, linen dress fluttering, educated.""What, kid?""""It's not a cow. It's an ox."" She returned to the ox's ear.""Sure,"" He started towards the rear end of the beast. ""Either way, if you're not spinning it around I'll sort it myself, shall I?""The ox shuffled uncomfortably as Marcel began to lift its tail.""What are you doing, mister?"" The young girl said, finally breaking the soothing song and turning towards Marcel.""Getting out the goods."" He winced, fingers edging closer to the exposed orifice.""Mister, this ox is ""the goods"""".Marcel cocked an eyebrow, paused, and let out a harsh laugh, ""And you're a funny kid.""But as he returned to his duties a small hand touched him on his arm, halting him.""Mr Zarapastra wants Luckbringer delivered safe and sound, no funny business. At least that's what I was told.""""Funny business? Luckbringer? Zarapastra spoke directly..."" Marcel trailed off. ""To you?""""I'm Lottie, and yes.""She held out a confident hand and waited keenly for it to be shook. Marcel looked at his hand that was about to enter the ox, and then to Lottie, and decided which course of action he preferred. He removed the gloves and reluctantly shook her hand, his enclosed hers completely like an oyster within its shell. Under their feet, the plane quivered and the engine's blare increased.The pilot in the front turned in his seat and called back, ""Hey, Marcel, we good to go?""The large man looked to Lottie and then to the ox, this Luckbringer, sighed, and called back: ""Let's fly, Felix.""Marcel helped Lottie to strap the shuffling Luckbringer in place and then calmed it to a seated position. The young girl began to hum again and swing her feet. Marcel sitting, sentinel-like and with arms folded, was suddenly struck by the song.""Mama Mia."" He blurted out in disbelief, ""Are you humming ABBA?""""Yes,"" Lottie replied as if in a dream. ""It's the only thing that calms Luckbringer. He loves ABBA.""She reached forward and brushed the top of the ox's head who met the affectionate gesture with apparent glee, as indicated by a low grown erupting from its loosely skinned throat.""An ox that loves ABBA, I've seen it all."" Marcel scoffed.""This isn't just any ox, mister.""""Sure, he's also an ugly one."" He laughed to himself but, at seeing Lottie's face fold forlornly, he stopped, and the sound of the plane filled the void between them.""Don't listen to him,"" Lottie spoke softly to Luckbringer. ""He's had an unfortunate life; he doesn't enjoy ABBA apparently. And who doesn't love ABBA?""He hated ABBA.Marcel sighed again, but this time there was truth laced within his exhale. He looked out of the small window and as the runway began to turn from grit to a blur and the sandy dunes in the distance began to bleed into one, he reflected on his time running endless supplies of contraband for Mr Zarapastra, but also, he reminisced on those that he had lost, some of a similar age as this girl who sat close to him.As Felix dipped the plane's tail and began the ascent, almost simultaneously, Marcel's eyes grow heavier, dogged by heat and confusion, and slowly they closed.Marcel wasn't sure what was worse, the familiar dream of a young voice calling his name or being awoken by the wet, sandpaper-like tongue of an ox. Marcel felt the tongue lashing at his nose and wriggling its way around his earlobes before sputtering awake and pushing the large head away from him.Around them, ABBA sang Waterloo, how does it feel that you won the war? Luckbringer's tail lifted almost in sync with the pulse. Marcel felt sick.""How long has he been doing that?"" Marcel spat whilst rubbing his face with his hands in an attempt to dry it.""Ever since you fell asleep.""He looked at the ox once more and then to Lottie.""And how long have I been asleep?""She mused and hummed, ""A few hours.""Luckbringer, stretched his neck once more, tendons flexing beneath his dark skin, and Marcel brushed him away.""Can't say I'm overjoyed to be doused in ox's saliva."" His voice was groggy and he winced as he shuffled in his seat.""He likes you, that's why he licks you."" Lottie's passive tone contradicted her suppression of a giggle.""Oh great.""""Not so much. Once he likes you, you are bound to him.""""Bound to an ox? I've heard of worse things.""Lottie's expression changed and she turned to him, ""As you can tell by his name, this is no normal ox, Luckbringer brings luck to those around him. But with good luck-""""Comes bad luck too?""""Now, you see.""""Oh great.""""Yes, very much so."" Lottie smiled.Marcel turned his head towards the land that lay flat far below, he traced the sandy roads that connected small towns.The winner takes it all! Marcel pinched between his eyes. Could one possibly have a worse soundtrack to a journey that involved ferrying an ox and babysitting a young girl? Just get the job done. Take the money and go back. But to where? An empty half-built apartment, where your daughter's bed used to be?""What makes this ox so lucky?"" He managed to muster a question.Lottie caressed Luckbringer's head, ""His survival instincts.""""Even if you take away his beloved ABBA?""But Marcel's question was either unheard or ignored as Lottie continued, ""It wasn't a surprise when I found him amongst the ruins of my family's farm, surrounded by the still-burning carcasses of his brothers and sisters. The land was charred and all life around lay waste but Luckbringer stood solemnly in the smoke.""She brushed him, Chiquitita sang out. Marcel watched silently.""I always knew he was lucky, each town that we would walk him through would rejoice at the wells springing to life with water. I would hear word of fields that Luckbringer had graced, once more coming back to life.""""What's to say that that same luck didn't burn down your farm?"" Marcel shot a glare at the young girl.Lottie merely nodded and turned her face away, a tremble of a lip? Marcel wondered. Once more, he turned his face to the Mexican sands outside of his window.The two became silent and no more words were said between them. The hours passed, to Marcel they ground with the insistent sound of 70s Swedish pop, the greatest hits rolled by and then repeated until finally, he could not take another song, melody or word.Abruptly standing, Marcel felt the pulsating of anger in his head, ""Turn this god damn shit off. Now!""Lottie covered Luckbringer's ears, ""I wouldn't advise that, mister""""You're a little girl, and that is an ox."" Marcel turned to the pilot, ""If I hear one more harmony, I will throw this ox out of the plane. Let's see what his luck brings then.""""I really wouldn't advise that.""But as she spoke the words, ABBA stopped. Immediately a tension, almost palpable, filled the innards of the cabin. Marcel was shocked when Luckbringer rose onto his legs, ears pricked up, tail dancing anxiously. The ox's breathing had grown heavy and saliva dripped from the sides of his mouth, in streams, to the floor.""Marcel, something is happening up here."" Felix sounded shaken, he turned to look back momentarily, his brow turned in worry.Marcel sat and ignored it. They were fine. It's an ox listening to ABBA-The plane jolted and began to sway, Marcel found his heart momentarily in his throat as his reached out to grab something to hold.Lottie called out, ""Luckbringer isn't happy.""""He's a god damn ox.""There was a metallic moaning noise from outside and then a shudder as a propellor stopped turning. Marcel heard Felix scream, ""We're going down!""Lottie continued to sit serenely considering the chaos, Marcel fumbled his large frame around franticly looking for another object to grab. We're going to die; this ox is going to crash to plane. Oh, what good was I to the world anyway?""You can stop this."" Lottie soothed him.The plane was started to topple downwards and pick up speed, Felix continued to attempt to spin the controls.A high cry of air splitting started to invade the cabin; Marcel's eyes shut tightly but he couldn't escape the sound of the jet plummeting to the ground.""God damn it! SOS!"" He screamed through the blare.""I know!"" Felix cried back.""No!"" He grabbed the pilot's shoulders, ""Put on ABBA. SOS! The song!""Felix fumbled at the stereo controls but sensing the imminent crash, Marcel jumped forward and flicked through the songs until the familiar sounds of minor chords on a piano erupted from the speakers.Luckbringer's ears lowered once more, and as they did, the broken propellor began to spin back into life; the plane coughed back into life once more and the ground tilted away once more. Gradually, the plane began to flatten its course and calm permeated throughout the plane.Marcel sat down, shaking, unable to speak. The ox looked at him, and once more sat down.""A good choice,"" Lottie said, smiling.**As the plane gently touched down on the runway, Marcel realised that the shock had stunned him to silence for an hour before they landed. The young girl had appeared to become increasingly subdued and her swinging legs now lay still.Marcel watched her for a while, observing her behaviour. Lottie must have sensed it for she spoke solemnly, ""So, you see Luckbringer isn't just any ox. And that's why Mr Zarapastra wants him.""""To bring him luck.""""No,"" Lottie said, a small tear ran down her nose. ""He wants to kill him.""Do something, Marcel. How many little girls have you let down? Suppressing the memory, he unbuckled himself and sat next to Lottie, putting his arm around her. He wondered where this compassion had disappeared to over the years, somewhere into the dry well inside.""Why would he want to kill Luckbringer?""""Because-"" She stammered, struggling to speak the words. ""My farm was his factory for, well, you know-"".Marcel didn't need to say, he'd been running Mr Zarapastra's drugs across the continent for a decade, it had got him nowhere and he was more familiar with the inside of the plane than he was in the inside of his heart.""But Luckbringer brought bad luck that day and my parents were caught in the fire."" Lottie chewed her lip and held her unwavering gaze on the dark ox, ""And the flames burnt down Mr Zarapastra's factory.""The plane halted and, from the front, Felix called back still flustered, ""We're here M-M-Marcel, I'm getting o-o-out of here.""""Hey,"" Marcel replied, ""Pass me the tape.""The next moment Marcel found ABBA's Greatest Hits landing on his lap and heard the slamming of the pilot door. He stood, legs buckling slightly beneath him, and opened the hangar doors. There was a moment, something that seemed like reluctance, that emanated from Luckbringer, who couldn't turn away from Lottie. The three stood in silence for a moment longer, Lottie flung her arms around the ox's neck, a gentle acceptance, and then they walked out into the beating midday sun.Lottie, her face turned down, pulled Luckbringer at her side, feet trailing as if resisting the journey.""Luckbringer is all I have left."" The young girl spoke, voice quivering.At this rate you'll always be unlucky, asshole, Marcel thought. Within the microcosm of a second he wondered if it was luck that brought this girl and her ox to him, and what would we do with this luck?Sighing, Marcel halted their solemn walk, ""Let's go somewhere else.""""What do you mean, Marcel?""""I mean, maybe this ox could bring us some luck, wherever we go.""Lottie turned her dampened face up to his, ""But what about Mr Zarapastra?""""I'll speak to Mr Zarapastra. Don't worry."" He wasn't sure what he meant by this, or even how he'd do it but apparently, he was signing his life away. Ox bring me luck, Marcel pleaded internally.Marcel turned to Luckbringer, shuffling on the cement, and gave him a gentle tap on the rump.""Knowing Me, Knowing You and all that, hey, Luckbringer?""The ox turned away, shunning the large man and Marcel's smile faded. I've just managed to offend an ox?""Oh no,"" Lottie said, shaking her head. ""He loves ABBA, but he can't stand that song.""The two figures, large and small, and the great lucky beast trundled slowly down the beaten runway, down a road that led far away from where they were expected to be going, and, perhaps, towards a lucky life.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1224/1*7357I5WpWGbz4K2fS4oROA.jpeg,https://theweeklyknob.com/who-doesnt-love-abba-f51dfb98617f,fiction,fa44397f60eedda7196c5d11479af7c9072ad27d24257010d9e9c45d
"How to Make YouTube Product Videos Really, Really Fast","I'm a YouTuber, and I've written before about how I earn $53+ per hour creating videos for my channel. A lot of the content on my channel relates to products, and one of my core strategies is to produce product videos very, very fast. In a previous example, I showed how I can produce 9+ videos in about an hour - including all the research time, shooting time, editing time, etc.With certain products, though, I can go even faster. In 2021, I'm planning to share more about my content creation process across the board - for Youtube, here on Medium, on News Break, for my photographic work, etc. So to demonstrate my YouTube video creation process, I fired up my computer, started a livestream, went to my patio, and shot 5 YouTube product videos, live on camera.The whole thing took 18 minutes, for an average of 3.6 minutes per video, including the research time.You can watch the whole livestream to see exactly how I did it. But there are some key points I can share here, too, about the best strategies for shooting product videos really, really fast. Why does speed matter? The faster you can shoot videos, the more content you can produce. Overall, more content tends to lead to more engagement, more subscribers, more views, and more revenue.Here are some of my top strategies for shooting YouTube product videos quickly.As I show in the livestream, my core strategy for product videos is to go to the physical space where I use the product (in this case, my patio). I then pull up Amazon on my phone (where I buy most of my products), look at my order history, and click Search Orders. I then search for the product, and pull up the exact item that I'm reviewing.I take about 30 seconds to scroll through the product page, noting the brand name and product name (it's important to mention the exact brand so that people can find the product later). I also note any key features that are important to include and to get right, like what the product is made from (stainless steel, aluminum, etc) and how much it weighs.I then pull up the camera on my phone and start shooting. I like to mention the product name right off the bat. I then go into the rest of my review, making sure to note any of the key features that I saw on the product page. I find that it's helpful to remind myself of these features right before shooting a video, so they're fresh in my brain. In the livestream, you can even hear me repeating some of this data to myself before I hit record, to make sure I've got it memorized.It's easy enough to remember how you use a product, and what you like about it. But it's harder to remember if it's corrugated stainless steel or hot-dipped stainless steel, or whether it's BPA free or not. Amazon keeps all these details for you in one place, so it's helpful to use your Amazon order history to find the exact product you bought and the most important details about it right before you make a product video.Sometimes I review products as soon as I receive them. If I get something really cool on Kickstarter, I try to review it right away, before it goes mainstream. And if I get a really new product - like when I got the Fitbit Sense several days early - I make a ton of content right away. I sometimes make unboxing videos, too, or videos sharing my initial impressions of a product I just received.In many cases, though, I wait at least a month to review a product, and sometimes up to five years. Why? Because I actually use all the stuff that I review on my channel. And I find that if I take some time to use the product, I get a better understanding of what I like about it, and what aspects of it aren't so great.I can say, for example, that my outdoor kids' table holds up well to weather, because I've been using it outdoors for 2+ years. If I just got it, I couldn't say that credibly.But there's another benefit, too. If you use a product for a longer time, you have more time to develop opinions about it. Maybe you have a great experience using it - or a really negative one - that's memorable and stands out. Or maybe you just develop a better understanding of what features are important and which features aren't.All of that is valuable to share with your audience when you shoot your video. And all of it is an easy addition to the content you're creating. You don't have to do a ton of research (which takes time) in order to share your experiences using a product. You can just dive in and talk about what you've liked in using it, or any issues you've discovered.Which brings us to the next point. Many YouTubers assume that they need to produce professionally-crafted, carefully researched, comprehensive overviews of all the products they cover. Surely, there's a place for channels which do this. But the reality is that audiences mostly want to hear what you think about a product, not a long list of product specs and features.Why? Audiences are totally capable of learning about a product's basic specs by Googling it, or reading its Amazon page. When they come to YouTube, they're often looking for personal experiences, information about how well the product's features actually perform in the real world, etc.It's easy for a product's manufacturer to say that it's ""Durable and well made"" on its product page. But the only way to know for sure if that's true is to use the product for a while in a real world environment. If you've used the product and can vouch for its durability (or you've found that it's not durable) and you share that info in a YouTube video, that brings a lot of value to your customers.Videos based on your own experiences are also a lot faster and easier to shoot. Again, I like to remind myself of basic specs and brand names. But otherwise I mostly shoot videos sharing my own opinions and experiences.Remember, you're a person, not a product page. Don't waste time reading a long list of specs. Tell us what you think about a product.I have a professional broadcast setup at my desk, with a Sony AX53 camera, an ATEM Mini Pro video mixer, an Elgato video light, etc. I use it along with Open Broadcast Studio to do pro-quality videos, livestreams, presentations, interviews, etc. when I'm seated at my desk and talking about a product there. When I did a long livesteam about my Leica Q, for example, I used this setup. Ditto when I appear on TWiT or CNN.But when I'm walking around making videos about products I use on a daily basis, I shoot my YouTube videos on my phone. I also don't use a tripod, don't add fancy graphics, don't use a mic, and overall worry very little about technical quality.Why? Again, when it comes to seeing products in use, people on YouTube want to see content shot in the real world. You're bringing them into your space, and helping them see how a product looks in real life. For that, professional production values aren't only unnecessary - they're a liability. A slick, professionally-shot video about a product in a person's actual space is a dead giveaway that the video was probably produced by a brand, not a real person.Again, there's value in some slick, brand-produced product videos. And some YouTubers do set up professional broadcast systems in different spaces in their house, much as I've done at my desk. I see people who set up pro-quality studios in their kitchens, for example, and then share real-world content and product reviews about kitchen gadgets. But for the most part, if you're showing a product in real life, it pays to shoot the video on your phone or with another simple setup, and to avoid a polished, pro look.And want to know a big secret? Even brands these days love video that looks raw and authentic. Many big brands pay tens of thousands of dollars to produce video content that looks like it was shot on someone's cellphone. It's also why brands will pay influencers a ton of money to shoot authentic, low-budget sponsored videos about their products. In a world saturated with slick advertising, these personal, casual videos make a big impact on audiences (and help companies make sales).The great news is that you can produce these raw, authentic videos just by being, you know, a real person taking videos on your cellphone. Don't be afraid of this dynamic or visual style. Your shaky, casual, low-res video is actually a huge asset that big brands would love to have, but struggle to duplicate. Embrace it.Maybe you can't shoot 5 videos in 18 minutes. But if you take this advice, you can almost certainly produce valuable product videos faster and more efficiently.",https://miro.medium.com/max/11850/0*YkLmn7iCTSYKcAkF,https://tomsmith585.medium.com/how-to-make-youtube-product-videos-really-really-fast-24b3459a16b6,social-media,fb10ba8f73844fa644dbf61e3cbe1dab07c5e0821f8c506bb4289719
"All you need to know about Bluesky, the decentralized social network created by Twitter, which allows you to build your own media platform","Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey discussed Bluesky and how decentralizing social media can address some of the problems facing Section 230.By Kate DuffyTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Tuesday explained why the platform and its users would benefit from decentralized social media network systems.Dorsey was referring to the company's project, Bluesky, which has been in the works for more than a year.In a call with investors on Thursday, Dorsey said: ""I think the most important thing to focus on in terms of decentralizing social media is that it creates a much larger corpus of conversation.""Dorsey, who cofounded Twitter in 2006, said platforms that operate without central governance allows people to access a wider public conversation, more content and ranking algorithms that suit people's needs.In turn, the company can surface more relevant content to users, he said.""That will not only help our business, but drive more people into participating in social media in the first place,"" Dorsey said.Twitter formed a team dedicated to building a new decentralized social media system, Bluesky, in 2019.The project presents a new model for social media platforms and offers an alternative to traditional, centralized platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.These sites are closed platforms, meaning users on one aren't able to connect with other users on another. Bluesky will take inspiration from email, whereby users with different email addresses can reach out to each other, regardless of which email server they use.Instead of being controlled by the company in charge, the network will put the power into the hands of the user. This means Twitter would only be able to control its own app on Bluesky, not other applications.Ultimately, it would allow people to create more social media sites. The system will take many years to develop, Dorsey said in a tweet in 2019.In the initial announcement, Dorsey said that a small independent team of up to five open-source architects, engineers, and designers are working on Bluesky.People familiar with the matter told TechCrunch in January that up to 50 people from the decentralized tech community are surveying the project and planning proposals for what Bluesky should look like.The people also said Twitter is hoping to hire a project manager in the coming weeks for an independent team that will start building out Bluesky, which is in the research phase.Read more: One chart shows how Elon Musk can create a huge amount of wealth with just his TwitterOver recent years, platforms like Facebook and Twitter have come under intense scrutiny about moderating illegal and harmful content and the spread of misinformation online.An open network, such as Bluesky, will make content moderation even more difficult because it will take much of the network out of Twitter's control.In the call on Thursday, Dorsey said decentralization can be a way to ""address some of the problems that is facing Section 230,"" an internet law that protects tech companies from being liable for content posted on their sites.Democrats and Republicans have mostly agreed Section 230 should be updated. Some are even calling for it to be stripped.In a Senate hearing in October, Dorsey said stripping back Section 230 could ""collapse how we communicate on the Internet"" and leave ""only a small number of giant and well-funded"" tech firms, according to Twitter, which shared Dorsey's comments with Insider at the time.Twitter didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.For more great stories, visit Insider's homepage.",,https://medium.com/business-insider/what-to-know-about-bluesky-the-decentralized-social-network-created-by-twitter-f3b6b079e4e4,social-media,fb425b30b5ca22b1e8612eaeb604eec92667ab7bf8b0fcddb2a2ea7d
Stomp and Stride,"1936. Dawn came later with each class, tinting the tall studio windows a reddish-gold that put Tessa in mind of a ripe persimmon. The light touched the bare arms and legs of the dancers seated on the floor, listening.After the demanding paces their instructor had put them through, some dancers lay flat on their backs; others cradled their heads in their arms. Most of them worked as waitresses or in factories to make a living. Martha struggled to pay them ten dollars a performance, but they rehearsed on their own time.Tessa was bone tired. Her mother's sleep-talking had startled her awake, and whenever she woke up, she remembered things she'd just as soon forget.She'd spent half the night staring at the revolving images in her head - moonlight shining on the policeman's blond crewcut. Her brother's face framed in the squad car window as it crunched away. The Paint Rock, Alabama, moon shrinking in the sky, retreating, out of reach. Ghosts that had spurred her to Harlem, to this Greenwich Village dance studio.Martha Graham, sturdy and supple, with the dark, deep-set eyes of a tragic heroine, posed in front. She stretched out a hand and made a slicing vertical motion. ""Picture a young tree, slender and frail, a sapling.""Tessa rubbed her eyes. She pictured a young tree.Sunup seeped across the floor. A faint piano note chirped - Housley shifting his weight on his elbow. Tessa swallowed, tried to ignore the good-looking young Black man at the keyboard, index finger stroking his chin, red suspenders hugging his crisp white dress shirt. His eyes flicked her way.What are you after- cutting your eyes at me like that?Tessa liked his broad shoulders and dimpled smile, but she'd steered clear of him since making it into this all-white dance troupe. She was fine by herself. Men brought trouble.Martha raised an eyebrow. Tessa focused on the lacquer chopsticks skewering Martha's slick bun and straightened her spine to prove she was listening.Martha made a sweeping circle with both hands. ""Now picture a wire fence around that sapling, a cage meant to keep it safe.""Tessa pictured the fenced-in sapling. She could see the cage, all right-made of barbed wire, fanged and dangerous.Martha said, ""Imagine that sapling growing, its trunk thickening layer by layer, getting stronger.""Tessa pictured that. The tree trunk in her mind's eye was golden brown, her own skin color. But her tree's bark was scaly, scored with cracks.""Years,"" Martha intoned. ""Decades. The tree is old. It has outgrown its cage. But the cage is embedded deep in its bark. Scarring it, shaping it, marking it. It is part of the tree's story, part of its being.""Tessa swallowed again, but the lump in her throat wouldn't budge.Martha lifted her hands above her head and stared at her students with widened eyes. ""And yet the tree lives. Strong, healthy. Holding within itself the piercing remnants of its own struggle to grow. That tree is you,"" Martha pointed at Lana Rosenthal.Lana's spine straightened and she smiled smugly. The blonde dynamo, Tessa's rival for the top spot in the company, was a pink-and-white Christmas card angel with the stealth and force of a leopard.Lana put Tessa in mind of an old friend whose name she had forgotten and wanted to learn again. But at this moment, Tessa hated her.Martha pointed at other dancers, one by one. ""Rose, that tree is you. And you, Trudy. And you, Irene.""At last, Martha put her palms together in front of her chest and lifted her chin, signaling the end of her fable.The dancers murmured. Tessa felt slapped. She was the only one who hadn't been singled out. Did the others notice? Clearly, Martha hadn't pointed to her. Why not? Was this insult some sort of test? She clenched her toes into talons. Her jaw ached.The dance mistress spread her arms wide.""So you see, from those who have much, much is expected."" She clapped her hands. ""Tomorrow we dance again. Class dismissed.""Martha crossed the room to the piano, her legs flashing under her royal blue kimono, and bent her spiky head toward Housley's neatly shaved scalp. The dancers swirled in and out of the changing room. Clutching sweaters and dance bags, they exited, sashaying or sauntering in twos or threes.But Tessa, her breaths coming short and tight, didn't feel inclined to leave just yet. Not at all. She saw herself in the mirrored wall, slender and scowling, feet planted in second position. She watched herself pluck at the knot of her headscarf, holding her breath till it hurt, refusing to shrug off Martha's insult.Been through more than my share. Got a cage around me squeezing me till my teeth rattle.Was Martha actually saying Tessa wasn't strong enough, even after the night the Paint Rock moon rose so high above the cotton field no one could pull it back to earth?""Well, I'm here, ain't I?"" She muttered it under her breath, but Martha turned toward her.Got the ears of a bird dog, that woman.""Tessa, if I may . . ."" Martha floated over and put a hand on Tessa's shoulder.Tessa frowned at Martha's red-painted mouth and said nothing.""You dance with such exquisite rage, my dear.""Exquisite what? Was this an insult or high praise? ""Pardon, ma'am?""""My dear, follow your anger. See where it takes you. Never fear.""From someplace deep inside, the truth tore from Tessa's throat. ""You think I'm afraid? Ma'am, with respect, you don't know how strong I am. You never had it like me."" Her voice trembled.Housley stood there staring and she didn't care one bit.Martha Graham grinned. ""Yes! Good girl. Use that rage. Make it art.""""Oh!"" Tessa gave a strangled cry. This is too much.Martha smiled as if enjoying the pleasant rustle of leaves.Tessa whirled and stalked away, yanking off her headscarf and flinging it into a corner. She struggled with the changing room door, desperate to slam it behind her. But the metal arm at the top of the jamb wouldn't let her. Instead, the door eased shut with a maddening wheeze.She stubbed her toe on a bench. ""Damn!""She clawed at her leotard, stretching it out of shape as she peeled it off. She grabbed her street clothes from her locker and shoved herself into them.She didn't care. She just didn't care what that woman thought anymore. But it was a lie and she knew it.She heard Housley and Martha leave together, chatting about Fats Waller. For once Martha hadn't gone to her apartment above the studio to dance for hours. As great as she was, she always said if she ever stopped practicing technique she'd lose her edge in a matter of weeks.Well, if Martha wasn't practicing, she must be headed to the corner store for a bottle. Tessa savored the spitefulness of this thought, enjoying it all the more because it was probably true.She wandered through the deserted practice room. White rectangles stretched across the scarred wood floor. She felt fine. Though she knew she'd regret it later, her back-talk to Martha had lifted her spirits. It was the first time she'd dared cross her.The only thing that gnawed at her at the moment was Housley seeing her disrespect Martha. She guessed she cared what he thought of her, too.She glanced toward the corner of the room for her headscarf, but it wasn't there. She'd find it later, but right now her hair was a mess. Smoothing it, she flashed back to Paint Rock days, marking steps in the church basement in a red bandana.She shook her head. ""Stop,"" she told herself. The past was long gone.Maybe the great Martha Graham had a point, after all. Why not dance her anger out? Nobody would know.Tessa kicked off her Mary Janes and closed her eyes. She saw a pitch-black stage, lit by one lone spotlight. In the silence between dark and light, a woman inside Tessa's head noiselessly bucked and kicked, one arm thrown back.Tessa squeezed her eyelids tight, willing the dance to continue. Over and over, the shadowy figure arched and bent, arched and bent, flinging one arm above her head like a snapping whip.Tessa danced what she imagined. Under her cheap chintz dress, she felt droplets trickle down her sides. She heard herself groan.Then, amazingly, the piano sang out with a driving jazz beat. She swiveled her head to look. Housley had let himself into the studio.She kept dancing.He attacked the keys. His thumping chords, his crazy fast high notes jumping and tumbling on top of the rhythm, made her answer with her body. She rocked forward and back, a hurt woman comforting herself.She stretched like a bowstring, shot across the floor, landed with two stamps of her foot. Bam, bam! Look out!She leaped again, and the air split open to let her fly.Meanwhile, Housley's piano gave a long questioning ripple. Tessa replied with a kick and a spin, finishing up in a low crouch that nearly snapped her garters.But that wasn't all. She exploded up and out, arms and legs splayed, hovering airborne for a wild second. She landed with another stomp, stomp, so hard her bones shook.Housley came back at her with a stampede of chords. Tessa whirled and tossed her head, spiraling through space until she felt sparks flying from her fingertips, her toes, her scalp. She was happy.Finally, she slowed her frantic pace. Housley's tempo slowed to match hers, and his touch on the keys got softer until the piano's shouts became a whispered prayer.Tessa came to a full stop. She stood tall and still, one arm raised above her head.She wiped her upper lip on her sleeve. Her dress was damp.Housley shut the piano lid and stood. ""Got your headscarf,"" he said, as if nothing strange and wonderful had just happened. He held out the neatly folded rag.Tessa took it with a nod. She was still panting. ""Hey, thanks for - What do you call it? I mean, I know it's jazz."" She stopped to catch her breath.Housley nodded. His lips tensed, as if waiting for her verdict.Tessa searched for words. ""Jazz, but different.""""They call it stride,"" he said. ""Stride piano. With some stuff of mine thrown in.""""Well, it was mighty fine. Stomp and stride, huh?""He smiled. His teeth were straight and even. ""You did some fine dancing, Miss Lark.""He had a dimple in his cheek and his thick-lashed eyes were soft and deep. Tessa felt thirsty. ""Thanks again, Mr. James.""Housley stayed put. Something beyond telling shuttled back and forth between them, warm and solid. She took a shaky breath and started for the door.That invisible good thing twitched like a live creature as she brushed past him. Did he feel it?Housley kept pace with her. ""How about that - we're neighbors,"" he said. ""Same train. Be mighty pleased to see you home, Miss Tessa.""She heard the South in his voice and grinned. ""Where you from?""""Oklahoma. You?""""Paint Rock, Alabama,"" Tessa said and chuckled.""What's so funny?""""First time I don't mind saying it. Not so much, anyhow.""Housley squinted at her and tipped his head, but he didn't say anything else about it.The subway car rattled and moaned and shook itself all over. They sat side by side, hurtling toward Harlem. As if following the rules of a game, they rode in silence.Tessa felt the rhythm of the train all the way from the soles of her feet to the top of her head, and she knew he felt it too - stomp and stride.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8992/1*FIwqiN-j2xYPklqfvzJwdQ.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/stomp-and-stride-ed2903061db9,fiction,fbb1a5c65142642c2d75fddf628ef00ae2c54538c7a6330affa3806f
You Can Sell Amazon's #1 Product Too,"Amazon doesn't sell stuff. At least, that's not their primary source of revenue. Jeff Bezos is not one of the wealthiest people in the world because he sells books and baking trays. My local supermarket does that.The main thing Amazon sells, the magical fairy dust that they sprinkle over everything they touch, every industry they conquer, is ease. Ease of browsing, ease of purchase, ease of payment, ease of delivery. Everything about the Amazon experience is designed to be easy.In an accelerating world, where companies come and go in the blink of an eye and technology is obsolete almost before it's even hit the shelves, the value of quick, easy solutions cannot be overstated. As life gets faster, so do people's expectations. Quality is important, so is price, but increasingly speed and ease are king and queen. If your new laptop can be delivered within 24 hours, does it really matter if it's a few dollars more? If you can get that Halloween costume delivered straight to your work, no fuss, then who cares about the quality?Think about it. Pretty much everything that Amazon sells can be found elsewhere, sometimes for a better price. High street shops and supermarkets still exist, and there's no delivery time when you buy directly from them. There are loads of other streaming platforms available, with more appearing almost every day. Almost nothing that Amazon offers is, in fact, completely unique. How, then, have they taken over the world in the way that they have?Ease. Though it's true that pretty much everything on Amazon can be found elsewhere, it can't all be found in one, real-world location and then placed into a single, neat basket. If you want furniture, clothes, groceries, and entertainment from other sources, that means 4 providers, 4 transactions, 4 terms and conditions, and multiple locations. Why not just get everything done at once, from the comfort of your sofa? Why not take the simple, easy route and then get on with your day?It's a good point.There is a reason why Amazon Prime is arguably one of the greatest products developed in recent years. A flat fee for a whole 12 months of ease? People couldn't get enough. At the end of 2019, Prime had 112 million users in the US alone, with a total of more than 150 million worldwide. And with an ever-expanding library of digital content now included with Prime Video, as well as next-day delivery, that number is surely set for continued, rapid growth.Are high street shops dying because their products are university more expensive than Amazon's alternatives? Is their stock of lower quality? Are they all in difficult to reach locations? No, on all counts. They're just not as easy.So, what can you do about all this?That very much depends on what your business is. I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that everyone is going to be the next Bezos. It's possible, but unlikely.But every single one of you can make your business easier and more accessible. In the world of the internet, most things are just a few clicks away. That's the market we're aiming for here. The fewer clicks your customers need to make, the better your business will thrive. Again, Amazon leads the way on this with their one-click purchase option for customers with established accounts.One click. That's all. One-click and a day to two later the thing you want arrives at your door.You know what else one-click does? It gives customers less time to reconsider. Every second they spend navigating through a booking or purchasing process is a second in which they could change their mind.So let them get what they want in as few seconds as possible.If you sell products online, you should aim for as few clicks as possible. If you can, save customers information so that, after the first visit, one-click purchasing might be an option.If you need the customer to make a booking, have the forms on your home page, with as few buttons and boxes as possible. Make it a matter of 30 seconds for them to reach out. You can worry about reeling them in afterwards, once they have made that first move.If you're not selling anything, the philosophy of ease still applies to you. Websites don't exist for no reason. Every single site has a purpose and, whatever that purpose is, it can be made easier to achieve.If you're looking for email contacts, only ask them for their email. Every other piece of information you ask for increases the chances of them changing their remind, getting scared off, or getting bored.If you want your content read because you have a message to share, put it in front of them ASAP. Don't hide your world-changing manifesto behind three clickthrough links. It might help to keep the website looking orderly, but every click is reducing your readership. Why do you think newspaper websites have such busy, flashy home pages?Do you see where I'm going with this?People, by and large, are busy and lazy. Ease is the ultimate currency of this century. In a world that is moving at breakneck speed, businesses have to keep up. We have to supply at the speed of demand.That's what Amazon do, and look where it got them.I'm probably coming off as a bit cutthroat. I get that. Flippant discussions of quality and price in relation to ease can be difficult. But when I say that low-quality products still sell if they're easy, or that you can charge extra for ease, I'm not suggesting that we do away with the more noble aims of business entirely. High-quality products are still high quality. Fair pricing will always win out against inflated prices in the end. People are not blind consumers, they can and do make active decisions towards these things, and that's good.However, we cannot deny the fact that ease is a big market. As marketers, we are not forcing customers to buy things they don't want at prices they don't like just because of minimal clicks. We are making their purchasing decisions easier, but we're not making them for them.All I'm saying is that, if there is a choice between two or three products, ease of the process is more and more becoming an important factor in purchasing decisions, in some cases trumping quality and price.Knowing that, and playing to it, will place us and our businesses in a better position for the future. After all, isn't that what business is all about? Giving people what they want?",https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/1*gb5WUmjA2k90B8Nkj55jZw.jpeg,https://sean-writing27.medium.com/you-can-sell-amazons-1-product-too-beb5f8be2517,business,fbd43e0261cf28256b7aeec530c38f8b371cf4fab5d26836e088569e
How To Actually Build a Huge List for No More Than $15 a Month,"So you want to build a list? Scratch that - you need to build a list.I am going to show you exactly how you can start building your list. This is the exact same process that I will be using to start building my list. The best part is that you can grow your list up to 2,500 members and send them up to 62,000 emails per month with almost no upfront costs.You only start to pay additional (very reasonable) fees when you've grown beyond 2,500 subscribers.Doesn't that sound great? Make sure you read this whole article as it's full of great information including some bonus tips at the end.*There are a couple of ways to go about step three.There are tons of different domain registration/email/ website companies out there to choose from.The list goes on and on.They offer several different domains, email, and web hosting packages.All prices shown are as of the date of publication.Make sure you go to IONOS.com and not IONOS.ca even if you live in Canada. They offer more products and better pricing.The first is the webmail offering. You can see the details for each package below based on one user. You get one free domain name as well as free private registration for one year. The domain name will cost $15 per year after the first 12 months.Next up is their MS365 packages. Yes, these come with a higher price tag but many more tools and features vs. their standard webmail account. With the MS365 Business basic and Business Standard accounts you get one free domain as well as free private registration for one year. The domain name will cost $15 per year after the first 12 months.With the MS Exchange 2019 package, you get a lifetime domain but lose access to the other MS Office tools, besides Outlook.The below pricing shows the current price deals they have in place.Last up is their GSuite package. The pricing is lower than the MS365 option but still a bit higher than the IONOS webmail option. Again when compared to their webmail you have access to many more tools and features.With the base GSuite account, you get one user (can go up to as many as five at simple costs per month/per user). Again you get one free domain name as well as free private registration for one year. The domain name will cost $15 per year after the first 12 months.The below pricing shows the current price deal they have in place.Just to make sure you know all of the options you have, let's look at their web hosting option. This option allows more flexibility for growth in the future and also allows you to host your email collection landing page on your own domain.They offer Linux hosting packages and WordPress hosting packages.For this article, I will focus on WordPress hosting because this will give most users easier access to plugins (many are free) to help build your landing page which you can then add the EmailOctopus word press plugin too so you can collect your email subscribers from it.They offer many more features with these packages that you can see here.As you can see the upfront costs to go this way aren't much different than the email-only options but you are now set up with in place hosting if and when you want to build your own website or blog.Again the biggest thing to note is that you won't have access to the MS365 or GSuite tools with this option. You will just have the IONOS webmail (several 2GB accounts).So there you have it. I showed you how you can build an email list of 2,500 subscribers and send them up to 62,000 emails a month for as low as free with your personal Gmail account.Email marketing and building your list doesn't need to be super complicated, nor super expensive.Getting set up with your own domain (what I plan on doing) the costs for year one range from $12 to $155 with the ongoing costs after that varying depending on which way you choose to go.Even if you go with the Cadillac MS365 Business Standard plan your average monthly cost is less than $15. Most of you do not need that plan and will see much lower monthly costs to get up and running even when using your own custom domain to start building your list and your brand.Here is another freemium option for anyone that actually made it all the way to the end. As I noted in my article ""A Guide to Getting Started With EmailOctopus"" their current landing page offerings are very limited.If you go with the WordPress hosting option then you can just build your own landing page and use the EmailOctopus word press plugin to send subscribers to your email list.If you go just with a domain and email hosting package then you need another option for your landing page. Carrd is just that option and they are easily integrated with EmailOctopus.Carrd can be used 100% for free (limited use and hosted on their domain) or you can pay to upgrade to Pro. They offer three different price points of $9, $19, and $49 per year... yes per year. Each level comes with a variety of different features which you can see here.The free plan allows you to build three sites using standard images and their own URLs. You cannot use your own domain on the free plan. You also cannot integrate your sign-up form with EmailOctopus. Do yourself a favor and get the $19 plan. At $1.58 per month, I am sure you can justify it!",https://miro.medium.com/max/6000/1*lvgLRfov6Fa4Ln3U0qdt6Q.png,https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-to-actually-build-a-huge-list-for-no-more-than-15-a-month-294b8c1b7d5b,marketing,fc487481444cf95feccd80ab822b3e4b28928ae4a00db5cfa6262095
The double nightmare of the cat-lawyer,"Analysing internet memes tends to be self-defeating: mostly their magic comes from a fleeting, blasé irony which makes you look like a fool if you try to pin it down. But sometimes a gem comes along that's too good to let pass. Besides, the internet's endless stream of found objects, jokes and observations are ultimately a kind of glorious collective artwork, somewhere between Dada collage and an epic poem composed by a lunatic. And like all artworks, this one has themes and motifs worth exploring.Which brings me to cat-lawyer. The clip of the Texas attorney who, thanks to a visual filter, manages to take the form of a fluffy kitten in a Zoom court hearing, has gone superviral. The hapless attorney, Rod Ponton, claims he's been contacted by news outlets around the world. ""I always wanted to be famous for being a great lawyer,"" he reflected, ""now I'm famous for appearing in court as a cat.""The video clearly recalls the similarly sensational case of Robert Kelly, the Korea expert whose study was invaded by his two young children during a live interview with the BBC. What makes both clips so funny is the pretence of public formality - already under strain in the video-call format, since people are really just smartly dressed in their homes - being punctured by the frivolity of childhood. Ridiculously, the victims try to maintain a sense of decorum. The punctilious Kelly ignores his rampaging infants and mumbles an apology; the beleaguered Ponton, his saucer-like kitten's eyes shifting nervously, insists he's happy to continue the hearing (""I'm not a cat"" he reassures the judge, a strong note of desperation in his voice).These incidents don't become so famous just because they're funny, though. Like a lot of comedy, they offer a light-hearted, morally acceptable outlet for impulses that often appear in much darker forms. We are essentially relishing the humiliation of Ponton and Kelly, much as the roaming mobs of ""cancel culture"" relish the humiliation of their targets, but we expect the victims to recognise their own embarrassment as a public good. The thin line between such jovial mockery and the more malign search for scapegoats is suggested by the fact that people have actually tried to discredit both men. Kelly was criticised for how he handled his daughter during his ordeal, while journalists have dredged up old harassment allegations against Ponton.But there are other reasons why, in the great collective fiction of internet life, cat-lawyer is an interesting character. As I've previously written at greater length, online culture carries a strong strain of the grotesque. The strange act of projecting the self into digital space, both liberating and anxiety-inducing, has spurred forms of expression that blur the boundaries of the human and of social identity. In this way, internet culture joins a long artistic tradition where surreal, monstrous or bizarre beings give voice to repressed aspects of the human imagination. Human/animal transformations like the cat-lawyer have always been a part of this motif.Of course it's probably safe to assume that Ponton's children, and not Ponton himself, normally use the kitten filter. But childhood and adolescence are where we see the implications of the grotesque most clearly. Bodily transformation and animal characters are a staple of adolescent fiction, because teenagers tend to interpret them in light of their growing awareness of social boundaries, and of their own subjectivity. Incidentally, I remember having this response to a particularly cheesy series of pulp novels for teens called Animorphs. But the same ideas are being explored, whether playfully or disturbingly, in gothic classics like Frankenstein and the tales of E.T.A Hoffman, in the films of David Lynch, or indeed in the way people use filters and face-changing apps on social media.The cat-lawyer pushes these buttons too: his wonderful, mesmerising weirdness is a familiar expression of the grotesque. And this gels perfectly with the comedy of interrupted formality and humiliation. The guilty expression on his face makes it feels like he has, by appearing as a cat, accidentally exposed some embarrassing private fetish in the workplace.Perhaps the precedent this echoes most clearly is Kafka's ""Metamorphosis,"" where the longsuffering salesman Gregor Samsa finds he has turned into an insect. Recall that Samsa'a family resents his transformation not just because he is ghastly, but because his ghastliness makes him useless in a world which demands respectability and professionalism. It is darkly absurd, but unsettling too: it awakens anxieties about the aspects of ourselves that we conceal from public view.The cat-lawyer's ordeal is a similar kind of double nightmare: a surreal incident of transformation, an an anxiety dream about being publicly exposed. Part of its appeal is that it lets us appreciate these strange resonances by cloaking them in humour.",,https://wessiedutoit.medium.com/the-double-nightmare-of-the-cat-lawyer-7fb0044d7c28,social-media,fcce070da6d785dc1a6c858c4df154e2b4c00a8ef32173effa92c48b
Prague - Never Let's You Go,"What do you think of when someone mentions Prague? I can imagine that many would be instantly reminded of groups of drunk 20-something year old men celebrating their last days of freedom before they get hitched, right? Bachelor parties and stag dos filling the streets?I'm here to change your mind and hopefully persuade you that there's so much more to this city than beer bikes and blokes.I've traveled to many cities around the world and hope to see many more, but Prague will always hold a special place in my heart. It was a city were I was born and raised. Upon visiting many other cities - I am grateful for being blessed to have experienced Prague.Prague is the most beautiful when covered in snow. With less tourists and the snow decorating all the amazing buildings, there's surely no better time of year to visit Prague than in winter.Prague has so many wonderful cafes, restaurants that are the ultimate where you can warm up, relax and defrost frozen fingers our pick of the best places to escape the freezing temperatures. My favorited place where I love to head out to work, write or just daydream is - Cafe Louvre.It's located in the downtown of Prague. The original building was built 1902 but the interior underwent several design and decor changes. It used to be visited by some prominent figures such as Franz Kafka, Albert Einstein or Nikola Tesla.There is no internet available in Cafe Louvre which makes it ideal place to try and focus on simple things such as enjoying the coffee, apple tart and reading newspaper. Wherever I find myself in this cafe - I feel like I time-travel back to the 1920s. If you find yourself in Prague - be sure to visit this magnificent grand cafe.Prague has been ranked among top world's greenest cities. I love the fact that when in Prague I am surrounded with parks. But only lately have I discovered Prague greatest treasure - historic gardens.There are hundreds of gardens - the oldest of them dating back to the Middle ages and many of them offer breathtaking views of the city. I used to travel frequently to Rome, Italy in search for the Italian renascence/baroque gardens, while I have had similar options at my doorstep in Prague.Last summer while the city walk I stumbled upon Vrtba Garden which is believed to be one of the most beautiful and significant baroque gardens in the central Europe. It is quite difficult to find as it's hidden behind an unnoticeable gate. But when you find it - you can bet you will be in awe by the beauty it shelters.The garden is not so large but you can find there everything what you expect from precious Baroque garden - elegant staircases, decorated banisters, terraces and statues. The Vrtba Garden offers an amazing view of the St Nicholas Cathedral - on of the biggest attractions in Prague.Vrtba Garden in Prague is beautiful in every season and is often sought after by couples to be married there. The garden hosts a lot of events such as garden parties, theatre performances and art exhibitions.When looking to escape the city rush I always choose Vrtba garden, which serves as an ideal place of solitude and peace.I have realized that the most important thing about a place - is how it makes you feel. Are you comfortable walking around the town in the early hours? Do you have the need to be accompanied? I am a city wanderer. I love to go out and just wander the streets, wherever I am.There are not many places that I have visited that had evoked in me the sense of safety - like Prague. It's a very safe city. I have walked hundred times back home alone in the middle of the nigh and I was never bothered by anyone.It's a place where you can let you children go out and play on their own and not be worried. After spending time abroad in more dangerous cities like San Francisco or northern parts of England, I've realized that growing up and living in safe city makes you a truly happy person.There is so much to Prague than the main sights. The Praguers are truly great and warm people. And there is always so much to re-discover later.I love stumbling upon new street art, visiting the famous Christmas markets, food festivals by the river, farm markets in the parks, hearing street music as I walk around, seeing the castle everyday on my way to home. Walking everywhere, while every corner having its history - Kafka's school was there;Nikola tesla studied here; Albert Enstein had breakfast there or Heinrich's assassins got him over there.I adore the mystery the city is clothed in, the special feeling that you get when walk the little streets in the old town and you can almost travel through the mist of times. Its unbelievable. I can't get this anywhere else in the world.And the list goes on.There is not just one thing that makes Prague special its just a lot of little things that grow on you with time.And as Franz Kafka said :Thank you for reading.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*yya3-ZK2voI8cSEWI4V6-A.jpeg,https://medium.com/show-your-city/prague-never-lets-you-go-9ac1edbb1397,travel,fd05c5fe21b8b7b5e0baf567642b826cd38937b6824a28767c2d7e12
Why Many Successful Founders Are Narcissists,"We all have narcissistic tendencies, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Some narcissistic traits - such as having a clear vision or the ability to attract others - may make you a better leader. But there are plenty of similar characteristics that can make you unbearable.Founders - and many of their investors - are likely to place highly on the narcissist spectrum, along with many of our great leaders, like Barack Obama, Abraham Lincoln, and even Gandhi.In his documentary, DICKS: Do you need to be one to be a successful leader?, Max Joseph interviews leadership expert Michael Maccoby about the pros and cons of narcissism, concluding that:The most common traits of narcissists include undeniable charisma, unshakeable conviction, a habit of listening only to themselves, mild paranoia, an over-controlling nature, lack of empathy, and even occasional cruelty - not because they want to be cruel, but simply in relentless pursuit of their vision.Maybe a few of these sound familiar.In his extended essay, 'Narcissistic Leaders: The Incredible Pros, the Inevitable Cons', Michael Maccoby describes the behaviours of both productive and unproductive narcissists.Productive narcissists tend to show the following leadership qualities. Usually, they:However, narcissists often have unproductive traits too. They may:These aren't ideal qualities in someone you'd want to work with - let alone someone in a position of power.Maccoby has three recommendations to help leaders avoid the follies of their inner unproductive narcissist - and they apply to us all.1) Find a trusted side-kick. It might be a colleague or a coach - but you need someone who can point out the operational requirements of your vision and keep you rooted in reality.2) Take time to explain yourself. If you want the organisation to identify with you, and the way you think, take the time to clarify and communicate.3) Embrace self-knowledge. Narcissists typically reject psychotherapy but they could benefit most from it. So, if you have a gut feeling that therapy won't work for you . . . give it a try anyway.Narcissists are the change-makers, the visionaries, the disruptors. They want to make a better world - in their own image. Like them or loathe them, we need them if we want things to improve.If you're one of these visionaries, passionate and willing to stop at nothing to achieve your goal, take the precautions above - or it just might come back to haunt you.Hi, I'm Dave and I coach tech CEOs from Series A to pre-IPO.

Let Your Love Flow: A Valentine's Day Assignment,"The last few years have taught me to wrap myself in love, warmth, and patience. That I am worth loving because of everything I am and everything I am not. That life's goal is to find my purpose and to live out my purpose while striving to be not only a decent human being but one who is continually striving to understand my family, friends, and everyone else around me.Most importantly, I have learned that to do all of those things; quiet alone time is necessary to metamorphosis into the person I know I am to become while also appreciating the person I am right now. Those times of solace and solitude should not be artificially interrupted because of Valentine's Day. It should not be the time to seek out romantic love when the timing isn't quite right.The following assignment was created to help reframe Valentine's Day from a day of romantic love to a day of support for yourself, family members, friends, and other people in your life.Remember, you are love, you are worthy, you have purpose, and you are right where you need to be in life and love. Find comfort in knowing that holidays and other special occasions will not always align with the universe's plans for our romantic relationships. And when they do not align we should take advantage of the time to appreciate the space we are in right now by loving ourselves and nurturing the relationships we do have.",https://miro.medium.com/max/7636/1*_ino5En19Cdcvgk96SMhQg.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/let-your-love-flow-a-valentines-day-assignment-4f92e503dda8,mindfulness,fd6119cb7556c4a9619414be60a0114206935b4d37d9bf105b038efd
5 lifestyle overhauls that can help you take full advantage of working remotely,"Psychotherapist Amy Morin recommends using WFH as an opportunity to explore different parts of the world, once it's safe to do so.By Amy MorinWorking from home during the pandemic has caused more people to dream about becoming a ""digital nomad"" - or at least it's helped them see that remote work can open the door to living differently.When you're working from home, you don't have to stare at the same four walls all day. Instead, you have the opportunity to get out and explore the world, when it's safe to do so.If you aren't ready to ditch your residence on a permanent basis, that's OK. You might try a temporary shift in your lifestyle (or plan for a three month trip every year from now going forward). There are so many different options when you aren't tied to a location.Here are five creative lifestyles that might help you take full advantage of remote work:I moved onto a sailboat five years ago and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I don't sail around the world or anything - I spend a lot of time tied to a dock next to my tiki hut so I can have fast internet, electricity, and calm seas. But, I do have the freedom to go sailing (or jet skiing) any time I want.If sailboat life isn't for you, don't dismiss live-aboard boating altogether. There are many different options.A houseboat could serve as an affordable way to live in expensive parts of the world. It might be like living in a floating apartment as opposed to an ocean-going vessel.Of course, you might also purchase a boat (sailboat or motorboat) and travel to exotic locations. This becomes a little trickier as reliable internet can be a problem at sea, but you can spend time in ports as needed and travel when you have time off.If buying a boat doesn't sound enticing, you can also cruise around the world (if cruising and world-wide travel ever resumes). There are plenty of world cruises that will take you all over the globe. Of course, these come with a hefty price tag so you'll need an amazing work from home job to make this one feasible.A great option for land lovers could involve RV travel. You can roam the national parks for extended periods of time, or stay in various campgrounds for a week at a time as you travel across the country.If you're not into buying a big commercial RV, consider a camper van. You might find free places to stay along your journey too. There are plenty of people who explore the world on a tight budget via Volkswagen bus, for example.This could be a good way to visit friends and family for longer periods of time, and depending on where they live, you might even be able to stay in their driveway.Read more: A 29-year-old 'California girl' moved to Nova Scotia with her husband last year. She says it's been a culture shock, but living in Canada meant they could finally afford the American dream.Some countries are working hard to attract work-from-home Americans for extended periods of time. You may be able to go somewhere for a year on a visa, which essentially gives you plenty of time to settle in without having to worry about residency issues.The Cayman Islands, for example, recently announced they will allow some foreign citizens to stay there while working from home for up to two years.If the thought of moving to another country for a year or two doesn't sound appealing, you can also simply travel to lots of different countries. From backpacking across Europe and working from coffee shops to flying to random destinations whenever you feel like it, you might decide to take full advantage of international travel once it's safe to do so after the pandemic.Have you ever wondered what it's like to live in Hawaii but don't want to move that far from family? Or have you dreamed about moving to the mountains but aren't sure you'd like the cold weather?Luckily, there are options to visit those places for a few months without the commitment of a year-long lease. A three-month lease can give you a great taste of a different lifestyle without having to make a permanent move before you know if you like the area.If you own a home, consider swapping houses with other people. This also gives you the chance to explore different places without spending much money.Read more: I moved my family from California to Austin, Texas, and regretted it. Here are 10 key points every person should consider before relocating.For some people working from home, it makes sense to stay with friends and family for an extended period. Moving in with an elderly parent might mean you're able to offer more assistance around your work schedule.For others, it may make sense financially to move in with a relative on a temporary basis to save money. If giving up an expensive apartment for a few months can help you save up or pay off your student loans, it might be worth it.Whether you can stay with a friend who lives far away for a few weeks before moving to your sister's place for a month and then onto your grandparents' condo for another month, the great news is that there aren't any rules when you work remotely.It may take your brain a while to fully grasp the idea that you have the freedom to do more things. And of course, some people have more freedom than others.

How to Serve Staff Better So They Stop Googling Advice on How to Cope,"If Google's search predictions (a.k.a. autocomplete) represents the human race's collective consciousness, then you'd be convinced we're horrible at being people managers.Just type ""my manager"" into the familiar white box. In the predictions, there's no ""my manager is amazing,"" or ""...is a great leader,"" or ""...deserves to be nominated for an award.""Instead, we get a peek at just the beginnings of many sad workplace stories. Tales of bullying, hate and gaslighting (see the feature image.) Are we really all deeply suffering at the hands of managers?Probably not.We're more inclined to use Google as a painkiller than a vitamin. Google's predictions are heavily weighted towards those with a want to solve problems rather than a will to seek affirmation. Nevertheless, the predictions only pop up if there's been enough actual historical search volume to warrant it. So, it certainly represents the dire plight of many who have Googled before us, trying to seek solace in dealing with a dud manager.If you're honest, you can probably remember a time you had a dud manager. If you're brutally honest, maybe you can even admit to having been one. If you're having a moment of absolute soul-cleansing honesty, perhaps you even know you are one. Not to worry, we've got this.How can we save a direct report from typing something horrible about us into a Google search? It starts with some simple behaviours, wrapped in the principles of servant leadership.Don't let the reference to servant leadership see you scroll on by - we're not about to embark on some cultish exploration of an in-favour hipster management technique. Here's all you need to know in the context of this article: servant leadership is where you serve your team ahead of your own progress and success. The point is by doing the former, you'll achieve the latter anyway, but in a manner that leaves less personal destruction in your wake.Individual jobs are usually accountable for tasks which contribute to some bigger end result. But often employees have very little connection with that end result. Eventually, their internal monologue kicks in with thoughts like, ""Why do I do this task? What does it achieve? Would it even matter if I didn't do it?""The lack of clarity - the feeling of not achieving anything useful - slowly weighs people down, creating negative feelings harboured at managers. In fact, studies have shown it's a significant predictor of depression.To reduce the chances of staff Googling ""my manager makes me depressed,"" make an effort to help them understand how they contribute to the bigger picture. Find reasons to talk about answers to these types of questions: What steps happen before staff do their part of the job? What happens after? What are the repercussions of making a mistake? Who's life is made easier when a task is nailed perfectly?Look for opportunities to combine tasks performed by different individuals. It'll give staff the opportunity to complete larger processes on their own, end-to-end, and feel a greater sense of clarity and achievement.Sometimes we assume a staff member's great work equates to their love for the job. Hell, we even take some credit for it! Here's another option: The work's become so damn easy, they can do it without thinking. This isn't good news.It's been proven that boredom in the workplace is mostly bad news. ""Monotony is detrimental to worker health, well-being and performance,"" says one study. It increases the risks of aggressive behaviour, anxiety, depression and alcohol addiction.Avoiding this isn't rocket science. But it does require that managers develop a regular habit. Making sure staff are challenged and stimulated by their work is a matter of just asking them. Regularly check-in and literally ask, ""Is this interesting enough for you?"" Then ignore their first answer - people often tell their boss whatever they feel is the correct thing to say the first time around and not the truth. Be persistent and ask again, ""So you feel there's still plenty to learn?""Don't take their great work for granted or pretty soon you'll end up the subject of a ""my manager makes me bored"" search.With tons of industry thought leadership and online education available to us, it's common for proactive managers to be across the latest trends and advancements in their field.This might make for a good manager.But we want to step up to be a great manager, right?A great manager takes this information and distils it with their team. By endorsing your support for trying new things, you empower staff with the autonomy to make decisions that impact their own work.It's been shown that restricting an employee's ability to make independent decisions can increase their risk of mental health issues by as much as 25%. This small change can have a big impact over a ""my way or the high way"" management approach.All it takes is ten minutes. It could be at the backend of a staff meeting, a quick email, or a slack message - just a moment to educate staff in a new concept combined with subtle, open-ended encouragement for folks to apply it as they see fit.So teach, don't preach.People can be born great leaders, but dud bosses. Being a manager is a learned skill. If you feel even just a pang of responsibility for some of those Google searches, try out those simple tips this week.Adopting the mindset of serving your staff first will be a catalyst for achieving your own success. Plus, you might just improve the health and wellbeing of those who look up to you every day.Maybe, one day, we'll even see different search predictions in Google:""My manager...is selfless...is my mentor...is someone who makes me be at my best.""We can only hope.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2160/1*KoBiCMjG_B31r0zwYr_ndw.png,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-serve-staff-better-so-they-stop-googling-advice-on-how-to-cope-b971f2f25a86,leadership,fdf3dea4c429678032a3385006e522139ee21d6d737f6013e2d14b1f
I used artificial intelligence to write an article and here's what happened.,"Hey, artificial intelligence seems to be all over today's world. These fake, silicon brains have been replacing our 'feeling brain' slowly but surely. Taking on more and more tasks off of us. But, have you ever wondered about the limits of A.I. What it can and what it can't do? That's the point where I decided that I'm going to run an experiment. The purpose was to find how good modern machine learning really is. So, I decided to try to get an article written exclusively by a computer.The first step was to research my options. One option was to try and build the A.I. on my own, and the other was to find a service online. I did some research on how to create an article-generator from scratch and it turned out that it wasn't that hard to create one, but surprisingly hard to train one to actually be good. I finally decided to go with a ready-made alternative that I found on Google.The service was easy to navigate and work your way through. That's when I started realizing just how much time I had saved, had I worked on coding my own. It was so easy, that I was almost surprised when I first used it. You just supplied the topic or niche that you want your article to be about, and that's it. There was also an advanced option that let you insert a paragraph, which the A.I. would use as a guideline to write on.I decided that I would use the advanced setting, since there was no 'productivity' in the topics, and that was what I wanted the A.I. to write about. So, I wrote a quick paragraph about productivity and mindfulness, and the journey began. I waited about 20 minutes for the algorithm to generate my article and, needless to say, I was quite nervous about how it would turn out.After a small coffee break, the wait time was finally over and I was ready to see what was supposed to be a full article. I tried reading the first paragraph and it didn't really make sense. I continued on reading and, to be honest, nothing made sense. Nevertheless, I published the article on Medium just like I had promised to do, and now, you can actually find it on my profile under the title 'How I use guided meditation to be more productive'. The article was worthless, nothing made sense, the paragraphs were all messed up, and I was disappointed.But, that's not all, I was determined to make this work. I started fiddling around with all the options that the service had to offer. I tried writing business articles, health articles, and even spirituality articles. Somehow, they all turned out moderately good, a miracle compared to the first one. Now, you're probably wondering, why didn't you post the better ones? However, the original challenge was to publish whatever article the A.I. gave me, and since that was the first one, I knew I had to do it, and you had to see it.As if A.I. writing articles wasn't interesting enough, I wanted more. I wanted to learn how machine learning operated, how its internals worked, and why it was so inconsistent. That's when I realized that the huge disparities in the language of the computer were due to the guidelines that I had provided. Whenever I entered a paragraph to be used as a platform to build on, the algorithm went crazy. When I let it do its thing, however, it wrote articles that were at the very least readable.Now, you're probably wondering to yourself, what was so important about this experiment. The answer is very simple, testing the limits of brand-new technology is always useful. This experience helped me understand that machine learning has a lot more to learn and accomplish. It's still in its early phases of development and we should be expecting much more from it.A.I. seems to be everywhere, from your fridge to IBM's supercomputers. Still, it has a lot of ground to cover. Once that happens, researchers think that we will see a new revolution, where A.I. takes over millions of jobs, but just like past revolutions, millions more are created, in industries that we didn't expect.In the next few years, the scene of Machine Learning will probably change drastically. We will probably see technologies like unsupervised learning get developed, changing the way and rate at which computers learn and the way we interact with them. Engineers will not have to input data manually, instead, automated algorithms will gather data on their own, regardless of the interaction we have with them.Something important is that we now see articles titled ""The AI-Enabled Future"". Those offer an optimistic view on the topic of Artificial Intelligence, and I think that that's the correct way to think about it. Most likely, we will not see a Terminator-like dystopian world where AI takes over and the human species goes extinct. The most likely scenario is a future where A.I. contributes to the world and helps us solve critical problems that humanity will have to face in the future.To conclude, artificial intelligence will make leaps forward, but I would like to raise some concerns about the future of article-generating algorithms. One of them would be, if the A.I. infringes some kind of copyright, should we blame the author or the system? Also, if the computer makes an offensive statement, like using racial slurs, is the author to blame here?",https://miro.medium.com/max/9140/0*8o8qN0xY5IAGiDtQ,https://medium.com/the-vector/i-used-artificial-intelligence-to-write-an-article-and-heres-what-happened-cb4f5473d9b8,artificial-intelligence,fdf1070f30e891abf903026f914d47b0ed30b47e0743924ec5dbcfda
"The world treated Britney Spears' mental health as a punchline. Things have changed for celebrities, but not for the better.","""Framing Britney Spears"" reckons with the pop star's treatment. Today we are better at calling out bullying, but no better at leaving stars alone.By Julia NaftulinI have a vivid memory of going to the grocery store with my mom when I was 13, and just staring.It was 2007, and tabloid covers of a tired-looking, stressed-out, and bald-headed Britney Spears dominated the checkout aisle magazine stands.Spears is 13 years my senior and as a child, I'd always seen her as the woman I wanted to become: Gorgeous, talented, and beloved. Those paparazzi photos, burned into my head forever, portrayed the opposite.I felt sad, and pitied Spears when she was the butt of primetime TV jokes, but I couldn't explain why it felt wrong. Last week, when the New York Times and Hulu released the documentary ""Framing Britney Spears,"" it clicked.The film is a look at her rise to fame, the media bombardment she endured, and how she ended up in a 12-year conservatorship meaning that, to this day, her father controls her money and life.It put so perfectly what we all had trouble expressing at the time: Britney Spears, at 26 years old, was in shambles and needed compassion and help. Instead, she got abuse and scrutiny.It's been over a decade and a lot has changed. If Spears rose to fame today, we'd have language to identify the bullying that put her mental health at risk. But that doesn't mean we're better at shutting down harassment and treating celebrities as real people.Celebrities today have as fraught a relationship with their social media followers as the stars of 2007 had with paparazzi and magazines. Take Spears herself: she barely goes out, isn't working, and famously does not post anything of note on her Instagram. And yet every photo, video, and caption is the subject of scrutiny. There's even a weekly podcast analyzing her posts, seen by 27.7 million followers.Whether we've got the language for it or not, we just don't know how to leave famous people alone, and that's what sends people like Spears into a spiral.It wasn't until recently that Americans had the vocabulary to discuss mental health.In 2006, a year before Spears' breakdown made national headlines, the National Alliance on Mental Illness released its first report in 15 years examining the state of healthcare for those struggling with anxiety, depression, and other mind-related issues.The report concluded the United States deserved a D-rating for its lack of mental-health infrastructure and information access.Siri Sat Nam, a licensed marriage and family therapist who's worked with stars like Katy Perry and Waka Flocka Flame, remembers a turning point in 2013. The Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, where 20-year-old Adam Lanza opened fire and killed 20 children and then himself, was a pivotal moment for America's mental-health reckoning. The New York Times later reported Lanza had a history of untreated mental health issues.""I think this is stuff that's in the underbelly of consciousness and it rises at particular times when a culture is ready. When traditions are really shook up, it calls us to get the term mental health,"" and the horror of Sandy Hook did just that, Sat Nam told Insider.That year, state funding for mental health services increased. Months later, the rollout of the Affordable Care Act began, giving 2.65 million Americans with mental health needs access to care.Another shift came in 2014, when the beloved actor Robin Williams died of suicide, shocking fans who knew little of his behind-the-scenes struggle with Parkinson's disease and depression. Moments after the news broke, Twitter and Instagram were flooded with images of Williams.His death ""served as a reminder that mental illness affects everyone regardless of age or socioeconomic status,"" Gregory Dalack, chair of the Michigan Medicine Department of Psychiatry, told HuffPost reporter Lindsay Holmes.Over the next few years, our vocabulary built. As a society we discussed mental health in the wake of the deaths of famed fashion designer Kate Spade and chef Anthony Bourdain, also by suicide.We also saw mental health creep into pop culture, with positive portrayals of therapists on television shows like ""13 Reasons Why,"" ""This Is Us,"" and ""The Real Housewives of Potomac.""But more conversations and positive portrayals haven't led to actionable change, as rates of anxiety and depression continue to rise. 6.7% of Americans, or 17.3 million people, said they suffered from depression in 2017, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. 18.1% or 40 million suffer from anxiety every year.""Framing Britney Spears"" illustrates how the paparazzi hounded the star for years, to the point she went on TV to say her biggest wish was for them to leave her alone.But, as the documentary lays out, her tearful request wasn't enough. Daniel Ramos, a former paparazzo who followed Spears and took the famous shot of her bashing his car with an umbrella, still sees his relationship with her in a positive light.""It was like she needed us and we needed her. We both needed each other. It was a great kind of a relationship,"" Ramos said in the film. ""There were times when she [was] like, 'Can you leave me alone for the day?'"" Ramos said. ""But it wasn't like, 'Leave me alone forever.' You know what I mean?""Today fans can like, comment, and directly message their favorite stars on social media, actions that give a false sense of closeness, a term researchers call ""parasocial interaction.""America's fixation on celebrities as quasi-royals is a ""double-edged sword,"" Sat Nam said.These one-sided relationships that can feel two-sided to fans have existed since the advent of TV, but have become more commonplace on oversaturated social media channels.""The issue that that then creates is that sometimes viewers will feel some sort of ownership over the creator and the content,"" Arienne Ferchaud, an assistant professor in the School of Communication at Florida State University who studies the relationships between online personalities and the public, told The Verge's Megan Farokhmanesh.When celebrities give into their fandom's pull, the aftermath can be devastating for their mental health because their public and private lives become blurred and they can lose their sense of self, according to Sat Nam. Though the #FreeBritney movement has a positive bend, with global marches and constant messages of support on her Instagram, the level of surveillance can be suffocating.""The public makes a star. They choose, gather around them, support them, and buy their records or whatever. Not saying they're not talented and great, but we make them. And then we also can destroy them,"" Sat Nam said.""That's a lot for anybody to go through, being under scrutiny all the time. It's exciting at one point when you first start with, but if you haven't prepared for that, there's no privacy,"" said Sat Nam.If social media users band together to scrutinize someone behind the safety of a computer screen, the feedback can be too overwhelming for one person to handle.It's something Dr. Samantha Saltz, a board-certified child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist in Boca Raton, Florida, sees often with her adolescent patients who've experienced cyberbullying.""The victims of bullying are unable to separate themselves from anywhere where they have access to the internet, so they get bullied over and over and over again. They literally cannot separate themselves,"" Saltz told Insider. ""It used to be where we could separate ourselves from any kind of bad situation. We go home versus being at work where something bad is happening.""It's also a reality for social-media-present celebrities today.15-year-old TikTok star Charli D'Amelio said she gets hundreds of thousands of hate comments every week about her appearance. British reality TV star Caroline Flack died by suicide in February 2020 after her personal life became months-long tabloid and social media gossip. This month, singer Chloe Bailey was shamed for being too sexy on TikTok after she posted a video to a viral dancing trend on the app.I wish I could tell my 13-year-old self the world has become a kinder to place to people struggling with mental health issues big and small, but that would be a lie.Spears remains under her conservatorship with her father keeping partial control over her $60 million net worth. Despite a record-breaking Vegas residency and hit songs and music videos in recent years, 39-year-old Spears is still fighting to prove she's fit to be independent.Her Instagram, the only way fans can communicate with Spears, has become just as scrutinized as her every move the paparazzi documented and hosts called out on national television.On Monday, Spears shared a selfie on Instagram with a simple caption of three mango emojis and no words.""We're listening,"" one follower commented. Another said they were googling the ""spiritual meaning of mangoes"" as a clue into the potential hidden meaning behind the pop star's post. Another thought ""mango"" could really mean ""Man, go,"" a reference to Britney's father and his power over her.Despite Spears' disappearance from the public eye, we're still scrapping for anything she does. We mean well, but hundreds of thousands of well-meaning remarks can be overwhelming, just like a swarm of camera-clad paparazzi.For more great stories, visit Insider's homepage.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2600/0*HL-20DxTArsCVGMF,https://medium.com/insider/britney-spears-mental-health-became-jokes-today-she-d-have-it-worse-ccda85f7604a,mental-health,fe3a81dfdbee9a300e982f5eacf68d365f971c438934854975593fc4
Cultivating Empathy in the Workplace,"Empathy makes a productive workplace where employees are honest, transparent and humanEmpathy is critical personally and professionally because it allows us to connect, be compassionate and understand others.It is a soft skill that amplifies all other skills like leadership and listening. It's also a performance indicator for people-focused leaders, who can work with people from different backgrounds, departments and teams.Empathy is a key aspect of leadership effectiveness and emotional intelligence that improves interactions, communications and outcomes. It also influences the job performance of a manager who performs better, as rated by supervisors.According to Daniel Goleman, a renowned psychologist, is a vital leadership skill and is one of the major components of emotional intelligence. It's a natural human response in situations like:We can cultivate empathy not only in our personal lives but our professional lives as well when we're in the workplace.With empathy, we can set our beliefs aside and put ourselves in someone else's shoes. But how can we cultivate it at work?Listen to what the other person is saying . This means not just listening for the sake of hearing that person out. Through active listening, you can understand the entire message behind that person's words.TIP: Take a mental note of phrases or words the person repeats; understand the body language and voice tone of that person.Keep an open mind and be flexible. In the process of listening, you must withhold your judgment and make room for the feelings of the other person. Don't outwardly act on your beliefs and assumptions while listening to the other person because it will not cultivate empathy and get the exact opposite outcome of what you're hoping for.By being empathetic, you can determine the reasons behind what the other person believes in. You can also show respect even if you don't necessarily agree with what they're saying.TIP: Role playing is critical to feeling the pain of the other person. You can also open up by sharing your emotions and stories. This process could also make it easier for this person to share stories with you.Especially in these challenging times, people are feeling stressed and having a hard time balancing work and life at home.At work, look for signs of stress in your employees before it becomes an issue, including employee disengagement. Check with team members weekly and ask how they're dealing with their current situation and handling their workload.To be an empathetic leader, acknowledge and understand the unique goals and needs of your team, including delegating work assignments properly. It will contribute to employee satisfaction and performance.Another example is empathizing with the mental health needs of your team (and yourself), especially during these challenging times when many of us are dealing with anxiety and stress due to the pandemic.Recognize that your employees are dynamic and unique individuals who have individualized means of dealing with and shouldering family issues while keeping up with work duties and responsibilities. Understand that it's your role to support team members who are in need. Doing so will also lead to an open communication line that promotes transparency at work.Empathetic leaders are transparent. They can admit they're imperfect humans who are also capable of making mistakes.What's important? They take action to make things right and allow their employees do the same.As a result, employees feel as though they're also able to admit when they make mistakes, allowing you and your team to find a solution before the problem worsens.Another example of this shines through on the topic of empathetic leadership with leaders. Leaders who admit when they're feeling vulnerable or overwhelmed leads to honest communication among employees, who can open up if they feel confused about instructions or if they think their workload is overwhelming.Foster empathy in the workplace by modeling it in your behavior . For example, seek to understand perspectives and feelings when interacting with employees. This sets the tone at work and encourages employees to do the same as they feel more comfortable.Leaders who are are highly-regarded by co-workers. They are connected to them and tend to be generous. They are the binding force that glues people together, even if they're not always visible among colleagues. Support and empower these leaders and see ways they're cultivating empathy in the workplace.Empathy is a powerful soft skill that gives you the ability to relate to and perceive other people's emotions and experiences through compassion.Empathic leaders lead as a with emotions and feelings. They can recognize and understand individual beliefs and perspectives, even when they differ from their own personal views.Empathy makes a productive and effective workplace with compassionate people that support each other; as a result, everyone collaborates and works to maintain a growth track towards the company's goal and purpose. By consistently practicing empathy, you and the rest of your team can create a happier, healthier company culture.May this serve as a message of hope that being human may very well be the best silver lining to all of our current vicissitudes.In love and respect, HilaryOriginally published at https://hilarycorna.com.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*BiPTr4yBwyRVnxtu.jpg,https://medium.com/@HilaryCorna/cultivating-empathy-in-the-workplace-cb9c1c81bd06,leadership,fe9b3f5f92dfaa577d85f521d73981ec9afccbfe68e540ce365ef3e6
Little Nightmares II Review,"There's a charming yet utterly haunting beauty that shines from Little Nightmares II, something that I have never seen captured in a game before. Similar to its predecessor, it feels like a fairytale that has been violently torn apart with some of the most intensely graphic and obscene abominations filling its place. It could make even the most hardened players wince at its ghastly sights and yet it does so without even showing that much blood and gore.There has been a shift in the horror genre over the past decade, particularly with modern horror films such as Hereditary and Suspiria. These films relinquish jumpscares for something far more effective, creating a slow burn of fear throughout until an explosive barrage of violence and horror suddenly occurs at the end. Little Nightmares II applies the same strategy and gives it a slightly unique twist. Instead of the entire game being a slow burn, each level is instead treated like such, creating a montage of intense horror that doesn't slow down until the credits start to roll.It's like each level has been ripped out of an anthology series. Sure there's a story that extends over the entire game but every set piece feels so unique and different from the last that by the time you get comfortable with your surroundings, the game violently pushes you into another extremely uncomfortable and different situation.Little Nightmares II without a doubt overshadows its predecessor in every way possible. I absolutely adored the original for its creative art style and for suggestively creating its horror, leaving the worst sights behind closed doors. However, its sequel does the opposite, showing the worst sights in plain view to disturb and distress the player and I love it for doing so. It manages to keep what made the original so fantastic, whilst also being different enough to stand by its own merits. I might sound hypocritical for approving of the game for doing the complete opposite of what I loved but in my opinion, that's what sequels are supposed to do.It is certainly much more morbid and tackles far more problematic issues than its predecessor. For example, there's a section of the game that takes place within a school. It's a horror trope for sure but it's one that the game uses to suggest themes of bullying and abuse from the students and teachers alike. In no way does Little Nightmares II try to make a comment on social issues but it was refreshing to see that it tries to make the player think and reflect on what they've seen rather than just attempting to frighten them.The monster designs of Little Nightmares II are so horrifically disturbing that it makes the monsters from its predecessor look like they were taken out of a cartoon. I won't say too much as this game is best experienced blind but the school section introduced a teacher so unnerving that it would send chills down my spine every time I ran into her. My teachers weren't exactly the nicest bunch but thank god I never had to encounter HER during my time in school.Unlike the first game, Little Nightmares II sometimes gives the player the ability to fight back against their foes instead of just running and hiding. Due to the obvious difference in size, the majority of the enemies you'll come across will be impossible to fight against, but the sequel does introduce a few situations where you can defend yourself from enemies that are more your size. Unfortunately, it's the biggest problem with the game as it becomes a tedious and stressful process that grinds the pace down to a painful stop.The problem with the combat is that it allows no room for error, expecting the player to time and aim every single hit perfectly. There was even one section in which I had to tackle multiple enemies at once and in the nicest way possible, it was infuriatingly bad. Thankfully there's only a handful of these scenarios in the game so it was not a massive problem however it still felt unnecessary, as if the game was forcing itself to cater towards criticisms of the first game for its lack of combat.Little Nightmares II is going to be an extremely harsh experience for anyone that didn't play the first and it's highly recommended that you do before tackling its sequel, mainly due to the continuation of its mind-boggling story. Instead of playing as Six from the original game, you instead take control of Mono, a new voiceless protagonist that bumps into Six who's still suffering from the events of the first game. The two of them embark on a horrifically twisted journey to find the source of a signal that has somehow killed off an entire town full of people leaving behind the worst abominations imaginable. The story of Little Nightmares II leads to many more questions than answers but an incredibly sinister twist ending gives a strong impression that Tarsier Studios have only just begun exploring this twisted universe.It was refreshing this time around to have an AI companion follow me around for most of the game without them feeling like dead weight. Six, being a fan favourite from the first game, aids Mono by helping him to get to out-of-reach places and distracting enemies. Not once did having a companion take away from the horror effect, in fact, it only helped to make the experience more terrifying. Whenever I got split away from Six, I felt more helpless than I did before. There were a few times when Six would accidentally push me out of a hiding place for me to get devoured by a monster but it is an extremely small issue that I can look past.Little Nightmares II is a masterclass in visual storytelling thanks to its extremely clever and talented level design. Fans of the first game will notice that Six is still hiding something truly evil. You'll occasionally catch her doing things that are easy to miss if you're not paying attention, such as breaking the fingers of a mannequin's hand or subtly kicking a dead body. Her odd behaviour leads to some extremely subtle but effective dark humour that gives relief to the player suffering from the game's intense atmosphere. You'll come across pictures and symbols that foreshadow upcoming events and hidden rooms that establish secret connections to the first game. There are so many details that are incredibly easy to miss and players are rewarded for paying attention throughout the sequel's 5-6 hour runtime.Little Nightmares II is not just an incredible horror title but a fantastic sequel to its predecessor. It takes what made the original so unique and popular and twists it in such a way that it feels like a massive improvement in every single area. What it lacks in combat it makes up for with smartly crafted scares and spine-chilling monster design. It proves exactly why indie games and their studios should be the leaders of the industry thanks to its endless amount of creativity and ambition. The team over at Tarsier Studios should be extremely proud, and hopefully, this sets the standard for future games to come. It is clear from its cliffhanger ending that this is only the beginning of the next big horror franchise and I cannot wait to see where they take its universe next.Little Nightmares II is available to purchase now on PS4, Xbox One, Steam, and Nintendo Switch.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*KbRNZ3NFjySO_k7_5Xe5FQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/super-jump/little-nightmares-ii-review-87cec8f66af2,gaming,fe3233a42f71d15ba860408bede158b2d255dba648146c6c595e7218
Wooing by Wi-Fi,"Carl could hardly keep his social distance as he gazed adoringly across the restaurant table at the love of his life, Emily.Lovestruck Emily could not contain herself. She took a rubber glove from the table's dispenser and donned it. Carl did the same. They held gloved hands while staring into each other's eyes. The plastic bio-barrier that surrounded his head steamed up, sending them both into paroxysms of laughter. They sat back and shoved respective soiled gloves into the table's disposal chute. Neither of them would wash that hand for at least 10 minutes.Carl beheld Emily. The romantic dinner at their favorite restaurant had gone perfectly. Now, it was time to take the plunge, he decided. He used his smartphone to dim the lights above their table and change the music to their favorite song.Carl took a deep breath and texted Emily. ""You know that I am madly, utterly in love with you.""Emily read the message and swooned before replying. ""And I with you.""""I can't imagine life without you,"" continued Carl, barely able to key in the message.""I don't want to even think about losing you,"" replied Emily.Carl took out a small velvet box and opened it to reveal a diamond ring. He placed the box in the center of the table and texted: ""Emily McKenzie, will you make me the happiest man in the world and marry me?"" He included a man-kneeling emoji at the end of the message.Emily couldn't hold back her tears, which were quickly dried by her personal bio-barrier's air jets. ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" she texted frantically.She used the table's disinfectant nozzle to spray the ring before carefully putting it on her finger. ""Oh, Carl! The only thing I want is to be your wife!"" she texted, and held up the ring which sparkled in the germ-killing ultra-violet light.""I am going to make you so happy!"" gushed Carl in his text message.They rubbed elbows for what seemed like an eternity.""We need a toast!"" texted Carl.Before he could order, the waiter droid arrived smartly with a bottle of champagne.""We hope you don't mind, sir, but our guest sensors detected the intense emotion of a marriage proposal. Please accept this token and our hearty congratulations,"" said the droid and proffered the bottle.Emily and Carl laughed their acceptance and texted confetti emojis to each other. The droid opened the bottle and served the drinks.""To us!"" texted Carl.""To us!"" texted Emily.The ecstatic couple gazed at each other as they sipped champagne through the drinking tubes in their bio-shields.""I must tell my parents!"" texted Emily.""Yes,"" said Carl, and gleefully tapped the keys of his smartphone.K.

Tom White,"It was Thomas David Arthur White's fifth birthday and his mother was to take him to the large department store in Holborn to buy him a present. Only two days before a bomb had fallen near the store, dropped by a Zeppelin on its seemingly haphazard tour over London. A building was destroyed, several others damaged and a number of people died while the Zeppelin continued its journey.The Zeppelins only came at night so it was safe to walk down Gower Street and then catch an omnibus eastwards down to Holborn. There was a bus stop just outside the department store and they, along with a few others, alighted. Everyone was looking at the ruins of the building opposite, the rubble spilling over the pavement and even the road, a bus heading west slowing down to drive carefully round. Several policemen were standing outside, trying to look alert and purposeful when they really had nothing to do and were bored. Such is the life of a policeman.Thomas's mother took his hand to lead him into the shop, but as she looked down was shocked by the look of terror on her young son's face. Before she could say anything he pulled his hand away from hers and ran off down the street as fast as he could. Maybe it was a mistake to bring him here, she thought. He had shown no fear at the sound of the bombs in the night. He was only five years old: did he understand enough about the destroyed building to be so scared of it?She called out and started to run after him. He was about twenty yards ahead of her and ran round a corner into a side street. As she turned the corner she saw that he had fallen and was lying on the pavement motionless. Had he hit his head on the pavement and knocked himself out? But as she walked briskly up to him he saw her skirts out of the corner of his eye and started yelling. ""No, no, get away."" Then he saw it was his own mother. ""Where are they? Get them away.""""Who? There is nobody here"" she said, almost as alarmed as Thomas himself.""The people, those people, they scared me"" he replied.""The policemen?"" she asked. Why would he be scared of policemen?""No, the dead people."" A chill ran through her. She knew that people had died, died horribly and painfully, in that building. And she realised, suddenly, completely and with absolute understanding, that Thomas could see them, see their injuries, hear their screams, feel their pain even.They went straight home, the birthday, the department store, the present, completely forgotten.""They cannot hurt you"" she told him. ""Sometimes people's thoughts, people's feelings stay around after they have died. It's like still being able to taste bread and jam after you have eaten it."" It was a silly comparison but it was all she could think of to explain to a small child. But she was trying to explain something she didn't understand herself, and tried to decide who she could turn to.Her husband was a scientist and had no time for anything his profession could not explain. Superstition, religion, spiritualism, they were just nonsense to him, a relic of a less enlightened age. But she must tell him what happened.He looked at her for a long time, then stared at the floor for a few moments.""Has to go somewhere. Can't just disappear. All those thoughts and feelings in our brains. All that energy in our bodies."" He had a very concise manner of speech, words pared down to the minimum.""But why Thomas? Why can't we all feel it?""Thomas's father was a professor at the University of London but for over a year had been working on wireless for the Royal Navy, often at an establishment in the suburbs of north London, sometimes further afield.""Just happens to be tuned in I suppose."" He had no idea what forces were at work but, unlike some of his colleagues, accepted that many things were yet to be understood. He tried to apply a solution from his own area of expertise. His wife did not understand. ""What does tuned in mean?"" she asked.""Waves, waves in the ether, coming through the air."" She still didn't understand or even hope to, but was just relieved that her husband didn't dismiss the whole episode as a figment of the boy's over-active imagination.""Are they - conscious? Do they think?"" The idea suddenly came to her that her own fate might be to suffer the pains of death for eternity. He didn't know, but thought again of the wireless. They would spread out, get weaker, and eventually disappear.""Maybe take him back tomorrow and...""""No, no, you didn't see him. He was terrified."" This was something he hadn't fully grasped until then.""I'll talk to him. Try to explain.""Professor White had no engagements the following morning so sent a message to the University that he wouldn't be in until midday.Thomas seemed calm that morning, with no sign of the previous day's ordeal. ""Tom"" his father said, ""let's listen to the gramophone"". He spend a minute or two looking through the records piled up on a table before picking up a recording of a well known tenor. ""Heard of this chap Tom?""""No Father.""""Very popular when he was alive. Still is, lots of people still listen to him. Let's play the record shall we?""Thomas didn't really like the music but sat patiently, indulging his Father.""Did you like that?"" asked Arthur White as he lifted the needle from the disc. Tom sat in silence; he didn't want to disappoint his father by saying ""no"" but he didn't want to lie by saying ""yes"".""Oh well, it doesn't matter. The point is this chap's dead, dead in his grave. But we can still hear his voice."" He pointed to the sideboard covered in photographs. ""See those people, aunts, uncles, grandparents? Half of them cold in their graves but we can still see them, up there on the sideboard. Lots of people dead as old Marley but we can still see them, still hear them. Understand, Tom?""Tom nodded. He thought he understood.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1332/1*e7TBSVmanpLLIJV9QBc4OA.jpeg,https://medium.com/short-fiction-by-chris/tom-white-6585c7fddb9a,fiction,ff09c071929711c924d18183799e7cc504811361614fb89d4254ea8c
