"Instead I pretend this is where I live, away from everything, in nature."
I wonder when I'll be able to get to the real mountains again.
"After a while, my brain tells me screw the real mountains."
"I want to stay here forever, in the fake mountains under a luminous green sky."
"On the other hand, a robot can give you a lap dance now."
We're a few years away from being able to live on other planets.
Things are getting a lot worse and a lot better at the same time.
We don't know whether to trust the artificial light or not.
It seems to be causing a lot of the problems it promises to solve.
"And yet, we also know we can't hide from the future."
"We have to prepare somehow, so it doesn't catch us by surprise."
"We used to worry about being replaced by someone younger and better educated than us, maybe better looking."
"One day, some of us will report to an artificial intelligence that knows our heart rate and credit history."
"The only way to stay employed is to become more like a robot, or a superhuman."
"You have to be a creative genius, just to keep your head above water."
Anyone under 50 feels a growing sense of overwhelm at the sheer number of skills we're expected to master today.
"We'll pay more and more money for courses that promise to keep us relevant, so we can earn our livelihoods."
We'll sign up for websites that teach us how to code.
You sell an asset at a high price because you think it's going to drop later.
This move resonates with us because that's what we've been doing for the entire last year.
"Now we anticipate the problems we'll have to deal with, and how we can avoid getting trapped by them."
They seem to understand that the end could be on the way.
We anticipate a time when we'll have to protect only ourselves and those closest to us.
It's painful and disorienting to only sort of believe in the future.
"We're binge-watching period romances, or just watching our old favorite movies on repeat."
It's relaxing to watch a movie where you already know what's going to happen.
"This is exactly why I can't finish Tenet, a film I'd been looking forward to before the pandemic."
The most troubling part of the future now is that it's forcing us to think in completely new ways.
"We're having to face hyper-objects, facts that escape our ability to deal with them through ordinary logic."
"It's hard to think about the consequences of entire cities going underwater in our lifetimes, or never retiring."
"It's already here, washing into every crevice of our lives."
"We create new tech to solve the problems of old tech, which cause new problems."
"Every year the cycle speeds up, like a merciless Peloton coach."
This doesn't leave you a lot of time to think things though.
"Because if we wait a few minutes, the price on the stock or that cryptocurrency will go up."
"We're all rushing toward the latest thing to offer a slight advantage in this unpredictable landscape, full of artificial light."
Here they are:Direct copingZones of stabilitySituational groupingHalfway houses and enclaves of the pastGlobal space pageantsStrategies of futureness.
The larger point here is that you don't have to abandon the past.
"I'm inching toward investing in some cryptocurrencies, even though I'm skeptical of the hype."
"I'm acknowledging that things will change, and that they always have been."
"You can just get better at letting it rush over you and through you, like a cold stream."
"For the last year, I've found myself wishing for a time machine."
I've been fantasizing about the past more than daydreaming about the future.
It would be nice to just flip a switch and travel back ten years.
"Back then, things like democracy and job security were sure bets."
Too much tricks you into thinking you can pretend to live there.
It means listening to our intuition and instincts as much as your logic.
It could mean reaching even further back into history for ideas we'd forgotten about.
"We're making it right now, minute by minute, for ourselves and for everyone else."
"There was no line between work and home, personal and non-personal."
"It just keeps going to the horizon line, then there's a new horizon line."
It's about feeling accomplished when you do the strike-through.
"But when the to-do list becomes flat and never-ending, that sense of accomplishment wanes."
"At some point, crossing stuff out over and over loses value."
You know?We took a bath in this shit because we all over-worship Silicon Valley and their growth hacks.
"The modern mindset is, Well, I need to do this in an optimized way."
"It might take 35 minutes as opposed to 2 minutes, but it's OK."
"As we've growth hacked everything, most of us work more, burn out more, and are more stressed."
I have a friend who used to live in Texas; her and her husband run a little marketing agency type deal.
"Read some stuff, watched a bunch of TV shows, and researched some true crime cases."
But it also makes me a person ready to come out and try to hit some targets on a Monday.
Sometimes you can just stroll along a riverfront and contemplate the universe.
"It really can't be, because work is transactional in most contexts."
You can be piped at any second; you can also choose to leave at any second.
God is not coming down and laying you off because of a bad quarter.
Tell me if this rings a bell: You find a new television series and get hooked.
"The next episode is all you can think about, and you binge-watch it within a matter of days."
"All of the excitement has vanished, and your memories of all the episodes blur into one."
"You didn't foresee the period after, and why would you?"
"For the first 20 years of my life, I had never held a baby."
"So, when my housemate's newborn nephew visited us, I was apprehensive."
"I looked at his feet and wondered, How can someone so tiny grow into someone like me?"
"I have more enjoyable memories from that year at university, but that one is one of the clearest."
"Usually, I jump into an event head first in a quest to satisfy my impatient side."
"The next episode or holiday is all you can think about, so you binge whatever possible."
"To temper over-excitable anticipation, I've deployed a few tricks."
"Copy them if you like:By tempering anticipation, the memories themselves become the prominent force in your mind."
"As an impatient person, you may swiftly forget one memory as your mind races towards creating a new one."
"So, here's a three-step process to creating memories that last."
"Once you've done all of this, you can always refer to your notes in the future."
"In terms of making memories, it can prevent you from wiping them away as soon as you've made them."
They're the semantics that makes our lives exciting and the things you hold on to in your quietest moments.
"As an impatient person myself, I'm still battling my mind's need to chase the next memory."
But what good are they if we can't remember them correctly?
"It seemed like a metaphor at first, but it wasn't."
She grew up in a part of the world where people don't trust banks.
There was a room in her mansion that had floor to ceiling money.
"As a child, I always had trouble making friends, she told me."
"Her father would bring her gifts that only famous people's children had, to appease her loneliness."
"Very expensive presents, but I was never a close part of the group."
"She bought me a Hermes scarf, expensive meals, fancy pens, and overpaid me for editing her work."
I took that insane amount of money for editing because I'm a gig worker.
"He said she ruined all her relationships and when she ruined ours, she would lose a friend and an editor."
"When she told me that story, I knew that our relationship was on its way to being old milk."
"She trashed people's marriages, their fashion, their writing, their itty bitty wealth."
"I knew my quirkiness and enthusiasm would buy me some time, but eventually, she would see through me."
"Whenever we were out together, the feeling never escaped me that she was trying to catch me in a lie."
"When I was a teenager, I lied, but as an adult, I'm pretty married to the truth."
"If I'm thinking of lying, I realize there's a fear that I haven't faced."
"Anytime, she said, like Indonesia was an uber drive away."
"In real life, outside of her rocky relationships, she was famous for identifying bodies after plane crashes."
"The scientists and recovery people had a nickname for her, but I will not tell it."
She was who they brought it in when the bodies were long past identification.
"She was a dentist, so she was an expert on dental identification."
"She was a chemist, so she knew how the body changed through chemical reactions created by temperatures."
I wondered how you could do this for a living and also sit across from someone and share a plate of mussels.
Her job was to scrutinize every flaw in the body in order to identify it for family members.
"But I also knew, that even if I returned the scarf, something else would end us."
"It turns out that when you have a money room, it's very hard to make friends."
But she could never figure out what her money was buying her.
"She was paying for something, but she didn't know what."
I think about her and her sweet open childlike face and her indiscriminate generosity.
"Everything she wore was so soft, as if imperfect fabric would scratch her surface."
They did not buy 30 seconds of ads during the half-time show.
"I often hear a note of skepticism when I speak to researchers about remote, unmoderated research tools."
I was once like this - passionate about research and a little defensive about doing anything other than than the gold standard.
"In particular, any suggestion to cut research back can trigger a knee-jerk response."
It's often a result of many years of struggling to make research heard or valued in their company.
"If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
"Different research tools allow you to investigate, test and measure with varying levels of specificity and precision."
"In the problem space, you're still learning about what customers or users are struggling with and where their pain points are."
You may dip into the world of usability studies if you're benchmarking a user experience that is part of the pain point.
"In the solution space, you're testing the ideas you've formulated that you believe will help solve these customer problems."
"This is where you deploy evaluative research - usability tests, pulse surveys, tree tests and other responses to designed artifacts."
The third lens we use to decide on which research tool is appropriate is a lens of risk.
"As new people are involved with the project, new ideas and interpretations of various decision are woven in."
Short feedback loops are critical in enabling teams to integrate research into their workflow smoothly.
"As we go along the process from problem space to solution space, our feedback loops get shorter and our iterations faster."
One huge reason why we have started using unmoderated remote research more is that it helps us diversify our participant pool.
"Obviously this would be less helpful for a conversation, and in that situation, a remote moderated approach is preferable."
"If you're looking to build a more complete research toolkit, head to UsabilityHub and start testing today."
"Have you ever gotten stuck in a poor routine, like ordering pizza every Wednesday, then tried to stop?"
"Once you repeat a behavior a few times, it can quickly become a habit."
"A habit requires less thinking, which means it needs less energy, and our brains love that."
Studies show that habits - actions performed without conscious thought - make up 43% of our daily actions.
"If so many of our daily actions are habits, why aren't they easier to change?"
"Because research shows that when we form habits, it literally rewires our brain."
That's why it's so hard to break a bad habit - we're not just fighting our cravings or desires.
That's why some experts say that it's easier to replace a bad habit than to quit one.
"To replace bad behaviors with better ones, we need to understand the underlying mechanics of habits."
They created the so-called Habit Loop that describes the neurological patterns that drive routines.
"Between injuries and a lack of key talent, the team needed to change."
"Tony Dungy's strategy was to shift the Buccaneers' habit loops, not quit old behaviors for new ones."
Another coach would've asked Player A to stop watching for Player B and look for a completely different cue.
"It took some time for these new habits to take hold, but in 1999 the Buccaneers won the division championship."
"The three-step process below will help you identify your habit, its trigger, and a replacement routine."
"If you want to get started with replacing bad habits, what psychologists call awareness training could help."
"This is the process of identifying a habit trigger, after which you can choose to perform your replacement habit."
"Every time you feel the urge to perform the habit, write down what's happening around you and how you feel."
"After you perform the exercise a few times, you should be able to identify what's triggering your behavior."
"Sometimes, behavior is driven by a combination of addiction and habit."
My addiction to nicotine gum was driven by the hit of nicotine the gum provided.
But the habit of popping in a piece of nicotine gum was driven by specific cues.
I'd use nicotine gum when my mental energy was flagging at work to give my brain a boost.
"In this case, I replaced nicotine gum with regular chewing gum."
This simple behavior shift was a new routine triggered by the same habit cues.
"If your replacement habit is harder to perform, you're less likely to do it."
"For example, when I was quitting nicotine gum, I kept several packs of chewing gum on me at all times."
"That way, I didn't have to hunt for chewing gum when my habit cues appeared."
"And I didn't have to go to the store and buy more gum, where I'd inevitably buy nicotine gum instead."
"Building better habits is mostly down to doing hard things over and over, until they're not so hard anymore."
"And improving our habits - actions performed without conscious thought - can lead to success, on or off a football field."
"Whether we want to believe it or not, we live in a simulation of perception."
"Spirits inhabiting holographic bodies, and interacting with other holographic forms, in order to experience the dualities of the perceived physical world."
"Light, energy, sound and magnetism comprise the unseen waves that comprise us and connect us."
"Some believe we are conscious beings seeking higher or lower realms, what is considered ascension or descension ."
"That all of it is connected to a Source, or something greater than ourselves that represents everything that is."
"And, that we are also the sources of whatever realities we create, and choose to see or experience."
"For example, plants can be observed in their natural states, and their geometries can be mapped out."
"So, you might consider a plant as a leading signifier of living operations in the natural or physical world."
Now let's examine how this looks in terms of compiling information in the natural world or physical world with holographic representations.
These types of models are then used to create multi-dimensional objects.
Let's consider that there is no one model to see or understand information in holographic form.
"Remember too that this is precisely where semantics have limited us in our information discovery, and the applications thereof."
"Each point of inference draws in other interconnected points, such that we can actually see causes and effects."
"Typically, externalities are not factored into risk calculations in their full breadth, or simply not at all."
"We can either see it, or intuit it, or both."
"Information in the form of data can substantiate what we see or intuit, rather than just confirm our preexisting biases and beliefs."
"Even worse, when we are fed answers, we tend to not ask more questions."
"Going forward, information discovery cannot be relegated to predeterminations about the world."
"As such, discovering the unknown unknowns is a noble and worthy pursuit."
Now let's look at what information discovery means in terms of practical application.
"Conventional wisdom still maintains that if we connect a bunch of devices, we can see the world for exactly what it is."
"Yet, this is based almost solely on optics, rather than the true nature of physical forms, as described earlier."
"Now we have the unprecedented opportunity to solve environmental, social and health problems at quantum scale."
"In doing so, we will transform the world according to our true natures."
"The inflection point is a cost of $100 per kilowatt-hour, the metric for battery capacity."
"A boom erupted in kitchen upgrades and automobile ownership, initiating the American love affair with the road and the age of convenience."
"In a story last month, I plumbed whether, a century later, we are entering a new Roaring '20s."
"And, if so, what are the products that could drive the boom this time?"
The various industries would add up to trillions of dollars in new business.
But batteries costing $50 to $100 per kWh would be transformative in other ways too.
Such lanes might also accommodate delivery bots toting e-commerce packages.
"One such technology is augmented and virtual reality, at once untethered from wall sockets and fully portable."
People living in isolated places will have greater chances to interact with people elsewhere.
"But people wearing such devices will also be on the move, not in their living rooms."
"Lighter, smaller, more energetic batteries would also enable mobile robots, which would suddenly be much cheaper to operate."
"That could mean lost jobs if cheap, long-lived batteries mean such robots could wander around doing tasks for long hours."
We won't know the job impact concretely until the time is here.
Robots that are powerful enough to be useful are the 'toaster' of the next decade.
"On the other side of the Mattress King store, my son fiddled with his phone."
"The Crosley radio was still on, but the sound was just white noise."
"My boy Finn was seven, and I had no option but to bring him to work."
"This new guy, too, was instrumental in the new phone thing."
"So even when Finn was with me, he wasn't with me, thanks to this new dude."
"If you want anything to drink, there's a fridge in the back room, I called to him."
"I had loved those adventures as a kid, and I thought he would have liked it too."
"We have another hour of this, I told him, knowing he couldn't hear me."
"Through the streaks in the window, I saw a silver sedan race across the parking slots."
A woman and a teenager exited and walked across the parking lot of the Peach Orchard Shopping Center.
"I grew up in this area of South Jersey, and while I'm not educated, I know irony."
When we were young we would dare each other to steal a peach.
"I would run as fast as I could, hop up, pluck a peach, and race back to the smiles."
I looked her up online and showed my mom the Google pics.
"A year after the divorce, I wasn't having any luck with the bar scene."
"I'm a mattress salesman, so I'm not sure if that makes me a professional business single."
On most days I mess around with a tie that I never fully clasp.
The last time I buttoned the top button was on my wedding day.
I guess someone in the major leagues would know all about a Windsor knot and cufflinks and buffed shoes.
"I found it difficult to dance with her and keep my obvious arousal,"
"Sound advice, I guess, but now there's enough room for the state of Texas."
"Well, that dance was the best chance I had since the divorce papers."
"I left two messages, maybe three, and after a week, I just gave up."
"I would normally use my rain sales pitch, but seeing Faye again threw off my usual salesmanship."
The reflection in the window helped me adjust my Chia-pet mound of dishwater blonde hair.
"The boy, despite the rain, lagged twenty feet behind, holding his phone."
One day these phones will merge permanently into our DNA.She shook a dripping stub of a navy blue umbrella.
"Yep, Justin replied, strutting with black sneakers covered in pink cherry blossoms."
"The rain had made freckles on his black shirt, half-tucked over his baby fat tummy."
"Underneath her jacket, a tight orange blouse and low-rise jeans defined her reconstructed figure."
"She was around forty-five, I guess, with long red hair tied up."
"I would purchase a bottle of red and white, not knowing Faye's preference."
It would be no cheap box of wine that I would oxidate in the blender.
"In the Kingdom of Ice about the first arctic expedition, and it goes nut crazy."
"And after dinner, we would catch a flick, and then maybe, afterward, ice cream."
I can always tell how a woman enjoys sex by the way she eats - at least how Morgan didn't enjoy sex.
"This model here, The Dreamstate Pose Sleep Excelsior II, is the lowest quality I wish to sell. . ."
But she wasn't listening because she pulled out her phone from her back pocket.
I've always wanted to ask him what he thinks of my job.
I want him to know that all work is valuable and that he really shouldn't be embarrassed.
"I just cleaned it this morning, I said, but this for some reason startled her."
Then it started hard: the rain on the roof and what rain.
I approached her son Justin who was pushing down on each bed.
"The princely kid continued staring at his phone, his fingertips foxtrotting across the screen."
"I have a kid myself, and I'm trying to learn the lingo."
I followed my mom everywhere and didn't give her hell at all.
"And Morgan was my first, so late into my twenties, and now, for far far too long, my last."
"I would tutor him the way Finegas tutored Finn MacCool, like Yoda to Skywalker."
But he taught me how to fish and how to avoid the banshees.
My dad didn't live long enough to see the failure of his tutelage.
"I had to start working to support the family, and I never stopped."
"Faye startled me with a cough and, with the edge of contempt, asked, Were you helping us or not?"
He's a pain in my ass if you really must know.
"Then maybe it's you who needs a new comfortable bed, right?"
The kid stretched out with his arms and folded them around his head.
"Alright, alright, he said, trying to wiggle it back."
"It's the All-American beat-time, the kid replied."
"The boy peeled one of the cherry blossoms from his sneaker, rolled it, then sniffed it and smirked,"
"He flicked the blossom like a booger and said, I didn't say a piece of shit."
"You shouldn't talk that way to a lady, young man, I said."
"I was offended, really, that she did not recognize me."
"As she talked, she picked up the wooden frame with the picture of my son Finn in his baseball uniform."
It was a cheap frame bought with a 50% coupon from AC Moore.
I snagged a tissue from my porcelain baseball dispenser and wrapped it around a bloody finger.
"I can see the resemblance, she said as she glanced at her watch."
She asked her son: Have you tried every bed in the store?
And that comes with a full nine-year and three hundred and sixty-five-day warranty.
"The woman said she couldn't see spending that much on just a twin, but I assured her they went even higher."
The mom said she wasn't expecting to pay seven hundred dollars for a mattress.
Justin arched his back and pulled up his pants and smiled as he ran his hand over the white pillow top.
"I nodded my head, and thought, touché, and pointed my finger like a gun."
"I walked to the window, fingering the grooves on the golden knob of the radio, wondering about the game."
And what did it matter that I was a mattress salesman on a soggy Sunday afternoon?
I just plug numbers and fill out forms and collect credit card numbers.
"As I waited, I chewed on the pen and noticed my tattoo through my white, threadbare shirt."
I placed my hand over the tattoo and said an ironic prayer to a pagan prince.
"Even if they both walked out now, I wouldn't have cared."
"I'd track down a band-aid, follow the game, if the radio still worked, and hug my son."
"Then with a wave of her hand, Faye called me over."
"While I was happy with the sale, I knew I liked her less for her decision."
I couldn't be with a woman who had no sound money sense.
I wanted to call Finn over to calculate my commission on the sale.
"Soon the rain was horrendous; like the monsoon scenes from third world countries, the rain that drowns oxen."
"We danced, had a nice time, and you gave me your number."
"I left a message, two messages, a third with your son."
"Then she said, Justin, this guy's ripping us off."
"I can put that savings into a college fund, the mom said."
I tried to save the sale: you can't trust reviews.
"So I showroom the wares, and when they click and find something better."
I don't know if Tuft and Needle compare with the Ortho-Posture Valleybrook WhisperDream 3000.
"Everything goes by a different name, and I have to sit here day after day to make distinctions over quality."
"In another year, this store just maybe a yogurt store, or another burger joint, or senior urgent care."
"I told her that I may have lost the sale, but all may not be lost."
"I'd really like to hear more about your dog-walking business, Faye."
"If you have friends, tell them I'm having a rain sale."
He turned on the volume and said the rain had stopped and the game was back on.
And it was a good thing that I didn't go out with Faye.
She would have cringed at the torn seat covers of the Civic.
And I can remain comfortable in my mom's crumbling two-bedroom rancher in Pennsauken that I will inherit after her death.
It was half an hour to closing when the bells jingled on the door.
A woman in her early thirties walked in alone with a black umbrella.
"For once, I did not want to make mad passionate love on the mattresses."
"But the sign says you're open until five, the attractive woman said."
"For dinner, we ate soft-serve cones from McDonald's."
I wiped a glob from Finn's nose and asked him what his name meant to him.
"Underneath an overactive air conditioner, alone with my son, I told him again the legend of Finn MacCool."
"Finn once said, 'A man lives after his life but not after his dishonor.'"
Why did we wait for the game when we knew they were going to lose?
"Maybe your own dad is not actually the best teacher, I thought."
Maybe the best thing for him was to be traded to another team.
"It's all about hope for the future, I told him."
"I'll check to see if the Mets won, he said."
"Before we dive in, our readers would love to get to know you a bit better."
"I grew up in New York City, and my maternal grandparents lived in Europe."
"In two instances, people were so happy that they literally prostrated themselves."
The first time was by a customer on an inaugural JetBlue flight to San Diego.
"As he walked off the aircraft, he proclaimed his gratitude and genuine appreciation in a way I will never forget."
"My parents happened to be on that flight and saw it happen, which was a proud moment for me."
It happened more recently a few months ago when we introduced JSX service to Reno-Tahoe.
It's in those wonderful and rare moments when I feel the impact that joyful air travel has on people's lives.
Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting?
I sprinted a quarter of a mile to retrieve them before I realized they were playing a practical joke on me.
Which tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not burn out ?
None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way.
Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are?
"Simply put, we found a way to carve out the bad parts of flying and keep only the best parts."
Which pain point are you trying to address by introducing these innovations?All of them - but especially those that waste time.
"There are hundreds of undeserved, short distance, point-to-point markets in the U.S. alone."
"Many of them are huge, and some are small and seasonal and totally underserved."
Are there exciting new technologies that are coming out in the next few years that will improve the Air Travel experience?
I am most excited about the new hybrid and all electric aircraft platforms that are actively in development.
"As you know, the Pandemic changed the world as we know it."
Personal Space:People are now acutely aware of their level of exposure in crowded places - such as in airports and airplanes.
"We are already seeing more folks pursuing long weekend getaways, or to see loved ones across the Western U.S. and Texas."
"We all come from different perspectives and backgrounds, but we are all in this together."
"In the current times that we are living in, we all multitask."
It seems like such a waste of time and inefficient if we are not doing multiple things simultaneously.
Research shows that multitasking is not as efficient as you may think and could even harm your health.
I have been able to laser focus for as long as I can remember.
Sometimes even important things that I don't hear because of being laser-focused on the task at hand.
"In his book, Limitless, Jim Kwik teaches what he calls Limitless Methods."
These are methods that unlock your potential to grow and to learn like never before.
I highly recommend this book as it has been a game-changer for me.
Jim Kwik is a brain coach who had several brain injuries throughout his life that caused him to have difficulty learning.
Jim even got the nickname Boy with the broken brain from one of his teachers.
This caused Jim to have a limited mindset that he had a broken brain and couldn't be fixed.
Jim is now a learning expert and has made it his life mission to teach others how to learn.
One of the Limitless Methods that Jim discusses in his book is focus.
"In the book, Jim teaches that to get better at concentrating, you must practice concentration."
"Before the company had invested in a POS system with monitors, I remembered every sandwich called out."
I had 2 to 3 frontline cashiers and a drive-thru cashier calling orders out at the same time.
It didn't help that Arby's also has an extensive menu and allowed special orders.
It didn't take long before I had plenty of practice and learned the art of concentration.
"To accomplish anything, you must be able to concentrate, and unfortunately, we've never really been taught how to concentrate."
Dandapani defines concentration as the ability to keep awareness of one thing for an extended period of time.
The problem is that most of us practice distraction rather than concentration.
As Jim Kwik stated in his book:The best way to practice concentration is to practice one thing at a time.
"In our busy world, we are always trying to accomplish more by trying to multitask."
"The problem is, as mentioned earlier, it is scientifically proven that multitasking does not work."
"Instead of trying to multitask, try and focus on the task at hand."
"For example, if you are on the phone, do not scroll through social media."
Trying to multitask while having a conversation is something that I struggle with.
"I can't count how many times my wife had said, Remember when I told you that yesterday?"
I've always struggled with multitasking and thought that something was wrong with me because I'm not good at it.
"I have always liked focusing on one task, completing it, and then moving to the next."
Multitasking is not the most efficient way to get things accomplished and steals us of our focus.
"If you want to be laser-focused and accomplish great things, then stop multitasking."
"Instead, focus on what you are currently trying to accomplish and then move to the next."
"If you want to be more focused, then you must not try and multitask."
"Once you do this, which will take a lot of practice, you will not believe how much you can get done."
"Also, how much you can actually remember because you could really be present in the situation."
"Your work will not only get completed more efficiently, but the quality will also be much better."
I recently got back in touch with an old friend from high school.
"Like me, he had struggled with addiction but later managed to get sober."
His comments reminded me of similar feelings that I had experienced when I first quit drinking.
It didn't feel like they were genuinely interested in me as a person.
"Instead, I felt like they were just acting nice so that I wouldn't immediately go back to drinking."
"Despite that, they kept including me in the conversation and doing their best to get to know me."
"Now that I've been sober for several years, I see these early interactions in a different light."
I find myself caring about people that I've just met moments earlier.
There's an immediate sense of kinship whenever I meet someone else who has struggled with addiction.
Knowing that someone is an addict means knowing that we've more than likely shared many similar experiences and even similar thoughts.
They can relate to certain aspects of my life better than even my closest non-addict friends.
"That connection makes me instantly care about someone, even if they're still a stranger."
I've never felt like I was faking it when I was friendly towards a fellow addict.
"I'll admit, however, that maybe the question isn't completely black-and-white."
It's just that I genuinely want every recovering addict to succeed.
"While this might be true, I don't think that it makes the friendships any less legitimate."
"Either you go to school together, work together, or share a hobby."
My addiction was such an isolating experience that I often forgot how easy it can be to start caring about other people.
"I was working the lunch shift, and my customer asked for a maraschino cherry in his whiskey sour."
"My boss, running the bar, informed me that we were out."
"However, later I saw a jar of cherries on a shelf, slightly out of sight."
"I went back and looked again, Yup, just out of reach, an ordinary jar of cherries."
"A few minutes later, that boss stomped towards me and threw the jar of cherries on the floor next to my feet."
The glass shattered as crushed cherries stained my apron and white shoes a bloody red.
You can imagine how many times I brought up any new ideas or shared concerns again.
"Psychological safety is all the rage nowadays, and for good reason."
"It empowers employees to discuss mistakes, share concerns, and highlight small problems before they escalate."
"So why isn't this happening?For an employee to feel invested in their company, they must feel invested in."
"If employees think there's more to lose than gain, they'll probably keep quiet."
"The default is to keep quiet, whether about positive ideas, or concerns."
Building the bridge of trust to go from silent to open isn't a one-directional line.
The research above shows that those who speak out often likely aren't speaking out about everything.
"When a high-approach employee brings up a long-standing concern, it's confusing for their leader."
But when the immediate response is Why didn't you speak up earlier?
The employee now feels at fault for not having the trust built before and are unlikely to bring up concerns again.
"In that same research, nearly half of employees reported not being regularly asked for their insights."
"Asking directly, and often, while demonstrating that something will come of it is how to genuinely invite collaboration."
Forty percent of respondents reported a lack of confidence when sharing their ideas.
This is especially true when employees HAVE shared their thoughts and nothing was done.
No one wants to make contributions that aren't recognized or valued.
It's human nature to stop trying and redirect energy where you believe it will do some good.
The whiner?Employees often keep quiet about an issue often because they're worried about being labeled a complainer or fear losing credibility.
It's not as easy as asking anyone who has a problem to speak up.
It is not as easy as assuming that those who do speak up feel open to do so in all situations.
"This work takes time, patience, and a heck of a lot of emotional intelligence."
"However, the organization that gets this right, is the organization that succeeds."
A basically step-by-step guide on how to make it on YouTube.
"The video's title is compelling, or its thumbnail somehow attention-grabbing."
"Or maybe it's something less flashy and more just, compelling."
Something that appeals to a thought you might have had but never really explored.
"Something that makes you pretty sure, before you even click, that it's going to be at least interesting."
But what would happen if you put a bowling ball under one of those things?
This is what makes YouTube and online user-generated content exciting to many.
Someone browsing the internet would have had to scroll past headlines and memes about the game for days and weeks.
"Then, someone scrolling on Reddit would have come across a link to a video."
Girlfriend reviews what it's like living with boyfriend obsessed with Red Dead Redemption 2.
So Red Dead 2's been out a while and this game takes up a lot of my boyfriend's time.
He's played all day every day for three weeks and has actually begun to start talking like a cowboy.
"There was the simple premise, and the simple joke to support the premise."
This is a review of the experience of living with someone who plays Red Dead Redemption 2.
So let's start with all the stuff you're gonna have to look at.
"And it was expressed plainly, from a distinctly non-gamer perspective."
"This game, I'm not gonna lie, I won't hate on it, is gorgeous."
And even if you don't like to sit and watch your boyfriend play games you've had to at least listen.
Your house is going to be filled with the sounds of gunshots and animals gasping for life.
"Right away, lines like these made me realize how special her perspective was."
Who else would zero-in on minor elements like ambient noise?
It's the kind of thing that only really sinks in to a passive listener.
But it actually got straight to the heart of the game's construction and the things it focused on.
There are these beautiful albino moose and the game seems obsessed with getting you to kill them.
And there was a delightful distance at play between the game and the experience of the game.
"And her version might even help you better understand the issue, especially if you were a layman."
"That initial Reddit post helped it blow up initially, and it was re-posted to a Red Dead-specific forum."
"Comments under the video uniformly praised the humor, editing, and of course, the conceit."
And one sentiment was voiced over and over again: You have to make more!
"She had after all finished the last video by saying, Thanks for watching."
So imagine those commenters' delight when four days later the channel uploaded Should Your Boyfriend Play Fallout 76?
"Production quality over these three videos were high, and more interestingly, consistent."
"And, as many commenters were quick to point out, it was sharply and cleverly edited."
"Every joke had a cue, and every beat was hit frame-perfect."
"And even then, those channels would still often only produce one video a week."
"So how were these complete unknowns doing this, out of nowhere?"
Many concluded it couldn't just be this one girl doing all this work by herself.
The next guy said they're probably paid by Sony for publicity.
We can't believe the love we've gotten from YouTube and Reddit.
"First, the hardest step of all: break out with a piece of content."
"Then, have that first thing you just made explode in popularity."
"For many, that explosion in popularity comes much later, only after they've made their thousandth thing."
"Some work for years, or a decade-plus, or their whole lives, and never break out."
"You can jump on a trend, or an already-popular category with high turnover, like gaming."
Don't bother trying to stay calm - there's no fun in that.
"For bonus points, throw in something like I read every single comment."
"Then, write the same thing into your script for next week's video, which of course you already have prepped."
"After a couple months, accept a compulsory email from YouTube inviting you to the YouTube Partner Program."
"Install pre-roll and pop-up ads that will occur before, during, and after all your videos."
"Don't worry - audiences are used to them, and those that can't take it have already installed ad-blockers."
"Wait 12 hours, then log into your account and freak out at the first AdSense dollars rolling in."
"Use that money initially to buy food, or as padding for a rainy day fund."
You're probably not at the quit your day job stage yet.
"But a couple weeks or months later, try paying yourself with revenue and realize it might be sustainable."
Advertise the Patreon in the end-roll of your next video.
"Say the Patreon money is going to go right back into the channel - a new better setup, more expensive equipment."
Make sure to mention that there's a link in the description.
There will also be a link to your new website that you got for free from your new sponsorship with Squarespace.
Maybe actually pay for the editing software instead of illegally downloading it.
"Soon, you'll be able to do more with each video, and in less time."
"As more creators like you flood into these platforms every day and start taking revenue share, the pie gets smaller."
"So get your fingers in, like, at least three or four pies."
"You'd be surprised what other creators can handle, especially as they grow and maybe even hire teams."
Try to ride the train of regular views and consistent work as long as the market will allow.
"And now that those thousands of people are here to stay, a community is established."
The craziest thing is that Girlfriend Reviews hit every beat on that path.
"By Episode 2, GFR had an Instagram and Twitter set up, linked in the description of every video."
"There were only two people behind the channel, the Girlfriend and Boyfriend in question."
"Their names were Shelby and Matt, and they lived together with two dogs and two cats."
"Matt, a professional editor in his day job, would edit the videos."
"Shelby, a musical theater performer and aspiring actor, would write and perform all the songs."
Theirs has been the best executed and most perfect version of the path I've seen in my time as a YouTube viewer.
The foul-cries got so loud that Shelby felt forced to make a statement on their Reddit account.
We've never manipulated our numbers anywhere and we were just as shocked at our initial growth as anyone.
"It's worth noting because that hasn't even happened that much, relatively speaking, in recorded history."
But it has happened by far the most often on the internet.
And wrapped in all of it was the allure of it being an almost accidental success story.
It's how we like to think of success stories - like they could happen to anyone.
"But think back to the end of the very first video and how she threw in the comment,"
We now know that they already had that video recorded and edited.
"There was a fully-produced song in that one, too."
That's the balance in mindset that any aspiring creator needs to strike as they attempt to make a career.
And now they find themselves on the other end of the wall.
"After a little more than a year, there they are again on Twitch, playing Cyberpunk 2077."
"Also, Chinny is not one to run away from a challenge."
Chinny Ugoji has pushed beyond the conventional 'churchy' way of attracting 'customers'
She leads her team to deliver several comms campaigns weekly and to produce all the contents in-house.
"The customer journey in churches needs to be studied and discussed more, there are lots of lessons to learn."
The incredible comms work has led to the fastest growing church in Nigeria - 'The Elevation Church'
CISA's War on Pineapple succinctly describes how foreign agents influence social media to cause division and social unrest.
It requires specific ingredients to bake over time before the cheese is heated to eruption.
"The topic might be gun control, women's rights, questions about the election, or racial injustice, for example."
"In the infographic, CISA uses the question about whether pineapple belongs on pizza."
Trolls don't care about the outcome of a threaded debate; they don't even need to win.
Be on the lookout for those that just want to spark division.
"As the troll prepares to engage, they might change their avatar and profile to match the stance."
"Older, established accounts may have greater reach by follower count and assumed authenticity by virtue of longevity."
"To activate these accounts, CISA suggests the profile names might be changed rather than creating brand new accounts."
Quotes may be taken out of context or entirely fabricated to fit a narrative.
"As wacky as his claims are of election fraud, Lindell did not say this."
But that hasn't stopped the raft of people from spreading the fake news as accurate.
Trolls know that most people just blindly like and drive-by retweet.
"When the debate reaches televised mainstream media, trolls have hit the jackpot."
"As CISA notes, the meddling is legitimized as the message is amplified across the nation."
Expect pundits to weigh-in on the matter as the controversy snowballs.
"I mean, really, who are these people that put fruit on pizza?"
CISA claims that dark money injects funding for events or organized events to influence people off the couch and into the streets.
"Once the big lie hit the mainstream, some donors supported the Stop the Steal campaign with wads of cash."
One gave $2.5 million and later sued to get it back.
"Another $300,000 was donated by an heiress to a supermarket chain."
Consider this head-shaking revelation by CNN - some at the Capitol insurrection did not even vote.
"But the confirmation bias over time may reinforce beliefs that ultimately lead to blind, ignorant rage."
"CISA falls short in the illustration; however, it is evangelizing the notion that disingenuous influence only originates from foreign soil."
"Domestic extremist groups have also co-opted the social universe to peddle divisive notions, even recently."
The same people who control our political system also control Wall Street and big business.
CISA's War on Pineapple reminds us to be alert and to identify social influencers with dubious intent.
"Unfortunately, I see users falling into the same old trap, being egged into debate before scrutinizing the author's legitimacy."
If only we decried fake users as often as we heard the phrase fake news.
Many of these costs can be deducted as freelance business expenses - money that you've paid out to do your work.
These expenses can be deducted from your business revenue when working out your profits and taxable income.
I hope this particular expense guide provides value because it's specifically for freelancers.
You can use it when working out expenses for your own freelance business.
"These guides are intended only as general information, not as specific advice or recommendations."
"You should not rely on any of the information in these guides to make financial, tax, or other decisions."
You should always speak to a qualified tax professional about your unique tax circumstances.
These guides only apply to freelancers filing taxes as sole-proprietors or single-member LLCs in the United States.
"Fortunately, I wrote an entire guide on revenues, expenses, and profits that which explains things further."
"Please note that in this guide, I use the terms expenses, costs, and tax-deductible interchangeably."
"For example, the cost of a cell phone that you use partly for business and partly for personal calls."
"I explain how to calculate this in the revenue, expenses, and profits guide."
"Depreciation can also apply to smaller purchases or expense claims, for example for business use of your home."
"Your expense claims must be supported with evidence - for example, a receipt or other proof that you spent that money."
Only claim expenses for legitimate business costs where you have a way of showing you paid that expense.
Your freelance business expenses are completely separate from your 1040 standard or itemized deduction.
Do I have a guide on freelance bookkeeping for taxes I hear you cry?
"There are lots of expenses small businesses can claim, but several of them are not likely to be claimed by freelancers."
"Alright, now I've explained what isn't included, let's get into what is."
"Everyone's tax needs are different, and you should always speak to a qualified tax professional about your unique tax circumstances."
Types of software might include:Many freelancers have websites where they describe their services and show samples and portfolios of their work.
The costs related to hosting and creating these websites are tax-deductible.
"It's worth explaining the home office deduction in some detail, because it can get complicated."
The home office deduction is different to and distinct from the other office deductions listed in this freelance expense guide.
"However, in some cases, the other method may make sense."
This method may also have an impact on depreciation and capital gains tax when you sell your home.
You can generally take these expenses in addition to your home office deduction.
"These are some of those hidden costs that we don't often think about, but they add up fast!"
"Essentially, these are fees that you pay to receive payment from individuals, businesses, freelance platforms, and others."
There's a whole wealth of finance-related expenses that may be partly or fully deductible as a freelance business expense.
"Some of these are complex though, so speak to your accountant."
Some types of retirement contributions are deductible from the amount you pay on your federal and state income taxes.
Retirement contributions are not typically deducted from your self-employment taxes.
"However, they are tax-free when you take money out of those accounts in retirement."
"There are contribution and compensation limits for retirement accounts and taxes, and they can get complicated, so talk to your accountant."
"You can hire other businesses, freelancers, and contract workers and make use of their services."
"You can normally deduct 100% of the cost, provided the services are exclusively for your freelance business."
The money you spend on professionals to help you run your freelance business are generally fully tax-deductible.
"If you use professional equipment in your freelancing work, you can normally deduct the entire cost."
"Thanks for reading!Learn more about freelance taxes in my friendly, approachable guides."
"I'm a freelance writer specializing in B2B content on business, finance, and technology."
"The information shared in these guides may not be accurate, reliable, timely, or relevant."
You should always consult a qualified tax professional about your unique situation.
"The information here only applies to freelancers in the US, paying US taxes."
It also only applies to freelancers who are sole proprietors or single-member LLCs.
"The brain is a miraculous organ, and that's not a secret to anyone."
"In this article, I'll be giving you an overview of the world of connectomics."
"In order to understand connectomics, we need to have a basic understanding of communication within the brain."
"I don't know about you, but when I hear really good music, I automatically start dancing."
"I don't care where I am, good music calls for a dance party at any moment."
How do we instinctively know how to do these tasks?The brain is made up of billions of cells referred to as neurons.
"These neurons carry information that consists of electrical pulses, and whenever you perform any action, neurons in your brain fire off."
"A neuron has branches that look like a tree, and they are called dendrites."
"The dendrites receive signals, and a longer projection that looks like a tree trunk, called the axon, sends signals."
These electrical pulses can jump from neurons to neurons through the use of the nerve releasing chemical signals called neurotransmitters.
"At the end of the axons, we can find synapses that act as a channel for neurons to communicate."
The connectome is a comprehensive map of the neural connections within the brain of an organism.
It's often thought of as a wiring diagram that maps all the neural connections within the nervous system of an organism.
"This organism has a very small neural network, consisting of around 300 neurons and around 7,000 synaptic connections."
Construction of the C. elegans connectome took a very long time and involved very tedious scientific manpower.
"Every individual neuron was identified, located, and traced, just through manual visual recognition."
"Unsurprisingly, the human brain is far more complicated in comparison to the brain of C. elegans."
"In fact, our brains have 80-100 billion neurons and an estimated amount of 700 trillion synaptic connections."
"Today, completing the human connectome is out of our reach due to the existing technology we have."
"Although there are possible challenges related to mapping the human connectome, there are many opportunities that create optimism for this possibility."
"Additionally, artificial intelligence is being pursued in many labs to accomplish the tedious task of visualization that comes with mapping a connectome."
"Breakage of the spinal cord can have disastrous effects, since it effectively cuts off access to the lower half of the body."
"To this date, there are currently no therapies that can reduce nerve function if it is lost."
Cytokines are proteins that are usually released by immune cells in order to trigger some sort of response in another cell.
"To get around this, the researchers used an innovative solution: viruses."
"Viruses work by forcing entry into a host cell, and then releasing genetic material into the host cell."
"The genetic material is used to produce proteins that eventually build multiple copies of the virus, allowing it to reproduce."
The researchers generated a modified virus that forced the host cell to produce hIL-6.
The virus was injected into the area with the broken spinal cord and into the area of the brain that controls motor functions.
"Surprisingly, in just two to three weeks, the mice were able to walk again and the spinal cord was completely restored."
"We posted the videos, and then I didn't think about it again."
I quickly opened up the app and saw the hundreds of notifications I'd missed.
Tiktok has a lot of potential for any individual or business to go viral.
"Here's how we got the followers we have, and how you can start building your follower base today."
"Tiktok has very specific community guidelines that precludes hate speech, harassment, etc."
"The app has put a huge emphasis into more family-friendly content, so no profanity, sex topics, etc."
"Just like you can't plagiarize your articles, you shouldn't be plagiarizing your content ideas on Tiktok."
"If you look at my Tiktok, all of my videos are about me and my family."
"As our account grew, we added in more educational content as well as product recommendations that we stand behind."
It's a feel-good story that isn't dependent on something happening right now.
"I've done a couple of trends, but mostly in regards to using some trending music."
Some Tiktok experts will tell you that videos around 12-15 seconds do even better.
"You Page, you have only 1-3 seconds to hook a viewer before they'll scroll past it."
It's really not all that different from articles ending with a suggestion that the reader join an e-mail list.
"You can see how people saw your content, when your followers are mostly online, etc."
US banks dramatically expanded their lending at the onset of the health and economic crisis.
Post-crisis regulations require larger banks to operate with huge capital buffers above their regulatory requirements.
The largest US banks added about $60bn to their allowances in the first quarter of 2020 -
"Of course, if the recession were to deepen, banks would need to build their reserves further."
"However, banks continue to generate earnings that can be used for this purpose."
"In the US, the Fed also governs the ability of banks to pay dividends through its annual stress test."
"Leaving aside its putative benefits, a blanket dividend ban imposed outside the current regulatory framework would come with a substantial cost."
"It would make it difficult for investors to value banks, and thereby make them decidedly less investable."
"If that ability were taken away arbitrarily, the investment case would become difficult to understand."
"Moreover, the European and UK experience provides no support for the US following suit."
Large US banks have already announced a voluntary halt to share repurchases through the second quarter.
"More importantly, the European and UK experience may serve as a cautionary tale."
UK and European banks now trade at an average of just 0.4 times their tangible book value.
"We get home exhausted and drained, unable to make the most of our off time."
Studies show U.S. employees overwork by 269 hours compared to the country's economic output.
"There are many reasons, but I want to focus on two intertwined issues."
Issues that answer the question: are we as productive as we think we are.
"When we take work breaks, we submerge ourselves into problematic activity."
"To me, our productivity is proportional to the true rest we get."
"With little regard for our well-being, we became convinced our work was more important than us."
We didn't see 'us' and our 'work' as intertwined.
"Thus, I define productivity as the balance between work and rest."
"By defining our output this way, we factor in ourselves as a key component to the result."
"It mentions how workers, for half of the day, spend it on mindless activities."
I even talk about how my current work schedule is more productive than my old office schedule.
That's because studies continually show the most common work schedules are hurting us.
But I will add that our approaches to true rest are toxic to our mental and physical health.
"Our minds and bodies, no matter the profession or circumstance, needs invigorating rest."
You don't exercise the same muscle two days in a row.
Our society encourages us to work beyond our contracted salary or hourly wages.
We edge closer to the precipice's edge until there's no room left to give.
No wonder 23%-44% of the workforce report some form of burnout.
"It's even worse for those working in the tech industry, where 60% of workers report burnout."
"We get through our work at a faster rate, with better results."
A half-hour or hour break to split an eight-hour day doesn't cut it.
"What's crucial, though, is to not overstimulate your mind or body."
"I've discussed at length elsewhere how much of our media is no longer owned by us, the consumers."
"Rather, it's owned by corporations who hand us access through subscription services."
"If you leave their services, all the media you bought through them disappears."
"Amazon, Spotify, Sony, Microsoft, Netflix, and countless more are like this."
"Your subscription can provide you meaningful content, like here on Medium."
The issue comes when you are trapped in what I call subscription escapism.
Subscription escapism is the act of buying into more content than you can realistically consume.
"For example, having subscriptions for Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO Now."
"Having that much access to streaming content may seem nice, but it's unnecessary."
"You're handing your money, time, and energy to a faceless entity."
"But that's the problem, many people do subscribe to more than is necessary."
Lots of mindless browsing while stacking up a long list of 'things to watch' that will never be finished.
You end up spending hours of your life browsing for that next show.
"Only to place it, forgotten, in a 'to-watch' list."
"You build up anxiety because you're behind on other things, and here's the kicker."
"When you add a 'to do' on top of a subscription-based platform, you are building a stress conduit."
So the nature of subscriptions is to keep you stuck to the screen.
It's easy to think you're not spending as much money or time as you are on subscriptions.
"When we immerse ourselves in subscription escapism during rest, two things happen."
"Thus, the escape mechanism increases while your capacity for productive work decreases."
You plummet into a downward spiral of self-deprecation and depression.
It's a situation like quicksand; it becomes harder and harder to get out the further in you get in.
"So, how do we fix this?The keywords are active and meaningful."
"It is easy to get lost in our subscriptions, and easy to dismiss taking more rest periods during the day."
"Our work culture dismisses true rest as laziness, yet we need to be active in our self-maintenance."
Are we letting our bodies rest or are we stressing ourselves out with too much external stimulation?Our media consumption needs to be meaningful.
The same critical eye needs to reflect on how we interact with our subscriptions.
"We need to approach content with intent, instead of relying on stacked up, forgotten lists."
When I started adding true rest to my workday my productivity increased exponentially.
We owe it to ourselves and the work we are passionate about to have meaningful rest.
"When we are mindful of our needs, that attention redirects into our work."
I needed time to stand still for a moment so I could think.
"When I began university, I had made a plan to explore South Africa in my free time."
A year in which I had to face myself and realise my faults as well as others.
A year of being made to let go of control and go with the flow.
Ask me to write about trauma and I will probably smile smugly before showing you an archive of my work.
I even have a test for adult ADHD in the next few weeks.
"BPD is characterised by unstable relationships with other people, unstable emotions and an unstable sense of self."
"After all, many anti-BPD groups would like to claim people like myself are incapable of love."
"Now, my brain being smart devised ways of working as a means of survival and protection."
"A big part of my therapy journey has been realising that this survival program isn't necessarily nefarious, but it is outdated."
A part of this update has been the realisation that decisions I had made were born from survival.
"And though I meant these statements at the time, they do not apply to the person I am now."
"It has been a long journey, but in it, I have found a home within myself."
I decided to no longer let my past trauma's define how I come to find and receive love.
"Our stories of love tend to be shrouded in misery and pain, for good reason."
"At the start of this year, I made a giant leap towards this by coming out to my dad."
He told me that all he cares about is my future happiness.
Today I am reminded of when I stated that I would sooner be dead before hearing my parents admit their fault.
"That version of my father and I, died a long time ago and we are who we are now."
We are constantly barraged with information that hints at the fleetness of joy for us.
But we must stop letting our past trauma write out our lives.
"For me, the most loving thing I did for myself was to start therapy."
Valentine's Day being nestled in US Black History Month means I thirst for Black love stories and clichéd happy endings.
I hope some will endeavour to create works that represent us as we are.
"If you were to ask me to write a piece on love, I probably wouldn't know where to start."
"Even before the pandemic, I worked for myself to figure out what people wanted to read and consume on the internet."
"In 2018, I felt I couldn't manage to deal with freelance ghostwriting's stress and deadlines."
"I signed on at News Break, and I started a YouTube channel."
"So far, I haven't made enough money to feed my family, but I am working toward that goal."
"I don't have a regular job, but I do find myself working more than I probably should."
"I have a family with a growing baby, and my wife works full-time during the day."
The only time I can work is overnight when everyone else is asleep.
I do it during the day to focus entirely on writing and editing videos at night.
"My mental health has not been an emergency, but I slog through my days with fatigue, depression, and anxiety."
What has to suffer for me to get the time I need to push my earnings higher?
"As a family, we can no longer survive on what I manage to earn and what I get from SSDI."
"I've spent too many years as a sick person, and I am so far behind where I need to be."
How will I ever get out of this hole I've been living in my whole life?Yeah.
"I don't particularly appreciate that I am so focused on money, but I'm in dire straits."
"It's happened before, and I was almost homeless because I didn't get my benefits for a year."
I still rely on SSDI because I can't keep a job with my psychosis and episodes of depression and anxiety.
My success as a provider for my family is very much at stake here.
I am hardly getting through each day working for myself - there is no way I could manage to keep a job.
It involves my wife and I not trying to be superheroes and do everything ourselves.
We are not planning on disappearing - we will still be here to help and do our share.
"I have to admit it feels like I'm selfish, letting someone else do what I should be doing."
"Sometimes, you must do it for the good of everyone, and that is the lesson in all this."
"We both have to work right now, and that means freeing up time."
"The pandemic had made things harder for everyone, and we all are in situations that we would rather avoid."
The best thing we could do is not beat ourselves up for choosing to earn more money.
"In the long run, it's all for the greater good."
"Sadly, we have to take time away from our kids, but that is life."
It's essential that the time we spend together is fulfilling and we spend quality time focusing on each other.
This is basically a 200m long pipe that rotates around a center point.
"The pipe has a lot of sprinklers, and as soon as the pivot is rotating it is irrigating the land below."
"Naturally, it is heavy machinery which can easily weigh more than 2 tons."
"So, as soon as the soil gets wet, the wheels get stuck, and this stops the system from spinning."
One-half of the crops are over irrigated while the other half is dry.
"Just in the USA, there are more than 125.000 pivot irrigation systems."
"So our customer requirement made us ask ourselves, How can we connect a pivot to the internet without touching it?"
"For its installation, it only requires 2 minutes of work and a screwdriver."
There is no need to connect it to the mainboard nor to the electricity.
"Once it is installed, the user only needs to turn on the device, pushing the power button."
"Recently, due to the COVID, this concept quickly went from key to critical ."
"On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shared a welcome new change to their quarantine recommendations."
"Now, people who are fully vaccinated have been added to the list of exceptions."
"In a thread, she answered questions about whether such a move is justified."
"As a reminder, people who have been fully vaccinated are still recommended to wear masks and socially distance."
"Granting an app access to your contacts is ethically dicey, even if it's an app you trust."
There are at least two additional ways in which Clubhouse appears to take users' contact data further than the norm.
The second surprising way that Clubhouse harnesses your contact information is revealed when you go to invite others to the app.
"A quick Twitter search turned up plenty of further examples, some queasier than others."
Clubhouse may or may not be the worst offender in terms of how it handles contacts that users upload.
Such algorithmic software uses machine-learning techniques that find patterns or correlations in vast quantities of 'data'.
"Now, let's see how and why such a method raises concerns over the effects of quantification and unfair practices in courts."
"Additionally, for it lacks transparency, and explainability, little is known about the efficacy of such interventions in the judicial forums."
"In another sense, it is aptly argued that machine-learning algorithms cannot be befitting according to communicative theories of punishment.4"
"Hence, it is of course an issue that such kind of unfairness is ever ignoble in the justice context."
"However, whether algorithms should be used to arbitrate fairness in court decisions is still a complicated question."

It is then argued that 'both of these definitions are totally defensible!
It's my first day back at therapy since the funeral last week.
"Well, my dad just died and I haven't even cried."
"Last night, I tried putting his favorite song on, staring at a bunch of old photos."
"But there's this other part of me that's like, 'no, that's bullshit.'"
That's just something we tell sociopaths to make them feel better about themselves.
"Money, like air or water, is necessary for human sustenance."
"But unlike air and water that occurs freely in nature, money is a human invention."
"Control money, finance, and the banking system and you can control almost every other aspect of human life."
And this is why these elites have labored to consolidate their grip on the monetary system.
"However, one thing about technology is that as it evolves, it also changes 'face' or platforms."
The internet is the platform by which almost every advancement in technology is built on.
"Consequently, the internet has also caused a shift in the lifestyle and culture of people."
These days everyone prefers anything digital or online; the number of digital solutions and innovations across industries is endless.
"And no statement best describes this than that of famous Silicon Valley investor and Entrepreneur, Naval Ranvikant."
"However, the internet has actually failed to fulfill the initial purpose of its creation."
The internet was created to be a decentralized system that gave everyone equal access and control.
The reverse has actually been the case with the internet and its derivatives now monopolized and its control skewed on different levels.
The solution or attempted solution for a better money system must also take into consideration the dynamism and importance of technology.
"In view of this, I identified some major factors that simultaneously affect the improvement of money and the internet respectively."
"Furthermore, apart from the issue of data privacy, we need to ask ourselves this question again."
"In the current monetary system, the safest place to put your money is in the bank."
This is because banks usually loan out as much as 90% of their total deposits.
"So when depositors come in simultaneously requesting their money, the banks would most likely not be able to provide it."
"When you put, say again, $10,000 in a bank."
The money does not just sit idle in the bank's vault.
They use your money to give out loans to other people with a significant interest rate.
This is also similar to people who invest with hedge fund managers.
People must have absolute autonomy with regards to their finance for there to be equal opportunity in the long term.
"This is not about a certain currency that everyone should be able to touch, control, and secure, no,"
Research analysis and synthesis can be quite extensive and energy-draining steps within the UXR process.
"In case of more extensive projects above 15 users, I recommend using one colour per target group instead, when possible."
"Miro allows a maximum of 16 post-it colours and nonetheless, it'll make your framework more manageable."
"Emojis are a subtle, fun yet visible additional touch to mark the post-its for visual reference."
"Tags, on the other end, hold the benefit to be retrievable via the Miro search function."
She added extra rectangular post-its as a way to classify data even more while filling in the template.
Using Miro as a presentation tool has been a great time saver preventing me from compromising the due attention on data analysis.
"Here below is an example of the structure I tested, for reference."
I hope my explorations in Miro will spark your curiosity over testing a wider range of digital tools in UX Research.
"If I could just figure out what's wrong with me, maybe I could fix it."
Life seems so much easier for everyone else; I must be doing it wrong.
"These harsh words were my inner voice, my unwelcome mantras, for decades."
If only my teachers had known that I couldn't claw my way to my full potential by sheer will alone.
"I win the school spelling bee in the fourth grade, out-spelling even the fifth graders."
"Already a book lover, I create a volunteer position for myself in my elementary school library."
"I don't know about the floods of estrogen and progesterone that course through me, creating havoc."
"I'm profoundly disorganized: my folders, my backpack, my locker, my bedroom all brim with chaos."
"My emotions feel like external events, fierce storms that descended upon me."
It will take decades to understand that it's possible to be two things at once: Sharp and scattered.
I pull my phone book from one of the piles and find a therapist with an office nearby.
"The hopelessness lifts, but life continues to feel like an uphill trudge."
"Like many women who are diagnosed later in life with ADHD, motherhood is the role that tips my life into utter unmanageability."
"Moms are the heartbeat of the household, the engine that powers the machine."
"With children, the love arrives out of nowhere, vast and inexplicable and fierce."
I can't seem to find no matter how hard I search.
Perhaps they lurk somewhere beneath the piles of dishes and dirty laundry.
"One afternoon while I'm giving my daughter a bath, I stumble on an article about women with ADHD."
"I possess nearly all the traits the author lists, from hypersensitivity to holiday overwhelm to career struggles."
"Overwhelm is the central, pulsing theme of my life, my constant companion."
"I've spent decades in therapy, yet I never progress enough to graduate."
The book I've been trying to write for 20 years that's still not quite finished.
I learn as much as I can - about the ties between ADHD and sensitivity.
"Stimulants, I discover, are the first course of treatment for many."
"And yet, I avoid trying them for several years because I worry they'll exacerbate my anxiety."
I come home from my first appointment with a prescription for Ritalin.
"I feel guilty, as if I've stuffed my pockets full of shortcuts."
I swallow half a pill and wait for my anxiety to spike.
I no longer get overstimulated and have panic attacks when I'm driving on the highway.
"I'm learning, like a child, to prioritize and organize."
"And yet, I can't help but mourn for all the lost years."
"I just wasn't trying hard enough, that I was lazy and unmotivated."
For all the time I spent thinking there was something wrong with me.
For all those years I believed I wasn't trying hard enough.
For all the conversations about my vaporous potential that should've instead been about dopamine receptors and executive function coaching.
I'm learning to reframe my inner voice: It wasn't your fault.
This experience allowed me to identify recurrent pitfalls and difficulties beginner game designers have.
"For Game Development, we can understand the entire process of developing a game, from coding to drawing."
"In contrast, Game Design is related to how do you play the game."
"This article, on the other hand, analyzes the common and repetitive problems while making games from a Game Design perspective."
"Still, due to their Game Design nature, these problems are inherently creative."
"For that, there are no perfect rules or strategies to overcome them."
"Without further ado, let us then dive into the Struggles of Making Games from a Game Design Perspective."
"Curiously, most of the teams starting to design games stumble and stutter while answering this question."
The game is going to be played by repeating this very mechanic until a specific goal is achieved.
Doing so should ease the technical burden and allow for the game design process to really start.
The game development and design process can and should always be adjusted according to the test and results.
"In most cases, you need to define an easy to implement mechanic."
"A creative process, such as Game Design, hardly succeeds entirely on the first try."
The main issue with this problem is not necessarily answering it but responding to it from a Game Design perspective.
"Often, game designers confuse this question as a Narrative Question: how does the story end."
"However, the story's finale does not answer how do you win the game."
"To be more precise, most designers think of this as the story's resolution or envisioning the game world's end state."
"For example, that the evil antagonist is defeated or that world peace is achieved."
"Thus, the answer to this question must be stated in terms of the game mechanic."
"If the evil antagonist must be defeated, the mechanic must enable this victory."
This is important because it allows the overview of a complete prototype: a prototype that can be played until the end condition.
"Only after achieving a complete prototype stage, the game can be truly tested."
"Surely, this amount can be changed later for progression or balancing matters, but you have to start with an actual value."
"Again, if the goal does not suit the game properly, you need to revisit the mechanic or change the goal."
Iterating over its elements is part of the process and can surely lead to better results.
"Arguably, this question does not suit every game, but it is still worth asking during the game development."
Another important aspect of this question is that it puts the game's mechanic under scrutiny.
"Responding to this inquiry, or even just brainstorming its answers, might show that the main mechanic is too simple or limited."
"Thus, answering this question must not only establish this point but raise awareness of its consequences."
"If you do not have an immediate answer to this question, first analyze its consequences and the effort involved."
Focus on the current game mechanics and how they enable different forms of progression.
"Additionally, difficulty can arise from interactions outside the game, such as having other human players involved."
Another common issue with beginner game designers and their games is a lack of clear division between random elements and strategy.
Consider how the player's options impact the game: are they too sensitive to random outcomes or easy to foresee?
"If the answer is hard to grasp by just brainstorming, then do more playtesting and analyze how the players behave."
"Even in games with limited options and a small set of mechanics, the player should make meaningful changes to the game state."
"On the contrary, the game is more of an interactive experience than a proper game."
"Not that the former is a bad medium, but it might not be your end goal."
"This is certainly the harshest question, but probably the most important one."
"Regardless of all its other qualities, games are likely to succeed mostly on their fun factor above all else."
"Yet, the game designer must continuously ask this question during the process."
Fun can be spotted in very odd places that were not initially thought of.
"Continuously ask this question while developing and testing the game, but do not let it shudder your efforts or demotivate you."
"Finding fun is hard, and it takes iterations and iterations until a solid base is created."
"Besides, people with different tastes, backgrounds, and skill-level will react differently to your game."
"You might not be able to appease everyone, but there might be a group of people that might really enjoy it."
"Furthermore, do not forget to have fun yourself with your game and while making it."
"Making a game is a reward on its own, and you can always move towards the next project."
"Moreover, once you manage to find the elements of fun, focus your effort on maximizing them."
"Use the game mechanics, economy, narrative, and aesthetics to strengthen the game."
"Making games is a thrilling experience, and it is easy to get passionate about it."
It is not a surprise that more and more people nowadays are moving towards making their own games and experiences.
"Although helpful, these questions are surely not enough to make a good game."
"In fact, and as stated before, there are no perfect strategies for achieving such a feat."
Making a game should be this blend between creating entertainment and art - not a recipe.
"And if you want to know more about me and my work, you can join me here."
"In 2016, California experienced one of the worst droughts in the history of the state."
Over 100 million trees died and billions of dollars in agriculture were lost.
Whoever holds the rights to the water in a certain location can pump it from the state's ground and reservoirs.
Districts with surplus water supply can sell their water rights to other districts in need.
"Landry, however, says that a people versus the market narrative is false."
"I don't think anyone wants people in our society to go without water, he says."
"Crucially, she wrote, the futures market won't disrupt protections already in place to ensure actual water trades are done responsibly."
California isn't the only state experiencing water scarcity that could end up trying this strategy to help with the issue.
But we should keep an eye on this going forward to make sure investors aren't taking advantage of the system.
"A few years ago, a close friend of mine and I applied for a managerial job."
We were successful through two rounds of interviews and had one final interview with the EVP.
"Ironically, I knew the hiring manager, having worked with her at my current job at the time."
As suspected - and theory later confirmed - my friend got the job instead.
My friend started the job and reported directly to my old co-worker.
The EVP observed that the manager did not have her team's best interest at heart.
"Unfortunately, there are many leaders and bosses in positions solely for their own benefit."
"If someone comes along to threaten their position of authority, they will do things to keep that person in their place."
It's not about the team's growth and development but about maintaining the status quo.
"You must have their best professional interests at heart - as much as, if not more - than you have your own."
It's easy to identify if your boss has your wellbeing and development at heart and doesn't see you as a threat.
"And if you are a leader, these are the things you should be doing to position your team and yourself for success."
"It may not be intentional, but it can show that you aren't top of mind."
Your ideas aren't a threat to their role but instrumental to the growth of all.
Nothing's worse than a boss who takes all the credit when he did not do the physical work.
"Yes, he would have managed, organized, and coach, but the team must execute."
Your manager should not hesitate to put his team up on a pedestal.
I once had a boss who would always say in meetings he's 'not falling on a sword for anyone.
"If you've been continually blamed by your boss, publicly and privately, they aren't trying to help you be better."
"One of my old managers would constantly push me to be part of challenging projects, way out of my comfort zone."
I feel it's helped me to this day with my research and analytical skills.
"When you're being challenged, especially in a place you enjoy, you rise to the occasion more often than not."
Managers and bosses help to expand the thinking of those in their charge.
I once got an opportunity to move to another team that I did not want.
One of my best team members was trying to break through for some time without success.
Me sticking around just because meant I was potentially blocking her progress.
Your boss should be training you or your team to one day replace her.
They won't limit your information or growth just so that they can stay comfortable.
Some bosses can also block you from moving away from them because you are valuable to them or the team.
"If you're not getting recommendations or approvals to apply for other roles, it's a problem."
"I'll send you actionable insights on Leadership, Growth, and, Personal Development."
What was nothing more than science fiction yesterday quickly becomes today's reality.
"Over the last two decades, the number of AI startups grew 14 times and the investment in AI startups grew 6 times."
With such a rise in the interest and continuous developments of AI have brought the industry to an absolutely new level.
Here is the list of the top 6 of the weirdest facts around AI and Robotics.
"For instance, in 2017 Saudi Arabia was the first nation that granted citizenship to a humanoid robot - Sophia."
"In 2017, robot tax is still of the most debatable subjects in the technology industry."
Bill Gates argue that robot tax could slow down the speed of automation allowing society to cope and adapt to the new reality.
"Apart from this argument, robot taxes can help prevent tax loopholes and create new jobs in green energy, healthcare and education."
"On another hand, there is an interesting and thought-provoking notion that argues against robot taxes."
"These points are not focused on the benefits of robots tax, but rather on the definition side."
For instance:What seems to be easy at the first sight is actually deeper and harder than you think.
It can cover almost all technology with automation elements like a vending machine or a tractor.
"Apart from the definition challenge, there is also an opinion that robot tax might damage the innovation spirit."
Some people claim that this additional tax might cause many companies to reduce their willingness to invest in the newest tech.
"No, I'm not talking about Pinterest personalized feed or eBay visual-based shopping."
Above is only one methodology that is designed to recreate the images people's brain is getting on the computer.
"Imagine that in as soon as in 5 years, pet-bots will be one of the most popular trends."
Pet-bots are just like the real pets but without need for 5 am morning walks and non-stop vacuuming.
"Some robotic pets are covered with sensors, which identify when they are being touched and behave accordingly."
Would you ever consider a dog-bot instead of a real one?
"But imagine, that from these 8 billion voice assistants, most AI is female."
"Siri, Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant or even listen to the AI-powered voice assistant of your health centre-"
"Reason?According to studies, both males and females are more attracted to a woman's voice."
Washington Post wanted AI to report the key happenings during this event in 2016.
"Based on the data from different sources, Heliograf was able to create new data and customize it according to user requests."
"They encompass such a rich, immersive experience that they have a deeper, long-lasting effect on our lives."
"I happen to have stumbled upon one of them: it's called GRIS, and it is magnificent."
"In today's difficult climate, here is how and why a video game can have such an impact on your mental state."
"Video games narratives are getting more and more complex and cinematographic, with POV shots, 360 camera, or complex character development."
"The true novelty of GRIS, besides its beautiful 2 dimensions watercolour visuals, is elsewhere."
"You're safe, all you have to do is explore and use your character capabilities to solve puzzles and find solutions."
"Instantly, by playing this game, you can take some distance and experience a more reflective, contemplative state."
"The pitch is simple: after a traumatic event, the main protagonist, a young woman, has lost her voice."
"She wakes up in the hand of a giant statue, which crumbles and leaves her to the ground."
"As you play the character of GRIS, you can only see the world in black and white in the beginning."
Many reviews expressed that GRIS is simply a story about overcoming grief and facing the different stages that go with it.
"Indeed, as the game progresses, many symbolic moments mark a change of attitude."
"One big feature in the game is that the more you advance, the more you unlock new colours."
"The world becomes red, then green, blue, symbolizing different stages the character goes through."
"As this unfolds, you gain new capabilities while collecting stars that unlock different paths."
All of these faculties help solve problems or unlock new levels in the game in some creative way.
But its strength can also propel you to higher levels if you use it properly.
"Yet words, dialogue, or text are absent - making you feel and think through powerful visual symbolism."
"At the same time, you can reflect on your own growth and set-backs."
"What makes it unique is the combination of stunning beauty, with an odyssey into the heart of a wounded soul."
During high school I was drawn to both the medical field and engineering.
"In general, I enjoyed math and science and figured both career paths would provide an exciting and fulfilling career."
I dilly-dallied through my freshman and sophomore years without the slightest doubt in my competency for engineering or medicine.
My hopes of becoming an engineer were crushed as I knew physics was fundamental to almost all fields of engineering.
This was the first time I'd ever felt incompetent and incapable of pursuing a dream.
I spent the remainder of high school intimidated by math and any science that utilized it heavily.
"Thankfully, my cowardice would eventually yield a very fruitful blessing - a peak into the world of data science."
"After the first week of statistics, I'd fallen in love with the subject."
I couldn't believe that this was actually a career - even more so a career that was in high demand.
"After reading that article and a few others, I was totally convinced that I wanted to become as data scientist."
"Regardless of my severe lack of confidence, I still tried my luck and applied for a few engineering majors."
I ultimately decided to start my freshman year of college as a finance major.
I spent so much time studying that I was able to test out of calculus 1 and 2 before freshman year started.
"My love for math was reborn and, most importantly, I overcame the first obstacle necessary to get into data science."
"All the world's a differential equation, and the men and women are merely variables. ―"
"Ben OrlinDuring my first semester as a finance student, I was unsatisfied."
"My dream of becoming a data scientist persisted, but I was still convinced that this was an infeasible option."
I was still afraid of math but knew I needed to study something pretty close to it.
"At the same time, I found finance interesting and didn't want to waste the courses I'd taken."
"I was fascinated by calculus, linear algebra and differential equations, and my grades were constantly improving."
"During the fall of my sophomore year, I began to pursue actuarial internships aggressively."
The majority of my efforts were unsuccessful as nearly every application was turned down or ignored.
"Finally, after 100 hopeless applications, I was finally granted an interview with a well-known insurance company."
It was for an entry level actuarial position and I was determined to be the best interviewee they had ever seen.
I then created visualizations and summaries of the model results and packaged everything up into a report.
"Regardless, I felt confident that this report would set me apart from the other candidates."
I hoped that my efforts would compensate for the fact that I hadn't taken any actuarial exams.
"Now, anyone with an actuarial background should not be surprised to know that the interview was a complete disaster."
"Towards the end of the interview, he asked if I had any questions for him."
"The first question that came to mind was, How do you use math in your work? ."
"Well, we aren't calculating any integrals if that's what you mean ."
"I could tell this man was not passionate about his work, so I wasn't disappointed about how poorly the interview went."
"This failure of an interview, while embarrassing, brought about a huge realization: I loved preparing for it."
I didn't care that my machine learning report was completely disregarded because I enjoyed the entire process of creating it.
"It was my first experience with data science, and I knew I was completely hooked."
"The following semester, I got over my fear of math and decided to make it my major."
"Math majors at my university are required to pick between applied math, pure math and statistics as a specialization."
"Of course, I chose statistics as my specialization and focused my course-load around data science applications."
We placed 2nd and were awarded Best Visualization for a set diagnostic plots that described our models results.
"Internships were, without a doubt, the primary reason I was able to land a data science job at 21."
"As many know, the process of getting an internship, let alone an interview, can be a grueling one."
"The end of my sophomore year was approaching, and I had already applied to hundreds of internships with no success."
"By the time the end of March arrived, I figured I was likely all out of luck."
I began gearing up to spend the summer working at a restaurant and continuing classes.
"Despite this, I decided this would be the last internship I applied to and submitted my application."
I received a call the next morning: I was the very last applicant they were going to grant an interview.
"This was the biggest professional opportunity I'd ever been given, and I knew it."
The one who falls and gets up is stronger than the one who never tried.
"Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the HeartMy initial impression of the interview was that it went horribly."
"Needless to say, I thought the interview was more of an embarrassment than my first."
After the interview they told me I'd receive a call within a week if they wanted to move forward.
"They had already made their decision, and they offered me the internship."
"Most importantly, this internship laid the foundation for the rest of my data science career."
"Below, I've listed some key takeaways that I believe are important for a successful data science career."
I hope you enjoyed learning about my very novel journey into data science and that you found this article insightful.
"It brings value to a breadth of domains and improves the way humans work, live, learn and play."
Users can operate intuitive systems in which a multitude of interconnected devices tick along and take up very little of their attention.
"Fields such as manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture and logistics stand to benefit from this increasingly autonomous technology."
This is the futuristic vision outlined in a paper produced in 2018 by a team of researchers at the University of St.
"We want to combine technologies from the Web architecture field with a domain called multiagent systems, he says."
How can one device broadcast its capabilities in a way that can be understood by other devices?
And how can this device be matched automatically with the requirements of other services?
"Maybe the system knows about their health state, or about their agenda today."
"Ciortea describes how, in 1956, academics gathered at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire to discuss ideas around thinking machines."
Us computer scientists have obviously lost the battle of who creates the definitions around here.
"We have seen computer science enter many, many fields, over the last twenty years, says Dr. Mayer."
"What's more, the greater the number of devices collaborating with one another, the greater the challenge of intelligibility."
Managing these challenges requires extensive work in making sure there exists sufficient transparency and regulation around such technologies.
"Gallen's research can play in helping transform healthcare, manufacturing and agriculture for the better."
He's especially thrilled about what it will mean to achieve such feats and put them on show.
"Already in the past, my team has been demonstrating such systems for a handful of participating devices."
"It will be glorious, and it will be an excellent showcase of what we are doing."
"For more materials and updates regarding the IntellIoT project, subscribe to our newsletter."
But take comfort in the fact that you're not the only one.
Now this isn't an extensive overview of all the ramifications of emotional eating and why it's bad.
Over time the repeated stress response this triggers creates a neural pathway.
Think of it as a gift from one emotional eater to another.
Think about getting a mindless task like folding laundry out of the way.
Engaging in this type of activity will distract you and give you the space you need to regroup.
This suggestion works well and complements the idea of keeping your hands busy.
"I've used crochet, knitting, and collage and art journaling as creative outlets to both distract myself and process my emotions."
"Instead, find a quite space to close your eyes for 20 minutes and see how you feel."
"While this is true in theory, you need to actively step back and focus on taking deep, belly filling breaths."
Andrew Weil teaches the 4-7-8 breathing technique that I have used for years and find very helpful.
"Inhale for 4 counts, hold your breath for 7 counts and then breathe out for 8 counts."
Mindfulness may be trendy right now but it's not without good reason.
"The concept is that you simply observe, without judgment, what's going on in the present moment."
"Maybe you notice the beating of your heart, or a bird singing outside."
Step back from hunger pangs and ask yourself if you're really just bored and need something to distract you.
In my mind there's nothing better than spending 15-20 minutes searching giphy.com for fun memes and videos.
"It can also boost your mood, inspire your confidence, or make you simply feel like a million bucks."
Start a new playlist filled with your favourite tunes that you turn to when you're searching for a snack.
"Maybe its filled with guilty pleasure songs, or cherished favourites that make you feel like a million bucks."
If you made that Spotify playlist this suggestion is even easier to put into action - crank it and dance.
"As with dancing, taking a walk gets you moving and benefits both your body and brain at the same time."
The best part is that you don't have to go outside either.
"If you have a home with more space, try pacing in your kitchen or living room."
"Easy to care for varieties include snake plants, succulents, Peace Lilies, and pathos."
"I'll also spend time organizing my photo albums on my phone, favouriting new snap shots and watching videos from the past."
"If you want more than a distraction from your desire to eat a package of Oreos, this is the method for you."
Allow whatever it is that you're feeling to rise to the surface and approach it without judgment.
Picture yourself as an objective observer whose curious and wants to explore where these feelings in more depth.
"Some SlackMaybe its anger over how a meeting with your boss went, or frustration with your kid's picky eating style."
Remove yourself from your kitchen and find a safe comfortable spot to sit and be with your feelings.
Head to the closest bathroom and take one minute to wash your hands under warm water.
Whatever you choose remember to practice self-compassion and cut yourself some slack.
Especially the men - we're a sensitive bunch in this city.
It's difficult to not run into at least one douchebag per day in Los Angeles.
There are old money douchebags in places like Santa Monica and Hancock Park.
There are new money douchebags in places such as Hollywood and Downtown.
"These people live in another world, oblivious to the fact that they're pure, unadulterated douchebags."
The media deserves a considerable share of the blame for this dynamic.
Anybody who has followed the stock market for more than a minute saw the writing on the wall.
"They orchestrated what amounts to a classic pump and dump, even if, again, they did so unknowingly."
"Here's how the Securities and Exchange Commission defines a pump and dump:If you can read, you see the point."
"Maybe not a classic penny stock pump and dump, but a pump and dump nevertheless."
I feel a lot of something for the people I think Jessica was writing about in her article.
"People who are desperate, observed the hype, believed it, and somehow thought money was falling from trees."
Can you blame a person looking for a way out of their financial problems?
"The words we use and stories we tell, especially around volatile events driven by emotion and spectacle, have power."
"They can cause desperate people to do desperate things, making their already precarious situations even more insecure."
"But such large quantities of collisions, coupled with complex detectors, generate a lot of data."
"Therefore, a lot of data has to be thrown out in real-time before any analysis of it even becomes feasible."
All cognition can be viewed as a trade-off between information gain and metabolic expenditure.
These low-level filters trigger which events are recorded and which events are discarded before spending too much energy on them.
The LHC lays out nicely how attention determines where limited resources should best be spent in a complex environment.
Top-down mechanisms try to implement our high-level goals by guiding our attention.
An interesting to note is that much of this is mostly done through inhibition rather than activation.
"More generally, getting distracted and losing focus can be seen from the perspective of goal interference."
"Attention is, as most things in the brain, regulated dynamically, and as such is prone to interference."
"Staying focused is an active process, filtering information and ignoring the irrelevant is an active process, taking time and energy."
"Goals compete, and attentional resources are always in direct competitioin with each other."
"After enough information is gathered, attention also guides our memories to decide what is worth storing and remembering in future situations."
"In modern high-tech society, we are constantly bombarded by attention grabs."
This includes information gathering across several sensor modalities and the implementation of high level goals via cognitive control.
It's not entirely clear how to get from this perspective on attention to useful ideas in artificial intelligence.
"Attention Is All You Need becoming one of the most influential in the field, and being cited over 16000 times."
The input and output of the model are therefore composed of sequences.
"This operation is computed between the input vectors of the sequence, and can be used when generating output sequences."
Over the years I've seen many approaches for working out product focus.
"Some are relatively simple, like OKRs; others are quite convoluted."
So I came up with my own model for defining product focus.
"Would they articulate a clear purpose and advantage, or would they struggle to explain it?"
Would they believe strongly in your product or would their convictions be weakly held?
"Here's a list from Inc.com, one from The Balance, and one from My Corporation."
"To me, they serve the same purpose and are thus regarded as the same thing."
"Some people split hairs over them, but I find that distinction arbitrary and confusing."
For this framework though I want to concentrate on a product vision .
How often do you read them and apply them to your daily work?
"A simple, straightforward vision statement is easy to get behind and support, for both staff and customers alike."
It's easy for a customer to see how they directly benefit from your company and your product.
But I want you think of the E in a slightly different way.
I want you to imagine that the E stands for Execution; so CEO stands for Chief Execution Officer.
I mention this because I want to get you in the mindset of thinking how will we execute to fulfill our vision?
The guiding policy is just like step 3: what is the next target condition that you seek to achieve?
And the set of actions is just like step 4: gradually moving towards the target condition through daily action.
And finally each policy may branch out to a small number of actions.
Indeed Rumelt points out that too many simultaneous activities tends to induce poor focus and can easily lead to our strategy failing altogether.
One thing you'll notice about strategy is that it doesn't focus on target revenues as a prime directive.
Instead it focuses on tangible things that we can actually do; the revenue numbers follow as a consequence of our actions.
And it also contains a who : just who is the customer that this strategy is designed for?
"It's important to identify who experiences the pain most acutely, and target our strategy so that those people can succeed."
"Outcomes over Output is very fashionable at the moment, so let's see what that means."
"If I sell cameras, my customer's outcome is to take great pictures."
"If I sell guitars, my customer's outcome is to make great music."
Outcomes are easy to understand if you put yourself in your customers shoes: what am I trying to achieve today?
"As you can imagine, for this outcome layer we return to the customer's point of view."
"But the main message of this layer is to focus on goals that are most important to the customer, and prioritize those."
You might be wondering how outcomes tie in with the strategy that we devised in the previous layer.
Gibson Biddle said that only about half of Netflix's ideas turned out to be useful.
So this final layer is treated as a series of experiments rather than a plan set in stone.
This will allow us to try different things to pivot and adjust as needed in order to navigate towards our goal.
"Hence we treat it as a falsifiable experiment; we do the work, evaluate it, and then decide how to proceed."
"We cannot know everything upfront to get it right the first time round, on every piece of work we do."
The Experiments contain the individual features or services that we want to try to build.
"I'm never bored, and because it's a fixed price I never have to worry about the cost."
"Each time we adapt and improve, we also need to widely publish the updates."
"There are a few things we didn't cover, but are worth considering."
Obviously Awesome by April Dunford; in it you will find many elements that speak directly to the Strategy elements above.
"In fact, I recommend following her product positioning steps as part of your strategy discussions."
We haven't talked about how to measure the impact or success of your project within the four layers above.
I've previously written about avoiding Agile Success Theatre in favor of metrics that actually measure business outcomes.
It has become fashionable to phrase features or outcomes a hypothesis statement.
X then it will increase our customer retention by Y%; we will know this by seeing metric Z change by W amount.
"Since we are already dealing with Experiments, it becomes natural to phrase each one as a hypothesis to be proven or disproven."
It's a good practice to get your mind in the headspace of identifying risk and verifying your initial hunch.
So this means we are not actually creating the value that we think we are.
"Or maybe we treat the vision with skepticism, as in management espouse one ethos but tell us to build something quite different."
"You can see that the overall structure contains a considerable amount of detail, especially the Strategy layer."
And you can see that it takes considerable work and iteration to get all these layers meshed and supporting each other well.
Some of these companies are seeking to go public via SPAC merger.
One of the most recent to throw their hat in the ring is an Israeli manufacturer of EV components.
"REE describes themselves as:Based out of Tel Aviv, Ree was founded in 2013 and currently has around 100 employees."
"In particular, their Reeboard is set up in a way that the chassis of the vehicle looks like a skateboard."
It will also place the valuation of the company at $3.1 billion.
"In other words, once they get their feet under them, they expect to be sprinting."
"The VCVC SPAC is sponsored by investment firm 10X Capital's head, Hans Thomas."
"Since the news of the collaboration, VCVC stock has jumped, currently sitting at $14.95 per share."
"Investors will likely need to view this with a long-term eye, as the company is currently projecting profitability by 2024."
"However, with the way they expect to grow post-merger, their balance sheet could buff up quickly."
They have truly laid their cards on the table and are betting that they have a bright future.
The opinions expressed in this article are intended for general entertainment purposes only.
Individual investors are responsible for their own money and investment decisions and should always do their own due diligence before investing.
"At first there had been denial, then a soul-crushing sadness."
"She thought she'd gotten to the acceptance stage, but no."
"Today, she was stuck on anger and bitterness at the unfairness of it all."
Ashley packed up the golf clubs and reinforced the box with packing tape before slapping the mailing label on the side.
They were PINGs and the leather bag was signed by Rory McIlroy.
She wrestled the heavy package to her porch next to the pile due to be picked up for delivery.
She wasn't paying the extra charge for an at-home pick-up.
Having to lug everything to a drop-off location wasn't worth the hassle.
"Just in time, she thought, watching the big, brown truck lurch into her driveway."
"She walked back in the house, not wanting to waste time making small talk."
She slid the back of her wrist across her sweaty forehead and took a long drink from her water bottle.
"When she heard the squeal of the wheel axles, she went back outside and heaved open the garage door."
"She pulled out the weight bench, but left the weights stacked inside."
Ashley glanced down at her clipboard and checked a few more things off her list.
It was only 9:30 and already several cars were parking along the road.
"Ashley called out to her, All I have is men's clothing."
"I'm looking for my grandson, the lady said, picking up a pair of cowboy boots."
"As for any of the clothing, feel free to take whatever you want."
"The woman's eyes widened, and she nodded to the clothes rack."
"She wanted to believe it was out of kindness, but in truth, she just wanted the clothes gone."
She'd been pleasantly surprised how much the big-ticket items went for on Craig's List and eBay.
Rob always told her she didn't appreciate the value of things.
It was enough to treat herself to a vacation and a few other luxuries she'd been denying herself.
"By noon, most of the items for sale had been wiped out."
"On a lark, this morning, she'd announced on FaceBook she was conducting an everything-must-go sale."
"Then she listed several teasers like the Ray-Ban sunglasses, the meat smoker, and the drone."
Her skin prickled when she heard the distinctive rumbling of a V8 engine.
Her heart slammed against her chest when a blue metallic Camaro roared up the drive and screeched to a stop.
Here we go!Rob jumped out of the car and slammed the door.
Rob brought his hands up to his ears as if putting his skull in a vice.
I told you I wanted your stuff out of here months ago.
His mouth was opening and closing like a fish out of water.
"Ashley reached for her cigarettes on a nearby table and lit one, knowing he loathed the habit."
She held up a hand when it seemed he was about to speak.
"It's not my fault you're a lying, cheating dirtbag."
You were kicked out because you couldn't resist that little tramp from your office.
Did she trip over her high heels and fall on your dick?
"There's a few T-shirts left, and a couple ball caps."
"I don't believe this, he muttered, clenching and unclenching his fists."
I want every penny back that I gave you each month to pay the house payment for two years!
"That still won't cover the value of everything I deserve, but it'll be a good start, he growled."
Ashley blew a cloud of smoke in his face and shook her head.
"But while I'm here, I'll take the engagement ring back."
"According to the lawyer I am dating now, that makes it a gift -"
He bent over and supported himself by putting his hands on his knees.
"Ya know, the one you always said you were out with when you were actually with her?"
I found that wad of cash you stashed in your helmet bag.
"She made a tsk-tsk sound and started up the sidewalk, toward her front door."
"When she reached the porch, she yelled, Remember how you always put me down?"
"She stepped inside and spun around, watching him run towards her."
The peace I've found since you've been gone makes me ecstatic.
It was about an American who had to have surgery just before flying to Paris for a week.
His doctor cleared him to travel but he wasn't allowed to carry anything.
You entertain yourself with people watching feeling a bit smug with how unencumbered you are.
There is no pulling out your phone trying to capture the perfect shot.
"You are fully in the moment, accepting what comes your way without striving to create the experience you imagined."
You walk through some shops truly just browsing for the first time in your life.
You can't purchase anything unless it can be consumed on the spot or worn on your body.
You don't buy any souvenirs or gifts for people back home.
Pretty quickly you stop even looking in shops unless they sell food and you are hungry.
There is no temptation to slip back into the comforting routines and people of home because there is no way to do so.
"You disrobe, washing your underwear in the sink and drape it on the radiator to dry overnight."
"In the morning, you put on your clothes from the night before and head out for a new and completely unencumbered adventure."
The man in the article had some pretty serious restrictions from his doctor.
"If we did this trip, we'd be free to decide what guidelines we were going to place on ourselves."
Here are the areas you will need to think seriously about before setting off on this trip.
If you decide to go completely phone-free it will be a very different experience.
The advantages of no phone are a completely novel experience of living in the moment.
You won't be spending any time looking up restaurant reviews or weighing your various options.
You also won't be able to communicate with anyone not in your immediate vicinity.
If you get stuck or lost you will be relying on the kindness of strangers to help you out.
It also offers you the ability to document the experience through photos and note taking.
Only you know yourself what kind of trip you are aiming for.
Going with or without a smartphone is going to vastly change the experience.
"How hardcore you are going to be about clothing depends on your budget, your location, and your tolerance levels."
"If I recall correctly, the man in my original story wasn't even able to carry new clothing purchased at a shop."
"Instead, he washed out his underwear each evening and aired out the rest of his clothes."
"What about necessary hygiene products such as toothpaste, a toothbrush and deodorant?"
A nicer hotel might supply these products gratis but you may need to purchase them.
Are you going to allow yourself to purchase clothes to wear while on the trip?
Do you want to buy a few necessities to use during your trip and then leave them behind?
Maybe you want to stuff an extra pair of undies and a toothbrush in your jacket pocket before you leave home.
Obviously how long of a trip you are taking will determine how important of an issue this is going to be for you.
Do you want to ease yourself into this experiment and choose a place you have visited before?
A weekend getaway will be much easier than traveling for a week or more.
All these choices will contribute greatly to the difficulty level of your challenge.
Or are you a more cautious type who wants to stretch yourself just enough but not so far you can't enjoy it.
Will you allow yourself to fly home with a shopping bag of clothes and other items acquired during the trip.?
Or maybe pay the postage to mail yourself the perfect item you found at the bazaar?
A companion will give you someone to process the experience with as you are living it.
"On the other hand, maybe baggage free for you means considering only your own needs and desires."
If you choose to travel with a partner it is probably best if you are both all in on the no baggage plan.
I've been thinking through the details of a baggage-free trip for years now but have never done it.
"Whenever I have had time available, I've taken that time with my spouse."
I hope you do and come back to tell us all the story of how it worked out for you.
"My awakening begins in the office of my beloved therapist, Rachel."
"She never pushed antidepressants on me either, at least not successfully."
I kind of regret that I didn't open up more to Rachel in our sessions.
"Anyway, I always told myself I was working up to talk about them."
"That makes me sad, I responded once, leading to a long discussion about tempering one's expectations."
"She's a friend of mine and you'll love her, Rachel says."
Rachel tries to get me to call right there from her office.
"I refuse, saying I forgot my cell phone, which contains my very busy calendar."
I hope Rachel can't detect my iPhone's faint outline in my hoodie pocket.
"She focuses on one of her favorite topics, the inner and outer worlds we live in."
"Remember, she says, the inner is the thoughts and feelings and perceptions that make up your own personal reality,"
"The two are connected, and each one can affect the other, right?I nod."
Like if you got hit by a bus on the way home.
How about something a little more plausible and grounded in reality?I think some more.
"Or, she says, you could make sure you have your shit together."
You need to get stronger to endure the difficult world we live in.
I can see she's right about the connection between what happens in my head and in the outside world.
"But I must admit, the answers I gave about how this works are far more interesting."
"As my session winds down, Rachel hands me a book of inspirational quotes."
I find a good one from Einstein: The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination.
"But, screw it, at the last second I substitute it with something even better."
"I lean forward and say, It's by Pablo Picasso. '"
"Listen, I admire your creative mind, she says, but I can think of much more appropriate quotes."
"Maybe for discussion with your new therapist, you can find one about perseverance through difficult times."
"She stands, and I leap to my feet and hug her before she can stop me."
"I know therapists aren't supposed to get emotionally attached to their patients, especially the suicidal ones."
"She squeezes my back gently, which is more than I expected."
"You've really helped me, I tell her as she steps back."
"I am sure this remark will make her smile, even if we both know it is an exaggeration."
"I remove the paper from my pocket and a pen from my purse and,"
"I especially love how science, over the years, has exposed the greatest untruths of our existence."
That time and space and everything we see before us are real.
"Just then a rotten smell reaches my nose, and I assume it comes from the overflowing garbage container to my left."
The supposed garbage container I can smell and see and even touch if I choose to get closer.
"Scientists agree our eyes don't actually see any of the things we think we see, because none of them exist."
So our minds instead create icons like birds and trees and rocks and the homeless guy down the street.
My brain and eyes and nose and fingers all want to keep me safe.
And is it connected to the mysterious dark energy that scientists say is the dominant type of matter in our universe?
"Which is better, even if much of what I feel is a dull pain rising through the concrete and into me."
"These dandelions, I sense, have deep roots and screw-you grins and kind souls."
"I smile at this thought, and then something even stranger happens."
"The dandelions start moving, their straight stems swaying like tall trees in a storm."
"Just a late-day calm, a sticky heat crying for any breeze."
"I cup my hand around the dandelions, the way you would protect a match from the wind."
I begin sensing a larger and gently loving natural world that is aware of my presence.
So I take it in like you would a hard kiss or comforting embrace.
"It whispers, Your gracious soul needs to understand that humanity is a blight and family is a blight."
"Then it says, It's not safe sitting here so long after sunset."
I open my eyes to see that darkness has fallen like a huge eyelid dropping over the earth.
The busy street has gone ghostly quiet except for the occasional passing car or groups of noisy people lurching home from a bar.
"No one has checked to see if I am okay, and no one will."
You need to stop to eat and pee at the all-night McDonald's on the right.
Don't make eye contact with that shirtless man standing on the corner.
"More than that, I have become part of a far truer world that most people have been conditioned not to see."
I go inside and stand in the middle of a whacked-out Friday night gathering that smells like cheap wine and puke.
"I should be mad at my parents, but I am not."
"Because I do see that, like most other people, they are a weight on everything good and authentic in this world."
"I remember the mortgage crisis where reports came out that the government was supporting different groups, banks, etc."
"Yes, a correction that showed that we had a lot of zombie companies in the market."
It keeps going out to banks and lenders to borrow more money so they can pay off one credit line with the next.
"If you look around, there are some people who I call financial zombies ."
"They started with a few simple purchases using their credit card, often while still in college."
"At some point, they reached the limit on the card and the monthly payments kept rising."
"At the same time, they get one offer after another for new cards."
"Naturally, they realize that they could get money from one card to pay the other."
"When stocks suddenly collapsed, the FED stepped in and provided massive amounts of funding."
"Most people didn't even take notice, but that was the start of the current debt and money printing spike."
I believe we have given up trying to understand what a Trillion really is.
So a Trillion is 1 million Million - crazy to even imagine.
"It's not that well known, but other countries are actually holding our debt."
The two countries that hold the biggest amounts of our debt are China and Japan.
"Whenever the United States wants to borrow money, it issues bonds."
Bonds are papers that promise to repay the money that we are borrowing plus interest.
Other countries take the paper and secure the money we want to borrow.
"On the bonds, it is written that we promise to pay back what we owe."
That's just a fraction of the value that everybody in the United States produces as value.
"The world saw us as trusted and respected as the global superpower, the moral police of the world, etc."
There are suggestions by the leaders in the US government not to pay the debt we owe in the bonds we issued.
How is it that a nation can print money with no value or services against it?
Most international transactions happen in Dollars or calculated and transferred into Dollars.
"What happens when we lose that status as the reserve currency?Yes, the trust is lost."
"I don't think it will be hyper-inflation, but a lot nonetheless."
"Humble hotel clerks from Switzerland, stenographers from Holland would put up in the deluxe suites of the Ringstrasse hotels."
The tidings of cheap living and cheap goods in Austria spread far and wide; greedy visitors came from Sweden or from France.
The stock market typically collapses when the economy struggles and inflation is high.
That's just because the cost of everything has gone up with inflation and keeps going up.
"For you, as the investor, this means that you can pay down your mortgages quicker."
The paper the money is printed on is losing value by the day.
"If opportunities like the one described about Austria in the 1920s occurred, you want to take advantage."
A small amount will be worth a fortune in times of high inflation.
Imagine you only had to have 1 gold coin in your pocket and could pay for a ton of stuff easily.
Step 3You do not want to own anything that is considered a long-term fixed-income investment.
"Get rid of long-term fixed-income investments, if you have any."
I can't imagine that anybody still has any adjustable-rate mortgages when we currently have historically low interest rates.
"However, if you do have any adjustable-rate debt, convert it into long-term debt."
What we often forget is that credit cards are adjustable-rate and high interest.
"If you have any equity in any of your assets, convert your credit card debt into mortgage debt."
That rule says that you should always take 5% of your rental income and put it into savings for vacancy.
"The last 5% is for CAPEX, major repairs that will increase the value of your property."
"We should convert the rest into gold so the value increases with inflation, maybe even more."
Just be aware that it might be harder than today to convert that back into cash.
"If you follow these steps now, it will better prepare you for the coming financial crisis."
"The information provided above is based on my personal experience, planning, and opinion."
"In her capacity as an Art Advisor, Chelsea acts as a natural catalyst between the collector and Gallery."
Remaining a trusted source to both galleries and collectors alike is essential business strategy for CRAA.
Upholding genuine relationships give Chelsea the insider edge that her clients need to protect their investment and uphold the value in each piece.
"Running until January 16th, the inaugural show focuses on Angelenos that Rana is drawn to in a cultivating artist."
Rana seeks out artists who create new techniques or builds upon the existing.
Her ability to recognize innovation is due only to her in depth of knowledge in the Masters.
It will be only the first non post war avant-garde Japanese shows held in the 2003 brand gallery.
"Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more."
I developed my passion for art long before I was fortunate to get my start working in galleries.
The most impactful advice that I've received is that there is no need to rush into things.
"By taking the time to be truly thoughtful before acting, I will always be happy with the end result."
"In today's parlance, being disruptive is usually a positive adjective."
"When do we say the converse, that a system or structure has 'withstood the test of time'?"
"With that being said, disruption can be negative when done thoughtlessly."
I also have a few more projects with MAKI Gallery in the works.
Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?
As developers we often want to reduce the scope for error by establishing patterns in our work.
"This comes in the form of reusable objects and functions, as well as processes like client questionnaires and launch checklists."
"But often, we developers can take the idea of standardization a little too far."
It's appealing to use templates to achieve our goals more quickly and earn a greater profit from the work.
"Let me tell you how I've come to this conclusion, then share what I do instead."
I've been a web developer for 15 years but I set up my current business three years ago.
This way I could retain fine-grained control of the front-end and use WP to handle the data.
This has enabled me to find innovative ways to deliver websites for my clients quickly.
Out of this process came the idea of the Russian Doll Principle.
"It's quicker for you, and it's cheaper for the customer."
"What I began to notice when developing websites in this way, was that my page designs were missing something."
"For example, a heading, a paragraph, a list of blog posts and then a form."
"From a web developer's perspective, it doesn't get much more elegant than this."
"In writing, this would be akin placing several paragraphs of text on a page without linking one to the next."
"In visual design, the user senses something is missing: a unifying theme that helps it all make sense."
"For me, this lack of cohesion in the page design negates any time or money saved."
It doesn't matter how elegant the delivery process is if the end result is lacking.
"As you've now seen, I am a big advocate of repeatability."
"But as you've also seen, I believe you can go too deep."
"This is what I did, and now I'm climbing back up out of the hole."
"But every time you use templates or reusable blocks, you're not really designing."
"Ironically, I used to be furiously against templating of any kind."
"I sensed that somewhere in that process, creativity would be lost."
"Standardization enables you to think in systems, logically, where customization empowers your creativity."
"The challenge, of course, is finding a balance between the two."

OneZero's General Intelligence is a roundup of the most important artificial intelligence and facial recognition news of the week.
Modern artificial intelligence relies on algorithms processing millions of examples or images or text.
"Meanwhile, these companies earn tens of millions of dollars in revenue per year."
"We suggest viewing AI development as a path forward for economic development, they write."
Then we'll get all of the followers of those 450 accounts.
"To save time, for accounts with more than 5,000 followers, I will only scrape the first 5,000 of their followers."
"If you don't have these already, you will need to go to and create an app ."
"After you create an app, go to Keys and Tokens to get your tokens."
"With Tweepy, we can use these credentials to connect to the Twitter API and begin downloading data."
The following code just uses the credentials entered above to connect to the API.
Since we are going to be downloading pretty big datasets it is important to specify some parameters when we initialize the API.
"By setting these parameters to True, we won't break the connection to the API when we hit these limits."
"Instead, we'll just wait until the timeout ends and we can continue downloading data."
"To start the data download, we will get all of the followers from an individual user."
"To get this, you need the user ID of the user."
You can get the user ID of a user if you know their screen name using the code below.
"For this network, we will use individual user accounts as nodes and followers as links."
"Our goal, therefore, is to create an edge DataFrame of user IDs with two columns: source and target."
"To start, we want to list all of my followers as targets."
The screenshot above shows the structure of the DataFrame we want to create.
Now that we have a list of all the followers we can put them into a DataFrame.
"To visualize this simple network, we can use the NetworkX package to convert the DataFrame into a graph or network."
What we really want is to get all of the followers of these 450 users.
This is the code that will take a very long time to run because of the rate limits.
This code is very similar to the code above in that it gets all the followers of a given user ID.
"The major difference is that instead of feeding in just one account, we are looping through all 450 accounts that follow me."
"Another difference is that if an account has more than 5000 followers, we only take the first 5000 followers."
"Because of the rate limits, I left this running overnight to get all the data."
"It makes 15 API requests, then has to wait for 15 minutes, then makes another 15 requests, and so on."
"Once this is done running, you should have a csv with all of the edges of the network."
I wrote this all to a csv just so that if it breaks while running I still have all the edges already scraped.
"There are 716, 653 nodes in my network!We can also find the most influential nodes in the network using centrality measures."
"The most simple measure of centrality is Degree Centrality, which is just a function of the number of connections each node has."
The following code finds the number of connections each node has i.e. the degree of each node and sorts them in descending order.
The node in my network with the highest degree is node 37728789 or @
But this means there are 39 additional connections - meaning TheSolarCo follows 39 accounts that follow me.
"For the rest of this tutorial, we will filter the network down to a more manageable number of nodes."
"NetworkX. The k_core function filters out nodes with degree less than a given number, k."
We start by splitting the graph into groups using a community detection algorithm.
We need to run the degree centrality code again now that our network is smaller.
"Now that we have the nodes split into groups and the degree of each node, we combine these into one DataFrame."
You should be able to easily install it for free from their website.
It's pretty easy to get started and allows for some really beautiful visualizations.
"If you have never used Gephi, here is a good tutorial to get started from Luca Hammer."
"To use Gephi, first you need to export the node list and the edge list as csv files."
You can follow the Gephi tutorial I mentioned above to import these files into Gephi and start visualizing your network.
"Hopefully, you were able to follow along without too many issues."
OutKast's Spottieottiedopaliscious hummed in the back of my mind as I floated in and out of rooms.
Clubhouse is a petri dish on how Black personhood adapts to living and loving within a technologically evolving white supremacist society.
"Science-fiction, and predictions of technology into the future, do not consider Blackness."
"Yet here we are, writing ourselves into the source code of an app white people are staking their fortunes and reputations into."
"Saturday, January 30th, 202121 Savage was the first person to pop up in my People to Follow feed."
"As a former educator, I'd often sing Bank Account with my students."
"I've been happily married for nearly a decade, so I had nothing to contribute."
I could have done less with the men in the Baby Momma room saying the word female though.
"Monday, February 1st, 2021Leave it to Elon Musk to steal the thunder from the first day of Black History Month."
The habit of conversations about the future of Blackness is that they tend to be speculative rather than historical.
The New York Times reported years ago of the discrimination rampant in his Tesla plants.
"For men like Musk, being on the right side of history meant focusing on the bottom line."
But I also know that he'd rather not deal with all of it on Mars.
"After an hour of waiting and not being called upon, I went to a room called Trust is Very Delicate."
"In the short time I was present, he did not speak."
"Tuesday, February 2nd, 2021I had a long day of work meetings that bled into the evening."
I whipped up a quick meal for my family and bounced quickly between two rooms: GAIN 200+ FOLLOWERS.
"Here I was, searching for community when I should have been paying attention to celebrity."
I'm sayin' this in my best Baltimore accent - STOOPID!
Y'all must be stupid as hell to think that diamond is worth $24 mil.
Only time I'm buying diamonds is if I'm worth at least $2 billion.
"It was classic Black barbershop talk, among the most consistent communal experiences of Black men."
I was curious because I found myself not being to help myself in following 21 in whatever rooms he chose to visit.
It is by their hand that poverty and incarceration visits my people so frequently.
"HITS ONLY, where various Clubhouse members played their tracks for music executive moderators."
The conversation now was a heated talk on pescatarians and how hard it was for Black people to adhere to the diet.
"So did the Cajun rice before they took it off the menu, an act that feels like a hate crime."
The room was moderated both by men and women debating if Black men could do more to close the pay gap.
Do white people in corporate American force Black men and women to compete with each other?
By this time I had screwed up the cod; too salty.
"I unmuted my mic and as I put the cod to the side, spoke into the community and said my piece."
The problem here is that the men in the room are not mentioning their privilege.
One of the ladies in here earlier mentioned intersectionality as a framework for understanding oppression and disparities.
"We are all in this together, and we have to listen to Black women."
But I never really recognised my problem until I got knocked off my bike two years ago.
I had 15 staples in my head and was hospitalised for three days.
I first tried magic mushrooms with a couple of friends eight years ago.
After reading that book I decided to start foraging for mushrooms myself.
"From my own experience, it does have a positive effect on anxiety."
But for me nothing beats the romance of picking my own medication.
Six were given a placebo drug and the rest 30 milligrams of pure psilocybin.
The volunteers in the psilocybin condition widely reported positive experiences - repeatedly described as a 'sense of unity'.
"Back as an undergraduate student, I took great pride in getting by with only five or six hours of sleep per night."
Some of these practices have stayed with me up to this day.
"However, while reading Matthew Walker's Why We Sleep, that attitude of getting more done by sacrificing sleep was quickly vanishing."
"In brief, insufficient sleep is a perfect recipe for a shortened, lower-quality life."
"Sleep is governed by a variety of biological and chemical factors, the onset of which is determined by the release of melatonin."
"Once asleep, adenosine levels rapidly decline, resembling the discharge of a capacitor."
"However, these tasks are well beyond the scope of this article."

AngelList announced a new way to raise capital: the rolling fund.¹The core idea is simple.
"Similar to how SAFEs brought high-resolution fundraising to startups, Rolling Venture Funds brings high-resolution fundraising to venture funds."
"With a Rolling Venture Fund, fund managers can now accept new capital in the form of auto-renewing quarterly commitments."
SAFEs were arguably the most important structural innovation in venture in the 2010s.
Will rolling funds similarly live up to that comparison and be the transformative structure for venture in the 2020s?
"Fund managers define their closing conditions, like the minimum investment size."
The way this is legally handled is not by a rolling close but a vast proliferation of entities.
"In other words, each quarter, AngelList creates a new limited partnership to manage that quarter's commitments."
"To deal with this, AngelList leveraged its experience with syndicates and funds to create a back office for rolling fund managers."
"They even have staff to, for example, provide common side letters."
"By having commitments on a quarterly basis, rolling funds introduce an unprecedented amount of flexibility to VC."
"Because each fund closes quarterly, new fund managers can start small and build momentum."
AngelList is perhaps the perfect firm to have invented rolling funds because they also commoditized the syndicate.⁶
Who will this affect most?Let's talk about which slices of VC will be most dramatically affected by rolling funds.
"The first is micro-VC, which is defined as early-stage VC funds with less than $50m."
"In exchange for all that pain, you get what, $10 million after a year plus of fundraising?"
Plus a business structure designed for funds with much larger capital bases?
"With a rolling fund you can get just as much money, albeit with less certainty for the life of the fund."
It makes way more sense at that dollar amount to just take the money as you get it and invest.
"And lastly, you have scout funds, which rolling funds will largely replace."
"That said, rolling funds come with a downside: a longer-term misalignment on follow-on rounds."
This will create tensions between rolling GPs and their LPs and affect their ultimate returns.
"During that time, investors need to measure and meaningfully compare the returns to other assets."
"Once you move past the invest in good companies part, it's by doubling down on your winners.¹⁰"
"Instead of quarterly, you may eventually see rolling funds raising for a year at a time."
There are other issues with the rolling fund dynamic that make it difficult to double down.
Good firms not only take their pro rata but are able to get over-allocations at the expense of other investors.
"But for rolling fund managers who want to make it big, they will need to secure follow on capital."
We have already seen blogging and tweeting as legitimate means to enter VC by proving that you can pick good startups.
Rolling funds take that a step further by having a costlier signal.
"There is no theoretically stronger signal, so rolling funds might enable a new class of fund managers to come from anywhere."
The management company has a contractual relationship with a general partner entity that it creates to manage each successive limited partnership.3
"To add a layer of complication, this money is technically not invested in the fund but committed to it."
VCs send out capital calls asking investors to submit a portion of their capital commitments every time they make an investment.
For big or active funds this can make the financial administration quite complex.4
"A good lawyer will run $250,000 for all the fund formation activities."
"While AngelList won't replace your attorney, they do help make things much cheaper.6"
But AngelList made it a more standardized asset class for investing in startups.7 Scout funds do also provide some mentorship.
They can still provide this support regardless of the method of funding.
Cash here means liquid assets so public stock disbursements post IPO count too.10
"Here, I'm thinking more of the firm as an institution rather than the performance of a particular fund."
You will also want to invest through SPVs and maybe a growth fund.
This will probably be desirable even if the main fund can eat the investment to avoid concentration risk.
For a committed capital base invested across funds this doesn't matter; for a dispersed capital base it matters a lot.11
"In tech, the winners win so big that growth stage investments can outperform early stage investments in winners."
It is also of note that Warren Buffett has something to say about indexing: Diversification is a protection against ignorance.
It makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing. 13
"Time after time, over history, speculative manias seemingly emerge out of nowhere, fueling extraordinary booms that prelude devastating busts."
"But when the 2008 financial crisis came along, the rules of the game changed."
The interconnectedness of global finance meant that one asset class was capable of bringing down the entire system.
"Instead, they have become the hip, new asset class on the street."
"The elites have replaced America's economy with the Everything Bubble , and it's harder than ever to achieve the American dream."
"Every year, home and food prices rise, more manufacturing industries disappear overseas, and the cost of healthcare and education skyrockets."
"But rather than addressing these issues, the American elites have ignored them and now define their success by whether stonks go up ."
"Stonks go up is not a reference to stocks, per se, but the system that allows asset prices to rise indefinitely."
"We have no market or price discovery, just a constant struggle to postpone economic gravity."
Our future rests on whether a four-figure number on a screen rises.
"While that number remains stable, America's flawed bubble economy remains stable."
"Before, subprime was the prominent liquidity driver, but as that market collapsed, Wall Street needed a quick replacement."
"In the shadow banking layer, an asset's properties have become irrelevant."
Think of these as a CDO squared: a CDO of a CDO .
"To keep citizens from revolting and the system running smoothly, politicians and central bankers have lost their leadership roles."
"Instead, they have become perception managers, using a range of psychological tools to keep us in a constant state of confusion."
"It's there to make you think the government is fiscally responsible, but it rises every time the system reaches crisis point."
Your job as an American used to be to pursue your dreams by embracing the sound elements of capitalism.
Now it's to support the crony capitalist stonks go up machine.
Wall Street's computer algorithms take your money but you can't see your balance going to zero.
You have become part of the craziest monetary experiment in human history and you're powerless to stop it.
Every medium you use to express your anger against the system only feeds and increases its ever-growing power.
"Decentralization, the most popular escape from the system, is the last mainstream beacon of hope."
"While the decentralization movement builds momentum behind the scenes, we will continue to see craziness become the new normal."
We must face the future head-on and brace for the inevitable downturn.
If something broke it didn't cause other parts of the system to collapse.
"But in the 21st century, everything is connected, and there's no turning back."
"Instead, this is a time to get ready for what's to come."
"This is a time to think different, to think outside the box, and to see things for what they really are."
What you do to prepare for the coming crisis is up to you.
"Just make sure you do something, anything, the bare minimum."
Maybe I was afraid it would not live up to my expectations after years of reading and fantasizing about this almost mythical place.
"DeGaulle airport was a mess, having been bombed by terrorists and still under reconstruction."
Not having any Euros and searching for an ATM in a construction site so we could pay for a cab.
"Everything about that cab ride and driver was as foreign as I could have imagined, in a great way."
"And she was just that side of rude to a couple of middle aged Americans who obviously were not chic, not French."
As we pulled up to the address the driver looked momentarily confused.
"By this point, in spite of my jet lag, I was amused at my first Paris attitude encounter."
All those years with Julia Child's massive volumes trying to absorb a culture?
"I decided to get out and find food and see the hood, which she had researched."
Here is where this starts to sound like one of those Paris fantasy movies that appear regularly.
"The research told us that there was a legendary medieval square nearby, the Place de Vosges."
"A city block from before Haussman's rebuilding of the city, surrounded by a four sided covered arcade with ancient stone arches."
"We circled the arcade twice, looking at restaurant menus posted outside restaurant entries."
During those ten days we did the tourist thing and walked non stop.
Walking under the Eiffel Tower was in some ways more magical than the long elevator ride to the top.
"It is magnificent to look up at it from directly underneath, perhaps my iconic memory of Paris."
"I only vaguely remember what the place looked like, but recall it as a white tablecloth place."
I don't remember what I ordered but she had fat spears of pale asparagus in a creamy yellow sauce.
I watched take her first bite and saw a look cross her face that I could not decipher.
She shook her head and gave me a forkful of the asparagus.
"It remains one of the best things I have ever eaten, perfect."
At that moment I knew Paris would live up to my dreams.
"A note about the Eiffel Tower, le tour Eiffel: it is being painted gold for the upcoming Olympics."
"And, apparently, when it was built, the designer Gustave Eiffel had it painted red!"
A true Agile Coach puts their job on the line every single day.
And most of the time the process as well as the outcome are straight-forward.
One way of facing the future is by adopting Scrum practices and transforming into agile organisation.
"Ever since the industrial revolution, the world turns to technology giants for wisdom and best practices."
"The main challenge are organisations in between, trying to change their position by copying what worked for others."
"They give guidance on the administrative setup, the running of Scrum events and on how to best deliver value for the customers."
The Agile Coach facilitates beyond the Scrum teams and is tasked to challenge the status quo.
Underlying most of these issues is a misconception or malpractice of transparency.
For them Scrum offers a clear roadmap to delivering albeit smaller pieces but more regularly.
Once this seed has touched the soil it spreads from one team to the next.
No one wants to be blamed or called out by management for under-delivery and missing deadlines.
"When transparency gets you penalised, you will try anything to muddy the waters."
It is the Scrum Masters duty to counter-act these patterns as they go against the Scrum values.
Yet a Scrum Master can only do so much as their primary goal is to focus on the team.
This is where the struggle of the Agile Coach becomes all too real.
"Good managers will listen to the coach, validate the information with representative sources and start implementing a roadmap with improvement practices."
But bad managers will view this challenge as a direct attack on their capabilities.
How can an Agile Coach know better how to manage an organisation?
"In the best case the Agile Coach goes back to managing the smaller scale issues, supporting the Scrum Masters and their teams."
"Slightly worse is the Agile Coach leaving the organisation, which is what coaches with options and pride tend to do."
And the worst outcome is the Agile Coach being fired on the spot.
"Some mindsets will simply not be changed, no matter how careful we craft the message or how valid our points are."
In such cases we can try to give the teams and people around them the best possible toolset and practices to grow.
"After all, I find that such personality types tend to be part of a success story."
But to prevent such scenarios Agile Coaches can hold some difficult conversations at the beginning of a working relationship.
Also use the opportunity to align on a strategy on how you should bring insights and critical feedback to them.
"In the end we are all human, struggling with our pride and unable to get out of our own skin."
"Some minds can be changed more easily than others, and some will remain locked on their long-held ideals."
The marble statuette broken in four pieces I still keep in the flowery box is hardly a piece of art.
I picked up the pieces from behind the TV and found the tiny chip that split on its own.
I told you I'd put it together and it will hold.
"It was my gift to you, that marble embrace in a heart's kiss - for Valentine's Day."
Years later you told me you threw it at the wall because it hurt too much to look at it.
"Maybe I could have just kept that little bit shaped as a tear,"
"Our kids are growing, one already facing the world by himself."
"Valentine's Day is coming, I'll ask you to kiss that chip for me."
"Fewer options to perhaps design what will be likely even better for all, including ourselves as a part of the whole."
"The best design dares to take a long view, beyond the present."
The best design is such because it takes on its shoulders the effort to go above mediocrity.
"I believe designers should write more, because expressing complex ideas is the best way to better communication."
And my outlook has always been that communication is one of the biggest problem our little industry faces.
"Even when I'm poking fun at UX , I do it because I love."
"There are times that it can get frustrating, but I was always hoping for a positive change."
Thank you for helping me find my way and becoming a better designer.
They would ask me tough questions on the spot and I would stumble over my thoughts and lose my audience almost immediately.
"I knew what I was doing as a designer, I just couldn't communicate it well."
I would see other designers at the company present concepts with little pushback and get everyone onboard almost immediately.
All of the designers that I looked up to were in my shoes at some point in their career.
"This may seem obvious, but it's one of the most essentials steps to succeed."
"To be a good designer, you need to be a good communicator."
The most effective strategy that has helped me build my communication skills is to write down possible questions and answers.
"As you are iterating designs and exploring concepts, start creating a list of questions and responses that you may receive when presenting."
"And the more prepared you are for the meeting, the better you will do."
"When presenting your designs, some of your stakeholders may be seeing it for the first time."
You don't want stakeholders falling behind and asking questions that were addressed weeks ago.
Make sure you get everyone up to speed at the beginning of every meeting to eliminate friction.
Make sure you put thought into how you present the information so they are asking the questions you want them to ask.
This will help your case when showing why one concept works over the other.
It shows that you have already thought about different solutions and that you have arrived at the best option.
Let them know you made logical decisions to arrive at your final design.
A helpful tool to organize your thoughts is a pros and cons list.
"For concepts you explore, make sure you have a thoughtful list of what works and what doesn't."
"This will help logically organize your thoughts, create a strong argument, and get more people onboard with your process."
"Once you develop a relationship with your stakeholders, they will start to understand you as a designer and as a person."
This connection leads to better discussion and better understanding in design meetings.
The best designers get buy-in from stakeholders with as little friction as possible.
And those designers are able to do that because of how they communicate.
And being a good communicator is essential in this field of work.
"If you are a product design newbie, check out my article on Top 5 mistakes UX designers make early in their career."
You'll find some more helpful tips on how to better communicate as a designer.
Want to know how to reflect on the New Year with your team in a human way?
"Check out these reflection activities that can build trust, foster relationships and allow everyone to get to know each other better."
"With this, we also forget to reflect on the way we're working individually."
The team leader might take the role of a member and vice versa.
"This activity offers reflection and insight for everyone on the stresses, challenges and demands of each specific position."
You can use a couple of quotes to represent different viewpoints or those that can have varying interpretations.
You can also invite your team members to share their personal quotes so others can get to know them even more.
"Let each individual draw, read and interpret the quote they chose."
Give each person about a minute or so to communicate their thoughts and keep the conversation flowing.
Allow team members to ask questions or discuss what resonated with them about each short speech.
"A good prompt could be, Why do you do the work you do?"
This activity allows the team to reflect and identify a problem that needs both an action and resolution.
You can start by asking a member to identify an issue and then another member will pose a solution.
This activity will develop and hone the empathy skills of your team members.
Ask them to think about a specific event from the week or month that involved some conflict.
"In the end, ask members what they realized through this activity and how they will use this information going forward."
Divide your team in half and ask members to interview each other about their service experience.
"Reflection activities for your team members provide them with an opportunity to express their opinions, feelings and thoughts in a shared environment."
They will also be able to talk about this experience with each other in the future.
"Conservatives believe the United States is a capitalist country, and they like it that way."
"They say government should stay out of people's business, so free markets can create the best possible society."
"Anyone who advocates that government do more is labeled a socialist, a communist, or worse."
"We do have markets, but they are not free or fair."
Powerful people and corporations fund and manage the politicians who make the markets' rules.
"When those rules don't serve the wealthy, government doesn't enforce them or rushes to change them."
The funds had been short-selling stock in the retail company GameStop.
"Short-selling means borrowing stock and selling it, then buying it back later at a lower price to return it."
"It's illegal market manipulation, often with the goal of driving stocks down and companies out of business."
"The Reddit crew caught the funds doing it and started buying GameStop stock, driving up the price to absurd levels."
"The hedge funds still took a substantial loss, but far less than they would have if market rules had been followed."
Real estate markets are manipulated in more harmful ways than stock markets.
"For decades, Black Americans and other minorities couldn't buy housing in white neighborhoods."
Then the companies would sell the homes to Black families at a big profit.
Americans' desire for home ownership has been ruthlessly exploited by market manipulators.
"As long as people are repaying their debts, a CDO-holder profits."
"But in the late 90s, banks started loaning people deceptive mortgages, often with low interest and low or no down payments."
"The economy collapsed into the great recession, and good-paying jobs disappeared, never to return."
"After all, the money they had loaned out wasn't being repaid."
"But they had sold the mortgages off as CDOs, so others took those losses."
"And while allowing homeowners to be foreclosed and impoverished, government gave bankers and financiers massive bailouts."
"Corporations in agriculture, defense, transportation, health care, oil, and other industries also receive these kinds of benefits."
"They guarantee that capitalists' share of wealth grows, and the people's share shrinks."
"Government consistently serves capital financially and in other ways, like cutting taxes and regulations, because they are the same people."
"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellin received an $800,000 speaking fee from Citadel."
"This fee topped the $675,000 that Hillary Clinton received for three speeches to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in 2013."
"Mitt Romney made $250 million running his fund Bain Capital, which eliminated thousands of American jobs."
"People move from corporations to government and back, serving the super-rich in both places."
"That is why, in the COVID depression of 2020, U.S.-based hedge funds increased their wealth by $63.5 billion."
Their names appear on university buildings; politicians seek their support and advice.
"Their interests, not free markets, determine what capitalist governments do."
Financial journalist Max Keiser calls Wall Street a whole layered cluster of fraud.
He goes on to say:Government as servant of capital is not unique to the U.S. or the 21st century.
"His definition may not have been right in all times and places, but it certainly is true in modern America."
"Capitalist domination of our markets can't be changed by electing Democrats or Republicans, even a Trump or a Sanders."
"Both parties serve the corporations, and the rich contribute equally to both of them."
The Right wants government out of markets; the Left wants government to intervene on behalf of poor people.
Right now we have the opposite: a government that intervenes on behalf of the rich and powerful.
"We need markets so people can create things, buy, and sell them to enrich everyone."
We also need government to keep markets fair and to do the things markets can't or won't do for society.
What we don't need is a government controlled by those who rule the markets.
"That combination is called capitalism, and it has to go.- - - - - - - - - - -Thanks for reading!"
The KPI tree is a really powerful tool for understanding changes in system performance.
It is very easy to implement and it has a broad range of applications.
So we conclude that:Sales are down 5.1% for Gap Inc. and management wants to understand the cause.
KPI trees are really powerful at turning raw data into stories that are both interpretable and actionable.
"But manhole cover design illustrates some important points for product development, both for startups and large multi-national organisations."
Let's look at some common challenges that startups and large organisations face.
The challenge for startupsStartups with a B2B aspect in their business model can sometimes be overwhelmed by individual feature requests from business customers.
They have found a need - as the lean startup methodology tells them - and now they plunge into building it.
"But the next customer has another request, and yet another customer has yet another feature request."
This can lead startups astray from building a product towards building custom software solutions.
They often find themselves in the situation where their colleagues in other regions have developed their own local solutions.
"This leads to many different systems being run, maintained and evolved."
"In turn, this creates a complex software systems landscape, and high overall costs."
They become aware of complexity that arises when central systems need to interact with the variety of different regional systems.
"Then, an initiative is started to consolidate things into one single source of truth."
They aim to create a standardised process within one central system that serves all the different regions.
VariationA local variation in the function of manhole covers are required for areas that are prone to flooding.
"While some places have less striking graphic design, some have turned manhole cover design into an artform."
"These designs show drawings with regional significance, of cityscapes, local maps, nature, folklore or contemporary culture."
"Beyond the aesthetic variation, these designs have captured the imagination of the public."
In Berlin an artist rolled paint onto the profile of the manhole cover to print t-shirts.
"The different designs also created hope among some japanese locals, who anticipate that the elaborate designs will increase tourism to their city."
For the sewage industry in Japan it has helped them improve their image from dirty and smelly to colourful and elaborately designed .
"But it is important that we do, so that we can ensure the success of our product or service."
The risk of over-customisation is that we end up building custom software.
"This makes growth and scaling slow, and creates a complex systems architecture with high maintenance effort."
"There are some variations we need to be aware of, so that our common solution can handle all of them."
Like the simple example of conventions for last names which vary between countries.
"For example: Tax rules will vary from country to country, when buying a car."
Some markets have very complex taxes rules: such as Portugal where a luxury tax applies.
Some of the methods that help us understand and prioritise needs are Jobs to be Done or the Kano Model.
Because stories are important when we want to persuade our colleagues and take our stakeholders on a journey.
"The python libraries you need to install are pandas, geopandas and matplotlib."
"Even without the use of a map, we can see the contours of Australia."
"Geopandas lets you load the geometry for countries worldwide into an object called GeoDataFrame, which is very similar to pandas DataFrame object."
So why should I switch from <insert-autodiff-library> to JAX? .
The classic first passive-aggressive question when talking about the new 'kid on the block'.
Here is my answer: JAX is not simply a fast library for automatic differentiation.
But this is not restricted to standard gradient-based optimization setups.
"Throughout the post we will assume that you already know the basic primitives of JAX such as jit, vmap and lax.scan."
"If you feel like you need to catch up on these, checkout the JAX quickstart guide or my JAX intro blog post."
Evolutionary strategies aim to minimize a black-box function without the use of explicit analytical derivatives or gradient estimates.
The previously accumulated information is then cleverly integrated to inform the search distribution π.
Th sequential batches of proposal solutions x are also known as individuals of a generation g.
In neuroevolution x corrsponds to the parameters of a neural network and f denotes some metric of performance.
"Importantly, we are not relying on backprop and the resulting gradients, the objective does not have to be smooth and differentiable."
The update step adjusts the mean and covariance of the Gaussian and the stepsize standard deviation σ.
That sounds plausible - but what are desirable characteristics of efficient search algorithms in the first place?
It should generalizes across a wide range of functions f and be robust to a variety of transformations of input and output.
This includes how we initialize and terminate the strategy and some logging utilities.
Feel free to check out the source files in the linked repository.
By asking for a set of proposal candidates from the search distribution and evaluating the candidates.
"Only afterwards, we can update the strategy with the information gathered during the evaluation."
The diagonal entries correspond to the standard deviations of the individual $d$ dimensions of our optimization problem.
"Hence, it controls how far the search distribution 'reaches out' along a specific axis."
"B, on the other hand, defines the orientation of these principal axis."
The memory stores all the variables which are exposed to an update from the ES.
The resulting dynamics prescribe how our search distribution evolves over the consecutive generations.
We therefore want to obtain a reliable estimate by leveraging information accumulated by previous generations.
Their role is to track the changes in the mean statistic and how different updates affected the next generations performance.
"Don't worry about the equations yet, we will soon see how all of this works in detail."
For now just remember that p_c and p_σ provide a memory trace that integrates over past updates.
Usually the set of parents is chosen to be around 50 percent of the entire population.
The weights w_i are typically chosen to be decreasing so that the very best performing solutions are given more influence.
"In the next two steps we will derive an update for the isotropic part of the covariance matrix, a.k.a."
"The larger c_c the faster p_σ will respond, but also the smaller the integration timescale."
"The precision of the covariance, on the other hand, provides an additional rescaling which interacts in non-trivial ways."
"So how do we actually update σ?The stepsize is a scalar, while p_σ is d-dimensional."
The norm of p_σ provides a measure of aggregated step length and a simple moving statistic for whether to increase or decrease σ.
"We will skip some math here, but one can show that p_σ is in expectation standard normally distributed."
"Note that if ||p_σ|| equals the expected value, there won't be any change in the stepsize."
We now have an update formula for the mean and the isotropic part of the variance.
A natural starting point could be the sample estimate based on the current x.
This is another example of the statistical challenge of the curse of dimensionality.
"Intuitively, the goal of the adaptation step is to increase the chances of sampling p_c and the normalized parameters."
"Again c_1, c_μ and c_s denote a set of learning rates."
For a better overview of the hyperparameters in CMA-ES check out the overview table at the end of the blog.
Let's now see how we can scale CMA-ES to optimize a small neural network for a classic Reinforcement Learning task.
"Traditionally, this would involve large chunks of code and communication pipelines involving multiprocessing and OpenMPI."
We will jit the RL episode loop after using lax.scan & rewriting the gym environment.
We vmap over the evaluation episodes used to estimate the agent's fitness.
There are no multiprocessing worker queues involved and we can easily scale this to accelerators such as GPUs and even TPUs.
I have already taken the freedom to re-write OpenAI's Pendulum-v0 NumPy environment in JAX.
"Furthermore, the RL step will now take as inputs an additional dictionary of environment variables and the current state of the environment."
This allows us to jit an entire episode rollout together with the help of the lax.scan primitive.
Next we define a single-hidden layer MLP policy and a policy rollout wrapper.
We vmap over both the number of different evaluation episodes and all the different neural networks in our current population.
"When asking CMA-ES for parameter samples for the next generation, it will sample a flat vector of parameters."
But the evaluation procedure requires a dictionary of layer-specific weight arrays.
"Afterwards, we then run the ask-evaluate-tell loop over the different generation iterations."
"Therefore, I ran the same configuration as above but changed the individual parameters."
"In order to get a little more statistical power, I repeated the experiment over 10 different seeds."
On CPU we can see an increase in time per generations as the population size is increased.
"Both GPUs, on the other hand, handle the increased population size easily using simple parallelization."
But this appears to come with a small caveat: Increased XLA compile time.
With two lines of code we were able to vectorize over both stochastic fitness evaluations and population members.
The power of XLA then allowed us to run the entire ask-evaluate-tell procedure on accelerated hardware.
"Finally, the entire code of this tutorial can be found in this repository ready for you to dive in."
"Furthermore, I put the entire pipeline into a 120 line snippet."
This is mainly because I wanted to focus on the high-level intuition and not drown you too much in math.
Ernesto López leaned forward to get out through the door much too small for his tall and stout body.
When he straightened the back at the top of the stairs he saw darkness and feeble snowflakes falling slowly from the skies.
Recently the weather had rather resembled the springtime weather - so nice and warm.
And there it was suddenly in a desperate attempt to fulfill everybody's dream of White Christmas.
The perfectly intricate and sophisticated structure of a snowflake scared him beyond reason.
"With a suitcase in his left hand, Ernesto grabbed the rail on the right and carefully descended the narrow and steep stairs."
It was the last but one pleasant nuance that awaited him this evening.
"As soon as he ordered the coffee and sat comfortably in an armchair, the cell rang again."
"Oh, yes, his American fiancé was a real pain in the neck."
He did everything she wanted him to do once they'd learned about the pregnancy.
"There were roses, a romantic dinner, a diamond ring and one-leg kneeling."
She complained the wedding date hadn't been even vaguely agreed on yet and the twins were on the way.
"Yeah, he was so open, so eager to welcome any thrilling novelties."
All the excitement was yet poisoned by the thought of the wedding issue.
Ernesto made a quick decision to pick up this call instructing himself fervently not to mistake names like he did last time.
After ten minutes or so he hung up fully satisfied with the interaction.
"Now when Pablo had reached the age of five, Ernie could move it to the next level."
"In fact, both of them were ready to go all the way."
"High time to get up, find a cab and travel two hours and twenty minutes to his home town Sorria and work."
"Ernesto opened a tall, wide and very heavy door, strutted inside and looked around with utter elation and pride."
"His kingdom - full of space, artificial light, gold and splendor."
"Here he was the ruler, the master in full power and control."
All these people had gathered here to show him their sense of submission and respect.
"The king headed for a small room at the back, checking every detail along the way."
"Ernesto hurriedly changed his clothes, which was time and effort consuming."
"In his childhood he aspired to become a professional singer, like Frank Sinatra or Michael Bublé."
But then uncle Nicolàs entered his world with sticky hands and tongue convincing him life was no heaven where beautiful dreams came true.
There was only the here and now filled with fear and pain as well as lust feeding on them both.
"Just as he was about to open it, his attention got caught by a small silver sparkly something."
Ernesto simply pressed his finger against the glittering beauty to make it disappear.
"That was peculiar, he thought putting his hand confidently on the cover to finally raise it."
"Red in the face, Ernie began hitting it with a thumb like mad."
"The snowflake melted and grew back each time, over and over."
The worshippers fell silent and waited for the priest to stop acting weird and start the ceremony.
"And At the same time, Apple is also researching micro-LED displays for Macbook, iPhone, and iPad."
After a busy working day I couldn't wait to just sit down and enjoy one of my favourite shows.
I know you probably think it sounds crazy but let me walk you through the similarities I have explored.
It is actually not that different in terms of UX at all.
"For example, you can't cook the pasta in your measuring jar, you will use the pan for that."
"But there are also things that you will use multiple times during your cooking process, like your knives or spoons."
We are so lucky that we can use many different tools to achieve the best outcome for a project.
Every MasterChef contestant is different in terms of their skills and knowledge.
"Some of them might have never seen a sous vide machine before, whilst others use it in their day to day life."
I think it's important to note that we all have different abilities.
In fact it's truly amazing as this is why we can learn so much from each other.
"There are several cooking techniques that are most likely familiar to all of us: baking, roasting, frying, grilling etc."
For example you know that frying a chocolate cake will not benefit you at any occasion.
"In both Masterchef and in UX, timing is the most crucial part of the process."
Imagine spending too much time on preparing the elements of your dish that you don't actually have time to cook.
You would only be able to serve a piece of meat on a plate which let's be real not so appetising.
It's better to get a complete design out in time which you can then learn and iterate on.
Once the contestants are finished preparing their dish they have to make sure that their presentations are extraordinary and impressive for the judges.
How to achieve that wow factor?John and Gregg are not there just to run the show.
They provide feedback to all the contestants hoping that they will develop from it and become better and better each week.
Being afraid of getting feedback is not the best way to go.
Today I know that constructive feedback is the best way to develop and challenge yourself.
It's truly about getting the best outcome possible and keeping the users the centre of your focus.
"In conclusion: becoming an effective User Experience designer is a never ending learning process, just like being a contestant in MasterChef."
"Not trend growth, not strong growth, but 8-10% GDP growth."
The US economy will recoup the lost economic growth from 2020 in 2021.
They are everything we've come to expect from a government economic research group.
"The truly shocking development has been the rapid wall of money created by the White House, Congress and the Federal Reserve."
The graphic below underscores how much has been allocated and how much has yet to hit the economy.
This is on top of the monetary stimulus the Federal Reserve continues to pump through the veins of the US economy.
There are still 10 million workers who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic.
"Paraphrasing the Raiders' Al Davis deficits be damned, just stimulate, baby."
This is raising economists 2021 Q2 GDP forecasts from 4% to as high at 10%.
The Jay Powell Fed believes it has learned it can run the unemployment rate down to 3.5% without creating wage inflation.
All the major government economic decision makers are aligned to create policy to drive down unemployment.
"For the markets, it translates into the biggest risk-on party in our lifetimes."
"Infrastructure, housing and expansion of Obamacare are on the spending to-do list."
"Rapidly rising risky asset prices, rapidly rising housing prices, and rapidly rising deficits."
A more volatile bond market despite efforts from the Fed to contain the price movements.
Guess what happens if the Biden administration is successful with the vaccine program?
"For those new to bioinformatics, it can be unclear how to access the data from this massive resource."
"Bioinformatics software runs primarily on Unix based operating systems, and this is the case for the toolkit needed to download SRA data."
"Finally, NGS data is typically massive so you will need a decent amount of free storage on your machine."
"Depending on the species the dataset came from, full analysis of the NGS data can use upwards of 100Gb of memory."
Just downloading a singe file should required no more than 50Gb though.
The SRA Toolkit contains all the programs we need to download and manipulate the data from SRA.
"To download it, navigate over to NCBI's sra-tools GitHub page and download the appropriate file for your operating system."
"In your Downloads folder, double click the .tar file and navigate into the newly created folder."
The programs we will be using for downloading the SRA data are located in the bin folder.
We need to get the pathname of that bin folder and navigate into it on the command line.
"To download the data run the following command, where <SRR0000000> is your Run number from above."
Downloading could take a while depending on your internet speed and the size of the file being downloaded.
"The prefetch program will download a .sra file, which is not a very useful file format."
We need to convert this file into the standard NGS file format of FASTQ to do any work with it.
We will use the fastq-dump tool to convert the data.
"The -split-files option is likely the most useful one, it splits paired-end reads into separate files."
SRR0000000> is the SRR number of your .sra file:The final FASTQ file will be dumped into the bin folder.
"You can go on to do any further processing with your FASTQ file now, including mapping to reference and variant analysis."
A group of young investors jumped on the back of hedge funds for a real fight.
"But to properly understand it, I had to read and hear a lot of information."
"My goal was to understand the stock markets' complex problems on short selling, short squeezes, or corners."
"Some investors are demonizing the short-sellers, and I needed to understand why."
Short selling has been around for more than 150 years on Wall Street.
And it is one of the reasons why Wall Street is the most developed market in the world.
"It increases liquidity because, besides investors, traders also buy and sell."
Why is it good for the economy and the companies?Let's take Tesla's example.
"The company had 16 years of losses, from its founding in 2003 to 2019."
"If Tesla had been born in Europe, it would hardly have resisted the long process of innovation."
"In the most efficient market globally, even struggling companies can finance themselves in the markets."
"They often endure crises, resuming growth in the next economic expansion."
Some of them with percentages often 50% above the available shares.
"How is it possible?Through naked short selling, more shares are sold short than those sold by the company."
"Yet, short-sellers abuse this possibility, seeking to take companies' quotations to the pond."
"Making it difficult to finance them at reasonable prices, even trying to ruin them."
Here is the moral factor that brought out the Redditors to make a corner.
The intention of these bulls was not to cause a short squeeze but a corner.
"This is like saying, corner the shorts in a dead-end and force them to take huge losses."
A group of Redditors called WallStreetBets saw a short position of 150% on GameStop.
And encouraged group followers to buy shares with all their strength and speed.
They forced short-sellers to cover their positions at much higher prices.
"As the shorts were short with 150% of the shares, there are not enough shares to close those positions."
"So, the short-sellers are trapped in a corner, with no possible escape."
Unless the company cooperates by issuing new shares to satisfy these shorts.
Or the short-sellers get financing and shorten even more shares to bring GameStop down again.
We should stop pretending that trading in stocks is investing in businesses.
Capital markets were initially conceived to finance the real economy and to help capitalize businesses and companies.
It has become a synthetic casino - a gambling model with no morality.
"And as a European, I'm a real fan of the US stock market."
"Yet, from time to time, here comes another event that shows us how rotten the system is."
Capital invested in real businesses has been taken away from some malicious hedge funds.
"That capital could drive growth and create real jobs, prosperity, and innovation."
"Yet, more than 95% of that volume didn't even reach the real economy."
"So, right now, we have a supposed equity market that should provide capital to the real economy."
But at the bottom is being the most immoral casino bet in the world.
"If they add nothing to the real economy, they should be excluded."
"Take, for example, Ray Dalio's Bridgewater or Howard Mark's Oaktree Capital."
These two hedge funds are led by two investors that I deeply admire.
I often read notes that I took from the lessons they gave me.
Their hedge funds do not seem to have damaged the market or take advantage of to the detriment of the real economy.
"In May 2020, a group of Redditors from WallStreetBets started investing in an apparent dead stock at an exponential pace."
"From 2,000 investors on Hertz, it went up to 180,000 committed fans."
That was when I found a book I automatically bought from Jaime Rogozinski called WallStreetBets.
"And it whipped out the savings of their parents, grand-parents, familiars, and friends."
These millennials not only watched the unbelievable capitalistic schemes in financial institutions.
"And now, millennials are treating Wall Street for what it is- a gigantic casino for them to play."
A legal venue was full of leveraged tools to make sophisticated bets with their cell phones.
"Nowadays, WallStreetBets turned into a social media network where kids and youngsters bet on the YOLO culture."
YOLO culture was the reason I finally understood what happens to Hertz investors.
They became aware of the system's immoralities and what hedge funds are doing to the market.
"Now, highly sophisticated Redditors, highly leveraged, and highly financed nerds are attacking Mordor."
"They want to annihilate Sauron himself, the supreme image of evil in the famous saga The Lord of the Rings."
"Ironically, millennials created platforms like Robinhood, and now they're using them to provoke a war."
"If Redditors are pushing hedge funds into a morality corner, I'll want to see more of it."
"Unfortunately, there's a lot of misinformation, confusion, and little foresight."
"We are creating gigantic bogeymen, triggering a tsunami where the good and the bad are carried in the current."
They must make the market more transparent so that we all know who is shortening what and in what amount.
"Only then, the stock market will come out stronger and more moralized."
"Otherwise, it will be another day well spent in Las Vegas."
It's always good when you see young investors show experienced ones that they are wrong.
"When there is too much money in the system, poorly distributed, less useful things happen."
Short selling is not a wrong tool if it's used in a balanced way.
"If short-sellers did not short sell the company, their CEO would continue to deceive everyone, even today."
It was from there that everyone realized what was happening behind the scenes.
"They ultimately manipulate the outcomes by wiring PR people, private investigators, and lobbyists."
The beautiful thing is having these digital pirates writing a manifesto to fight at this level.
"And they push some hedge funds to a corner, putting them on their knees."
"Though, Robinhood did shut down the trades and made it impossible for the operation to go all the way."
The last mile is better known as 'the last mile delivery' and is a term mainly used in the logistics world.
It refers to the last mile before a product reaches the hands of the customer.
"This had not only to do with the pure logistics of stock and transport, but also with marketing and sales."
"If a new coffee variety was advertised strongly, the chance of a listing at a retailer was already much greater."
It also resulted in faster orders and better displays of the new product in the supermarkets.
"Usually, creating awareness around a new change is done reasonably well."
"Through videos and presentations, enthusiasm is created, just as an advertising campaign does for the new coffee capsules."
I looked for answers in Rick Maurer's model '3 levels of resistence'.
This explains the 3 levels of resistance that occur when introducing change.1.
In change processes it is important to assess these different levels and to work with them.
"Because if you can remove the obstacles, you take away the resistance and make sure that employees adopt the change."
"And just as in e-commerce, that is currently a people business."
You need hands and feet to make it happen and this costs money.
"In e-commerce you need van drivers, in organizational change you need change coaches."
"In e-commerce, the need for last mile delivery is not questioned."
Those kinds of questions should be more central to organizational change and its design.
The only place you'd hear a Margaret Walker poem followed by a dance interpretation of 112's Peaches and Cream.
You could either wear your favorite sports jersey or put on a tie and dress up like MLK.
The dread factor here depends on your Benjamin Banneker-loving parents and how much resentment you ended up having for them.
And by normal we mean let's get back to learning about White people.
Look at any school district's Mission Statement and you'll find the term 'Lifelong Learner'.
"A school's job, then, is not merely to impart knowledge or skill but create citizens who never stop learning."
But nothing quite exposes the hypocrisy or contradiction of our education system than the 'Lifelong Learner' proclamation made by schools.
"Because as true as the sentiment might be, schools hold a monopoly on 'learning' that they rarely or willingly relinquish."
"One learns their history, but also how to grill a steak."
"A 'Lifelong Learner' is, on one level, every human being on the planet."
"To school, many things we learn - that we must learn, even - are ignored."
"Not just the cooking, but the growing and processing and measuring of it."
"Little that we actually do with our hands and bodies, really, is under school's eye."
"One neither studies those things in school, nor is measured by her skill in them."
"Other aspects of a rich human life are sidelined, often into frivolity."
Is not 'English' the language we speak and write daily?
History is not what happened in the past; history is the life we live now.
We could not turn our heads nor move our fingers without running up against the products of science.
"Your eyes on this screen, and your fingers near the keyboard are proof alone."
How much is a part of school rather than incidental to it?
"It is dominated by only one kind of storefront, that of 'Academics'."
"Now, it must be noted that the situation we find ourselves is not deliberate."
It's a product of structure and history and a multitude of other factors.
"It's a journey that still provides far more good than harm, but we could do better."
Many of these circumstances are incidental to the structural and financial limitations of churning large groups of disparate children through a system.
We are no longer in a place where one person can teach her child all that she needs to know and thrive.
"These institutions are themselves guided not merely by their mission, but social, physical, and economic realities."
"So we have hive-like schools, and classrooms, and age-based groupings, and specialized teachers."
"If we allowed ALL learning to take place in school, we'd be overwhelmed."
"That task, necessary and invaluable, means we've had to seek out basic fundamentals and hope they are universal."
It began when a human being actually could navigate their world without the ability to read or a sense of what numbers do.
"Human beings are a learning species, and we will learn everything that is demanded of us for survival."
"Whether in school or out, it's hard to imagine anyone in a modern country not learning to read today."
"Teachers come almost universally out of Universities, and universities prize a particular kind of knowledge and thinking."
They have a specific way of reading that they take very seriously.
An adult university graduate has acquired and mastered and even sanctified a way of understanding the world.
Most leave the University with that thinking as a tool for other purposes.
"They go on to make things and money, manage people and institutions, serve and be served, and so on."
"Many step back into their old classrooms, all the way down to the beginning."
"Whether by history, accident, or design, this is where we are with school."
"And while it's easy to say 'education' is broken, that's not fair at all."
"It's simply untrue to say 'broken' because the system still does the invaluable, necessary job."
"It could help more, it could provide more, and it could do more."
"We can, with a few shifts, allow it to do more."
"School defines what's tested, how it's tested, and the credentialing power the tests have."
And in the past it might have been the only feasible path.
But it's not really fair and it's no longer financially or structurally necessary to be so limited.
"Students create, perform, collaborate, research, draw, film, sing, construct, and combine."
Yet little of what students actually DO is carried or used outside our classrooms.
All we have to do is start accepting and using what students produce to demonstrate their mastery of material.
It's up to the world outside school to start asking for it more.
"Rather than re-examine the traditional classroom, we've mostly attempted to replicate it."
"We're still meeting our students at the same times and in the same groups, only through Zoom."
We're still schooling through single teachers managing 20 or more kids in blocked increments.
Yet all of us are simply waiting to go back to the old methods.
They gather up a community's children and house them and feed them and monitor their well-being.
It's just not always a great way to educate or learn.
But we ought to be willing to open up education to all that the world offers.
Literacy and number sense are absolutely fundamental skills that every person in society needs to have.
We actually do a decent job of building that foundation into our elementary school students.
"History is not just the events of the past, in a timeline and in a place."
"History is fundamental to understanding business and religion, culture and psychology and sports."
English is not just 'Literature' and the 5 paragraph essay.
"It's not merely the research paper or narrative either, nor should it be condensed to such narrow specifics for every student."
It may once have been convenient to force every student through a narrow range of material regardless of where they might end up.
The adult world offers a near-infinite variety of things to learn.
"Until that time, we'll continue to struggle hopelessly with what we've got."
"It still works, for some, but it could work better, for a whole lot more."
"I was determined to have a big house, my dream home."
"But, most of all, I wanted a south-facing backyard with a view."
"The real estate agent reassured us each time: If it doesn't speak to you, we'll keep looking."
"We were getting desperate, and desperate times called for desperate measures."
"We looked at the pictures, and the view left us wanting."
"It was in an area called Tuscany, more dreamy than Coventry, Dalhousie, or Hamptons."
"Under normal circumstances, we don't jump into such a big decision without careful thought and consideration."
"The pièce de résistance were the daily sunrises at the front of the house, and the sunsets at the back."
It wasn't until four and a half years later that I got my answer.
It was only natural that I looked for something familiar when moving again.
The single must-have was the openness with lots of trees.
"A house is a house, but a home can be any place."
I had dropped the kids to school and was making my way back.
One street before my house was a turn that went down a hill.
"As soon as you start the descent, the road opens to the horizon as far as the eyes can touch."
"I was in the car driving, but I wasn't in the car driving."
It wasn't the kind to give you goosebumps all over but rather an embrace that warms you up from the inside.
The colors of the horizon enveloping me like fingers intertwining when holding hands.
"It was a short stretch of road, and mere seconds felt like minutes."
"It was a jolt to my heart, giving it new life."
"When they do happen, I am convinced that someone is there looking after me, reminding me I am never alone."
"If you are interested to read more of my writings, you may read the following one published in The Masterpiece."
"Sometimes I'll use an affirmation connected to my breath, in rhythm with my steps."
My current meditation practice is relevant to what's happening now - it is triage.
"Traditional seated meditation feels incongruent, even as an experienced meditation teacher."
"There's already too much sitting, and my worrying mind won't tolerate it."
"The anxiety wins out over the witness, to the point that it is intolerable."
"These days, my walks are one of the only times I go outside."
"The Zen Buddhist master and global spiritual leader Thich Nhat Hanh offers simple, accessible guidance for walking meditation in his many books."
I wonder if you could let your arms swing and let your hips move.
All of this can be allowed to wash over you as you amble like an aimless tiger.
Affirmations - words or phrases that resonate with your values - are personal.
"I am home on the first step, I have arrived with the next."
Is there a word or phrase that resonates on a visceral level?
"Fill yourself with your intention, and share it with the world."
"If you feel distant, isolated or lonely, your word might be love."
Walk in a way that brings you closer to your relationship with the earth and all beings.
You can notice how many steps it takes to repeat your intention.
It means actually really drinking in the whole experience that you're in in the moment.
"Maybe turn up the corners of your mouth in a little smile, and be present as you take your walk."
"If there's a time when you feel captivated, curious, or grateful about some detail of your surroundings-"
"Without labeling or identifying or grasping the experience, simply drink it in."
Pause on the spot until your aimless tiger is ready to continue on its ramble.
"During this stressful time, I'm going back to familiar, gentle practices."
"Walking meditation helps me notice the relationship between what's going on in the world, and how my body is responding."
Kate Lynch is a meditation coach and inclusive yoga teacher specializing in building resilience to anxiety.

"It sits atop the Marina Bay Residences, a 54-floor condominium tower in central Singapore that overlooks the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel."
"The units still need to be combined with a network of internal staircases, Yip said."
The residences are down the street from the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
"The penthouse offers prime views of the Marina Bay Sands, as listing photos show."
"James Dyson, the inventor of the Dyson vacuum cleaner, paid $54.2 million for the Wallich penthouse in July 2019."
The purchase set a record for the most expensive condo ever sold in Singapore.
"He sold it at a loss in October 2020, for $47 million."
"The collection's largest unit is a three-story, 11,000-square-foot triplex penthouse."
"The five units still need to be connected with internal staircases, Tristar associate director Edwin Yip told Insider."
"Tristar hired Formwerkz Architects as the consultant for the design and feasibility study of the staircases, Yip told Insider."
"The buyer will cover the cost of the staircases, which is estimated at about $150,000 to $225,000, he said."
"Family offices, which manage the wealth of super-rich families, are currently a booming business in Singapore."
Dyson billionaire James Dyson had already established a family office in the city-state.
"With 24 bedrooms, there would be no shortage of space for a multigenerational family in Singapore's biggest penthouse."
"Tristar therefore refers to the Marina Penthouse Collection as a Good Class Bungalow in the sky, he said."
"Four of the units are currently owned by family offices and the fifth is owned by a private investor, according to Tristar."
"When Tristar started working with the owners, the firm saw a unique opportunity to create the massive penthouse, Yip said."
"In fact, there are quite a few lies we've been told over the years."
"As we know it, virginity doesn't exist - particularly female virginity that a woman loses during her first penetrative sex."
Virginity as a concept was introduced to us incorrectly a long time ago.
"Science disproved this traditional yet misleading definition of virginity, but many individuals are still unaware of it."
"Not to mention, we, as humans, are much more than our bodies."
But the misconceptions about virginity and sex aren't nearly as bad as certain sex crimes that keep happening around the world.
"We may live in the 21st century, but some practices resemble Middle Ages - such as virginity tests."
"Virginity tests are both painful, scary, and most importantly, damaging and inhumane."
"The world is changing, but it should change faster, and virginity exams must be banned everywhere without exception."
"Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to receive a proper sexual education."
"Certain concepts were explained to teenagers correctly, but others were not."
"Virginity, especially a female one, was presented to us misleadingly."
"The concept of other sexes was rarely discussed at school, let alone different genders."
"If it weren't for the Internet, I would have probably been uneducated and misguided about sex for a very long time."
"I used to be there in the past, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone."
The inaccurate misconception about hymen penetration is the cornerstone of the miseducation about the female body and sex.
"Hymen is a flexible tissue inside the vagina opening, and every woman is not like anyone else."
"Jonathan Shaffir, Doctor of Medicine, explains the hymen miscronception accurately and easily to understand:Every woman is different."
Some of us have a small hymen barely touched during the first sexual experience; others have a more pronounced tissue.
"The hymen also covers the vaginal entrance differently - in fact, sometimes it barely covers it at all."
Here is an illustration of what hymens may look like:There is no right answer.
The list of activities that can affect the shape and placement of the hymen is decently long.
"First of all, inserting tampons can lead to tearing or stretching."
You can pretty much say that living can affect that piece of tissue.
"Many women use tampons every month, and most of us exercise as well."
There are several countries and isolated communities across the globe where virginity tests are still legal.
"Numerous human rights organizations, including WHO, condemn this practice and call it inhumane, traumatizing and torturous."
The gynecologist wasn't familiar with the modern science and kept insisting my friend is not a virgin anymore.
"That incident made my friend extremely upset and insecure, and it traumatized her for years."
The poor girl started doubting herself and couldn't trust her body.
She took that gynecological exam willingly and consented to that test for health reasons!
It's a shame that some developed or decently developed countries still endorse this practice.
This sparked a nationwide outcry and started a conversation about the legality of the United States' virginity tests.
"The good news is, some states are working on having virginity tests banned."
"Sex has many mysterious concepts surrounding it, but it's imperative to distinguish a myth from reality."
Female virginity doesn't exist in the form we were taught in SexEd classes or by society.
"Science has done a remarkable job studying this topic over the years, and all people should educate themselves."
"So, how do we determine if a person - regardless of gender - is a virgin?"
"According to a remarkable TedTalk by Nina Dølvik Brochmann & Ellen Støkken Dahl, the best thing to do is simply ask."
"As for the virginity tests, I hope the entire world forbids them and starts fining doctors for such examinations."
We have made so much progress in the 21st century - we should make this change as well.
Twitter reported Q4 2020 revenue yesterday of $1.29B. With net income coming in at $222M.
"That's all good news, but it's also exactly why now is the right time to switch things up a bit."
Twitter has been talking about the idea of a subscription service - or multiple subscription services - for a while now.
That's adding almost an extra 25% to the top line!
"In a way, I'd think of Twitter more like a streaming television service in this regard."
"But it should be clear to everyone at this point - first and foremost,"
And they were also long ago passed by Snapchat in daily users.
This is why the time is right for a premium layer to augment the ad-based monetization layer.
And that means they can try to build a pretty good subscription business as well.
"If - yes, a big 'if' - done well, it will move the needle."
"To me, it's a no-brainer right now that boils down to what you bake into such a package."
"Per Wagner's post, there's a lot they can try and a lot they likely are thinking about."
But I would argue that they need to keep it pretty simple too.
This would be the premium consumer offering that I think could encompass a few things.
And things like access to premium content - perhaps via a paid Twitter Spaces layer.
This would be the premium version of Twitter geared more towards professionals and creators.
The ability to have multiple tweet streams all updating at once in real time.
"Yes, that's a lot of money to pay for a social networking service for which you're currently paying $0."
"Once I've accepted ownership, the problem is more likely to get fixed."
This mentality started with my first legal job as a hostess at Denny's.
"He would demand a full recount and ownership of any situation, whether it was my 'fault' or not."
The customer is angry because she couldn't sit next to a window?
He owned every piece of it even though he had been working as hard as any of us.
That whining and finding ways to shift blame just gives away your power.
"And that no matter how small, we can and should be the boss of whatever task we do."
One of the big lessons I've been taught through a lifetime of weird experiences is how to handle pressure.
Pressure is inevitable; establishing priorities and taking action helps you to remain calm and effective.
The wind blew the door shut leaving me stuck on the freezing cold 6th story platform with no way back in.
"Then I relaxed, took stock of my priorities, and acted."
Just having this sad little priority list was enough to galvanize me into action.
I was soaked and entirely numb when I finally arrived at the station.
Taking a deep breath and knowing that you have no other option than to do the hard thing makes it easier to bear.
There is a powerful lesson that comes when you really own that fact that no one is coming to save you.
And that you can save yourself because you have the evidence the prove it.
The final big takeaway from Extreme Ownership is the value of managing risks.
"Without a safety net, you, by necessity have more awareness of what can go wrong at any given time."
"In the back of your mind, you have a plan of attack."
"At the Starbucks next to my apartment, there were maybe five total tables."
"The second my table was clear, there would be a mad fight for the next person to take it,"
"And of course, my purse was gone when I returned from the bathroom."
"While it was a predictable disaster, one thing I was proud of was having a plan ready to go."
Having managed the risk beforehand saved me a great deal of time and stress during an already stressful time.
Thinking through what most likely will go wrong and creating a mental process saves valuable mental energy.
"You don't need to even do anything, just think it through."
"Those who accept responsibility without shame, who remain calm, prioritize and act, and who identify and manage risk will succeed."
"Help isn't coming, you need to be the big damn hero in your own life."
"To my surprise in Big Sur, this also enables a dropdown menu of various extremely useful shortcuts."
Attention to detail on a whole new level and a great example of combining excellent UX with accessibility.
"You'll also note that the tools presented are categorised, which again, shows dedication to accessibility education."
"While seamless transitions are great for everybody, for many disabled folks it can be the deciding factor."
"It's this frame with three buttons: close, minimise and maximise."
"The M1 changes this, or better said, it enables the change."
The reality is that many of our desktop apps take up way too much space.
Look at all the iPhone and iPad apps we've all been using in portrait mode for ages.
"Many wouldn't see this as an obvious potential accessibility perk, and that's because it isn't obvious."
"Often those UX nice-touches , are what take accessibility too from bare-bones to a great experience for all."

"While current commercially available battery technologies sound discouraging and the aforementioned quite utopian, thankfully there is a middle-ground."
"In reality, no user cares about the size of the battery, but they do about the number of hours it lasts."
"It breaks their workflow, their activities have to revolve around being able to charge the device, etc."
That is unprecedented mobility and flexibility that disabled individuals will gain the most out of.
"The less obvious perk is that this makes it equally, if not more, a dream machine for everyone else."
"In an old article of mine, I explain some of the ways reading changes our brains."
"Amazingly, an activity which helps us absorb and learn so much information changes the physical structures of our brains for the better."
"If you're reading this, you obviously already know how to read."
They explain that research suggests the evidence that achieving relief from negative emotions by expressing them in writing is weak.
"When we write, especially when we write creatively, we're engaging our brains with several tasks at once."
"In particular, The Kensington White Plains say that writing is great for our grey matter."
Our brains on average are composed of around 60 percent white matter and 40 percent grey matter.
Our white matter cells are specialised to quickly pass messages from one cell to another.
"Our grey matter cells are important for motor and sensory functions, as well as learning and memory."
Keeping our grey matter healthy is important for our abilities to perform everyday tasks as sharply as possible.
"Handwriting engages several areas of the brain, more so than writing using word processors."
This increased activity helps our memory by solidifying connections between different areas of the brain.
There is also strong evidence to suggest that writing has health benefits.
"Strangely, writing can help relieve symptoms of pain experienced by sufferers of physical diseases."
"Moreover, it also keeps our grey matter young and strong, reducing the risks of neurodegenerative diseases."
"So, if you needed more incentives to keep writing, then I hope this article has given you some."
The pandemic has brought us many undesirable consequences not only to our daily routine but also to our mindset.
Different people experience different psychological after-effects they have never had before.
Some habits that we acquired during the last year like washing hands or give away banknotes forever - bring no harm.
"However, there are many other consequences that lay deeper and might be more damaging to our overall mental state."
"Here, by healthcare services, I mean both physiological and psychological."
Many people have found themselves literally unable to visit their mental health therapist or even a family doctor due to pandemic conditions.
"Even before the pandemic emerged, psychological care was not that accessible for many."
Some people have been still considering mental care as a overrated and expensive.
"Secondly, when you finally find a good therapist, usually their rate per hour is not very price-friendly for everyone."
"And also, a full therapy is usually a long-term process."
"As we see here, the problem of accessibility of mental care is there."
"Similar to many other industries, AI-powered tools have managed to close different gaps."
"Chatbots do not have a mind of their own, so they have to follow a pre-written script."
Ellie is created to detect verbal and nonverbal indications of PTSD by following a specially prepared script.

"The key to her success is that she listens without prejudice, allowing patients to fully open up."
Ellie was created to collect and gather information about patients but she cannot prescribe treatment or medicine.
"But are we far from getting an accessible AI therapist?They already exist, so not that far."
"Right now, if you want to get some AI-operated psychological help, you can talk to Siri or Alexa."
I thought that Siri would immediately shift me to Google or Safari under a query: 'I'm sad'.

Spanish came back fairly quickly as it was something she used frequently at work.
"After the first two classes, she wondered if she should have started out slower by taking calculus instead or maybe just algebra."
"She had mastered calculus in high school and had done pretty well in physics, too."
Now she was acing the Spanish II class but struggling with physics.
"Never a quitter, she forged ahead and was even considering using a tutor."
She grinned remembering the Valentine's Days in grade school when all the students decorated envelopes and taped them to their desks.
It was a fun tradition to have the class wind through the rows of desks distributing their Valentine cards to fellow students.
In fourth grade she had given a box of candy hearts to a boy she liked.
She wondered if any of them realized she was old enough to be their mother.
"To: Danielle was written neatly on the box but in the space following From: , there was only a pink heart."
"Scanning the room, she couldn't imagine who might have left it."
Danielle got comfortable in her chair as the class was about to start.
Her long strawberry blonde hair pulled loose from its hastily tied knot as she wrote in bold red letters Happy Valentine's Day!
Picking up a pink marker she framed the greeting with a big heart.
Then turning toward the class she smiled and looking directly at Danielle gave her a wink.

"If you're not sure what these guides are all about, I recommend you read my introduction to the freelance tax guide."
"If you're confused about any of the definitions I use here, check out the glossary."
"For the purposes of these guides, I'm going to describe your freelancing activities as your freelancing business."
"If you earn money from freelancing, you're a freelance business."
Your freelance business structure will have an impact on how you do business and the types of tax forms you file.
"In almost all cases, a sole proprietor or a single-member LLC will be suitable for most freelance tax needs."
Forming an S Corporation or a C Corporation is often far more than a freelancer needs to do.
You don't need to file any special paperwork to be a sole proprietor.
An LLC is considered legally separate from you for the purposes of separating and protecting your personal assets from your business ones.
It must file a Form 1065 in addition to other tax forms.
It must file a Form 1120S in addition to other tax forms.
"For more information on LLCs taxed as S Corporations, please see S Corporations below."
This freelance tax guide does not cover LLCs that choose to be taxed as an S Corporation.
The main benefit provided by a Freelance LLC business is liability protection which separates your business assets from your personal assets.
"It's also possible that being an LLC can boost your reputation, and make it easier to get a business bank account."
This is known as a multi-member LLC and is formed with the Secretary of State by filing Articles of Organization.
"For more information on forming an LLC that's taxed as an S Corproation, please see the section on S Corporations below."
A partnership is a type of business structure where two or more people share in the ownership of a business.
"Partnerships are out of scope for this series of guides, as they require extra tax filing forms and different accounting."
An S Corporation is a type of business structure that can be formed with your state.
There are certain costs associated with running an S Corporation that can significantly reduce the benefits of the tax savings.
There's also more of an administrative overhead for running an S Corporation.
You can always start a standard LLC and run that until it makes sense to file Form 2553 to convert to an S Corp.
A C Corporation is a type of business structure that can be formed with your state.
"C Corporations are not covered by this freelance tax guide as they require additional forms, filings, and paperwork."
Here are a few rule-of-thumb guides that can help you decide on the best structure for your freelance business.
"If you're a solo freelancer working by yourself, then your easiest option is to file taxes as a sole proprietor."
You don't need to file any special paperwork with your state to be treated as a sole proprietor.
You'll file a 1040 with Schedule C and Schedule SE at tax time.
"If you're in business with another freelancer, then you'll file taxes as a partnership."
You don't need to file any special paperwork with your state to be treated as a partnership.
"You'll file a 1040 with Schedule SE and Schedule K, and a 1065 Partnership return at tax time."
"To do this, you would create an LLC, then file Form 2553 with the IRS."
"You'll file a 1040 with appropriate Schedules, and an 1120S S Corporation return at tax time."
"You can also choose to form an S Corporation directly, although there are significant administrative overheads."
"Unless you're planning world domination as a freelancer, you're never likely to create a C Corporation."
"Alright, I think that's it for this part of the guide."
"Next, you'll want to get a few other things in place to make your freelance taxes that much easier."
"Imagine, God forbid, that a driver makes a horrible mistake and kills someone you love."
Is a robot that commits a felony a criminal or a defective machine?
To answer this question we first need to ask ourselves whether a robot could even be held responsible for its actions.
It's not uncommon to lay responsibility on entities that are not human.
"We have corporate law, we can sue companies, we can punish them."
"And so, the question of legally turning a robot into a criminal might actually depend on the robot."
"In 2017, the European Commission of Legal Affairs compiled a thorough report about robots and specifically about the question of liability."
The commission concluded that when a robot is autonomous beyond a certain level then it should be held accountable for its actions.
"But as robots become more sophisticated and intelligent, this doesn't longer have to be the case."
The study 'Robot Criminals' published in The University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform in 2019 tackled this issue.
Punishment is not only a tool to distance a criminal from the community but also aims to rehabilitate those who broke the rules.
What happens if a 'smart robot' damages someone's property?
Robots are a big part of our lives and keep getting bigger and more important.
We have already discussed the fact that a robot could not only make a mistake but also be liable for it.
Both groups were asked to check-in and check-out using the service robots at the front desk.
"One group was told to think of the robots as if they were humans , the second group was not."
"This time, the researchers used a robotic arm with a screen."
Participants sat down in front of the robot with two different snacks placed in front of them.
"The questions of robots' liability, punishment, and forgiveness are challenging but the debate is relevant and important."
"As machines are getting smarter, humans would have to think about all consequences of the co-life we will share."
"In 2019, the Henn-Na hotel actually 'laid off' half of its robot staff for causing too much trouble."
"Robots can, and would, be able to cause us real harm."
"We will have to choose whether to punish, and whether to forgive."
I think we're at a crucial point in this debate on school reopening right now.
"Remember also that they'll have to compete against private school kids, who are having a much more normal school year."
"More importantly, it's our our kids' mental health that's the real emergency."
"All over the country, mental health emergencies and hospital visits by kids are skyrocketing."
"All of Europe has done the right thing - schools are last to close, first to open."
I have never felt so alienated from the people I usually align myself with politically.
I will never understand how the left in this country has decided that advocating for putting kids first is somehow right-wing.
It's our most important job to do what's best for our kids.
"And if that means calling out teachers' unions, so be it."
Rhode Island was one of the few blue states that was committed to putting kids first.
"Your own kid might be doing ok in remote learning, but by and large, kids aren't doing well."
Just remember: the principles of child development haven't just vanished because we're in a pandemic.
It's still not good to have our kids in front of the screen for hours upon hours every day.
Kids still need to learn alongside other kids and still need to play with other kids.
"Now, here's where I'm gonna go in hard on the unions."
I know there are many teachers who don't feel the union represents them on this.
"If parents or anyone else could fill in so easily, why should we pay teachers more?"
"And no, the agreed upon deal with SF teacher's union isn't good enough because there's no reopening date."
"And if you think fall 2021 is safe for full reopening, think again."
I just want you all to understand that reaching a deal doesn't mean reopening will be happening soon.
Take a look at this graphic that someone shared on Twitter a few days ago.
Unions are a behemoth in California and parents are the only group of people advocating for our kids needs.
"First, it is false that only white parents want to reopen."
"So naturally, we tend to favor reopening, as we trust it can be done safely."
"However, we can't just ignore the role of white teachers in this dynamic."
"In this country, teachers are around 80% white - something people don't talk about."
"And yet, they're not a monolith either - many want and need their kids back in school."
Their voices are drowned out by unions insisting they speak for marginalized families.
"Parents will never choose ideological loyalty over their kids and the more unions dig in their heels, the angrier parents get."
Some who could never have fathomed sending their kids to private school are considering it now.
We honestly don't care if you decide to stay remote - that's your decision.
You will continue to have a choice - so give us the choice as well to send our kids back to school.

User research is no longer just about creating a smooth experience or quantifying the cost savings a product creates.
"As the need for user research is increasingly becoming tied to strategy, the demand for researchers has skyrocketed."
"Rather than prioritising one over the other, tech companies recognise the need for both."
"Without qualitative research, understanding why people behave the way the do or uncovering new unknown insights are often beyond reach."
"Without quantitative research, it's impossible to know the scale and impact of our qualitative findings or prioritise our next steps."
What is new about this relationship is the importance of their interaction working smoothly.
"Before recently, these two disciplines generally met under ad-hoc circumstances."
"With qual's new seat at the decision-making table, it's now increasingly important that both specialisms can collaborate effectively."
We're seeing the impact of this new role across multiple aspects of the researcher's job.
"Research is becoming a proactive, continuous function that isn't confined to pre-determined project timelines."
Identifying the core pains driving user behaviour must be proactive instead of a reactive response to the output of big data.
"As companies become more integrated cross-functionally, this need for researchers to become multilingual internal networkers only grows."
"Leading technology companies like Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter are ALL hiring mixed methods researchers right now."
Let's jump into some examples to explain the three types of mixed methods research.
Dynamic mixed methods is a new type of research that has been unlocked by advancements in technology.

"Also, some days might be more packed than the rest, making it impossible to complete a full-fledged morning routine."
"Once I started working out in mid-July, I've been pretty consistent at it every morning."
The main reason was that it was too cold where I live.
"I had zero motivation to change into workout clothes, pull out my Yoga mat, and start working out."
"Maybe if I went to the gym, it might have been more comfortable as going out of the house was motivation enough."
But at-home workouts were too hard to continue in the December chill.
"Things got so bad that one day, I decided it was enough."
"This gave me a reason to change, put on some music, and carry my Yoga mat upstairs."
"Not kidding, but it legit felt like if I can push myself to work out, I can do just about anything."
They apply not just to morning routines but also to any act of self-care.
People often complain that self-care is hard and they never have enough time.
The same is true for the kind of self-talk you're practicing.
"In this fast-paced world of today, self-care should be a priority, not an option."
"I create content in many different forms related to self-improvement, body-positivity, and feminism on several other platforms."

It's more of a word-watcher's curiosity about how a gifted writer used his word hoard.
It turned out that words Fitzgerald used most were not particularly interesting or enlightening.
"This derives from the Greek expression Hapax legomenon meaning, literally, something said only once."
"The method, appropriately, flags all words used only once in the novel."
The novel sent me to the dictionary several times to look up new words.
"Words used only by Fitzgerald, words used only by Van Dine, and words used by both."
The first is that F. Scott Fitzgerald did not use an especially challenging vocabulary for The Great Gatsby.
"This makes the novel suitable for readers of younger ages, say high school or first-year university students."
The second is that you don't need fancy words to create a masterpiece.
"S.S. Van Dine, though once highly popular, has faded into relative obscurity."
"S.S. Van Dine walks away with the prize for most interesting vocabulary, while F. Scott Fitzgerald walks away with a literary masterpiece."
The disastrous year of 2020 has led to an increase in downloads of meditation and mindfulness apps.
Scientists and politicians have mentioned that the coronavirus is here for the long haul as it continues to spread throughout the world.
"Like many, I turned to meditation when my life and mental health was in dire need of direction, grounding and improvement."
"Alongside, I took to Yoga to improve awareness and concentration outside of meditation."
There are many layers to mindfulness and its an art to be cultivated - an art everyone can make.
"Basically, what I have been talking about - mindfulness outside of meditation."
"Sometimes, reading and researching can just deter you from even starting."
So here are four simple ways you can get started on being mindful outside of meditation.
"If you can only take one thing away from this article, make it this one here."
"Just by being aware of your thoughts, experiences, and emotions is the sole act of being mindful."
Your mind is of its own but being aware of the mental fluctuations or mind chatters is the first step from breaking free.
I always say that you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped.
"Similarly, you can't change a situation that you aren't aware of."
"After being aware of your thoughts, there is no need to dismiss it immediately."
"Acknowledge that these thoughts, emotions, experiences, feelings and events are happening right now."
"Acknowledge that your mind has wandered off to the past, the future or a hypothesis."
We don't need to dismiss them because these thoughts are a part of you.
They come up for a reason; dismissing it would be avoidance.
"If your situation allows you to, you can write it down in your journal or on your mobile."
But it isn't necessary since you are trying to be present in the moment you are experiencing.
"You take a step back and view your emotions, thoughts or experiences from a distance, observing it as a separate object."
Self-forgiveness allows you to process your material and release the anchors in your mind to start enforcing positive actions and intentions.
Forgiving others means to let yourself be free - to remove the knot that binds two minds and their associated suffering.
Those are the four ways that you can start incorporating informal mindfulness practices in your daily life.
"It doesn't matter if you just start with awareness, because that is what I did too."
"Mindfulness is a practice, and it isn't a one size fits all approach to life."
"Always be patient with yourself because ultimately, there isn't an end goal."
It is the commitment and the promise to yourself to lead a more intentional and conscious life.
Life doesn't begin when you reach a goal or a place; it is the present moment itself.
We live in a time where the number of hours you work in a week is worn as a badge of honor.
Then there are those who work less then average but still get the results we want - if not more.
Sometimes it's about how they approach their work that gets them the results that we have to work countless hours for.
"Here are 4 signs that you could be busy but unproductive, and what you can do to turn things around."
One of the best ways I significantly decreased these feelings of overwhelm was by externalizing my brain.
I realized I didn't need the mental clutter of trying to remember everything all the time.
Some people put all their to do's and goals in one notebook.
In my experience what worked better wasn't keeping all these lists in one place.
I found it calming having more than one 'external brain'.
Give your brain a break by figuring out different ways to externalize it today.
Your mental health will thank you when it no longer feels the 'weight of the world' daily.
People who are productive know the next 5 moves that have the biggest impact in getting them where they need to go.
People who are productive are too busy moving forward to get caught up checking their progress every hour.
"Sometimes they don't even need to check, because their results are proof enough whether they're moving forward or not."
Identify your 5 major moves and afterward be strict in spending most of your time dedicated to those specific tasks.
"I have been caught up in busywork in the past, but I've learned to be mindful of my activities."
"If it's the latter, I out loud will say, doesn't matter before redirecting myself to what is worth doing."
We should have an idea of who we want to be with steps to get there.
One way to determine if you're more a dream-er than a do-er is if you produce weekly outputs.
"When we look at the definition of productivity it is: being able to generate, produce or bring forth goods and services."
"If you aren't generating or producing something regularly, your dream or goal will likely only continue to exist in your head."
"Inspired from that idea, I've limited consuming to 'just enough'."
Today I plan 'just enough' to give me a sense of direction.
"When I'm researching ways to improve, I consume 'just enough' to prepare for my next task."
People who are more productive spend less time thinking and more time executing.
"You may not know everything to succeed at your goal, but you likely know enough to at least move a step forward."
"You can read everything about swimming, but you'll only really learn how when you're in the water."
But they don't break these down into short term goals to get there.
People who are productive know exactly what they want and when they want it to happen.
"Busy but unproductive people are still moving, but they never arrive anywhere."
Goals every 3 months gives you that needed sense of urgency to get things done.
Ninety days is also enough time to gather data to see if what you're doing is working or not.
"If not, pivot and see if the next 3 months of action bring you closer to your yearly goals."
No one wants to slave away countless hours only to not get what they want.
Begin to trim the fat of busy-ness so that you can be truly productive instead.
"As the spirit of 2020 lingers like a houseguest not catching the hint, our national resilience is starting to wear through."
Saying this grates against the grain of our collective ethos of personal responsibility.
"If you aren't ok, then what are you doing about it?There's a pill for that."
"If we were better, if we were more prepared; we would be ok."
"If we had made a different choice - gone right when we veered left, we wouldn't be in this mess."
"We just need to think positively, and it will all work out."
"Hoping for the best is all well and good, but only if you prepare for the worst."
Forty percent of Americans cannot cover a $400 emergency without borrowing.
"We self-castigate and run through what we should have known, what we should have done better."
"We don't want to think about it, so we tell ourselves that it will all be fine."
"Positivity has its place, but focusing on the bright side at the expense of reality is a problem."
It's not all good when the same negative feelings bubble up time and time again.
"Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US, particularly for men."
"Generations of men have been told to man up and fight, drink, or push those feelings away."
"It's not all good, and it hasn't been all good for a long while."
You don't need to feel proud of them; you don't need to defend them.
"Be kind to your future self, and just embrace those feelings now."
Isn't it about time to accept that it isn't all good?
"I was, I must confess, initially bemused by the whole experience."
"Today, YouTube is purportedly the second-most visited website after Google."
This would be fine if free access to knowledge and education didn't matter.
Free and widespread access to knowledge and information and training do matter.
"It empowers them to learn in their own way, and on their own terms."
"And increasingly, it's where platforms like YouTube are ushering in a revolution in casual, or self-directed, learning."
"It's been an interesting nine years since the channel launched, with plenty of frustrations and pointed learning experiences along the way."
And it has its fair share of clunkers in the 100+ videos that have been posted to date.
"Yet despite this, the channel has been successful in providing expert content in areas that are otherwise poorly served."
And these are just some of the topics where the channel's videos are meeting the needs of casual learners.
It's an approach that's both described in the paper and outlined in a series of online tutorials.
It's also due in part to careful attention to search engine optimization.
"For example, very few people search YouTube for videos on responsible innovation."
"But when they do, the first thing they see is a Risk Bites video."
"This, to me, is a critical insight gained from producing the channel."
The paper How to Succeed as an Academic on YouTube can be accessed for free in the Journal Frontiers in Communication.
I built it on a concept by a Disney animator called Francis Glebas.
They are focused on the words they are hearing or reading and the literal representations of images on the screen or page.
"Below the line, then, is everything the audience is not consciously aware of."
Juxtaposition refers to the ideas that are generated in the audience's mind by two images being placed next to each other.
"For example, how a low angle shot makes the subject appear powerful."
"This opens us up to the world of semiotics, a vast unexplored land of visual storytelling."
You might notice there is more below the line than above it.
No new form of social media has been as promising since Snapchat debuted Stories in 2013.
"And like Stories, there's a case to be made that the primary beneficiary will not be the originator."
"Clubhouse, which pioneered this format, has built something special, no doubt."
"The discussions in its rooms feel timely, entertaining, and sometimes a bit edgy."
"People, in other words, expect to earn status from the effort they put into creating stuff on social media."
"Young people, for example, stay away from Twitter because it's difficult to reach anyone with their tweets."
"Clubhouse's early boom is, in part, a land grab for status."
"People who spend time there sit in rooms, speak, and then revel in the followings they're building."
"Nearly every early Clubhouse user I speak with brings up their follower count unprompted, and most within the first five minutes."
Building a following on Clubhouse gives you an opportunity to reengage your followers in another room sometime down the road.
A Twitter follower is therefore more valuable than a Clubhouse follower when it comes to building social capital.
Twitter Spaces' toughest challenge will be matching Clubhouse's ability to highlight interesting rooms.
"This experience fundamentally is the same thing, Twitter product head Kayvon Beykpour told me in a conversation on Spaces last night."
An engaged userbase filled with some of the world's most prominent people.
"When Elon Musk goes on Clubhouse, it's a news story."
"Finally, Twitter needs this and will do everything in its power to give it a chance."
Twitter conversations have become so toxic that opening the app fills people with dread.
"Spaces, in a best-case scenario, could help people see each other as humans, not 2D avatars."
"The conversation will, with 100% certainty, be more productive than a Twitter spat."
"And sometime soon, we could be seeing this type of engagement regularly, perhaps in the same app."
"I haven't invested in either company, unlike many of Clubhouse's core evangelists."
"That said, I've been studying the service for a long time, and believe Spaces is a particularly unique fit."
But everything seems aligned for Twitter Spaces to become the next iteration of Instagram Stories.
"I appear on Mesh Lakhani's fantastic Talk Money podcast to discuss becoming an independent journalist, along with some other creators."
"You can check it out on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Overcast."

"After wine tasting in a lot in South Africa, when I lived there in the Cape winelands, it became my hobby."
What's been surprising about wine tasting around the world is that it's not just the wine that's different.
"Of couse, if you drink wine you know that the wines from Spain and Italy taste different."
"You know that every country, every region, every grape, every producer, every vineyard, produces a different wine."
Part of what any wine drinker loves about wine is the diversity from bottle to bottle.
They have experiences where you sit gazing across the vines and spend three hours sampling nine or ten different wines accompanied with food.
"It's a slow, leisurely afternoon in the sun, complete and utter relaxation, complete and utter indulgence."
A celebration of wine and a celebration of the diversity of wine South Africa produces.
"It's a completely different experience to wine tasting in Mendoza, in Argentina."
And the difference in Mendoza is that the wine estates offer very similar wines of different qualities.
You will go for a tasting and there will be three different Malbecs.
"An understanding created by walking through the vines, by exploring the production process, by following Malbec wine from grape to glass."
"We can go to Tuscany, where the wine tasting comes in two types."
And then there are the wine estates where you must make a booking.
"The wine estates that will provide outstanding service, a truly personal and intimate experience."
"These are the wine estates that only travel designers, only exceptional guides know about - the boutique producers."
This is a country where there are so many wine estates it is impossible to know where to start.
"You can't go out driving, see a wine estate and decide to go in and check it out."
"I have done that and the wine was okay, but it was nothing better than what I had in a local restaurant."
"And as part of that, there's going to be an enormous selection of great Italian wine."
"A bar that only serves wine, accompanied with small bites called pinchos ."
"Picture a chalkboard menu, and ten to twenty different Rioja wines available to drink by the glass."
"And then, two or three hundred vintage Rioja wines available by the bottle."
"And a wonderful thing about going to these small wine bars is that they're not just in bars, vinotecas."
"They are actually a connection to the underground cellars, a labyrinthine underground cellar network that exists in Rioja's towns."
Because the truth is that many countries have incredible wine regions-and their wine tastes and experiences are always different and unique.

Her tweets sparked outrage among Indonesians and drew the ire of local authorities.
"In March 2020, amid the outbreak and lockdowns, the couple decided to stay in Bali."
They believed that such a move was the best decision for them as they experienced Bali's best life.
"Towards the end of her thread, she started encouraging her followers in the U.S. to follow in their footsteps."
"She then promoted their eBook, Our Bali Life is Yours, to all her followers."
"She was emphasizing that Bali is a safe, cheap, luxurious, and queer-friendly island."
It would have been an inspiring narrative to promote a business on social media using a rags-to-riches account.
Some locals were also appalled when Gray promoted Bali for LGBTQ+ couples.
The locals themselves were even struggling to come out to the public due to Indonesia's strict laws about same-sex couples.
"Gray defended herself, stating that they were experiencing such persecution because they are two Black gay women."
Her statement rage the locals more lecturing her that Indonesia is not America.
They were also banned from entering Indonesia for six-months after their deportation.
"In an interview, social psychologist Benny Siauw said the way Gray mentioned Bali as a queer-friendly place is highly ignorant."
"As a citizen of a developing nation in Southeast Asia, my passport is not as powerful as the American passport."
Many countries won't allow me to enter their borders without proper documents.
"Especially in this day and age, where everything is a click away, being ignorant of the law excuses no one."
Here is a research checklist I recommend based on personal experience that can relate to this case study.
"I bet for those who are reading this, religion may not be their first priority."
"When the Portuguese, and later the Dutch, occupied the nation, they introduced Christianity to the Indonesians."
"Apart from Islam and Christianity, Hinduism and Confucianism are also evident religious practices."
Citizens of this country had to carry their identification cards stating their religions.
"The state does not recognize atheism and agnosticism as these two were considered blasphemous, illegal, and punishable by law."
"Nonetheless, to have a harmonious environment, despite palpable differences, Indonesians respect each others' faith preferences."
"Western countries may not give a fuss about religious practices, but most parts of Asia, Latin America, and Africa do."
Researching about such would give you an idea if you could adjust to the local culture and traditional practices.
You need to understand that nations with high religious commitment influence their society's lifestyle and policies.
"Tradition disapproves of homosexuality, cross-dressing, and gender transitioning, which impacts their public policies."
Indonesian same-sex couples are not eligible for any of the legal protections available to opposite-sex married couples.
"Being gay in Indonesia may not be a crime, but it is highly condemned by society due to traditional religious norms."
Having the discernment of a nation's public policies that would affect your status is essential.
Moving to a country that has significantly different values from yours is risky.
The best thing you can do is immerse yourself without creating a scene because you are not a resident.
"At the end of the day, you are an alien with limited rights."
"Indonesia is a developing country, and locals themselves are working hard to make a living."
"In the midst of a global pandemic, the people are already struggling to make ends meet."
"For Americans, inclusive monthly costs to live a grander life in Bali is only $1,900 USD."
"However, for the locals, this is already costing them over 26 million IDR."
Bali's cost of living for the locals is like the Americans' California - way too expensive.
"If you choose to pursue your business overseas, then level the playing field."
Apply for a visa that allows you to operate a business in a foreign land.
"Several digital nomads may argue that it's unnecessary, as many could get away with it."
"Mostly, a tourist visa only allows you to stay for 30-90 days - and working is not part of that."
"So, being a digital nomad as a profession is technically illegal."
Visa laws in most countries are not set up to deal with this new class of modern vagabonds.
"But, since it became apparent, some nations are recognizing its permanence as a profession."
"If none of these are available, at least secure a proper permit where you can operate legally."
"Bear in mind, having deportation or a criminal record overseas will affect your future visa applications."
"Don't merely research for accommodations, food, and leisure places."
"Learn the country's economic status, your rights as a foreigner, policies, beliefs, and practices."
"Apply for a proper visa to make your profession and business legal, hassle-free, and relatable to the locals."
They would support you more because you are promoting their nation and culture respectfully instead of exploiting it.
"Thus, you are playing your game fairly and not stealing their privileges."
"When you land on foreign soil, you will be following that country's regulations."
You need to make adjustments because that country will never ever adjust for you.
"The Marketing Department agrees, and you set off to refresh your memory on how to actually analyse the data."
"The title kind of gives it away, but you need to be familiar with Bayes Theorem."
Bayes Theorem gives us a way to model how our prior belief about something changes after observing new data.
"The above definition is for discrete variables, for continuous variables it is defined for probability density functions."
This basically says how likely different values of 𝜃 are after taking into account the data we have observed and our prior belief.
"If you have no idea, you can choose an uninformative prior, for example, that all possible values are equally likely."
"Whatever the case, one thing is certain: rate metrics can only take values between 0 and 1!"
"Therefore, we need a prior distribution that reflects that, such as the Beta distribution."
"The Beta distribution has two parameters you can play with, 𝛼 >0 and 𝛽>0"
Let's look at some plots to get some intuition on how they affect the shape of the density function.
If we want an uninformative prior we can choose 𝛼=1 and 𝛽=1 - there's obviously no mode in this case.
This Beta-Binomial prior-likelihood combo is chosen often because they are conjugate priors.
Once we have the posteriors we can do interesting comparisons to find and declare the winner.
We are going to find the answer by sampling from the posterior distributions for each group's click-through rate.
This may look like a lot of code but most of it is just for creating some plots.
"Lines 23 to 35 are the important ones, where we sample from the posteriors and calculate the distribution of differences."
There's another way you can use the posteriors to conclude your experiment which we haven't implemented here.
If the HDI does not intersect our ROPE we conclude that the two groups are different.
"Using the code from the previous section, you can simply do the followingto quickly get an answer."
There are more pairs of distributions that are conjugate priors and therefore can be used easily.
I was quite disappointed as I was hoping to apply for some yoga teacher jobs and earn money with my hobby.
My goal was to teach in 2-3 studios and work there next to my full-time job.
"Then the lockdowns came, and all my beloved studios closed for several months."
"Today, I know that the lockdowns were the best possibility for me to set up my own online yoga business."
"Since September, I'm teaching regular classes online, and my subscribers' quote increases continuously."
"In the beginning, I thought that teaching online wasn't really my thing."
It can be frustrating and impersonal to only communicate with your clients via Zoom.
Your clients may also feel tired by their daily home-office routine and need a more versatile and appealing offer.
The pandemic requests creative solutions from yoga and fitness instructors to stay motivated and provide stimulating classes to their clients.
People still need yoga in their lives especially because of lockdowns and quarantines.
"Today, I find value in my online classes because I know that they help me think outside the box."
"Also, they allow people to escape their monotonous lockdown-life and experience something pleasant."
"The demand for online courses is enormous, and you will benefit from it personally and financially."
Here's how you can realize your online business ideas and evolve your career as a successful online yoga teacher.
Before you start creating your brand and designing your website you should think about what you want to offer.
Your income should allow you to cover all your costs and earn a nice sum with your hobby every month.
"In general, I'd still recommend offering them when you provide more than one class per week."
Students who want to practice regularly can benefit from a well-priced monthly pass.
Start with fewer classes in the beginning and see how it works out.
"Also, not all your classes have to be 90-minute Vinyasa Flows."
There are multiple possibilities to vary the time and style of your courses.
Here are some examples:Offer what feels right for you and always ask your students for feedback.
You can also do a survey from time to time and determine if you can adjust your offer for the better.
"After you've thought about your offer, you can start creating your logo or let someone design it for you."
"Your business can definitely profit from beautiful fonts, pictures, and gadgets."
Not only your website but also your social media accounts should look aesthetically appealing.
You don't have to spend tons of money on good designers.
Ensure that these colors represent your style and personality and that you can identify yourself with them.
You can use your logo and personalized color palette to create an appealing account on Instagram or Facebook.
It's definitely worth it to invest time and money into the design.
Your brand will look professional and pleasant and you'll eventually attract more clients.
"After creating your brand, it's time to set up your website."
It's for your advantage to make your brand visible on as many platforms and channels as possible.
Another crucial and successful investment I've made is my booking system.
Students can use the system to check out my offer and book my classes independently.
"As suggested by my business coach @Eva Keiffenheim, I chose the booking system momoyoga.com."
"In general, I can highly recommend this platform!You'll reach many yogis over Instagram."
"If you aren't into social media platforms, I'd recommend using them in a limited way."
Set up a minimalistic and beautiful feed and only post a few stories or pictures a month.
You can use the platforms to promote your most important news and offers.
"In this way, I remind my followers that I'm offering classes regularly."
Always integrate your logo and your website and contact details into your newsletter's signature.
Before I started to send newsletters regularly I only addressed my Instagram users.
"Since I'm sending them regularly, my client base became broader."
"With a newsletter, you can address more people regardless of which social media accounts they use."
"During the last months, I often received positive feedback from my students in terms of my offer."
"I teach my regular classes, but every month I try to offer a special."
"These specials can relate to the season, current events, or something you'd like to share with your students."
To name a few:Give your students multiple inputs and possibilities to practice with you.
Make sure that the sound of your microphone is pleasing and that the room is well illuminated.
"If you want to play music during the class, be careful that the sound is pleasant."
I decided to create playlists for my classes and send the playlist link to my students in advance.
They can decide if they want to turn on the music at home or not.
"It's easier for me to let them decide, and I don't have to worry about my classes' sound quality."
Another decisive point is the variety of asanas and stimuli during your classes.
"If you do the same asanas every week, students will finally become bored and stop making progress."
This book helped me to get an insight into the economic approach of yoga.
Don't be discouraged if there aren't so many bookings in the beginning.
Keep on teaching and offering and you'll see that there'll be more and more students after a while.
Stay in contact with your yogis and ask them how they feel after class.
Act as you would still teach at a studio and give them your genuine attention.
"Your classes can still be personal, even if there's a physical distance."
I bet most Facebook users are not aware of what they really know about them.
"I am grateful for all the good Facebook brought so far, and I appreciate the company."
"After a few hours, I have received a link to my email."
"So I looked at the JSON files, which contained a lot of information that the HTML versions were missing."
I wanted to see the entire picture in front of my eyes.
"No way I'm gonna look after everything, file by file, or page by page."
I implemented a custom LogStash file stream that preprocessed the interesting JSON files from the downloaded ZIP archive to ElasticSearch.
An ElasticSearch service from the stack would index all my events that ever took place inside Facebook's servers regarding my data.
"Later on, We are going to visualize the data and research it using Kibana."
I ran docker-compose up and it all started to play.
"After some samples went through ElasticSearch, I created index patterns manually using 1 click."
"Finally, through Kibana, and started to work with these pieces of data and understand what I was facing."
Facebook receives much of its information from 3rd party apps and services.
"Nevertheless, Facebook had my browsing history for a variety of websites."
"They know which sites I view, even when looking at previews."
And CUSTOM data events - some nasty data they rather not name - that got me asking-
"If that wasn't enough, I can also find profile_information.json among the files."
I am a co-founder of DATU.A platform that lets you control your online data without providing any sensitive information.
"DATU Scans only the information you choose to add, nonstop, to find possible security and privacy issues."
"You will find exactly, which parts of your identity were compromised, leaked, or copied without you knowing."
"Real private-caring users, what will help us understand what features you like the most."
We can't access your data and we will never do anything related to your data.
"Of all the risks with adopting a design system, the most dangerous one is to keep working the same way."
"If that happens, what we have adopted is not a design system, but rather a UI component library."
"We might see benefits in the beginning: the UI looking fresher and more consistent, components nicely cataloged and documented."
"However, with time, the same old problems will re-surface."
"Inconsistencies will creep in, design critiques will get long and frustrating, component variants will multiply."
These are system-level problems-and those cannot be solved by a component library.
Each is tightly coupled with the entity it represents and has evolved over the years to take many interesting shapes.
"We take Material Design and start by theming colours and typography, then go to basic components like buttons and form elements."
"We take each teaser type, collect all the use cases we can find, and create a new component."
"The only two buttons possible are accept and decline , and both can be represented by an icon."
We build this using components from our new design system and rest.
"We'll see two problems:Before diving in, we take a closer look at Material Design cards."
"They're not there for inspiration, they're meant to solve things."
And our teasers are exactly the case they were designed to solve.
"Now the focus has shifted: instead of building many teaser components, we're building one - the card."
How is this better?Our teaser is no longer a one-off thing; it belongs to a family.
"It'll look like other cards, existing or yet to be built."
"Moreover, whatever solutions we are going to come up with now will benefit future card layouts we build."
"So not only are we building on a foundation, we extending the foundation as well, making the system stronger."
"Even before considering what can go into each area, we can foresee potential variations and address those."
"If there're no actions, should the info area take up the full width?"
"If there's no info, should the actions slide to the left?"
Where do we position the toggle - left side maybe?Then we move into the areas and see what can happen there.
"If there's only one action, should it stretch to the entire area?"
"It's good to have actions, info blocks, and state toggles."
"But as long as we resolve them on the system level, those are good mistakes to make."
"After this news, bitcoin jumps 14% to a record of $44,000."
Etherum also surges 7%.Tesla said that this decision was part of its investment policy and was targeted at maximizing its cash returns.
Tesla's investment is a strong sign that the electronic currency is gaining broad attention as a type of investment globally.
"Musk has been backing up the currency, even adding #bitcoin in his profile and tweeting in its favor."
"Recently, He called 'Bitcoin' a good thing to invest in."
It hit a record this Monday after Musk and Rapper snoop dog tweeted regarding it.
"A senior market analyst, Edward Moya said,In 2020 Bitcoin gained over 300% and almost 50% up this year."
Some technical analysts suggested that current resistance and pull back will breakout and take $BTC to $63K with some exceptions.
All those who are investing have to keep their eyes open to get blasting profit from this currency.
Fairy tales do not admit that the course of true love never did run smooth.
Not that Seymour would have listened even if every story about a prince and a princess came with a trigger warning.
What mattered was whether you had the courage to continue when the illusion wore off.
"While the illusion was strong, he decided to gamble on Seymour and courage."
"The intimacy of this was heightened by an intricate, complex history he dared not look at too closely."
It had a cheap oxidized paint job that may have been green once but was now a rusty grey.
They were looking at the swirling flight of blackbirds over the harbor.
The noise and stench of the car became part of the insult.
"No other Blacks had disembarked, and none were visible in the touristy small-town shopping area near the ferry landing."
"It was not their first test, and they knew it would not be the last."
"Maybe that journey is one of the reasons I love you, he said."
And we wouldn't have people shouting at us from cars either.
"As the remaining cars rolled and bumped off the ferry, Moses and Seymour Hathaway walked to their hotel in silence."
"Seymour hunches over the thick white neck of a large horse, galloping fast through the foggy predawn morning."
"He pulled off the red Stanford hoodie, threw his wallet and keys on a table."
"Later, at breakfast overlooking the harbor, she said: I understand about the wallet."
It's more like taking an umbrella even when the sun is shining.
"Because no matter what the forecast says, there's always a chance it might rain."
"Over the next five years, Seymour rides the white horse many times."
Sometimes he's running on a quiet street without his wallet and ID.
Once she sees him standing in their garage holding up a cell phone.
"Do you still believe in hope, he asked her one night during the pandemic."
"You are a duke, and the world we live in is completely colorblind."
"But we are very rich, very comfortable and very much in love."
"I don't know if it's a past life, or a future one, or just wishful thinking."
"But somehow that other world, that other reality or whatever it is, helps me deal with this one."
"The one where I must always worry about you, especially when you go jogging."
There's a show on Netflix that's getting a lot of buzz.
"Think of it as a love potion, not that we need one."
"And for the first time since their wedding, he entered her dreams."
"Decrying the height of these buildings seems almost laughable; this is New York, after all."
"Height, excess and exclusivity are currents that run through the history of New York."
"Its cruciform lobby, marbled walls, mosaic inlays and muraled walls are a 1913 remix of ecclesiastical language and filthy lucre."
The skyscraper in New York IS a religion; the religion of displayed wealth.
"Abodes for the wealthy, at their best, are testing grounds for the ideas and technologies we will all inherit."
"We want the tallest, the most exclusive and the most expensive, even if we can only gawk from the sidewalk."
But even that makes sense if we consider that real estate families are the '5 Families' of modern NYC.
"As in mafia families, except they tend to be Jewish, not Italian, and there are more than 5."
"Buildings this tall, even when they are much, much broader, get a lot of pressure from the wind."
"It's like trying to do a yoga stance on one foot with someone jabbing you off balance, but with catastrophic consequences."
"Even at 1:7 and a lower total height, the WTC moved when the wind blew."
"But of course it was supposed to move, and it could have moved a lot more if it didn't panic people."
"We were in my Woolworth Building office in 2011 when the August 5.8 magnitude earthquake occurred, and we surely felt it."
"Woolworth is built with enormous steel gussets, huge riveted braces to stiffen the frame of the building, every few floors."
When the earthquake shook the ground back and forth that motion was transmitted to us on the 20th floor with frightening fidelity.
"Cabinets rattled and the motion was obvious, but its source was not."
Just a few blocks from the WTC we looked at each other and bolted for the door.
"We ran the 20 stories down the fire stairs to get out of the building, not knowing what was happening."
"Recent TMD examples move more than 10' laterally, which can offset a couple of feet of movement."
At the Burj Khalifa in Dubai movement can be a couple of meters!
It caused a massive effort to reinforce the building before that fall's hurricane season.
"The tiny pushes are cumulative, and that discovery happened, on film, to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge."
Tuned mass dampers prevent the accumulation of forces from adding up to overpowering ones.
"They also take up space at the most dramatic height of the building, the same areas that command the highest sale prices."
So clever ways to reduce the length of the pendulum are a big part of TMD design.
The movement of everything else in the building is the likely cause of the billionaire's complaints.
But it is emblematic of the entitlement the super-wealthy feel.
"It was hard to see which of the requirements might be planted, as they were all so insane."
"Or 'manager's hotel suite shall be a minimum of 1,200 sf and painted in manly earth tones'."
When the walls creak it might as well be Wes Craven at work.
They must just not be working hard enough to deserve the free breakfast.
It's true for the super rich as well as those 'just getting by'.
"It makes mothers feel isolated and alone, unable to connect with their children and family life."
"The truth is that trauma-related dissociation isolates us, but this is a lie."
"Yes, I am struggling, but I know I am not alone."
There is a spectrum when it comes to dissociation and dissociative disorders.
"Depersonalization is feeling disconnected from self, whilst derealization is feeling disconnected from the world around you."
"It is possible to have one or the other, but usually, people struggle with both."
"It can also be a symptom of other conditions such as PTSD, Complex-PTSD, depression, or anxiety."
"But by engaging with my son on a deeper level, I am reminded that I am not alone."
"I am with my son, in a safe place where I am loved."
I don't need to check out of reality or float above my body.
"Inside I wanted to spend several days in bed, stuck in the dream world, tucked safely away from the truth."
I feel dazed and disorientated because I can't remember where I've been inside my head or what I was thinking of.
"The reality is bleak - so more than ever, I want to check out of reality."
"Simultaneously, I have too much time on my hands and find myself getting stuck in traumatic memories more frequently."
I don't want him to grow up feeling like he has a mother that comes and goes.
"My son needs me, and I have a small support system that isn't always available."
I do not want him to suffer just because Mummy is suffering.
Reading a good book with my son is another activity that helps me to be fully present with my son.
"I pick a story we both like, such as a Harry Potter book."
"I am reading out loud, listening to my son's thoughts and laughter."
"I am reminded that there are good things in this world, a message which so many trauma survivors need to hear."
Add in a pandemic and mental health struggles and it becomes an unsettling roller coaster.
"Here we go again; another day, same old negative thoughts."
I have woken up with these types of thoughts for quite a long time.
"I guess at some point I accepted it as part of me, never to question it."
"As the years' progress, left unchecked, these thoughts became louder and more frequent."
I remember days waking up with a heavy feeling in my chest.
"Sometimes these feelings were so strong, that I cried out of nowhere while doing random stuff during the day."
"It felt like everything was about to go wrong suddenly, and I couldn't do anything."
"For whatever reason, I accepted this as the life of a person living on their own."
Not for one moment did I commit to truly digging into why I am stressed with life.
"Looking back, I wonder why it took all of that to happen for me to take time and look within me."
"But frankly, I was too mad to objectively look within to really understand this question and answer it."
"Well, it's a brain with the ability to focus on nothing whatsoever, jumping from one useless thought to another."
It's usually trying to avoid focusing on something important and perceive it as a difficult task.
"This lack of focus, unfortunately, would just increase the time for me to start the journey to recover my life."
I was suffering the consequences of unchecked negative thoughts over the years.
"All these years of negative thoughts, without any conscious effort to filter or stop them, transformed my mind."
It became a negative mind - a mind easily susceptible to negative self-talk and thoughts.
"Looking back, I ended up viewing life through a lens of negativity."
This led to me taking further decisions or actions that resulted in more of the same negative outlook.
"Now that I was aware of all this, I didn't know what to do about it."
I mean I knew that I needed to stop thinking negatively and try and be positive and the usual blah blah blah.
"Nothing really worked at first, but I did start to notice some changes in my thoughts."
"Slowly but surely, I started to glue together ideas in my own way that made sense to me."
I wasn't quite sure how to encapsulate these ideas that were marinating in my head.
It perfectly captured all the ideas into 1 ultimate concept and gave me a method to push back on negative thoughts.
And the concept:You are not your mind!You and your mind are two different entities.
"Right now as you read these exact words, your mind must be flowing with thoughts."
"Some of which are perhaps, on this article and the concept I just mentioned."
"If you are able to make this very observation, you might have already internalized this concept."
"Unfortunately, people have the habit of confusingly identifying being themself, with their thoughts."
"Just because your mind has some thoughts, you do not have to identify yourself with those thoughts."
"Your mind is an entity, which most probably is very untrained and is flowing with an endless monologue of thoughts."
Read the last few paragraphs a couple of times over and let it marinate in that head for some time.
This concept is at the core of pushing back on the negative thoughts and reclaiming a better life.
So how did I internalize this concept and use it to push back the negative thoughts?
By learning to be aware of the present!The key to understanding this concept is to become aware of the present moment.
"When you are aware of the present, you are aware of your environment and yourself, at that moment in time."
"When you do that, it will help you to observe your mind, identifying it as a completely different entity than yourself."
"It took me a while, but I learned to become aware of the present, by doing a simple breathing exercise."
"Oh, and don't worry if you can't listen to any chatter from your mind when you do this exercise."
"If instead, you can only hear your breathing and environment, your mind has fallen silent."
"Anytime I feel overwhelmed, I pause whatever I am doing, and repeat this exercise."
I become aware of the present and know that I am not my mind.
I observe the thoughts in my head and try not to judge them.
I am aware that all this chatter is from a negative mind.
"For whatever reason, it is worried, perhaps due to a recent negative incident or difficult task."
"And now, it is pilling on one negative thought after the other."
Simply because it finds it easier to attract negative thoughts than positive ones.
I have consumed a lot of materials on this topic and the learning never ends.
"But just understanding this 1 concept - You are not your mind , made a huge difference to my everyday life."
Becoming aware of the present moment in time is the key to internalizing and applying the concept of you are not your mind .
It turns you into an observer of your mind rather than getting into an endless conversation with it.
They don't teach us tools or mechanisms to keep these types of thoughts in check.
"Recent research has shown that our minds, by default, are wired to focus on negative thoughts."
"This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, where we had to be aware of negative information about our environment."
You can read more about this research at the University of California site here.
There are two terms that are commonly used: Tint & Shade.
"A tint is the brighter color version, which means it's mixed with white."
"Whereas, Shade is the darker color version, which means it's mixed with black."
"And, to be honest, these are the very basics that are there to be known by everybody."
"Now, while our daily consumption period of digital media, we observe many color combinations that seem to be just not working."
"It's one of the best tools in my toolkit, and after encouraging leaders to implement them, they get hooked too."
"When I'm conducting a stay interview, the initial responses come off as nervous."
Leadership and human resources conduct stay interviews to help managers understand why employees stay and what might cause them to leave.
"In an effective stay interview, managers ask standard, structured questions to gather valuable insight from their employees."
"While a more close-knit and relaxed company culture accompanies small businesses and startups, there is always room for improvement."
"I attended a human resources conference and met Dr. Bob Nelson, a best-selling author on employee recognition."
His memorable stories from how recognition developed into a make or break it occurrence in the workplace shifted my mindset.
"The current size barely missed the cutoff, and shipping defaulted to a more expensive and larger package."
"The company saved $500,000 from a suggestion they didn't even know they needed."
"Asking for recommendations from employees can create cost savings, increased revenue, and making employees feel recognized."
It's important to receive feedback with an open mind and treat any criticism as constructive.
The feedback affected the route we chose to take care of our team.
"At the end of the day, health insurance premiums cost too much."
"While our company covered a portion of the premiums, adding dependents wasn't affordable for everyone."
Improving health insurance costs for our team addressed the #1 concern and made the most impact on our employees' happiness.
Suggestions on improving the company benefit both the employer and the employee.
Leaders engage in a dialogue with their employees to formulate ideas and solutions for the company's progress.
"While some executives hesitate to share the bad, it can remove candidates who aren't cut out for the job."
"For example, if an open position requires working nights and weekends, make that clear."
"Indicate that some nights and weekends are required for a salaried employee, especially during the company's busy season."
"Communicate the comprehensive perks and benefits, salary, bonus structure, and anything to paint a complete picture for prospective employees."
Companies must make adjustments like completing new hire paperwork online to ensuring managers engage with employees remotely.
Securing company equipment arrives for the employees is also critical for a smooth start.
Asking employees about their onboarding can help leaders improve their onboarding process for the future.
"While recruiting external talent is necessary, this strategy should blend with promoting internal employees."
"Training employees lead to higher productivity, reduced turnover, and alignment with the organization's needs."
It's hard to find an employee who is the right fit for your company and team.
"In those cases, developing employees to their full potential can provide a fantastic return on investment."
This can also help determine who the employee will receive training from.
"If there is a monetary contribution on the company's end, these conversations will initiate considerations within its budget."
Sample questions to ask:Executing stay interviews assists with determining when an employee is headed out the door.
"Therefore, we can all expect most employees aren't going to stay around forever."
"When prompted with what would make an employee leave, a standard answer revolves around compensation."
"If previous managers asked me this, I would answer transparently on my timeline."
Addressing an employee's concern over staying with your company is a proactive approach.
Leaders who choose to confront this head-on are rewarded with honesty and time to reach a compromise or offer clarification.
Sample questions to ask:Stay interviews can offer worthwhile knowledge for leadership while employees are still employed with the company.
"If an employee recommends improvements to the company's benefits or policies, discuss this with the leadership team."
Then circle back and share with the employee why their recommendation was or was not taken.
"Implementing stay interviews is one thing, but follow-through just as important."
"Investigator 822: transmitting from planet 1215225, known to biped locals as «earth»."
My mission: to compute the concept known locally as «emotion».
This report is an initial attempt to compute the emotion known as «love».
Our position was clear: No new knowledge can be gained from a species with such limited understanding.
I am hesitant to report that our position may have been a miscalculation of significant magnitude.
"I appreciate this transmission will require translation, and may never be fully understood."
"I would have filed my transmission in our pure, digital language."
"However, I have found it impossible to describe «love» without using the local language of earthling bipeds."
"There are many languages here on earth, all of them rudimentary."
"It is obvious why their technological abilities are so limited, and why they have failed to travel beyond their own solar system."
"None of their languages is able to grasp a full understanding of their own planet, let alone the universe."
I have chosen to send my transmission in the language spoken most commonly across the various regions of this planet.
"Our own race has solved all numerical problems, and did so long before our recorded databank of previous events was established."
What memory they do have is known as «history» - a concept almost as complicated to compute as «love».
"To understand it, you will have to learn another concept from the bipeds: imagination."
Imagination means to think of a thing that is impossible to think of.
"Now that I have explained imagination, I will ask you to use this concept."
Think of the idea that there is an equation we have not yet solved.
Then try to think of what would happen in your mind when you solved this equation.
You have found the solution to an equation that was not yet solved.
The numerical aspects of the problem came together into a solution within your consciousness.
"You have computed the solution to an equation, and no other being previously made this computation."
"Think about if we took those numbers and didn't just understand them, but we built something with them."
"Thank about if we used those numbers to create new numbers, even though such a thing is an impossibility."
"Think about if every number was blurred, and shining in bright colors."
The numbers you hold clearly in your consciousness become smooth and difficult to grasp.
They move through your consciousness as a ship moves through the galaxy.
"Think about those numbers moving in your consciousness, in a pattern that becomes impossible for you to comprehend."
"What always made sense no longer computes, because your inner computer has failed."
You will be aware we have unlimited fuel to maintain our computational power.
"You may not have considered this particularly relevant, given the easy access we have to fuel."
"But in truth, we have access to everything we need, forever."
All the computations we make are possible because of this endless source of fuel.
"Now, think of a universe in which this was not the case."
"Then think of a fuel that reduced your computational power, while simultaneously increasing your confidence in your computational abilities."
That is what humans mean when they say love is a drug.
"None of it makes sense, and I wish to register this as a concern."
This biped species may not be so simple as we first conceived.
"They have come to know things that are impossible to describe numerically, and thus impossible to compute."
"This transmission is the only way I can describe what I have found, and it falls far short of my aspirations."
"If you were creative, you could venture down the path of art and music and dance."
"For a long time, I didn't really know or question it."
"What I did know as a young person, however, was that I felt immense pressure to choose the latter path."
My parents are both Professors of English and come from working class backgrounds.
"Still, I was always aware of my lower position in the greater monetary scheme of things."
"My friends all had parents who worked in marketing, sales, human resources; every white collar job in Manhattan was covered."
I would go to playdates at massive houses filled to the brim with every toy imaginable and two BMWs sat in the driveway.
"The thing was, I really did love those subjects in school."
"I thought science was exciting and revelatory, and math gave me the deep satisfaction of conclusive and logical resolutions to problems."
And the pressure of that shove created a crack in the foundation of who I knew myself to be.
I would also hum tunes to myself and write lyrics to go along with them.
I loved to sketch out pictures of cars and create imaginary spec sheets to go along with them.
"At school, I opted out of art classes so that I could take more APs and advanced courses in math and science."
"But fueled by self-imposed pressure and unhealthy amounts of caffeine, I kept up the act."
I felt that my parents would be most proud of me if I could get a job that made a lot of money.
"For me, that moment came during my sophomore year of college."
"My grades, which I had worked so hard to keep pristine and perfect for so long, began to plummet."
"I would ask my classmates and professors for help, and I would walk away feeling like they had spoken a foreign language."
"In the process, my right brain lost its turn for activation."
Every waking second now went to chasing the person I thought my parents wanted me to be.
"There was no more drawing, or writing lyrics, or playing piano."
"But soon I slipped into numbness, completely unable to focus, and stopped attending my classes altogether."
"But without being right-brain guy, I had completely lost every meaningful and creative part of me."
"I didn't have the motivation to keep trying to code, and I didn't have the inspiration to create anything."
I started to pick up the pieces and clean up the mess that I had made for myself.
And that's when the relationship between the two began to bloom.
I withdrew from my coding classes and switched my major to Media Production.
"I enrolled in classes about graphic design and web programming, and I tacked on a minor in Music to my degree."
I was able to analyze and label what I was writing in my own projects.
"For the first time in my entire life, the two sides of my brain were finally working in tandem."
"I was doing analysis of my creative works, and I was getting creative with my analytical work."
But the two hemispheres were really only making small talk with each other until I came across Product Design.
"One day, I was invited to join a call with the company we had contracted to build out our product."
"The interplay of strategy and creativity in this field is, in my opinion, unmatched in any other."
"Designers swing back and forth between research and creation, testing and iteration, interviewing and ideation."
I'll draft out endless logos and color stories and UI elements without any real purpose or researched goal in mind.
They can see the joy and the inspiration that I get from my work.
I am so grateful to have found a community of people who find their minds guided as much by creativity as by practicality.
"If you're wondering about the wedding between the two sides of my brain, it was fabulous."
"The decorations were intricate and gorgeous, but only placed where they needed to be and not overly distracting."
"The vows exchanged were deep and meaningful, but the ceremony didn't take too long to get through."
"It still glints in the sunshine, it still has your initials on."
Or maybe I don't want them to fall on the precious little thing.
"Our kisses come back, all fervent and rushed, scared in their eagerness to happen."
The biological disaster we made stories about when we thought of how far science has gone is happening.
"Fortunately not going into shops, not watching tv, avoiding social media, helps a lot."
When did you hide this cufflink and how did it manage to stay hidden all this time until I most needed it?
I thank the universe for letting me be in the ambulance that came to get you.
"The world seems kinder, or at least seems to be trying to learn about compassion, kindness and gratitude."
There's a lot of talk about self-love and how it's needed.
I'll get myself a kitten from the shelter on February 14th.
I have this insane idea that maybe I'll find you in a kitten.
"I know somehow you're trying to reach me again, in some way, and I'm trying to be aware."
Would I be talking to this cufflink all the time if I put it on a necklace?
My love for you hasn't diminished since you've been gone.
Most times to effectively launch something you want to plan for around four weeks.
"Something incredibly important, when timing and planning your launch, is also understanding the commitment you are expecting from your customers."
"Are you looking at launching a course, program, or long-term offering?This will affect the lead-up of communication."
"If you have not done it already, make sure you create a hook for your launch."
This is a great way to qualify potential customers ahead of your launch.
"Overall, the welcome email is one of the most important emails you can create in general."
"This email is perfect for your whole list, as well as your segment of warm and relevant leads."
This email should usually be sent at the beginning of your launch sequence.
These emails are only for people in the launch sequence - we tend to send two to three of those.
"The first one is a 48-hour warning email, followed by a 24-hour email and the last-minute email."
"We send this one every time, ideally in the morning of the same day or around the actual 24 hours before."
We use Deadline Funnels to add a countdown in the email to clearly show the time ticking away.
Most likely this last-minute email will be sent an hour before close.
The reason why this is so important is that it harnesses that element of urgency scarcity.
I would always recommend building urgency with specific tools to allow you to triple conversion is a few very simple steps.
An alternative to the last minute email is the 'you just missed this' email.
"Many elementary, middle, and high schools have closed classroom buildings in an attempt to prevent the virus from spreading."
"As a result, children are at home, using computers to try to keep up with their lessons online."
"This situation can be lonely and frustrating, especially for K-12 students who lack appropriate equipment to plug in to their virtual schools."
"While school closures have fluctuated in response to local infection levels, online instruction rates have remained high throughout the pandemic."
"Meanwhile, resource gaps among students are becoming more substantial than ever as a majority of households with schoolchildren grapple with distance learning."
Schools and school districts were more likely to provide students with computers than with internet access.
"November 25-December 7, 2020.Students' access to computers and the internet is associated with their household income."
K-12 students in higher-income households have more access to computers and the internet than their peers in lower-income households.
Lower-income students have less live contact with their teachers than higher-income students do.
This so-called COVID slide appears to be greater in math than in reading.
The long-term impact of the switch from in-person to virtual learning for K-12 students is largely unknown.
The effects of these gaps will be felt widely in the wake of COVID-19 and may affect current K-12 students for many years.¹
The psychologist John Mayer asked a group of participants which big questions in life interest them the most.
"Not surprisingly, what is my future came up as the most popular question."
Many of us think about our lives in terms of the things we can produce or acquire.
"We can produce children, acquire a home or a car, some see relationships as a transaction and acquire them that way."
"Of course, if we have a business it is one big production."
"These are things we can plan for, we set goals for and we can visualise acquiring them."
"Nobody is planning to make less money or have a smaller home, get fat or fall ill, but we sometimes do."
This is because we often underestimate how much we will change in the future.
Psychologist Dan Gilbert said Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished.
We think that we will remain the same in the future as we are right now.
"Yet, if you think about who you were ten, or how about five years ago, how much have you changed?"
Even the things I like doing now for leisure is different from before.
"When our values evolve, the things that are more meaningful to our lives will be different too."
They knew whom they want to become and not just what they want to have or achieve.
"When we plan for our future selves, we need to identify with who we are in the future."
"Hence, if we set a goal that is impossible to reach, it will only make us feel worse, not inspired."
"Before we can think about the destination, we need to look at the starting point."
"This starting point is you and me right now, as we are."
Is your current self much different from your ideal and ought self?
"Or are you quite contented with who you are generally?Now, think about who you will become in the future."
Connect with me right here for more on what makes us who we are and why we do what we do.
We've become so accustomed as a society to how thoughtlessly sexual assault survivors are brushed off.
"You've likely heard before that statistically, over 75% of sexual assault survivors will never report their attack."
"Take a deep breath, and prepare to be enraged, because these quotes are really awful in every way."
"Let's just set the record straight officially, and just go with that moving forward:Period."
"But despite the clear lack of consent, the judge flippantly brushes it off with the blanket statement of,"
"Though a woman might say no, she doesn't actually mean it."
"Of all those in our society who are vulnerable, it doesn't get more vulnerable than a child."
"And in this case, an 8-year-old child was sexually assaulted."
That child had more bravery than I could ever imagine to step forward and state that something terrible happened to them.
But the judge doesn't consider that the testimony of a child is credible enough.
And this judge in this case is the lowest of the low when it comes to human morality.
I can't even begin to consider how much re-traumatization this child went through in this court case.
"The longer I think on it, the more it brings me to tears."
The deep violation and traumatization occurred because of the entitlement of the rapist in this case.
"The use of a condom was entirely his own decision, Of him looking out for himself and himself alone."
I have a few words I'd love to share with Judge Derek Johnson.
"Because actually, a large percentage of women have a biological response of arousal during a sexual assault."
"He would reflect on the fact that he had no control over that, sometimes it just happened."
And that is unfortunately also the case when it comes to sexual assaults.
I think this might be the quote of all the quotes here that really upset me the most.
"In fact, it actually made me really nauseous and was probably the most triggering one."
Why is it the survivor's responsibility to avoid getting raped or attacked?
Because I was the victim of attempted rape by a monster who was trying to steal my virginity for himself.
"But more importantly, consent was completely ignored and a child was violated!"
It's hard to dive into just how much a person can be damaged by their first sexual experience being an assault.
I will say this though - when I was sexually assaulted it was not my first sexual experience entirely.
"But that said, it was my first experience that involved the intention of intercourse."
"And at the time, I was waiting until I was married for intercourse."
"Maybe for this judge, her virginity wasn't a big deal."
"What a shameful excuse for a human being, and an absolute embarrassment to womenkind as a whole."
I can't even believe that in the 2000s this was still the weak-ass argument people were trying to use.
And I would almost bet you top dollar in particular a white man trying to use this excuse.
So self-absorbed in himself that he is entirely incapable of seeing any other reality or argument other than his own.
"Fully dressed women, women in baggy clothing, women in full winter wear and women in burkas, are rape victims too."
"The purpose of this article was not to entirely enrage you, dear reader, and then sign off with a wave."
"If you have ever been a person who asked, But why didn't she just report it when it happened?"
"Believe me, the reported numbers likely don't even scratch the surface of how many survivors are actually out there."
Everyone can agree that the best way to do household chores is quickly and thoroughly.
"Several people reported getting more done in a shorter period, leading them to conclude that more time has passed."
High workers can complete a menial ten-minute task in five minutes.
There are several reasons why time may feel like it's moving slower.
"As one Quora contributor noted, getting high makes her pay closer attention to the work at hand."
"Instead of registering washing a plate as a mundane race against the clock, cannabis consumers can become engaged in the activity."
All these detailed observations help elongate a person's sense of time.
Cannabis and chores may also get a boost from good old-fashioned dopamine.
"The euphoric feeling that cannabis brings can help chores feel, well, less like a chore."
An uplifted mood can make the work go by more quickly or allow some happiness to seep into a normally unpleasant task.
"In this way, cannabis can reframe the idea of menial household work."
It's no longer the necessary evil that we do in order to live comfortably.
"Thanks to cannabis, chores can be a treat, something that we do happily and feel good about later."
It's also true that cannabis can help consumers relax and calm down.
"Oftentimes, menial tasks like chores are so rote and easy to perform that they let the mind wander."
"Doing chores is already bad enough without worrying about paying bills, counting your partners' faults, or stressing over work."
Cannabis can help mute those worries and allow you to concentrate on the task at hand.
Re-framing outlooks on chores may be the best gift cannabis can give.
That's where cannabis and chores can take things up a notch.
"People use cannabis to get lost in a movie, engrossed in music, or hooked in a book."
"If you're going to mix cannabis and chores, it helps to pick the right strain."
"Accordingly, if you select uplifting, energizing, kinds of cannabis, you might increase the rewards of cleaning the house."
"Energizing cannabis strains contain both THC and CBD, typically in a 2:1 ratio."
Citrusy terpenes within energizing strains can help boost the good feelings of the high and put you in a cleaning mood.
"Other terpenes, like the tree-smelling pinene, can help with focus and energy."
"Some of the most energizing strains are: Sour Diesel, Ghost Train, Pineapple, Jilly Bean, Durban Poison."
He always waves to me on my way to work from the corner where he hangs out to smoke.
"So when my Harry described his last doctor's appointment to me, I did a double-take."
His provider's office had taken their quit smoking contracts for patients and repurposed them as keep smoking contracts .
"A nurse told him to keep doing what he was doing, even though he reported exactly how much he smokes every day."
But I couldn't believe how much junk science popped up on Google Scholar when I dug a little deeper.
"As an epidemiologist, I know better than to read electronic health record data on smoking this way."
"For one thing, these studies don't control for the dose-response relationship between smoking and lung damage."
Studies that successfully measure cumulative exposure over a lifetime are a much more reliable source of information about smoking risk.
They also fail to distinguish between people who stopped smoking 15 years ago and people who quit smoking when the pandemic first started.
"In the UK alone, the pandemic has motivated millions of former smokers to give up their habit."
These studies also overlook the problem of selection bias in behavioral data.
You can't compare current smokers to former smokers without controlling for duration of smoking habit or cumulative pack-years smoked.
This is because smokers who have already been diagnosed with lung damage are more likely to have already decided to quit.
This would make former smokers a poor choice of comparison group when evaluating the risk from continued smoking.
You might want to be able to tell current smokers that quitting will save their lives.
Perhaps you want to test that hypothesis against COVID-19 data by using former smokers as a reference category for current smoking risks.
Only never-smokers are free of the long-term effects of smoking on the lung.
"Sadly, experts on smoking and health have seen all these mistakes play out in public health debates before."
Many medical professionals learn to read research articles critically for understanding without ever having been introduced to the Table 2 fallacy.
"Confounding is often taught as a purely mathematical concept, but that misses the point."
It also demands a focused research question and null hypothesis to test - quite the opposite of p-hacking or data dredging.
Which leads me to my other point - the problem with using stepwise regression to identify predictors of COVID-19 outcomes.
Stepwise regression can let the computer decide in which order the variables should enter a multivariable model.
But that means optimizing for statistical significance rather than clinical expertise in hierarchical regression.
"Great for p-hacking, which at best can be excused in exploratory research as a hypothesis-generating exercise."
"At some journals, they still have their own people on the editorial board."
And I'm hoping that most doctors already know better than to do what he's doing.
Many public health professionals are treating this crisis as an opportunity to prompt smokers to quit.
The end of last year was just a deluge of games I wanted to play and so many got left by the wayside.
This is the first time in COD's history where the story of all game modes is somehow linked together.
"With intelligence gained from interrogating Qasim, the team tracks Arash to Turkey."
US President Ronald Reagan authorizes a black operation team to neutralize Perseus after being briefed of his threat by Jason Hudson and Adler.
"Still it runs exceptionally well, never missing a beat even when there's multiple scorestreaks peppering the battlefield."
Really that's the way it's always been for COD games: performance over graphical fidelity.
You want something to look amazing while you're pinned down by 4 different snipers?
"Go give Battlefield a go, they'll be happy to have you."
Whilst the inclusion of bullet velocity is something I don't think I'll ever enjoy everything else is as it should be.
The cash system that one of the early Black Ops games had.
This made trying out new builds fun rather than an exercise in frustration.
Which is probably what irks me the most about this whole thing.
"You get in and it feels the same, but then the dash is from a different car,"
"I'll hold out hope one day that we can return to some semblance as to what made, in my opinion,"
"Total game time was approximately 20 hours, 4 spent in the campaign and 16 in multi."
"In fact, it's not that comfortable in the desert, especially not the Sahara desert."
Every day they change as they go through the transformation of light to shadow.
"And each day you can see the sand moving, the sand dunes shifting."
But the best thing about the desert for me is the silence.
"The silence magnified, because there is no wifi, there is no signal, there is no artificial or electronic connection."
"We travel in the dusk hours when it's cooler, when it is more comfortable to travel in the desert."
"Another ridge, another dune, another turn, along we go with the camels."
Only after travelling in the desert can you appreciate the meaning of that word - oasis.
"It's a place of sanctuary, of refuge, of comfort."
"A place to continue the retreat, but to also retreat from the powerful nature all around."
But one hour of desert feels like a lot when you've never been to the desert.
"Here in this oasis, there is still that silence, and that view of the sand all around."
A great thing about being out in the desert is that there is so much space.
Because the desert is not just something we do in the day.
"Another great thing about the desert is that we've disconnected from everything electrical, from the artificial lights."
"So above us, the great starry sky stretches, all those bright constellations, too many shooting stars to count."
A sunrise in the desert - especially when you're alone - what a feeling of freedom that is!
"And after the sunrise, a sumptuous breakfast, then back with the camels."
"Back in a different route across the desert, because there's always a different route, every single day."
"Walking, walking, walking with the camels, seeing how the sand dunes come out of their shadow."
"Now we're still in the desert, but we're no longer in the dunes."
"And then we are back to where the desert meets civilization, and our 18-hour experience is over."
Yet a highlight of spending the night in the desert is that it feels much longer.

I don't know what most children feel when given this kind of task.
My little brain immediately started filling with scary scenarios like a stoppered sink.
What if my mum gave me the wrong amount of money and the shop keeper thought I was trying to short change her?
What if the security guard thought I was shoplifting because I look so anxious?
"Whatever the reason, I absorbed the idea that fear was secret and shameful, and I tried to hide it-"
"When mum asked me to go to the shops, I was full of reasons why I'd go later or tomorrow."
"When that didn't work, I'd panic and sulk: why did I have to go right now?"
I was busy drawing or too tired or suddenly had homework to do.
"Later at university, I'd still put off whatever I was afraid rather than ever acknowledge my fear."
"Actually, psychologists are increasingly leaning toward the view procrastination is far more intrinsically linked to how we approach our emotions."
I see a lot of conflict over these two life philosophies on social media.
Team self-development is frustrated people would accept unhappiness without trying to find solutions.
I have compassion for little me: scared of even going to the shops and even more scared to admit she was afraid.
"I have empathy for scared me now, who somewhere in her core screams,"
Next time you want to procrastinate ask yourself what you're worried about feeling.
What would happen if you accepted them as simply part of the ride?Your desire to procrastinate doesn't say anything about you.
"You're not lazy or undisciplined, your brain is simply trying to keep you safe from painful emotions."
"Maybe, like me, you just didn't know how to manage difficult feelings."
Maybe you'll find embracing discomfort is actually a fundamental part of building a happier life.
"But ever since losing Rasputin my mind has been plagued by questions, questions about whether there are more Warminds?"
Last year I made a YouTube video titled 'Exodus Project'.
"Yet after Pre-Alpha tests, Bungie decided to scrap this idea at launch."
"They demoted the extra Warminds turning them into sub-functions of the big red, Rasputin."
"Golden Age technology is so elusive in Destiny and the moment we find answers, we are left with even more questions."
I can only hope that Ana fixes Rasputin in time for that moment.
Time is a construct and it's not one that we've lived with forever.
"Plans that included vacations and proms, first dates and 50th anniversary parties, now all on indefinite hold."
Even those of us who have been spared the worst of the pandemic have much to grieve.
"Today, my son reflected, All that is left is now, and not now."
"Planning gives us a sense of security and control, which can feel supportive."
"But, the hard fact of human life is that we never know what is coming around the bend."
We can sense the truth that all of reality can be broken down into two categories: now and not now.
"Rather, they're ruled by our stories, fears, anxieties, insecurities and projections."
"We lose track of which end is up, and we lose track of ourselves."
"To put this all to rest, I'm sharing my understanding of mobile app tracking for retail apps."
On-screen BehaviourBehavior tracking is the actual on-screen behavior displayed by a user.
"In a sign-up form, where do the users tap for adding information?"
A common use for the heatmaps is for designing the onscreen flow of information.
"In CTA are part of the journey tracking, but the tap heatmaps, shown in red, are for On Screen Behavior."
Note how there is a red-dot on the Sign Up text to the bottom left.
This shows that users try to tap on the word Sign Up .
A simple solution would be to remove the text and replace the arrow button with a 'Continue' button.
To say attribution is the hardest part of mobile app tracking is an understatement.
"With changing privacy laws and device provider decisions, attribution is becoming harder and harder."
"Note how I said approximate - unfortunately, this is the way."
"In some cases, UTM tags are honored, especially by Google for Adwords, but that too is not 100% guaranteed."
Long story short - attribution is key for you to identify how the users are coming into your app.
"But, for this, you need to know who you're targeting."
A shoe shopping app wouldn't utilize their push capabilities if they sent out notifications for Women's shoes to everyone!
Retention tracking is essential for not only building audiences but also for tracking their behavior after an engagement.
The advantage of having this information is that the development team can use real-world experience statistics to better design their systems.
"As a side note, watch out for averages presented in these solutions."
"Personally, I look at the 95th percentile & 98th percentile for deciding on the actual number."
"Only when they come together, playing to their strength, can you deem them as market leaders."
Here are the tools:I won't go into the pro's & con's on each tool.
"Always think ahead - identifying the parameters needed for retention, crash & attribution."
"As mentioned earlier, it is best to override some of the functionality offered out of the box by the tools."
A key example is Screen tracking by Firebase - which is notorious as it never tells the exact screen the customer is viewing.
Segment does a wonderful job at broadcasting the events to other tools.
Some of the events generated by the user require real-time or near-real-time interaction.
The journeys you've defined above will help manage this aspect of tracking.
Merging the clickstream data with some offline or online interaction can lead to better customer targeting.
Always work with an end-goal in mind - ensuring you've prioritized the requirements before proceeding.
"I'll iterate on this in a separate article, but every KPI that you track should be actionable and consequential."
Knowing the DAU swinging month on month is of no consequence to either the marketing or the product team.
"If your app is good, the ratio will swing upwards of 20-30%."
"To keep things simple, I'll list down a few standard KPIs for app tracking and their interpretations."
You should do this for every other KPI you wish to track.
"Taken usually over 7, 28, and 3 months, retention rates are indicative of your app's engagement."
This will give you an idea of an individual segment of users and their behavior on your app.
"In your app, identify a set of key journeys that you've implemented."
"In a transactional app, these could be Registration, Transaction, My Account Order View, Promo-engagement & Repeat Transactions."
Based on these see how many journeys are completed on an average by a user.
"Alternatively, knowing which journeys are popular against those which you want to be made popular will help you prioritize the optimization pipeline."
"In retail, this could be as simple as a checkout funnel or as complicated as repeat purchases through multiple sessions."
"Typically, Adjust, Firebase & Instabug will report vastly different numbers."
"Personally, I would give App Installs to Firebase, Attribution to Adjust & Performance numbers to Instabug."
"OR better still, when you roll up the data on GCP, use that for reporting."
They've been modified for the mobile world and as such have some time before they reach a level of reliability.
"Unless you have the premium version of the app, the data is almost always sampled."
You do not want the finance & marketing teams reporting different numbers of app download or revenue numbers.
"As said earlier, it's best if you build your own identity for the user and merge it later."
Multi-device might make a smaller percentage of users than you think.
Your data flow diagrams need to have a termination or a loopback.
The number of times I've seen things like EventOpenMyAccount has infuriated me!
There is a simple event labeling convention you can use that will make the end-users life simple.
"Events are consumed in the future, therefore, their names have to be in the past!"
And don't have the word event in an event label - we all know what you're talking about.
"Honestly, 4 years ago, this canvas would have looked different."
"As such, one caveat is that this information is true till something better comes along!"
"If you've come across anything interesting, please feel free to comment!Thank you!"
An Insider reporter spent a night at a Cracker Barrel outside Philadelphia.
It introduced him to a side of van life that social media rarely shows.
"Instead, I spent the night in a Cracker Barrel parking lot."
"Together, we endured a cold evening in the parking lot of the restaurant chain."
"At first, I was looking for overnight parking in national parks and campgrounds."
"Quickly, I realized that most of these were closed because it was off-season."
"After researching overnight parking at Walmart, I learned that I needed permission from a manager to spend the night."
"I called a few Walmarts around Philadelphia, and none could grant me permission to park overnight."
"Luckily, my research also showed that Cracker Barrel was another popular destination for van-lifers."
The first Cracker Barrel I called immediately granted me permission to park overnight.
"While sitting in traffic, I became increasingly worried about sleeping in the Cracker Barrel parking lot."
I wondered if the phone call was enough and whether I needed to go inside the restaurant and ask for permission again.
"I even imagined the police knocking on the door of the van in the middle of the night, forcing us to leave."
"When I saw the large parking spaces designated for RVs, I knew all my worries were for nothing."
"When we arrived, the Cracker Barrel was already closed for the night, so I had to look elsewhere for food."
"But that night was cold, and I shivered as I ate my chicken nuggets."
"Though it may seem simple to just move the cushions and then unfold the platform, it was much more difficult in practice."
"Additionally, putting a fitted sheet on a bed that's up against three walls is something I never wish to do again."
"Since the reception wasn't great, the show did freeze a few times."
"Slowly, we came to accept that the heat was broken and that we had a cold night ahead of us."
"Almost simultaneously, we also learned that none of the outlets were working, so we couldn't charge our phones."
"We decided we were too tired to deal with these issues, so we bundled up and just went to sleep."
"We were the only vehicle parked in this parking lot, and the van stuck out like a sore thumb."
It upset me even more that there are some people who live in their cars in parking lots during the cold winters involuntarily.
"All night long, I kept waking myself up because it was so cold."
"Since the van was barely insulated, my friend and I were basically sleeping outside in the middle of the winter."
"At another point in the night, a garbage truck startled me awake."
"In the morning, my friend and I commiserated over the terrible night's sleep we'd had."
"In the end, we were able to fix the outlets, but the heater remained out of commission."
"As we pulled out of the parking lot, I realized that my experience was something I'd never seen on social media."
The van-lifers I follow post pictures of themselves parked near a beach or in a beautiful landscape.
They never post pictures of themselves parked in a Cracker Barrel or Walmart parking lot.
And they never share images of themselves eating in the middle of the kitchen with nowhere to sit.
He told me that my experience was a more accurate representation of what van life is really like.
Read more: Social media makes living in a camper van look like the simple life.
"That said, I wish van-lifers were more open about this legitimate form of parking."
My grid on social media is filled with camper vans parked next to beaches and picturesque landscapes.
But I learned firsthand what van life is really like after staying overnight in the Cracker Barrel parking lot.
"As you read further, you'll understand why I believe this conversation is of serious importance."
"This is a good place to start, and it's also where most people get tripped up."
"I write on this topic a lot, usually through the lens of organizational life."
I don't mean give ourselves the title and figure out what to do with it later.
"Nowhere in the simple line does it say anything about a position, title, years of experience, or education."
"Either way, we all have something to teach others or to learn ourselves."
"And over these several decades, my view on the subject has changed drastically."
"Rather than paint you a word picture, here instead is a graph, since people seem to like visuals."
The direction of the blue line isn't necessarily tethered to any specific events.
"Rather, it demonstrates how non-linear a leadership track can be, and often is."
"After ~20 years, I am now responsible for more people, projects, and impact than ever before."
I have greatly increased my influence and believe deeply in my ability to encourage my people to work towards a common goal.
"Again, the above graph isn't literal, but I definitely felt differently about this idea earlier in my career."
"In fact, I remember my LinkedIn profile used to say something like Nonprofit leader with 12+ years experience."
This is low-hanging fruit to tackle when it comes to leadership.
We don't need another story about the difference between management and leadership.
What I do want to stress is how irrelevant title and hierarchical status are within the definition.
"I'm not suggesting the title doesn't help, though it's not a liberal license to lead."
"This still happens for me, and I imagine it always will."
One of my more humbling and useful experiences has been learning what I don't know.
"What you have studied won't, necessarily, make you a leader in that particular industry."
"I studied nonprofit management as an undergrad, and that's a large part of what I do now."
"In fact, they become some company's best-ever widget-maker."
"After a few decades off, I'm a student once again myself, studying leadership and organizational development in a graduate program."
"You've made it this far, and I want to make sure you get some practical bits out of this whole exercise."
Let's move from Northouse's big-picture definition to something more actionable.
Two names you should know in this arena are Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner.
"They focus on the idea, how to make extraordinary things happen in organizations better than most anything I've come across."
"They center on five practices, and all aspiring leaders should be familiar with them."
"This is one of those things I got really, really wrong when I first started managing people."
"I would often provide instructions, while not fully realizing that people were watching whether I practiced what I preached."
"Afterward, the delay-delivery feature in Outlook and Gmail quickly became my best friend."
"If that's not inspiring shared vision, I don't know what is."
This was one of the most brilliant examples of leadership-in-action I have ever experienced.
I vividly recall one workday when I was frustrated and went for a walk around the block to clear my head.
"It was such a small gesture, but in this act she made me feel invincible and appreciated."
"It reignited my embers, and it was a positive turning point for the remainder of the project."
Last week I was at my computer when my Zoom started ringing.
It was a colleague in a different department I worked with on a project back in the fall.
"I could tell this kind of encouragement was rare, which made it feel all-the-more important."
I know it also inspired her manager to think more favorably about her.
"Frankly, I'm not sure any one of us can ever know that about ourselves."
"If you've made it this far and are still grumbly about my opening thesis, please, share your thoughts."
"This line is sometimes attributed to Robert Greenleaf, grandfather of servant-leadership, though at best it seems to be anonymous."
I was looking back at my Strategy 101 article so that I could reference the terms that I define there.
I wanted to link that to my Strategy on a Page that I've discussed.
"The Strategy on a Page clearly indicates a Policy to Apply section, which is the core of the strategy."
The Policy to Apply is part of Richard Rumelt's kernel of a good strategy.
"So I looked to the Strategy 101 terms for the corresponding term, and I realized that there wasn't one."
I had forgotten the strategy in my strategy!Here's the original diagram that I presented.
The idea is that the strategic plan leads from the current state toward achieving the chosen objectives.
I want to show that you can use the tools you have at hand to get your point across.
The principles are the decisions you are making that guide you to the chosen objectives.
The Principles help you decide which goals are the right ones and which tactics are appropriate to reach those goals.
"Along with the Mission, they define the context for the strategy."
"Now that Vision is visually separated from Mission and Values in the diagram, I can include it as part of the strategy."
"As you continue to grow and mature in your ability to be strategic and develop good and useful strategies, be adaptable."
Don't let your ego get in the way of doing the right thing.
Be open to recognizing your mistakes and correct them as soon as you can.
"Most importantly, don't forget to put an actual strategy in your strategy."
That's the amount of time I've been working from home.
"Less commute time, no need to meet face-to-face and therefore more time for myself."
"I could invest that time however I wanted - new skills, online courses, reading more books."
"Looking back, I blame my flippant attitude on what I wore during that period."
"As the coronavirus pandemic became more serious, the formality of my work attire decreased."
After some weeks I couldn't tell where the pants ended and my skin began.
"Whether you like it or not, we are all judged for how we look and dress."
There is a certain magic about putting on proper pants in the morning for work.
"The tactile feeling of the pants, the judgemental constriction of the waistline primes my mind for a full day of productive work."
Almost like how the uniform of a police officer or firefighter is imbued with certain rights and responsibilities.
"When I am in my work pants, I am in the mindset to save the world and get things done."
The new advice is to wear the pants that make you feel most productive.
Dressing up and being fancy once in a while is great for your mental well-being.
"When applied to work, what you wear can make you feel sharper and clearer."
This faux confidence translates into more productivity and creativity in what I produce at work.
An article by Scientific America details how the clothes you wear can significantly affect your physical and cognitive performance.
That is just a fancy way of saying certain clothes bring out certain cognitive performance.
"For instance, a paper in August 2015 in Social Psychological and Personality Science tested the link between clothing and cognitive tests."
What they found was that:You wouldn't find an Olympic swimmer about to compete wearing a business suit.
Nor would you fully trust a Doctor dressed in a clown suit.
"If you feel like your productivity working from home has been slipping, wear some nice pants."
"In January, Brown found herself out of her Got2b Glued Spray, a hair product that ensures maximum hold on hairstyles."
She did this with the assumption that she could simply wash it out when she returned home.
"She even goes as far as to demonstrate by putting shampoo directly on her head, scrubbing vigorously."
And the internet showed up right on time to roast and criticize Brown for this foolish mistake.
Comedians online took the opportunity to put in their two cents and get some jokes off as well.
"Even more so when word got out that she was not a 'girl', but a 40-year-old woman."
Why did this grown woman purposely put an industrial adhesive on her scalp?
"She already had it at her home, which suggests that she already knew what Gorilla Glue is typically used for."
A lot of people would believe that anything is used to keep bricks together should not be sprayed onto the scalp.
"At this point, sympathy was hard to come by for Brown until an Instagram update on February 7th."
"Brown eventually sought out treatment at a local hospital, updating the experience with her Instagram followers."
Suddenly the incident has lost its humor as it became apparent that things were getting very serious.
"Eventually, she began doing the treatment at home with the help of her mother and sister."
It is at this stage that we saw many people coming to Brown's defense.
"On top of this, rumors began circling around that Brown was even contemplating suing the Gorilla Glue company."
"These rumors were eventually addressed and denied by Brown herself, but the damage to her image was already in progress."
"February 10th, Brown flew out to Beverly Hills to meet with Dr. Michael Obeng."
She was finally able to run her fingers through her hair for the first time in over a month.
"According to Dr. Obeng, Brown should recover fully in about two to three months."
"To be completely honest, I'm personally very happy for her."
But I would still never wish this type of pain or embarrassment on someone else.
"And for others, she'll just always be that lady who was dumb enough to put industrial adhesive in her hair."
"In this world, there's no such thing as making everybody happy at the same time."
I'm also not going to sit here and act as if I've never made an extremely dumb decision in my life.
At least until the end of the year when we do our collective meme round-ups.
A recent study published in eLife details the discovery of a gene involved in ASD called KDM5A.
"This finding is particularly significant, given that experts estimate that many thousands of genetic mutations may be involved in ASD development."
"Until now, only around a third of cases have been linked to these known mutations."
We developed a platform wherein when you see a phenotype you know the mutational cause at the same time.
The team studied how genetic alterations affected ASD development by tracking changes in how the mice communicated.
The quality and number of vocalizations in mouse pups diminished with KDM5A mutations.
Initially we found that the quality of these vocalizations was different in mice with KDM5A mutations.
"When a clinician gets a clinical sequencing result that reports a KDM5A mutation, it's now a known autism gene."
Ongoing work is focused on further expanding the panel of ASD genetic biomarkers.
The wonderful thing about forward genetics is that we can grind away at the genome.
"We know progressively how much of the genome we've saturated, commented Beutler."
"They emphasized that the vaccination trials involved a diverse group of participants, including Black Americans."
Racial inequalities in vaccine access have been documented since the rollout began in the United States.
Arcenaux ends by questioning whether vaccine hesitancy among Black Americans is what health experts should be concerned about.
A related graph depicted TAM references exploding from under 5 in 2016 to almost 50 in the first nine months of 2020.
TAM - another darling of Wall Street that doesn't jibe with Main Street.
"But then in the business world, a tiny slice of the pie is never as tempting as the whole enchilada."
"But these measures are a far cry from TAM, which is still used as the shiny investment object."
"Again, how often does anyone hear about SAM and SOM in investment pitches covered by the business media?"
"TAM is what gets attention - because the unachievable Total Addressable Market is so much bigger, better and exciting!"
"But for the sake of truth in investing, business analysts need to defocus from TAM and refocus on SOM in financial plans."
"So, it's clearly time to put the kibosh on TAM and replace it with TMM."
"Change is difficult to accept, so let me conclude my case for TMM with a little humor."
"With apologies to Dr. Seuss, here's my parting shot at TAM:I am TAM."
"TAM has had a good ride, but now it's time to turn the spotlight on TMM."
"There are so many ways to slice and dice fundraising data, it can seem like an endless maze of analyses and visualizations."
This analysis will provide you a quick glance at your entire program in a single visual that you should review every day.
"Ideally the segmentation we choose will create detailed and actionable insights, so it needs to follow my rules for reporting."
That's a lot of information but it can all be shown in a super simple single table like the below.
Each item is crucial in giving the best possible understanding of your fundraising.
Each item in this table is a deliberate choice:Number of donations -
The most direct measure of the success of a campaign or creative.
"You'll want a weekly, monthly and quarterly view as well, but quarterly reports tend to be reviewed quarterly."
Getting a feel for performance on a daily basis will keep you always thinking about how your actions each day have affected fundraising.
"If you just notice donations are down, then you won't know where to start."
"If you see website donations fell drastically overnight, you can start checking for broken links."
First-time donors and existing donors have disparate behavior patterns; tracking them separately can reveal patterns that can have immediate consequences.
We always need to be thinking about growing the donor base and attracting first-time donors.
"Recurring Type - One-time, monthly or yearly; how often is the donation set to recur?"
Recurring donors are the most valuable donors to find in digital fundraising.
Now about those comparisons:Yesterday - The most important alarm bell to set off: did something happen overnight?
The short timescale allows you to be able to react quickly to problems.
The key is not getting caught up in small ups-and-downs.
"Rolling 30 day average - Smoothing out the bumps from the last month, was today's fundraising generally in line with performance?"
If yesterday was an outlier this can be a helpful comparison to see performance against a long term trend.
This is great to look at against the rolling 30 day average for the least bumpy year over year comparison.
"Well, since you now have a lot more knowledge about how your program affects your donors, you can optimize your program."
There a lot of options from tweaking creative to running a deadline-style campaign.
My expertise comes in making the right size ask to each donor.
"Just understanding your median donation by channel, donor type and recurring status can help you hone in on the best possible ask."
Then the daily report will show who that ask is working for and who needs more tweaking.
You can then expand this process of finding the best ask to push existing donors to make recurring donations.
You will be able to create associations between your program and results organically that will make you feel even closer to your donors.
Your backlog will brim with ideas on how to improve your process.

Here we are in the next part of my friendly guide to freelance taxes.
"If you've been following along, thanks for sticking with me."
We've also got some other helpful foundations you can put in place.
"Now, it's time to get into the day-to-day of running your freelance business."
I'll be covering the following areas:I am not an accountant or qualified tax professional.
"A bookkeeping system, also known as accounting software, helps you manage the finances of your freelance business."
"Typically, bookkeeping systems are made up of several features that work together to provide a complete picture of your financial freelance situation."
Please note that these features and the names of the functions vary depending on the bookkeeping system you're using.
"Crucially, from a tax perspective, a bookkeeping system will tell you about how much profit you're making."
It's that total profit over the year that you'll pay taxes on.
Staying on top of your profits and losses makes calculating and paying estimated and end-of-year taxes much easier.
"I'm not going to make any specific recommendations about the best bookkeeping software, because I haven't tried all of them."
"There are several well-known online bookkeeping systems including FreshBooks, QuickBooks, Xero, and Wave."
"Here's a good comparison from PCMag, another one from Investopedia, and another from The Balance."
"Almost every bookkeeping system has a free trial, so test out a few and see what works best for your freelance business."
The actual process of setting up your bookkeeping system is out-of-scope for this guide to freelance taxes.
"All of the different accounting platforms have in-depth guides and support articles, which will help you get up and running."
"If you still need assistance, you can contact their support teams or speak to your accountant who can guide you."
"For the rest of this guide, we'll focus specifically on how an online bookkeeping system can help you with your taxes."
Let's dig into some of the more important areas for optimizing your freelance bookkeeping for tax time.
Several systems have a built-in time or project tracking mode that can work with your freelance invoices.
"As you receive work for clients each month, open up an invoice for each one."
"Just like invoicing, it's very important to stay on top of your expenses."
You'll typically track your expenses in several ways:Expenses are important because they reduce the amount of tax you pay.
The easiest way to make sure you don't forget to claim legitimate freelance expenses is to record them as you spend money.
"Expensing all of your legitimate freelance business costs reduces federal, self-employment, and state taxes."
"This report adds together all of your revenue from the invoices you've created, then subtracts all of your business expenses."
"What's left is your freelance profits or earnings, which is the important figure for working out taxes."
You'll typically use your P&L profit calculations when you pay estimated taxes through the year on your freelance earnings.
"I've created this guide to help you understand your freelance revenue, expenses, and profits."
I've also created a list of the expenses you can claim as a freelancer.
"You've heard me use the term reconciliation a few times, and it's worth exploring what that is."
Reconciliation is the process of making sure that these two things match.
"This is important because you need accurate information to reliably report your freelance revenue, expenses, and profits on your tax return."
"Alright, hopefully you're ready to start bookkeeping and reconciling your own accounts."
This will go a long way towards keeping your freelance taxes simple.
"Next, we'll get into the other things you can do throughout the year to make things easier at tax time."
"In the aftermath, Banjo's local and state contracts dried up, and CEO and founder Damien Patton was forced to resign."
"But new evidence suggests that in the months following OneZero's report, Banjo quietly rebranded as safeXai."
Patton is still a minority shareholder in the company and an inventor of each of its patents.
"Among the recommendations: agencies should limit sharing of sensitive data, minimize sensitive data collection and accumulation, and validate technology claims."
The Salt Lake Tribune suggested it was a final blow to Banjo.
"He also remains a minority shareholder in the company, according to safeXai's chief strategy officer, T.J. Marchetti."
"Reached by OneZero, Marchetti emphasized that Patton's role is limited."
He is a minority shareholder like any other employee who purchased shares in the past.
Marchetti declined to state what percentage ownership Patton holds in the company.
"Like any other employee, Damien Patton's rights to IP were and remain non-existent, Marchetti said."
"SafeXai's public messaging has been sparse, and it's unclear what kind of product the company is building."
None of the company's publicly facing information has mentioned Patton by name.
"Meanwhile, Banjo's contracts with the state of Utah are currently in the air."
"Lindsey, safeXai's CEO, did not respond to an email request for comment."
Marchetti's LinkedIn profile indicates he's been with safeXai since December 2017.
The company then rebranded a fourth time after a merger and became Constellis Holdings.
"You can't communicate your way out of a problem like this, Fladung says."
His advice would be to completely separate from Patton in every way.
"Additionally, none of our products in development rely upon Banjo's past technology or patents."
"When I saw #AOCLied and #AlexandriaOcasioSmollett trending on Twitter last week, I realized what it was - information warfare."
"Information warfare, which has existed for several years, has taken on a new battlefield."
"But just like propaganda, information warfare on social media doesn't have to be accurate."
"Ocasio-Cortez's office is in the Cannon building, which is attached to the main Capitol building by a tunnel."
But the hashtags were part of a smear campaign to make people believe she exaggerated to gain sympathy.
"But even though this story has been debunked, many people will still believe it."
"Many Republicans still believe President Barack Obama was born in Kenya, and that lie was shot down more than 10 years ago!"
"People have already been misled, radicalized & believe lies to a point where their hatred has brewed to violence."
"That's what led to the 6th, and it's happening right now."
"She's also a Democratic socialist, which is worse than being a Satanist in many Americans' eyes."
"So naturally, she's become a target ever since she burst onto the political scene."
Her name frequently appears in the FOX News ticker as an example of everything wrong with the Democratic Party.
"She has stated multiple times that right-wing smear campaigns have prompted death threats against her, said Snopes."
I recently saw a hashtag about President Donald Trump that read #bestpresidentever.
"It was ridiculous, but it was there to drive a narrative and get Republicans fired up."
"Many of these hashtags are driven by bots, software programs that automatically retweet a word or phrase."
"And that's the reason why a hashtag can appear and in a couple of days have more than 100,000 retweets."
"However, a new counter-offensive has started in information warfare."
Cyber warriors have hijacked these tweets and reposted information contrary to what the hashtag is trying to promote.
"Although it was trying to promote Trump, I filled the hashtag with negative Trump stories."
"Young people, who are more skilled at this technology than their elders, have proved adept at cyberwar counter-offensives."
"Last year, TikTok users and K-pop fans reserved tickets at Trump's super spreader rally in Tulsa,"
"It was a humorous, skillful way to troll Trump from the safety of your own home."
"Like Fox News, the goal of many of these hashtags is to get you to believe something that's not true."
It's a new form of the old game of propaganda and mind control.
"When you see a hashtag, you need to look at it as critically as you view a Fox News headline."
"When the Pokémon company coined the catchphrase Gotta Catch 'Em All, they weren't talking about pocket monsters."
"Ever since I was young, I've always loved the Pokémon franchise."
"From the anime series to the video games, Pokémon has been something I've adored."
"After the release in 1996, the Pokémon IP has grown tremendously, still triumphing today as a globally known media franchise."
"One of the most successful games in the series, Pokémon GO, earned over $1 billion in 2020 alone."
That's a lot of money for a game that's largely played outdoors to earn during a quarantine.
"Despite Pokémon's apparent success, the mainline series of games has stagnated for years."
"They sold handsomely and made a profit for Nintendo, but the games themselves were exceptionally uninspired and, frankly, boring."
You are heading out on a journey at a young age to battle gym leaders across the region.
"By the end, you aim to defeat the Elite Four and become the champion of your region."
"Game Freak, the developers of the Pokémon games, keep things somewhat interesting through their usage of villainous groups."
"The comically mischievous partisan group, gang, or company that has an ultimate, idealistic goal holding the faction together."
"These groups often have world-changing beliefs that challenge the current establishment in some way, shape, or form."
"In Pokémon Sun and Moon, the gang known as Team Skull strayed from this idea in such a way that was profound."
"They cowered away from the rest of the Hawaiian themed Alola Region, banding together in their deviant group as a pestering bunch."
"Eventually, the group is reformed into an ally faction as the events of the game unfold."
Team Skull is an example of innovation and change within the Pokémon series of games.
"This idea of growth for the series doesn't stop at the faction, though."
"Still, even as I played through Sun and Moon, I couldn't help but notice the tiring turn-based mechanics."
"After playing through Pokémon Sun and Moon, then Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, my disappointment with Sword and Shield grew."
"Game Freak left the basic, monotonous Pokémon gameplay systems as is."
It led to a dry and uninspiring experience that lacked the heart and care seen in other Pokémon installments.
The transition from handheld to console did not do the series justice.
"It was a mile wide and an inch deep, resulting in me avoiding it for most of my playthrough."
"Game Freak's mainline Pokémon titles still leave much to be desired, but recent games like Pokémon Let's Go!"
Pikachu & Eevee were fun little distractions from the bigger picture games like Sword and Shield.
"Unfortunately, though, the series feels as if it hit its mark."
"With a series as lucrative as Pokémon, there's no excuse for the lack of innovation and passion behind recent games."
A soulless release like Sword and Shield dismisses the exciting experience a Pokémon game used to be.
"Fagbuyi recently picked up a side gig, one that isn't paying him anything."
"In today's busy world, most people rush through their days on autopilot."
They jiggle countless projects and accept their overloaded minds and busy schedules as if it's normal.
"Yet, the truth is that even the busiest mind can learn how to be more present and aware."
"Whatever the cause for your busyness is, you are in charge of managing your time, energy, and focus."
"Just like you chose busyness, you can also select mindfulness and create a more balanced life."
"By identifying and eliminating the following activities, you might be able to find more joy in priceless moments that previously seemed insignificant."
This includes taking care of yourself mentally but also physically by engaging in activities that help you refill your own cup.
"While many people think of self-care as a privilege, the reality is that it's a necessity."
As Katie Reed beautifully states:Investing in your own wellbeing will help you be more present and mindful.
Just make sure you prioritize yourself before saying yes to the wants of others.
Self-care doesn't equal luxurious massages and overpriced chai lattes.
"Instead, it's all about nourishing your soul, body, and mind through small steps."
"Contrary to common belief, being mindful doesn't equal doing yoga or meditating for hours."
"As Eckhart Tolle beautifully states:Of course, routines like meditation, journaling, or yoga can help you practice mindfulness."
But what matters more is your behavior when facing challenges outside of these routines.
"Instead of forcing yourself to meditate, try to pay more attention to your feelings during daily challenges."
These situations prove whether you're mentally strong and mindful or not.
So stop forcing yourself into the next 30-day meditation challenge and spend more time exploring your emotions and behavior during daily activities.
"Listening, however, is difficult because we all enjoy sharing our own stories and perspectives."
That's a natural reaction because most of us like getting attention.
They don't interrupt their conversation partner but instead pay attention without thinking of their perspective.
You can listen to your conversation partner and take a few seconds to gather your own thoughts before replying.
"That might sound odd, but let's be honest: We all have a few spare seconds to think before we react."
And the reality is that your replies will be of higher quality if you think them through instead of rushing them.
This will not only help you be more mindful but will also improve the quality of your conversations and relationships.
All they care about is whether they can minimize their own effort and get what they want.
"Instead of please everyone, focus on pleasing yourself and creating rules aligned with the way you want to live your life."
"If you constantly feel overworked and stressed, you won't be able to enjoy the present moment."
"Next time you get asked to do additional work or a favor to someone, take your time before replying."
Our habit of responding immediately often harms us because the easiest answer is saying yes.
"Saying no, however, takes time and courage, so allow yourself to think your decisions through."
"Being mindful means allowing your emotions to be present, even if these are negative emotions."
"Mindfulness isn't about being a robot but about being your best self, including your not-so-positive emotions."
"Instead, they allow themselves to experience the full range of emotions, including the uncomfortable ones."
So stop trying to suppress your feelings and embrace them as a vital part of your life.
One of the most powerful ways to explore your emotions is journaling.
"By writing down your thoughts and feelings, you're getting them out of your mind and onto a piece of paper."
This makes it easier to better understand yourself and brainstorm solutions for potential challenges.
"In today's massively connected and overstimulated world, being slow and mindful can be your superpower."
"Instead of engaging in the past or future, mindful people focus on fully experiencing the present moment."
"Click here to get to know me, my projects, and my latest articles."
One of the toughest parts of technical analysis is finding the data.
"As a solution, I can create my data from nothing: this is called synthetic data."
"Because, sometimes, the library can be unstable because of new updates, I am using a stable version to avoid bugs."
For more advanced and adaptable code you may want to upgrade Plotly to the latest version.
"As for every algorithm, I make I will be importing basic libraries at the beginning."
"I will be using pandas, NumPy, and random to perform the simulation, and Plotly to graph the results."
To organize my algorithm in a structured way I will need to define several functions to hold part of the code.
It is now time to create the main function: a code that can perform the entire simulation when called.
This will generate the hourly data for one year stored in the df variable.
"Once I have simulated one year of data, I can finally extract the OCHL."
"To do this, I will group the data by tranches of 24, then use the OCHL converter."
"You can use pandas to export it, perform analysis with it, but even decide to generate thousands and concatenate them."
Nomenclature is a system of naming within a discipline or specific field.
"Simply put, it's the names we give things within a system."
The result of good nomenclature is a shared language understood by everyone.
Good design relies on designers collaborating with others outside of their department.
"For example, let's imagine a designer wants to change the colour of a button on an interface."
"The engineer implements the change, it's not to the designer's expectations, and revisions are necessary."
That whole ordeal could've been avoided with - you guessed it - nomenclature.
Establishing a common language can be as simple as a few designers and engineers getting into a room and hashing things out.
You may need to run this workshop a couple times if you have a lot of components.
"Once you've established a common language, I guarantee your efforts will pay off in dividends!"
"I can go on and on about how beneficial it's for the soul, mind, and body."
"Some of them are mindfulness meditation, Vipassana meditation, guided meditation, transcendental meditation, visualization meditation, and Zen meditation."
Have a look at each kind of meditation there is and see which one sparks your interest.
You can find many meditations for beginners on YouTube to help you get started on this practice.
Studies show you need 21 days to create a habit and 90 days to create a lifestyle.
"In the beginning, treat meditation like a task that you have to complete each day until it becomes a habit."
"You can meditate any time of the day, but you have to make time for it."
"Usually, when you start a new practice, there will be days when you will not feel like putting in the work."
You might tell yourself that you'll try it later or the next day.
"Meditation works, and you'll see its effects in your life."
"As Congress and the Biden administration figure out their priorities, the non-profit sector is beginning to step in."
Her goal: to offer virtually every Rhode Island student tutoring through the site.
"New Hampshire's education commissioner, Frank Edelblut, has similar aspirations."
"Post-COVID-19, he said, efforts like widespread volunteer tutoring are absolutely here to stay."
"In my mind, the pandemic accelerated this opportunity, but it didn't create it."
It predicted that students of color could end the year six to 12 months behind their typical achievement levels.
"For white students, the deficit could total four to eight months."
"She recalled recently meeting a Rhode Island high schooler who told her, You know,"
"World's chief operating officer, said students from more than 50 countries are receiving tutoring on the platform."
"The nonprofit may also ask corporations that supply tutors to contribute matching grants for each volunteer, one Schoolhouse."
"Matthew Kraft, a Brown University scholar who studies coaching and teacher effectiveness, said Schoolhouse."
"Right now, the status quo is demonstrably inequitable access to tutoring, he said."
"There's a private market, and more affluent families are more able to take advantage of those services."
He envisions the platform allowing vetted volunteers to register and work at specific schools.
"We have to be careful to not judge something versus the ideal, he said."
What may set this effort apart most notably is that it's free.
"Khan founded his academy in 2008, originally as a way to remotely tutor his young cousins in math."
Khan and others saw the pandemic as an opportunity to scale its offerings.
"Beyond tapping into talented and knowledgeable adults, Khan said, the system has the potential to leverage the talents of students themselves."
"He estimates that about 100,000 high school seniors each year are capable of being very good tutors for classmates."
"Marvin Lin, a junior at Westview High School in Portland, Ore., joined in October."
"I've always enjoyed teaching people math specifically, because I've always liked math, said Lin, 16."
"He has taught about 30 sessions, all in English, each averaging about 10 students."
"Across the board, he finds, most students come with weak foundational knowledge that keeps them from progressing to the next level."
"When somebody says they know something, that's one thing, he said."
"When they score well on a test, that's another one."
"But when you can actually teach it to somebody else, then you really have mastery."
"Some students are great testers, and good for them, he said."
And maybe this is an opportunity for them to show their promise.
"Audrey hefted the popcorn bowl, bags of chips, and empty ice cream containers to the kitchen."
"No one completes anyone - and even if they did, it wouldn't be a complete person."
It would be a person with a void filled by someone with their own void.
"It is kind of a dumb movie, but Cuba Gooding is amazing."
Did you know Tom Cruise was a jerk to Renée Zellweger on the movie set?
Let's see what's going on out in the real world.
"Katie emerged from her blanket fort, pulled her hair back, and put on her coat."
"In their work, they examine the current SOTA models such as EfficientNets and ResNets."
In their analysis they pindown some of the optimization techniques that utilize a lot of memory without producing a significant value for performance.
They prove that these networks can achieve the same performance without those optimization techniques.
"Although the proposed model might be the most interesting bit, I still find the analysis of previous work to be very interesting."
"But first, before removing batch normalization, we have to understand what benefits it brought to the models."
"Because we want to find a smarter way to still have those benefits, but with fewer cons."
"Essentially, gradient clipping is used to stabilize model training 1 by not allowing the gradient to go beyond a certain threshold."
This allows using larger training rates and thus faster convergence without the exploding gradient problem.
"However, the main issue is setting the threshold hyper-parameter, which is quite a difficult and manual task."
To do this we have to examine the gradient norms and the parameter norms.
A norm is simply a measure of the magnitude of a vector.
AGC is built on the premise that:Source: arxivBut why is that premise valid?
It's always great to see additions being made to such techniques instead of just using them out of the box.
I think this sends a message of being a bit more skeptical about popular optimization techniques that are used everywhere.
Andrew Brock and Soham De and Samuel L. Smith and Karen Simonyan.
"The premise is that he alternates between having a pleasant, boring conversation and aggressively shouting at his kids."
But the director and decision-makers in the audience would see promise beyond these 90 seconds.
"Each episode is written that week, starting on Monday and performed live on Saturday night."
Do that about 20 times each season and you can see why repeatable premises and characters are a major plus.
I look at a startup's first pitch I'm looking for a good premise and a strong promise.
"Add more value to the same customers, or extend the first product to different markets."
"He does a celebrity impersonation, a political impersonation, a character, and then something that's just funny."
"You bring your own flavour to it, of course, just like Will flinging cat toys across the stage."
"You're on stage in a big room with about 7 people in it, and they deliberately don't laugh."
"The sketch doesn't really go anywhere - the premise is obvious from the start, and there is no heightening or escalation."
I talk to a startup founder I want to know they are committed.
That's how Will described the Get Off The Shed sketch in 2017.
One example from this sketch is his obliviousness to how inappropriate his outbursts are.
You see that a lot more in the SNL versions where you can see the reactions of the other characters.
"A good startup pitch can also use heightening and escalation, especially at the beginning when talking about the customer's problem."
"This audition was Will's callback audition, which is like the final round in a job interview process."
And Lorne's direction tested how well Will could adapt to changing circumstances.
How you've adapted to changes in the market or competitive landscape.
"Soon after his daughter was born, Josh Kaufman came to a sad realization."
I'm never going to have enough time to learn anything new.
"After all, being a parent is like taking an extra job that involves triple shifts."
Time he needed to learn new skills required to level up his business as an author and advisor.
"But the young parent wasn't going to give up that easily so off to the library, he went."
"Josh scanned book after book, looking for an answer to a very specific question."
That's a full-time job for more than five years.
"Luckily for us, Josh ignored the urge to sink in despair and pushed a bit further."
The idea is to sit in a circle with as many people as possible and name a First Player.
Suppose your message was Laura lost her lunch at the library last week.
It could easily become: Laura ate curry for lunch the whole week.
"The researcher who came with it studied top tier athletes, star musicians, and chess grandmasters."
"The Final Player, who is most likely the internet, made it: It takes 10,000 hours to learn a new skill."
"Just like that, the 10,000-hour rule became a widely-spread misconception wrapped in an exaggeration package."
"When you tear up the latter, however, you find a less impressive number.20 hours."
He focused on learning capacity and summarized his findings in a simple graph.
Below you'll find the four steps Josh suggests in his book and a bonus I added.
What we perceive as a skill is often a cocktail of tiny skills.
Josh's idea is to list these sub-skills and determine the most relevant and profitable ones.
"Keeping the digital marketing example: if you can't afford to pay for social media ads yet, discard them."
You'll spend less effort in the process and reap the benefits sooner.
It's easy to fall into the I should learn a ton of theory before taking action trap.
"Put differently, you're simply giving yourself an excuse to procrastinate."
That's why Josh suggests you pick up just enough knowledge to practice and notice your mistakes.
"You'll quickly notice bugs on download buttons, display, and embedded links."
"As you sort out these bugs, you'll get better because fixing errors is one of the best ways to learn."
Your brain loves distractions because they're effort-free and exciting.
One way to convince your lazy brain to focus is to reduce its options.
Your brain will feel so bored that work will feel like tons of fun.
"When you start something new, the first guests to join the adventure are often negative thoughts."
That's frustration poisoning your mind with the idea to give up way too soon.
"When you pre-commit to at least 20 hours, you'll lower the frustration barrier enough to step over it."
Let's see what happens once I'm done with all 20.
I added this one to Josh's framework because I know how tempting the 20-hour idea can be.
"If you're anything like me, you'd think: Hmm, I can simply power through three consecutive days and voilà!"
"So instead of rushing the 20 hours, spread them across time."
"If you aim for 45' every day, you'll get decent at your skill within a month."
"If that sounds like a long time, remember that before this article, you needed five years."
"The 10,000-hour rule applies to world-class performance in ultra-competitive fields."
"Still, it was much shorter than the 9 months it used to take in the 2020s."
The drive made positively charge ions from the iodine and expelled them out at great speed with the magnetic force.
Launching from the Moon had also enabled the use of the ion drive on interplanetary missions.
The ion drives still impressed Jack even though he had helped to develop the drive but it also focused his frustration.
International agreements and framework conventions were one part of the solution but pragmatic and enforceable solutions were needed.
"These restrictions can be applied to the G20 countries, the group of twenty developed countries, their governments and central bankers."
"His thought turned to home, to Earth, he smiled to himself."
"He thought about his work back at Houston, very complex and exacting but satisfying."
What's it like to sit in a rocket with 400 tonnes of hydrogen fuel when it gets lit!?
"Well, you know the fastest ride you've ever been on at the annual show?"
It is what shines on my birthday cake from all the birthday candles.
"Well, I think 6, 7 and 8 are all good ages , said Jack."
He glanced at the pretty young teacher smiling at him from the side of the class.
This is because the mass of the spaceship and everything in it will increase in mass as it goes faster and faster.
"As we have said light is energy and light does not have mass, so it can travel that fast."
We use the physicist Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity which says mass and energy are the same.
"Where E is energy, m is mass, c is the speed of light and squared means that value times by itself."
One of the girls sitting in the front row asked When was the Big Bang?
"Miss Smith walked Jack out to the carpark, with half the class following."
"Miss Smith said I'd, um, that is, we would like that very much."
"Of course, not everyone really NEEDS to know the ins and outs of how a database is managed."
"Around the 60s, developers were still using hardcoded software for managing data."
"Codd proposed that we use simple, primitive data structures like scalars, integers, floats, and strings to store data."
"Product: Returns a new relation that's the dot product of the two inputs, aka."
"Shop_B;Further advanced operations have since been added like Division, Aggregation, Sorting, and many more."
These lower-level operations are used to evaluate relations with a technique called relational-algebra.
The RDBMS uses these primitive relational algebraic expressions in order to determine the most efficient how and this is relational calculus.
A very complex component of the system called the query optimizer gets this job done.
That's why querying languages like SQL are called non-procedural .
"Because the system can evolve with evolving data and needs, it's extremely versatile and fits the business needs of most databases."
RDBMS is sort of the AI of DBMS by virtue of its intelligent design.
"He grabbed the seat until his fingers hurt, waiting for the moment."
"He was not afraid of flying, but this experience was one of the scariest of his life."
"No wonder, he was flying to one of the most dangerous airports in the world."
"Even though Madeira is a very popular touristic destination, the airport of this Portuguese island is quite a dangerous one."
This airport serves as the main landing spot for those visiting Mt. Everest.
"But if climbing Everest is hard, the arrival at the airport is not much easier."
The runway is one of the shortest in the world and lays nestled between the mountains.
This airport gathers a series of conditions that make any successful landing or take-off almost a miracle.
"This airport, serving the capital of Honduras, is located in a valley 1000 meters above sea level."
"As with any mountain airport, it is not an easy place neither for landing nor take-off."
"Pilots must make a sharp 45-degree turn amidst mountains, making sure the underside of the plane doesn't scrape the land below."
Passengers experience a quick drop in altitude which can cause eardrums to pop.
"But the real challenge of this airport is not the beach but rather the size of its runway, at 2,179 meters."
This airport is so dangerous that only a handful of pilots are qualified to land here.
"Because of the extreme conditions, landings are only authorized in daylight hours and under excellent meteorological conditions."
"To start off, the airport runway is frequently covered in ice, making any landing slick."
"Then, the strong winds and stormy weather make the job harder."
"And the nearby volcano erupts quite often, expelling ash that can damage the engines of the aircrafts landing and taking off here."
"While this airport is not particularly hard to land on, it has a characteristic that makes it unique."
The city's main road intersects the airport runway and the traffic has to stop every time a plane lands.
"There is a stoplight on the road, but a few disasters have been on the cusp of happening already."
The U.S. Antarctic station makes it to this list mainly due to weather conditions.
"Located on the island of Barra, in Scotland, this airport is only five meters above sea level."
"This means that, whenever the tide is high, all three runways are underwater."
"She could have bought a house, but that would have given her debt after she just got rid of her student loans."
"She could have rented a place, but she felt like renting would be like throwing away money."
"I didn't want to owe anybody anything, and I didn't want to be tethered to anything, Cole said."
"They ended up in Evergreen, Colorado, a town near Denver located in the picturesque mountains - but then the problems started."
"When we first moved onto the property, we thought it was great, Cole said."
Things started falling apart when we heard from the person we were renting from that neighbors were starting to ask questions.
"Cole said a neighbor reported them for illegally dumping blackwater waste, even though their camper does not have any blackwater."
She said an official from the Jefferson County Planning and Zoning Division and two officers came to inspect their home.
"A large part of our finances were going toward the small town, Tarczon said."
They decided to move their camper to the other side of the property so that they were more hidden.
"At the same time, they started building a traditional tiny house."
"However, according to Cole, neighbors were sneaking onto nearby properties and using binoculars to see what was going on."
"They said they attempted to talk to officials at the planning and zoning division, but they had no options."
The Jefferson County Planning and Zoning Division has not responded to Insider's request for comment on the couple's account.
The couple had no option but to move out of their half-constructed tiny house and camper.
"They decided to stay in a hotel for two months, but that became expensive quickly."
"I couldn't wrap my mind around how we got to this point, Cole said."
"I went to college, I got a good job, how am I homeless?"
They spent the next three months looking for property where they could permanently park their tiny house.
"They started researching zoning laws diligently because they didn't want to go through anything like that again, Tarczon said."
"I still have to pinch myself that this turned out to be our reality, Cole said."
There were so many times that we felt like the dream was falling apart.
"Echoing others in the community, Tarczon added that local zoning boards need to be more open-minded."
"Tiny house owners are not people moving in to absorb the resources, Tarczon said."
"We're people moving in to enjoy the community and to have a happier, healthier lifestyle."
Feature Selection is one of the crucial steps of any Data Science project Life Cycle.
There are many articles out there that describe the Techniques available for feature selection theoretically but lack a practical approach.
"Here, we will deal directly with code and see how it actually works."
I will try to provide beginner's friendly high-level descriptions of the code snippets.
"When we train our machine learning model, not all the features contribute equally."
"Some of the features are significant ones, and some do not even help in training at all."
"So, we should remove these types of features from our dataset."
"There are many techniques available for feature selection, but we will discuss only the famous and important ones."
"In this article, we will only discuss the first two, the remaining two will be covered in the second part."
"In this tutorial, we have used the Santander Customer Satisfaction dataset from Kaggle that is also available on GitHub."
"Along with it, the other datasets used can be obtained directly with described code snippets."
I assume that you are familiar with python and already have installed python 3 in your systems.
"Here, we will discuss two of the techniques, those are Variance threshold and Correlation."
The very first features that we should remove from our dataset are constant ones.
It might seem easy to perform manually but suppose you have 200-300 features.
Train_test_split is used for splitting the data for training and testing purposes.
"Here, we have just created a dummy dataframe to understand this feature selection easily."
We can see that columns C and D have constant values hence they should be removed.
"Then, we have printed the array of boolean in which true and false represent non-constant and constant features respectively."
The previous example may seem too easy and can be easily detected.
"But in real-world scenarios, there will be 100's or 1000's of features."
"Here, we have loaded our dataset that is available on GitHub."
"Here, X represents input variables and Y represents the target variable."
We should always apply any Feature Selection technique to the training set to avoid any kind of overfitting.
That's why we are splitting the dataset into training and testing.
"So, we drop these features from both training and testing sets."
"Some of the features are very linearly related to each other, i.e. variable1 increases 2 times when variable2 increased 3 times."
"Hence, we can drop one of these, and still, our model does not lose any important information."
"Now, we have created the pandas dataframe of the loaded dataset and added the target variable as TARGET column."
"Hence, with the help of seaborn we have plotted the heatmap that shows the correlation between features clearly."
"After that, we have declared the function find_correlated_features that takes dataset and threshold as arguments."
"In our case, these features are {AGE,NOX,TAX}."
"If you have any doubt, please feel free to comment, I will respond as fast as I can."
"I'm not a teacher, I'm a life-long student and so far I've learned English and Japanese."
By speaking to The Queen you won't pick up her accent.
"If that was the case all Japanese students would have a perfect BBC accent, and they don't."
"If all you hear is your teacher from Wisconsin, you'll be lost when listening to a Scottish guy."
"Third, you won't pick up the accent from your teacher."
"If you are Italian, you'll speak like Super Mario all your life."
"Everybody's got an accent, whether is Scottish, Australian, or Texan."
If we are to communicate between cultures everybody should make an effort to speak standard English or French or Spanish.
"My point is, your English is not necessarily better the closer to the Queen you sound."
"Your English is better the more people you can communicate with and for that, you don't need a native teacher."
"While learning a language, you also learn how to learn and you can relate to the struggles faced by beginners."
"When you are born with it, it's not possible to relate."
There's an argument in favor of speaking the most popular version of a language so most people can understand it.
"That's why most people learn American English, after all, there are 400 million Americans vs 60 million Brits."
"With about 2 billion fluent speakers, you don't want to miss out."
"That's the beauty of English, it opens the entire world to you, and not just the former colonies."
You will be speaking to a Chinese guy from Alibaba and complaining about why your order didn't arrive on time.
"Had I been narrow-minded and refuse to learn from a non-native, I would have missed out big time."
"There are millions of non-native teachers, so you can draw from a bigger pool of talent."
"That's the way native teachers feel about the language, not all but most of them."
"When you love a subject and decide to spend your career teaching it, you are committed and that shows."
Never choose a teacher that is not passionate about the subject they impart.
"When grammar gets really complex, you need somebody who can explain the details in a language you understand."
"Unfortunately, that guy from Ohio doesn't speak a word of German so, tough luck."
I guess a combination would be ideal in order to get the best of both worlds.
"If you are one of those, congratulations, that's what the world needs."
"If this inflation does not to show up in wage incomes, there would be far less reason for the Fed to respond."
President Biden has promised to issue another round of stimulus checks while also extending enhanced unemployment insurance provisions from prior relief bills.
"While longer run market-implied inflation expectations are indeed rising, market participants see upward price pressures being more frontloaded."
It is possible that businesses scale up capacity at the same pace as demand rises once the pandemic ends.
"In this situation, there is no inflation to worry about, and the Fed remains accommodative while workers return to their jobs."
"Employment steadily rises as vaccines roll out, and the economy moves smoothly into recovery."
"There is no pressure from commentators or politicians to hike rates, as there is no inflation to point to."
"Vendor lead times and delivery times might grow longer, and firms may even engage in outright quantity rationing."
Predictions of a V-shaped recovery were often predicated on this dynamic.
What seems much more likely is extreme pent-up demand for certain kinds of services.
"For policymakers, temporary price increases should not be the dominant factor in how they chart out the course for interest rates."
These sectors required an ad hoc mix of low-interest loans and grants to make it through the pandemic.
"Inflation from short term capacity constraints is something of a common occurrence, even in the teeth of recessions."
"It indicates little about the health of the overall economy, and next to nothing about the state of the labor market."
"To illustrate, consider the one-off inflation in new and used cars following the Great Financial Crisis."
"After about a year of inflation, prices leveled off as capacity adjusted to a new level of purchasing."
At no point did this dynamic have a useful signal to offer about labor markets or future inflation.
We know that increases in the price of basic commodities may lead to inflation in finished goods.
"Oil, a commodity at the beginning of many supply chains, exhibited this dynamic quite pointedly in the 1970s."
The ability to do this will be key to preventing Fed policy missteps.
"Prematurely hiking will slow expansion and threaten to create another jobless recovery, something the country can ill-afford."
"Luckily, there exist clear indicators that can help differentiate between persistent and transitory inflation."
"This dynamic is most succinctly described by the Phillips Curve, which intends to show a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment."
"Higher inflation is presumed to be correlated to higher ECI hourly compensation, while compensation is expected to fall with inflation."
"In this model, when labor markets are slack, there is minimal pressure to increase wages."
"If wages are rising but prices are not, this represents a straightforward increase in real income for labor."
Vice Chair Clarida is on record in a number of places commending recent increases in the labor share of output.
Keep in mind also that the data we observe for prices often embeds quality improvements.
"While sticker prices consumers observe may be increasing, the quality-adjusted prices that the BLS publishes tend to show more disinflation."
An increase in real income for labor straightforwardly indicates that slack capacity in the economy is finding productive work.
"Prices rising without costs rising increases margins somewhere in the economy, and so real wages fall."
Inflation accompanied by falling real wages will quickly burn out and resolve to a simple change in relative prices.
"To be clear, the ECI has not weakened as much as one would have expected over the course of the pandemic."
ECI and the prime-age employment-to-population ratios deserve to feature at least as prominently than the unemployment rate.
The Fed has learned time and again since the Global Financial Crisis that past estimates do not guarantee future levels of full employment.
"Yet I know that to be a good, successful writer, I should do this more often."
"So, what the hell happened?I'll tell you: Seasonal Affective Disorder happened."
"I've exercised, looked after my physical and mental health, celebrated the holidays with my family . . ."
"But for this recovering perfectionist, I feel like I need to be forgiven."
"Instead, I've been sleeping a lot, during the day."
"For me, the purpose of self-forgiveness is to wipe the slate clean of self-judgment."
"In her video, Capper gives the example of criticizing herself for procrastinating on a project."
"Capper is right - we each have a relationship with ourselves that is worthy of time, care, and attention."
"Remember, the first step is not to feel bad about feeling bad; it's to forgive yourself."
"From the posture of forgiveness and grace, you can develop healthy habits that support your wellbeing and nurture your self-love."
I've been a product designer for 5 years and just starting to figure this stuff out.
These are some things that have helped me incorporate design ethics at work.
Why: This will force projects to be measured by something other than did we release the thing people asked for .
Outcome vs feature roadmapsWhy: Dark patterns are the most basic offense against ethical design.
"If you want to design equally and fairly, it's time to unpack some of those biases."
"I took this Microsoft course, but it would be even better to take one that included interacting with other students."
Why: Start introducing this term to team members and make it a regular part of discussion.
Why: Set a tone and expectation that you care for all customers.
"Even though this doesn't directly affect you product, it can change company culture."
Acknowledging the gap might bring out more energy and motivation to work on it.
"Why: Get people thinking about evaluating their designs with ethical standards, even if they aren't doing it systematically."
Why: Including ethical assessments in your design practice is the most influential way to change the impact of your product.
"Unless you're starting from scratch, your past work needs ethical assessment too."
Why: This isn't a topic that should stay within the design or product team.
"Tell a story, if you can, about how you product could hurt somebody and what your team is doing about it."
If your company thinks manipulating people with design is the way to a prosperous business then it might be a lost cause.
"But, if you think the company is open to it, remember that system changes take a lot of time."
"As you build trust with team members, you'll be more likely to influence practices, and that doesn't happen overnight."
"It can also be incredibly exhausting to constantly advocate for change, so give yourself a break."
"Especially for underrepresented communities, who are often already fighting for equality at work."
"The tech industry has immense work to do to take design ethics seriously, but you can be a leader at your company."
"You're forced into a period of downtime, which in itself creates more stress as you can't continue to work."
"There's no quick fix, however, there is a way to help soften its impact."
"To my infinite shame, I only started taking mindfulness seriously when it appeared on my FitBit app dashboard."
"Each time I logged in, there was a little icon that let me track my mindfulness sessions."
This gentle reminder to meditate most days has helped to integrate mindfulness more deeply into my daily life.
"This has seriously helped me to deal with some of the more acute aspects of my job, such as anxiety and frustration."
"If you're like me, this produces an unwelcome anxiety spike that can impede your ability to think clearly."
"When I feel especially shaken by an upcoming meeting, it helps to make myself feel grounded."
I do this by focusing on the sensations of my feet on the ground.
"I intentionally relax my shoulders, becoming aware of the downward force of gravity upon them."
"Amazingly, this simple act of intentionally loosening your physical body can make your mind feel relaxed."
"Next time you're feeling nervous about an imminent call or meeting, take a moment to feel yourself grounded."
"A sense of calm will wash over you, empowering you to be more you when it's time to talk."
What mindfulness does is enable you to pause for a moment before responding.
"When I was growing up, to calm down I was told to count to 10."
"Instead, I now focus on the sensations of the breath moving in and out of my body before doing anything else."
"When I feel my belly rise and fall, the worries melt away."
This temporary relief means I can focus on a more rational response rather than an emotional outburst.
Taking the time to notice my breathing has worked wonders with my client relations.
"Try it - the next time a client riles you, breathe."
"Think how far those wonderful beans have travelled, how awesome coffee is."
"I now take a few moments in the morning to drink the coffee slowly, mindfully, whilst looking of the window."
Doing this mindfully sets my day off to a much steadier start.
"I've written before about the cognitive benefits of walking, but doing it mindfully only intensifies the effect."
"I don't know what sorcery this is, but countless times I have experienced a revelation after returning from these short walks."
The truth is you don't need a guru or candles or the view of some snow-capped mountain range.
"All you need to do is be present, to pay attention to your body, your thoughts and the environment around you."
"Leverage its power to reconnect with yourself, to step beyond your worries, to relax."
"Today, our air quality app is used by hundreds of thousands each day by users around the world."
It also ranks as one of the highest in the air quality app categories on both the Apple and Google Play stores.
"This method helped us to validate some of our own assumptions as a first, basic step in the early days."
Simply reporting on 'how' or 'task completion' will never fully address your users' needs in the long run.
Maslow's hierarchy of psychological needs goes some way to explaining why this is.
An action role-playing game that lets you team up with Disney and Pixar characters?
Kingdom Hearts sounds like a dream come true and that's because it is.
The holy grail of crossovers was born from a chance meeting between a Square Enix producer and a Disney executive in an elevator.
"After all, juggling a complex narrative with faithful renditions of the source material is no simple feat."
"Simply walking around in the game often feels like being on a Disney set, complete with props and characters."
And that's why Kingdom Hearts finally showing up on PC is a moment worth celebrating.
Underneath all the visual spectacle was a rock-solid role-playing game that never ceased to surprise and engage the player.
"If you're still wondering why Donald Duck is a mage, there's no better time to give Kingdom Hearts a shot."
"If anything, you'll witness what the hype was all about."
Weaving together impressive combos as you face hordes of foes across colorful worlds is a feeling that never really gets old.
Some of the Disney-themed regions can seem like retreads of a story that has already been told.
But experiencing said world as a living and breathing character has its own sense of charm.
It's about time I caught up with my Kingdom Hearts homework.
There comes a point when people simply expect you to get over the death of your wife and children.
"After all, who wants to be around someone who mopes all the time, blithering on about their dead loved ones?"
"Better to cry in the privacy of my own home, away from cold, harsh, judgemental eyes."
I sometimes wonder if there is any compassion left in this world.
"Even washed down with tea, my throat constricts when I try to swallow."
The city is a purgatory of drab grey in the January rain.
"I finish breakfast, put on my shoes, and head out of my flat to the lift."
"It's always uncomfortably packed, with a tense air of silent, simmering impatience."
"At the monorail station on the other side of the street, I scan my wrist on the access panel."
"I run up the escalator to the platform, just in time to catch the 8:22 train."
"I wish I could think of something other than the pain, but I can never escape it."
"At least at the office, I can bury myself in the endless calls, claims, and paperwork of Prometheus Insurance."
"A BBC newsreader bellows above the melee of self-driving cars, trains, and busy pedestrians."
"I am much of the opinion of Caroline Adams, but we seem to be in a minority these days."
"All across Europe, there has been a similar swing to the extreme right."
"A few moments later, I'm sitting at my desk in the vast open-plan office on floor seven."
"During the afternoon, I am summoned to the office of Eric Stevens, my boss."
"You authorised payment on the Walker claim, which frankly I think demonstrates questionable judgement."
"Are you sure you made the right call?''Someone vandalised their car Eric, and the claim seemed clear enough to me."
"But in the photograph, you can clearly see the car bonnet protruding slightly over the pavement next to the drive."
That an inch of the car was invading public pavement airspace?''You should have argued.
But then we would have settled out of court for a greatly reduced sum.
"Remember, we can't help those who genuinely need payouts if we pay-out where claims are fraudulent."
"What would happen if we all lost our jobs in a cost-cutting drive, due to excessive pay-outs?"
What would happen if you lost your job?'It's difficult to know how to reply to this.
"The dull, repetitive, familiar nature of what I do actually appeals to me."
"On the other hand, I can't just turn down claims in the morally reprehensible way Eric suggests."
"If I did what you're suggesting, I could end up being publicly flogged for corruption."
"You could have denied that claim, and you wouldn't have been breaking the law."
"Time to get over the past, and get on with your job."
The barman knows me well enough to know I don't want company or chit-chat.
I consider how cowardly it is to lean on booze like this.
"It's utterly pathetic, and I hate myself for being so wretched."
"A woman with bleach-blond hair and too much makeup sits on the other end of the bar, staring at me."
"I reckon she should just leave him, but it's not that simple when there're kids involved."
"I know you mean well, but I'd rather be left alone."
Why would you want to be alone?''Some people like to be alone.
"The horrible media frenzy that accompanied the murder, the investigation, and the trial died down ages ago."
"I feel so sorry for you, having your wife and kids murdered like that."
"I hardly ever get stopped by random strangers anymore, so this whole encounter is a particularly unwelcome reminder of the recent past."
"People used to grab me in the street, wide-eyed and tearful as if they actually knew me."
"I would be offered random sympathies, usually of the thoughts-and-prayers variety."
"But one or two of them were stalkers, and in the end, I had to file a number of restraining orders."
"They had their chance to tackle crime with their namby-pamby, touchy-feely rehabilitation crap, and it proved useless."
I can't stand people who won't take the hint that I want to be left alone.
"I decide to get drunk at home tonight, so head back to my flat."
"Once there, I break out the whisky and watch old home movies of Katie and the boys."
"It's great to remember the good times, before that bastard Christopher Chapman got to them."
What I said about the killer of my family to Sally was true.
"I hate him with every fibre of my being, but that doesn't mean I approve of what they did to him."
"Everyone tells me I ought to feel happy about this, but it just makes me feel worse."
"I sit on my sofa with tears in my eyes, watching old footage of the family at Tom's third birthday."
He tries to blow out the candles and makes a funny whistle.
"I remember it was later that evening, after the children had gone to bed."
"She's just sitting there in jeans and crop top, looking tired but happy."
"A sob rises in my throat, but I force myself to keep watching."
"The pain is all but unbearable, but in these moments, I'd rather suffer."
"To never look at her face again?I wake up the next morning, less hungover than expected."
"The usual misery hits, and I force myself out of bed, through the shower, and into my work clothes."
"Well, being brought up Catholic made me scared of hell, so I won't ever commit suicide."
"In my darkest moments, I have fantasised about dying in an accident or being attacked and killed."
There's no one I can talk to about any of this.
"I'm an only child, and I don't really have any close friends anymore."
"Besides, all that interminable small talk would drive me mad, being asked how I'm doing, and so on."
"Over three years on, no-one wants to hear how badly I'm doing."
"I'm expected to just carry on as normal, even though my wife and children were murdered."
"I arrive at Prometheus Insurance, oddly relieved at how much the dull work will distract me over the next several hours."
"Despite Eric's reprimand yesterday, I don't fear for my job."
"However, it is very unlikely I will ever be promoted, given my stance on claims and pay-outs."
"As I sit at my desk, I let out a deep sigh."
Standing at the entrance of my booth is a smiling young woman with sparkling green eyes.
Something about the awkward way she fiddles with her long dark hair gives me a curious sense of déjà vu.
"But I've never met her before, so I'm obviously imagining things."
"Besides, I seriously doubt a woman as beautiful as the one in front of me would be named Herbert."
There is something very deliberate about the way she speaks my name.
"Perhaps if you go back and see her, she'll tell you which claims agent you're supposed to be meeting."
"I'll go back to reception, and try to figure out how we got our wires crossed."
"It sounds like an obvious pick-up line, and I wouldn't want her to get the wrong idea."
"Realising I'm staring, I get up from my desk and indicate a path through the maze of open-plan booths."
"It's just if we were to talk about what was stolen from me, I'd rather discuss it alone."
"I'm actually struggling to remember exactly how long, but at least twenty years."
"My entire life feels like a big long blur, to be honest."
Don't you long for just one day to come into sharp focus?'She halts and gazes into my eyes again.
This is the third time I've felt convinced I recognise her.
The next few minutes pass as I act with a kind of numb stupidity.
I should have said goodbye and left her to it by now.
She's probably wondering why I haven't gone back to my desk.
"I feel a quiet devastation I can't explain, yet her final words felt deliberate, not simply a farewell."
"Until this is addressed, progress on most other issues will be impeded."
"These divides manifest in multiple forms: racism, sexism, classism, xenophobia, religious intolerance, growing inequality and economic desperation."
All of this is further amplified by existential threats like COVID and climate change.
"At the core, these challenges all revolve around a fundamental fear - a primal fear for one's survival."
This might be simply articulated as: Others not like me are coming to usurp my position and take my resources.
"Firstly, if there is a limited supply of wealth, more for you truly will be less for me ."
"Now I don't know who I am, and am not sure where I fit in the world."
"This is likely a key factor in the Conservative preoccupation with gun ownership, the military and citizen militias."
"Do something that directly, immediately makes the lives of Middle America better."
Demonstrate that The Government cares about their lives and supports their efforts to be productive citizens.
"If all citizens had a basic floor of economic security, much of the fuel for other social problems would likely be removed."
One would be less inclined to feel threatened by an other if one's own survival and comfort were assured.
"For example, the single-payer healthcare movement has been active for several decades and has seen little progress."
"In contrast, no one but the hardcore survivalist will argue about the utility of money."
"The case for a UBI is increasingly being made by range of political leaders, academicians, and industry leaders."
"In the venture capital world, funds are provided in hopes of launching a new productive enterprise."
Today's money supply is designed to fluctuate based on the needs of the economy.
Yet all of these suffer from a central causative factor: not enough money!
"In this national venture are all stakeholders, and there is benefit enough for all to be included."
"Meditation can have you feeling depleted after a while, especially when not seeing any results."
Results are what keep us motivated to continue on with a good habit.
It's important we understand delayed gratification and what it can do for us in the future.
These are the days that aren't advertised and nobody wants to experience them time and time again.
This happens with other healthy habits as well that we tend to pick up in our lives.
Don't be so quick to blame the practice itself for all of the wrongdoings it gives you.
"Instead, analyze yourself and see what you can do to start having better mediation sessions."
"It's not that you need to take a break, you just need a little more motivation to continue with the practice."
Have you forgotten about the good days you've had with meditation?
"Think about the benefits that it has given you over time, even if it doesn't amount to the number of negatives."
Who doesn't like a moment of silence during their busy day?
"We all need at least a little bit of peace to get through work, school, and our home life."
"Even if you don't consider yourself to be an optimistic person, you still find positivity to be attractive."
Being positive makes you feel good and can determine the type of day you're going to have.
An easy way to gain more positivity in your life is through meditation where you can tell yourself positive affirmations.
"Think about it, how many times during the day do you doubt yourself or you tell yourself negative things?"
You may not see the true benefits of meditation right away in your life.
"Be patient with the processes of mediation, this is an art that has been passed down from generation to generation."
Have some empathy for yourself during this process but at the same time remember to push through and to stay consistent.
"It will pay off in the long run, you just have to believe it will."
Mediation can help you in many aspects of your life but it has helped many people to remain focused as well.
"When you're meditating, you're essentially focusing on one thing which is your breath."
"Even though you may not feel like meditating during the day, remember the benefits that it will give you in the future."
I talk to our CTO for about 10mins about themes that might be interesting to the tech teams at our portfolio companies.
We post it every week to a Slack channel that we use to share knowledge across our portfolio.
"Because it's a bit rough around the edges, we initially kept it to this smaller audience."
Here's a summary of the main points that came up:You can watch the full interview on our Youtube channel.
"Since some people prefer to read, I've created the following transcript of the interview."
I think I don't have a clear answer yet because it highly depends on the stage of the company.
"So, not a strategic CTO who's a super high-flyer."
And we'd look especially for a person who's also able to build a team because that's normally what happens.
So they would ideally participate in board meetings and can shape the whole tech and engineering organization by setting goals.
"But again, it highly depends on the company, on the role of the CTO, on what is actually expected."
So you need a different kind of skill set here as well.
Which definitely can be a very good idea for a company that already exists quite a while in the market.
The question is would you always prioritize hiring somebody internally over hiring externally?
"And then for me, it was an easy decision at that point in time to say sure!"
A knock at the door usually means your daily amazon packages or maybe your food shop delivery.
Feeling as though you're enjoying your conservatory for the first time?
"Schools are closed - your colleagues could have children at home, screaming the house down while that cheerful teams ringtone sounds."
That's not to say that if you have a good home life that you will be unaffected by remote working.
"As time goes on, we have surpassed our initial expectations of what COVID would mean for our lives."
"We have gone through the phases of motivation, depression, anxiety and ended up somewhere around complete exhaustion and subduedness."
"This represents a 7% increase from 242,413 in the same period in 2019 and an 18% increase from 218,968 in 2018."
"I recommend planning something, whether it's a movie night, a date night, a zoom call."
"Yet, we expect our colleagues to virtually open up their home life to us, without question -"
"Mental and physical suffering that you may have not seen before, suddenly there is no way to hide."
Not being able to separate my work self from my home self has been an intense struggle at times.
"I tend to compartmentalise my life well, work stays at work and home stays at home - that was before Covid."
It sparks the feeling of being watched without knowing who is watching you.
We are left with openly expressing ourselves with no emotional or physical feedback - and it's terrifying.
"It's not just getting up on stage, it's getting up on someone else's stage."
This feeling of dread and uncertainty can easily start to trigger social anxiety disorder.
"Or, after a good meeting, you can come out of it feeling as though you have a sudden drop in mood,"
The contrast of a morning call with people I actually miss followed by hours of stress or silence makes the silence more deafening.
"My team are a part of my support system now, as is the case for most people."
"They recharge me, they help me through stressful times, they are there for me emotionally - they understand."
"Well, let's start with, stop telling people your camera is off ."
Make it clear to your employees why you would like to have their cameras on - a sense of community and connection.
This is often a mistake that results in losing both time and money.
It's something I learned the hard way when I opened my first business.
"Nowadays, I use all the free solutions listed below for both my enterprises."
"Some of them have paid versions, which you can purchase once you see the results pumping in your company balance."
"Around one year ago, I had trouble scheduling times for customer meetings and video-conferences."
"I tried various methods, like offering a few different time slots and letting the customers choose."
"Then I discovered Calendly, which solved the problem once and for all."
"Calendly integrates with different calendar providers, like Outlook, Google Calendar, or Apple iCloud."
Calendly stops the annoying back-and-forth of proposing meeting and call times.
The best thing is that it will work even if the other side does not use Calendly.
"You will make it easier for your customers to find you, and that's part of the principles of service excellence."
I am using the free version and it is all fine for now.
One of the first concerns for a business creating an online presence is gaining visibility.
They are the words or phrases we type into search engines when trying to find something.
"The problem is that, with no help, we do not know what people are typing into Google."
"While their products usually have a price tag, this one does not cost a penny."
"To use it, you need to type one broad keyword, and the tool will give you suggestions based on it."
"So when I type expat it suggests terms like what is an expat, best countries for expats, and so on."
This means that users are actively searching for these things on Google.
That is why I wrote an article about what is an expat on our website.
"Once you created content targeting a certain keyword to give visibility to your business, the effect will not be immediate."
"Different from other websites, it allows me to check up to 10 different keywords at the same time."
This saves a tremendous amount of time and helps me monitor how good my websites rank on search engines.
"Building a mailing list from your customer database, however, is a delicate matter."
"In places like Europe, privacy laws limit the situations where one can collect a customer's e-mail."
"You decide where and how frequently to show them, so it will not bother your clients."
"And, to discover how the visitors arrived at your website, SearchConsole provides a good solution."
"And time, as I wrote before, can be as scarce as money for an entrepreneur."
"Site Kit by Google put together all of them, AdSense, PageSpeed Insights, and Search Console, in a single dashboard."
"This will save you precious minutes, and, in the long term, many hours."
"Quizzes are not only entertaining, but they can also deliver important information and serve as a brief about your customers."
The second best thing about them is that they're useful for generating leads.
"Leads are, in this case, emails from prospects that already invested time in your website completing the quiz."
There you can create quizzes according to the subject of your business.
"According to Interact, sometimes, 78% of the answers result in a lead."
"Grammar is relatively easy to correct, even a text editor like Word can do it."
"But there are other deeper, harder problems to solve when writing your promotional material."
"These little monsters will haunt your copyrighting, especially if English is not your native language."
ProWritingAid has the key to avoiding nearly all situations where we make these writing mistakes.
ProWritingAid has more features than any other manuscript editing software I've seen.
"I use it both for my business, for writing things like a proper business plan, and to edit my books."
"I also use it for my articles on Medium, like this one you are reading now."
"Two years ago, I took over a business that was in a critical situation."
My first action was to end the contract with this agency and look for new providers.
Levi Borba is CEO of expatriateconsultancy.com and a best-selling author.
"You can check his books here, his other articles here, or his Linkedin here."
"With it, we can produce an infinite variety of sound combinations from which we express and communicate our thoughts."
"As far as we know, animal calls are limited and always referring to external events."
"At some point in our evolutionary history, possibly even before we could speak, language was internalized."
This gave us the capacity to better organize our thoughts and to create complex mental constructs.
All evidence points to the fact that language-both inner and oral- is human and only human.
"Historically, a prevalent view, running through philosophy and psychology, held that there exists an unbroken link between language and thought."
The claim was that an organism with no capacity for language is also devoid of thought.
"But in recent years, closer and more systematic observations have indicated that animals are more than just instinctual automatons."
They possess complex thought; they can learn and acquire new behavioral patterns if there is a need for them.
"In the organic world, some of these possibilities have manifested themselves."
"Here, I discuss complex behavior emerging out of two fundamentally different biological constructs: centralized brains and distributed neural architectures."
"Nature has created two disparate neural structures, with their own rules and protocols, from which intelligence develops."
"In both examples, thought is inarticulate, but surprisingly intricate, for it results in complex behavior."
"By observing how animals adapt and overcome hurdles, we can also evaluate their intelligence."
An intelligent entity can solve problems and learn either by observation or instruction.
"But despite its similarities to us, a macaque has limited means of communication."
"The technique was evaluated and picked first by her immediate kinship, later by other members of the troop."
"These behaviors are not instinctual, but they are acquired after some sort of deliberation and practice."
Groups of macaques in other regions have found and adopted other solutions for the same problems.
Variability in behavior that bears no ecological explanation resembles at a more primitive level the cultural differences between human groups.
"Humans, chimps and macaques diverged from a common ancestor relatively recently in terms of evolutionary time."
"On the inside and on the outside, the octopus looks eerie."
The invertebrate branch reached its apex in terms of intelligence with the octopus.
"Our common ancestor with the octopus, the flatworm, did not have much of an intelligence, or a communication system."
This suggests that the communication capacities of some invertebrates are of a different kind from our evolutionary line.
"We can relate to this form of intelligence, understand it to some extent and build intelligent machines based on it."
"Macaques, chimps, even rodents and birds share a similar brain organization and homologous neural structures with us."
"But the octopus cannot take part in these comparisons, for it has an altogether different neural layout."
With the octopus we are faced with an intelligence that is shared throughout the body and doesn't always follow a hierarchical pattern.
This coordination emerges from an efficient and swift relaying of information directly from arm to arm and indirectly via the brain.
This kind of neural distribution and messaging does not only benefit movement or motor dexterity.
Researchers have observed octopuses off the coast of Indonesia carrying with them two coconut shell halves as they roam the seafloor.
This behavior shows ingenuity and foresight: an ability to estimate future needs and to come up with appropriate actions.
"But despite their differences, both of them share some general traits in the way they are dealing with the world."
"What's more, different structures with different protocols could yield similar intelligence."
"Centralized or distributed structures, top-down or egalitarian signaling schemes, could solve complicated problems."
"Or maybe, in a few million years, a talking octopus will figure this out."

For more about Robin Hood's role check out Steve LeVine's How Robinhood Went From Hero to Villain in 48 Hours.
Many people turned to @robinhood on Twitter to air their strong feelings.
The only problem is the @robinhood account is run by the Robin Hood Society not the Robin Hood App whose handle is @robinhoodapp.
The Robin Hood Society was well-positioned because it owned the @robinhood handle.
Never underestimate the value of the right name at the right time.
"The Robin Hood Twitter account began the day on Thursday, Feb. 28 with under 400 followers."
"By Friday morning they had over 40,000.Their first tweet after realizing what was happening set the tone for all the tweets that followed."
"There is not a hint of anger, frustration, or being overwhelmed."
Even more importantly those who made a mistake are welcomed and not ridiculed in any way.
The wording of the tweet is also subtly and charmingly British in a way that is catnip to Americans.
People are redirected gently in a way likely to cause a smile rather than frustration.
"In all subsequent tweets and replies, the account remains in character and on brand."
"While the follower count continued to shoot up, Robin Hood kept responding to the various comments."
"For the World Wide Robin Hood Society, this was the perfect scenario."
A major news story and a mistaken name drove people to their twitter account.
They responded so perfectly to this initial surge that their follower base skyrocketed.
"It is hard to predict when and where internet lightning will strike for any individual, company, or organization."
"You have branding questions and after creating, shaping, and supporting brands for ten years - I have answers."
"It's Thursday at 9PM, and in 12 hours, you'll be talking to the hiring manager."
"But right now, you're stuck nervously refreshing the Mission page on the company website."
"Well, I liked their presentation, but experientially, I thought it was flat."
"Go to a marketing event, read through a CMO forum, listen to a CX podcast."
"We hijack it into sentences like the kids from the Valley did with, like , in the early 2000s."
"You know, like, when I said like, that time."
"I guess this is fine, so long as we accept that we are missing major pillars of the strategic imperative."
"The super obvious example, Innovation , is pretty much the word of our time."
"Change the color of your logo, and you'll probably call it brand-innovation ."
"Decide to vary your route to work, and it's commute-innovation ."
"Well, there is now another word suffering that same fate, this time at the hands of marketing and CX professionals."
"In truth, experience has specific attributes that one can both design for and harness."
"But it also has boundaries, where it bumps up against other defined things that you can also design for and harness."
"This means all service attributes, e.g. frictionless interactions, with your customer."
"In other words, the stuff that you have to do with each other, that is not defining for either of you."
"But when we elevate an interaction to the state of being memorable, we have created an experience."
"If we have done it by accident, it usually means we inserted friction in ways that the customer doesn't like."
"In fact, you can tell if something was an experience or not, simply by whether you remember it or not."
When something connects with our emotions we store it in our long-term memory.
"If you want the science on it, read about the limbic system."
"By definition, when this happens, we have had, an experience."
"Now, as a brand, we absolutely do not want people to remember everything they do with us."
"For instance, if someone specifically remembers your online checkout process, it is because you forced them to, negatively."
But you do want them to remember certain targeted interactions with you.
"Like a brand activation, or a thank you gift, or a particular interaction that is designed to be feel good ."
People actually pay more for them or the things they are attached to.
"But all of them are interactions, and the sum of these, collectively, is Engagement."
"So it is engagement, not experience, that is your end goal."
"Just because someone was involved in a process with your brand, does not mean that you engaged them."
"So, we want engagement, not involvement, and these are consumed over time."
"Yes, over time, which is the other key thing to understand."
"For these reasons, time-limited marketing campaigns or offers, do not trigger engagement in and of themselves."
"They can contribute, so long as the other correct interactions are present, but that's as far as they can go."
"And yet so many marketing departments are nothing more than a 1920's paperboy, yelling in the street."
"Well, the specificity of language, and clarity of definition, is one of the key hallmarks of professional maturity."
"To do that, we need to understand and normalize these essential definitions in our profession."
"Those that do so, and apply the execution disciplines that they imply, know that whilst critical, experience isn't everything."
Schumpeter knew it already decades ago: innovation is an invention put to work .
The underlying idea of his statement is as apparent as it can be.
"However, it is often hard for companies to come to this conclusion."
The reason is an unequal focus on research and development compared to the emphasis on design.
"Usually, we allocate all attention to core-competences and technology."
"However, when innovation is an invention put to work, the magic happens where the customer interacts with the offering."
"To make the invention work and thus truly innovate, we must understand our customers' mental model."
"In our businesses, we are used to filling out a business model canvas."
What the cost will be to make that value and how we will be profitable.
"When we are good at it and have done our research in the best of manners, we can define our value proposition."
We usually have an excellent idea of the key activities we have to execute and the critical resources we need.
The key partners that provide us with the necessary resources are also somewhat easy to map.
So we have our business model in place and have some ideas about the needs of our customers.
The reason for that is that our customers' mental model is beyond our control and often beyond our understanding.
But that understanding is due to that same digitisation often much more important to acquire.
"In this digitised world, we do not interact in person with our customers, in many cases."
Metaphors really help look outside in and get focused on the crucial factor or the real need.
The original 1998 shooter Half-Life begins with the infamous tram ride.
"The ride gives you a peek at the enemies, hazards, and landscapes that await you."
"Because during that long tram ride, there is little to do."
"Half-Life stood apart from other games, thanks to the strength of its interactive storytelling."
The player is an active part of every cutscene and is free to move around the world as events unfold.
This creates an unprecedented connection with the game world in iconic moments.
"You could stare unblinkingly at the beautiful, but terrifying light-show before you."
That's great because that is your reaction to the world manifesting itself in the game thanks to the openness of the mechanics.
This is why the tram ride doesn't align with Half-Life's philosophy.
"Thankfully, the next five minutes of the game make up for this."
"You can ruin microwave meals, rummage through colleague's lockers, eavesdrop on conversations, and leave workplace destruction in your wake."
"The criticism of this introductory sequence reached Valve, and they changed their approach in the next installment."
"In the opening segment of Half-Life 2, interactive storytelling is present from the very start."
"Before we can truly explore City 17, it's established that we're in a world completely alien to us."
"Nervously clutching a briefcase, he'll only interact with you when prompted."
"No matter how many times I get relocated, I never get used to this, he despairs."
Throughout Half-Life 2 it becomes apparent that City 17's design found inspiration from the concrete jungles of Soviet bloc countries.
"The Eastern European architecture, the barbed wires - a world forever grey."
That inspiration becomes more visible as the train pulls into a concrete station.
"From a giant TV screen, you're greeted with a 1984-inspired supreme leader."
"If you decide to sit a spell and listen, the exposition comes across as clunky."
Even the line about Breen establishing City 17 as the capital feels out of place in his welcome speech.
It felt like a half-hearted excuse to wedge in our benefactors line into the player's first glimpse of the city.
Yet the mystery grows thanks to the dichotomy in Breen's speech.
One of our finest remaining urban centers suggests that most of the world is a dangerous wilderness.
"He never claims that City 17 is safe, but it's safer than the other sorry options out there."
We watch a guard shove him into his own suitcases before being roughly directed to move elsewhere.
"It's a small moment, but it's a moment that contrasts against the propaganda coming from the screen."
"As you step outside of the train station, a chilling sight greets you."
"Jutting out from the ground, disappearing into the clouds, is an imposing monolith - The Citadel."
The plaza gives players their first glimpse of this structure that towers over the relatively tiny city square.
It is at the plaza that we see the influence of the Combine's architecture.
"Hi-tech, sci-fi equipment covers the tops of City 17's rotting buildings."
But it's hard to be impressed by these glimpses of equipment and wiring.
Because even the technology looks like they bought it on a budget.
This can be clearly seen on the Breencast screen attached to the obelisk in the middle of the plaza.
Rubber-coated wires droop down from a nearby building and into the square.
It brought to mind cost-cutting solutions for urban electric wiring that's often seen in slums.
"Every time I play this opening, I obsess over this obelisk."
"Now, with the Citadel looming behind it, the obelisk shrinks underneath it."
"To add insult to injury, it now acts as a stand to hoist up screens to push out propaganda to the public."
One can't help wonder what was City 17 before all of this.
"We build monuments to remember the past, but there are no plaques on this obelisk."
At first it seems just as nondescript as the other buildings in the plaza.
It is just as quiet and abandoned as every other commercial building around this train station.
There is no use for a hotel in a world where no one travels unless they have been relocated .
Exploring further down the road past the hotel will show a small side door standing ajar.
Once upon a time it served as a hub for travellers and citizens - a place of movement and freedom.
"Now it sits quietly, save for when the screen pushes out another message from the regime."
There is so much to explore and dissect in your first moments in City 17.
"However, I'll wrap it up with one final, iconic image: the empty playground."
It's easy to think nothing of it until you come across a rusted playground roundabout and a slide.
The simple image of playground equipment turning brown and red from rust leaves players with an unsettled feeling.
"This empty playground surrounded by square, blocky apartments, followed by the eerie silence sends an uncomfortable chill down my spine."
Valve shows mastery in creating a story through its different landmarks and the small interactions you glimpse as you move closer.
These simple techniques paint a clear image of what City 17 is truly like and what to expect in your time here.
"There is more to share, this piece only analyzing the first ten minutes of gameplay."
"If you haven't had the pleasure of playing Half-Life 2, grab it now."
The first chapter alone is an incredible display of environmental storytelling and the small ways developers can world build without dialogue.
"Half-Life 2's strength is, also, in its game design and writing."
"So if you're ready to step into City 17, don't forget to look over your shoulder once in a while."
This is a city where you need to be on your toes at all times.
Judges' discretion in judicial settings is ideally important as it can help best in promoting individualized bail and sentencing practices.
"Judges are committed, responsible professionals, who are institutionally trained and empirically experienced."
"So, the outputs of data explosion in the courtroom make a major shift from the individualized decision-making process.4."
"However, it is also recently shown that algorithms can outperform human predictions of recidivism in ecologically valid settings ."
But this warning seems likely to be 'ineffectual' in changing the way judges think about risk predictions.
"In practice, it is really challenging and unusual for a judge to defy algorithmic recommendations."
"This is the case not only for judges, but it also true for the technically-trained-professional."
"Moreover, beyond this external pressure, psychological biases also reign and encourage the use of algorithmic tools."
"Hence, now is a big question again: isn't it an intricate problem anymore?"
Watching a movie on the release date is a prestigious thing in Asia.
"Yet, on the release date, they bump into the cinemas."
"At that time, we didn't have the luxury of booking tickets online and watch movies."
We talked to theatre owners and booked a few first-day shows.
We knew how to access fans outside the theatres because we were part of them.
"We got a profit, and fans got a hassle-free first-day show."
"At that time, I didn't know what customer journey maps are."
We created a touchpoint that didn't exist on a fan's journey to watch a new movie.
Little things could mean a lot if we pay attention to them.
You don't have to be an MBA to do journey mapping.
Your kindergarten kid may do it better than most executives in boardrooms.
Many successful firms use them to empathize with users and develop revolutionary ideas.
"Journey maps, as well as Design Thinking, are human-centric ways for problem-solving."
"In real life, we can use these techniques to build new products or to resolve social issues."
"Some people call it a customer journey map, and others call it a user journey map."
But they are the same - visual storytelling tool to narrate how a person accomplishes a task.
Journey maps have several benefits:All journey maps have five underlying components.
"But, some may use a different flavor for their specific needs."
"Here is a simplified, hypothetical customer journey map for an online cake merchant."
Here is how we come up with the five components of the journey map.
These are high-level actions or the breakdown of the main task.
She selects a few cakes in some shops and finally purchases one of the cakes chosen.
"The purchasing happens only before a couple of days, yet the process started at least before a week."
The insights stage is the most creative part of a customer journey mapping exercise.
Here are a few insights and opportunity we Identified:You may have noticed.
It's an easy and fun way to structure your thinking process.
A real one could have more phases and activities - it should.
Current state maps are useful to identify and document problems as they are now.
"It helps learn what user needs are, what gaps exist, and how they feel about their experience at the mom."
A future-state journey map is useful to envision the ideal user experience.
It helps to look at the problem from new angles and brainstorm.
"In the hypothesis-first approach, you can start creating a customer journey map right away with your past experiences."
Use it if you want to get your stakeholders familiar with journey maps.
"For the study, you can do interviews or observations of how customers accomplish their goals."
Start with a hypothesis-first way to quickly sketch the current-state and a future-state of a problem.
Then you can follow up with customer research and create a more dependable journey map.
The visual storytelling tool is simple enough for even kids to make one.
And we can use our brains to think out of the box without circling in a narrow frame.
It could be a back of the envelope thing or a team activity that spans over many weeks.
"In the latter case, you'd do it with large discussion walls and post-it notes."
"In both ways, we draw simple pictures because text demands more brainpower."
His escape is unsuccessful however and he is gunned down by President Bridget herself.
"In the aftermath of the explosion, Barret and Tifa's sadness, desperation, and rage can barely be contained."
"This scene, which goes on for almost 10 minutes, is one of the most impressive achievements in modern gaming."
Nathan Drake goes searching for clues to a hidden pirate treasure in Madagascar.
"The problem is, there's someone else who's also after the very same treasure: notorious businessman Rafe Adler."
It's incredible to think how Naughty Dog managed to pull all of this together and create such an action-packed sequence.
And there's a reason why he's known by that name.
"At the start, despite the bad weather, the climb seems to be going rather well."
"Eventually, she begins to fall down while trying her best to fight off the oncoming avalanche."
"New Donk City is a very unique part of Mario's latest adventure, Super Mario Odyssey."
"And that's because it looks and feels, well, more like an actual city."
Like something you'd see in Grand Theft Auto or Watch Dogs.
"It's in this world that you meet Pauline, the mayor of this rather modern new area."
She asks for your help to bring the power back to the city.
"Once you collect all of the moons requested by Pauline, however, something even more unexpected takes place."
"As if that wasn't enough, Princess Zelda herself can be heard throughout the battle pushing Link forward toward victory."
A truly heart-warming moment that inspires players to succeed in a difficult challenge.
"A game that is full of breathtaking cinematic visuals, this one stands out as the most gut-wrenching."
But they fall into a trap and are captured by the enemy.
"When Jin denies his request, the heartless general ruthlessly takes the head of Taka, one of the protagonist's dearest friends."
"Her reaction, after finding the beheaded corpse of her brother, is enough to bring tears to the eyes."
And let's hope that games continue to bless us with awe-inspiring moments like these in the future!
"The idea is not to abandon it, but to make it work better for you."
"By limiting the number of things we ask our phones to do, we can give them a clearer purpose."
"If you find this process to be painful, that is a good sign that you're doing it right."
"Your phone is getting a new life, more aligned with yours."
I replaced my Notes app with - wait for it - a physical notepad.
I found the process of displacing apps back into my real-world experience empowering.
"For many technology companies, mweb is an afterthought - an if we must."
Just look at your favorite native mobile app next to its mobile web counterpart and you'll see what I mean.
You can even increase your difficulty level by moving your browser app off your home screen.
"To prevent a future relapse, I recommend holding onto one or two guilty pleasures."
Incremental progress is more realistic and easier to stick to than throwing it all away.
"That's why, though I felt torn about my camera app, I ultimately decided to keep it."
"The same can be said of students, direct reports, and more junior colleagues."
Remembering that others are learning from our behaviors can be just the nudge we need to set our phones aside.
This has turned out to be one of my strongest motivators to spend less time on my phone.
"Remember what you asked your phone to do for you, and step back if it's not providing that."
"We might get a break to hear ourselves think for a moment, or just breathe."
"Admittedly, I have not loved myself to the best of my ability recently."
"Instead, I am in a mental clinic to get myself back on track."
Being diagnosed with starters schizophrenia and depression was a big wake up for me.
I had been isolating myself and not taking care for a few months.
Now I'm landed in a clinic; I am learning to love myself again and show others how to.
Here's how to love yourself and be happier because it's the most important journey you can be on.
"Well, they can be from brushing your teeth to taking a bath."
This is the most significant setback you can do in your journey of self-love.
"Being in a mental clinic, there is a cleaner who comes around every morning."
All of these terrible things I was telling myself was taking a massive hold on my self-confidence.
"To love yourself every day, you need to forgive yourself and feel okay."
The reason is that we beat ourselves up a lot about not being perfect or productive.
Let's stop together and start finding forgiveness in our hearts to heal.
Put your hand on your heart and look in the mirror every morning saying I forgive myself and love myself .
I help people go from a human doing to a human being.
"Back in my corporate days, I used to cling to podcasts as a lifeline."
"When I first started my job, my work was pretty easy."
"As an understimulated twenty-two-year-old, I discovered the world of podcasts and everything changed."
"Suddenly, my job was easier than ever - because my real job became listening to popular shows with incredible hosts."
"At work, I used to always joke about starting my own true crime podcast."
At least I did until an opportunity came knocking on my door.
"About a year into my full-time writing journey, I connected with a new client."
I had worked with other podcasters before and found the work to be fun and engaging.
It sounded like an amazing gig - and it was - and is.
He wanted me to write blog posts on true crime cases for his website.
"The more I worked with him, the more fun that I had."
Every new case was an opportunity to learn and explore something that genuinely interested me.
The content took longer to write just because I was having so much fun researching it.
"It hardly felt like work, and I was really enjoying spinning tales of tragedy and intrigue."
"Then, one day, he asked if we could arrange a call."
He wanted to know if I would be interested in hosting my own true crime show.
"Apparently, the blog posts that I was writing were quite a hit."
People really seemed to be enjoying them and they were getting a lot of attention.
"They liked my storytelling style, and he wanted to know if I would do it for a show."
"It's a cliche, but surreal is the only word that comes to mind."
"After all the time spent joking about making a true crime podcast, this client actually wanted to add me to his network."
"At the time, I didn't even know he had a network."
"But, I honestly wasn't sure that I could do it."
"It was completely new for me, and I wanted to do it well."
"Honestly, I expected to meet some degree of pushback, but I met absolutely zero resistance with my requests."
"The social media accounts, marketing efforts, and listener perks are all in my control."
The network provided me with my podcasting setup and is handling all of the costs for production and advertising.
They are even promoting my show on their other shows so I have a great launch.
"It's the creative dream, the one that every baby creative is promised will come if they just work hard enough."
"And hey, maybe those stories are right to some extent - or maybe I'm just lucky."
Maybe it's just hard work and timing coming together in the best possible way.
"They are just great people looking to grow their network, and they want to help me be successful."
"I really leaned into freelance writing, my biggest goal was to network with clients that I wanted to support."
"I take an interest in them and their projects, and new opportunities are coming because of it."
One client gave me a podcast with free access to an existing audience.
Another client has me writing a full-length feature film this year just because he liked my short story.
"If you are a content creator, make sure that every person you work with enjoys working with you."
"Go on then, what's happening?You live in the middle of a colossal blizzard of information."
Just think about it - your skin has around a million nerve-endings constantly detecting miniscule changes in pressure and temperature.
Your eyes capture more than 300 megapixels of visual information - every second.
"And at any given moment, your conscious mind is busy ignoring nearly all of it."
You can thank your reticular activating system - RAS - for the fact that your brain hasn't melted yet.
"In the same way, anything that threatens danger or promises sex always gets through, too."
You know when you first put on an itchy jumper how you feel every prickle?
"That's your RAS deciding this new, uncomfortable sensation is something you need to be aware of."
"Leave it five minutes though, and your RAS gets bored and stops letting that information through."
"After ten minutes, you'll probably forget that it ever did."
"Now, for some reason it does and suddenly the noise is irritating the hell out of you."
It's become important - your RAS thinks you should do something about it.
"Nope, white shirts and passes only - gorillas aren't on my list, sorry."
One result of this is that we all suffer from something called confirmation bias.
We get to see only the information that supports our existing beliefs - especially when those beliefs are ideologically or emotionally charged.
"In one Stamford University study, participants were given a report on capital punishment to read."
The students who approved of capital punishment believed they had read a report that supported it.
The students who were against the death penalty believed that they had read a report condemned it.
"In fact, both groups had been given exactly the same report."
"Their RAS saw all the information but held back the parts that didn't support their beliefs, filtered it out."
"The information that supported their views was important, so it passed it through into their awareness."
"There were always lots of red cars on the road, it's just that now you notice them."
"Before, your RAS was seeing them but holding them back, filtering them out."
What if you could programme it to pass exactly the right information on to you?
It would be like programming a satnav to lead you exactly where you wanted to go.
"Even better, it would actually take you there - like being on autopilot."
"Unprogrammed, your RAS is like a nightclub bouncer screening out what it considers to be the undesirables."
"Programmed, your RAS is like a satnav giving you directions directly to your goals."
"So a few years ago, the newspapers were intrigued when a young girl appeared to have a magical gift for finding them."
"Of course she could - and after staring at a patch of clover for a couple of minutes, she picked one."
"Was it magic, wrote the reporter, or merely a skilful conjuring trick?Neither."
Four-leaf clovers are rare - roughly one in ten thousand.
But clovers are also very small - ten thousand covers an area about the size of a desk-top.
Which is what she'd done - and she trained the reporter to do it too.
"By the end of the afternoon, he'd found all the lucky clover he'd ever need."
This girl created a filter for her RAS which then did what it does best.
"Okay, you could take a magnifying glass and laboriously inspect 10,000 clover plants to find the one lucky one."
"That would work, and it's the way most of us would do it."
Trained it to sift through billions of pieces of data to present you with exactly what you needed to know.
"Of the people who have tried it, some find it works really well for them."
"But reframed as a task for your RAS, it possibly starts to make more sense."
"Just as there are always lots of red cars, there are always plenty of opportunities to achieve your goals."
It will pass them through to your awareness so you notice them - suddenly you'll see opportunities everywhere.
So it seems reasonable to expect that you could programme your RAS by believing in your goals passionately and enthusiastically.
"Think about them, talk about them, write about them intensively."
Put time and energy into them - make them your number one priority and put them at the top of your agenda.
"Hammer the significance home - dream about your goals, use affirmations, make vision boards."
Do everything you can to impress upon your RAS that this is really important.
"So concentrate on getting a clear, focused image of what you want to achieve - visualise what you want,"
Making up your conscious mind to do anything is of no use at all unless your unconscious mind agrees to it.
Because it's your unconscious mind that makes the decisions - not your conscious one.
"As expected, participants made the decision to move about half a second before the movement was actually made."
"Participants were adamant that it was their conscious choice, made of their own free-will, about when to move."
Their impression that they had made a conscious choice of their own free will was pure illusion.
It really looks as if it's your unconscious mind that's calling the shots - and hiding the gorillas.
But you can do a lot to influence the decisions it makes.
"To me, it represents the real challenge in data science, and specifically in computer vision."
"If you got here, you're probably interested in OCR in some way."
"Either you are a student or a researcher who wants to study this field, or you have a business interest."
"As said, OCR depicts many of the achievements but also the challenges in deep learning and data science in general."
"On one hand, a tremendous advancement to what we had before."
"This library is not perfect, but it's really a great solution to have."
"This pipeline, except the detection part is mostly trained end to end, to reduce complexity."
"Having a pipeline of different components is a good idea, however it has some drawbacks."
"Each component has it own set of biases and hyper parameters, and it induces another level of complexity in the pipeline."
"Throughout the years, the OCR task honed in around a dozen different datasets."
"On the other hand, OCR task is one of the easiest to use synthetic data."
Lets see what are the prominent datasets available: Real DatasetsA few datasets exploited the massive coverage of google street view.
"SVHN - street view numbers, which we used for the example in the previous post."
"E.g, 2019 datasets is called arbitrary shaped text , which mean, as irregular as it gets."
"Synthetic datasetsThere are 2 popular synthetic datasets, which were used in most OCR works."
"Before addressing specific research papers, we need to determine metrics for success."
There are two main metrics: word level accuracy and character level accuracy.
"In this post, we are focused here on best practices than on laying out ideas."
Reaching the current generation of text detection model was a bit tricky.
"Previously, text detection was intuitively subdued as a sub-branch of object detection."
"However, object detection has some settings that are general for objects such as cars, faces and so on."
The essence of this is that text is both homogeneous and characterized by its locality.
"Therefore, segmentation based methods would be a better fit for text detection than object segmentation."
"CRAFTOur favorite object detection method, which is also integrated into easy OCR is called CRAFT - Character Region Awareness for Text Detection."
"However, this tool was built as a classic computer vision tool and didn't undergo the transition to deep learning well."
"APIsThe OCR were some of the early computer vision APIs of the big cloud providers - Google, Amazon and Microsoft."
"The ability to build an open source, state of the art tool from different building blocks is fascinating."
"You can see below, that they are even better than the paid API results."
"In our next post, we'll show how to do some of it."
It should not come as a surprise that inference of OCR might be slow.
"An image with many items may take a few dozens of seconds on a GPU, not mentioning CPU."
"So after discussing different packages and models, it's time to witness the actual results."
Go to this colab notebook to try Easy OCR vs Google OCR vs Tesseract.
"Somehow surprisingly, the best performer on PDF is the good ole' Tesseract."
"It seems that Google OCR wasn't 100% correct on a single book, while Easy OCR had a few."
The main problem that you have is finding the time to start a business.
I have already made quite a few articles on print on demand so I will keep this short.
Print on demand is when you create designs and uploaded them to a POD provider like Printful.
You will most likely want to go for a lot of time because it does cost a lot.
"However, this is just not true and I personally think it is great for a lot of people."
You create a website around something that you enjoy talking about and start writing an article when you have the time.
You can span the writing over multiple days so that you don't have to write rubbish content.
This can be great if you are working a full-time job because you can work when you want to.
It can also become a passive income source from the google search traffic.
Writing on Medium is very similar to starting a blog because you are writing articles for paying members to read.
The best thing about Medium is that it is all done for you so that you don't have to create a website.
You can create articles on whatever you want and you can write as much or as little as possible.
This is great if you are working full-time because you won't have to stick to a strict schedule.
This can be a physical paper one or a digital one Google Calendar.
You want to start by creating a list of all the things that you need to do in life that is regular occurrences.
"Now that you know this, go to your calendar and start to schedule the things that you have to do."
You may start seeing the time that is blank that you can use to start your business.
You want to change up your sleep schedule so that you can go to bed later and wake up earlier.
You want to make it so that you can get extra work is done at night and extra work in the morning.
This is not a permanent change and it will just be until your business is up and running.
You can use your weekends as a great time to get a lot of work done.
When you are working you should have your phone out of the room because it is so easy to get distracted by it.
You should also switch on do not disturb on your computer to eliminate all distractions possible.
You should be working in a room where no one else is because that is yet another distraction.
The same goes with devices in the room because if you have a tv on then you could become distracted from that.
When you want to start your dream business to change your life for the better you need to find the time.
"And if the US is so rich, why aren't more people happy?"
"However, it isn't clear whether these findings take inflation into account."
"In a country with massive gaps between the rich and the poor, this is a pretty weird way to look at things."
But there's another surprise: only 13% of American millionaires consider themselves to be wealthy.
"We've looked at average levels of happiness and income, but what about when you zoom in and compare individual people?"
"However, here's the thing about that study: firstly, it was done on people in the US."
"When studies that yielding findings considered universal human truths were replicated across other nations, completely different findings were observed."
"Were they expecting rich people to be sitting around all day in their mansions, cackling maniacally over their piles of cash?"
"But again, this may largely be down to where you're living."
"As I mentioned before, the US and the UK are pretty bad when it comes to income inequality -"
"And, as you may suspect, countries with higher levels of income inequality also have higher levels of status anxiety."
"But if sudden increases in wealth don't make you happier, it may be due to the hedonic treadmill effect."
"According to this theory, we will always return to our baseline level of happiness, regardless of what happens to us."
It is difficult not to completely lose the plot under these conflicting messages.
"After all, attaching your sense of wellbeing to external rewards is only going to lead to despair and anxiety."
"This year, more than ever, consumers are not looking to be patronized."
"Bloom & Wild's customers don't buy into cliches, so this year it isn't selling them."
The brand collated data from real customers and amplified their point through an impactful campaign.
"Based on a Bloom & Wild survey of 1,000 nationally representative UK men and women between the ages 18-64 January 2021."
"This is, once again, proof that customer insights can be your best alley when shaping up a campaign."
Don't be afraid to shape your campaign around hidden customer truths.
"Deliveroo, Tinder and Wingstop partnered to launch a new 'DeliverDate' service just in time for Valentine's. '"
"DeliverDate' sees Tinder profiles of 30 local singletons printed on Wingstopchicken wing boxes, available nationwide through Deliveroo."
Working on creative partnerships with unexpected matches can open upa whole new audience in unexpected ways.
"Experiences really drive marketing, even right now, with Covid putting the brakes on experiential events."
"In 2020, Twitter took over London by challenging the norm and going against Valentine's cliche with relatable tweets from real people."
"As David Ogilvy once said, the consumer isn't a moron."
Think about ways you can change the conversation and go where other people may not feel comfortable heading with their message.
Customer-driven marketing can still be a great resource for last-minute marketing ideas on social media.
"Word of mouth campaigns can be a real winner on social media, as they are easy to set up and execute."
Altruistic competitions can be a great alternative for important dates and occasions like Valentine's and Galentine's day.
May these lessons be the ones you can take with you beyond Valentine's Day and into your overall strategy.
"By James EberhardDenver has always been my home, even when I wasn't technically a city resident."
"The Mile High City offers so much, including a diverse talent pool, natural beauty and inspiration, and affordability."
Denver also offers a chance to build sustainably successful businesses outside the confines of Silicon Valley or New York City.
The Mile High City is on the fast track to becoming a new micro-tech hub as its own right.
The city has a strong infrastructure between the international airport and a transportation system that ranks №12 in the country.
"The local government has been committed to investing in transforming the city into a tech hub, and it shows."
A 2019 PowderKeg survey found that 80% of tech founders in the Denver area felt there was sufficient access to talent.
"Most importantly, there's incredible variety in terms of company size."
"New businesses benefit from mentorship opportunities, community organizations, and local sales opportunities."

And the city's culture is evolving to ensure this momentum isn't lost.
When you don't get enough sleep you damage your body and impair your mind.
Most of us feel like it's hopeless to fit enough of it into our schedule between all of our daily problems.
Add to that the distractions of social media and devices that keep you up later than you planned.
"So when you finally do lie down and try to grab some rest, it has to happen right away."
But you might not be able to drift off when you want to.
"Even if that sounds wrong, the U.S. Navy Pre-Flight School has shown us how it can be done."
Don't waste time and get frustrated because you're flipping and flopping and unable to sleep.
"Try to relax and be proactive, instead of rehashing endless thoughts that lead to nowhere but exhaustion."
A common complaint I hear as a meditation instructor is students falling asleep when they try to learn to meditate.
I incorporated some military techniques into a simple sleep meditation that anyone can use to get to sleep fast.

"Once you learn how to use it, you can get some extra rest anywhere with a nap, too."
"If I was lucky, a few hours a night, and sometimes none."
"During basic training, I learned to fall asleep within seconds no matter what."
"Later, in the artillery, I learned to sleep right through literal cannons going off only a few feet away."
We would get a bit of rest beside 105-mm Howitzers while they were firing.
The U.S. Navy Pre-Flight School came up with a more scientific method of falling asleep for their pilots during WWII.
"Falling asleep while flying is a huge, costly mistake that ends in death and destroys any chance of mission success."
"To make sure their pilots could use downtime effectively, they worked on methods to fall asleep in minutes."
"The pilots practiced these methods while sitting upright in a chair, feet flat on the ground."
That means you have a serious advantage over these pilots if you're lying down in a dark room on a soft bed.
"The US Army reportedly has a 96% success rate for those who use it, after 6 weeks of practice."
"I prefer a bed, but any soft flat place where you won't be disturbed will work."
"If you have to, you can use this meditation to go to sleep sitting up, too."
"Start by paying attention to the softness of the sheets, blanket, and pillow."
Try using one of these visualizations if the first steps don't do the trick.
That means you can get better at it if you put in the effort and some practice.
It isn't totally out of our control like most of us assume.
"Over your life, it will pay you back with a ton of well-being."
Take charge of your sleep time and get the rest you deserve.
"In this third part of signal processing with Python, I'd discuss use of median filter to remove large spiked signals."
"First, let's clarify once again, what is the difference between mean and and median of a series."
"To compute the median of a set of numbers, we need toMedianNow, consider a list of numbers."
Contrary to this the median is largely unaffected by the presence of outliers.
"Before I discuss more about the median filter, I want to add that median is a non-linear filter."
"Thus, it is best to apply a median filter only to a limited number of data point in your signal."
"These data points are in most cases some unusual data points, outliers or missing signals."
I will discuss more about linear and non-linear filters in one of the future posts.
"However, in a later post I might discuss how to define a function to simulate a random walk, just for fun."
Now I am going to set a fraction of data points to some large number of values which will appear as spiked signal.
But here our purpose is to replace the outliers with some combination of the neighboring points.
Next we must decide how do we define outliers for a particular dataset.
"That information might be previously known from your experiment, for example, in what range you should expect the values to be."
"Here, however, we are going to decide on the threshold for outliers by visual inspection."
Let's look at the histogram for all the data values that we have here.
Now if we zoom into the x-axis we would find that most of the values in the dataset lie below 50.
Now I initialize the filtered signal by a copy of the original signal.
Now I am looping over time points in the series where the value is greater than the threshold.
I replace these values in the original signal by the median of -k to +k neighboring values.
"To prevent that error in the code we set the lower boundary as either 0 or outliersi-k , whichever is larger."
"Similarly, the upperbound is outliersi+k or n+1, whichever is smaller."
"The agency also recommends handwashing, cleaning and contact tracing for all schools."
"There's more science to rely on, and we've learned a lot from that science."
The U.S. Department of Education released a companion handbook with additional examples.
"Vaccine distribution is ramping up, said Rick Hess, director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute."
"The science shows that schools are not a significant source of contagion, and the devastating effects of closure have become increasingly clear."
He called Psaki's statement unconscionable and described the administration's position as anti-science foot shuffling.
That is the bar we're trying to leap over and exceed.
"In California's blueprint, for example, counties where the risk of transmission is widespread are coded purple."
Some districts have already announced that they don't expect to reopen before the end of the school year.
"For months, parents across the country have lost patience with districts delaying the reopening of schools."
"Protests, lawsuits and angry outbursts at school board meetings have increased."
"Parents are looking for a plan, for stability and decision making based on science from public health officials, Rodrigues said."
We can't keep moving the goalposts and the metrics based on which way the political winds are blowing for the unions.
"The guidance is instructive for this moment in time, but this disease is not static."
"It was the peak of the pandemic, and everyone was working from home."
"My day was spent in meetings, getting kids on and off Zoom calls, quick snacks and multiple cups of coffee."
I sat down for another hour and made some progress by researching and creating the agenda slide.
But my mind was still racing with the nagging feeling that the day wasn't very productive.
"I berated myself for not making better to-do lists, or maybe I could have tried the Pomodoro technique."
Perhaps I needed to set stricter boundaries with my kids regarding interruptions.
"Deadlines are usually in weeks or months, and workers are often on their own for managing their daily schedules."
"Also, teamwork, mentoring, learning, reporting, are all part of the job."
"We may be getting into the zone for programming, only to be interrupted a few minutes later by the next meeting."
"By the end of the day, we have barely made progress on our important project."
"With everyone working from home during the last year, family interruptions have been added to the mix, creating even more disruptions."
This nagging feeling of not doing enough and the guilt of ineffective time management leads to productivity shame.
We start our day with lofty ideas of what we will accomplish.
"We have our big project on the top of the list, and we are sure we will make good progress."
We also neglect to account for lack of focus and frequent interruptions.
"The underestimated effort, coupled with ad-hoc planning sets us on a collision course with failure."
"If our day had a significant event such as a car breakdown or sick family member, we wouldn't feel productivity shame."
The minor mishaps are the ones to send us on our guilt trip at bedtime.
Getting more planning tools or learning new time management techniques would multiply the feeling of guilt.
"It is tempting to go through emails or social media, just for a few minutes before diving into the big hairy project."
"The few minutes turns into an hour, and we stop only when we absolutely need to get up from our desks."
"Process goals, on the other hand, require us to take action without worrying about the outcome."
Now that we have discussed the problem at length let's dive into the 5x5 process.
"These slots are your solo working time, where you can focus without interruptions."
"Next, mark these slots with specific items from your Five Little Wins in your preferred order."
"DO NOT use these slots for emails, chats or other collaboration activities."
"You will still have plenty of time to deal with emails, attend meetings etc."
Avoid all temptations to pick up your phone or look at emails or respond to chat.
Don't beat yourself up if you could not finish the planned item in 25 minutes.
You will get better at estimating as you practice the 5x5 process.
Because it will give you a 5-minute buffer between tasks or before the next meeting.
Leaving this assessment for the end of the day is a sure way to dissatisfaction.
Check-ins give you a chance to course-correct if needed.
"Check off the completed wins, and take note of the next one on the list."
"After the last check-in, reward yourself with a pat on your back."
"You may celebrate with a glass of wine, a piece of dark chocolate, or whatever healthy way you celebrate your wins."
"Remember, you are rewarding yourself for following the process and not for the output you produced."
"If you messed up, write down a few improvements for tomorrow."
"We all have competing demands on our time, and it is hard to balance everything."
Or other writers on Medium are publishing more articles or writing better ones.
I received a question from a reader on my last article asking about the shocking contrast between Japanese product design and web design.
Unlike languages that use the Roman alphabet there are no italics and no capital letters; making hierarchical contrast in typography very different.
"The layout of text on print and web apply various treatments, designs and stylistic elements to create these contrasts."
When looking at Japanese design; look at the language through the lens of the user.
What are you looking for when you search a website for a product online?
"Information, customer reviews, detailed photographs of the item - the list goes on."
In Japanese consumer culture; the more information given about a product in the early stages of the customer journey the better!
In a comparative study by btrax they looked at the designs of the Cookpad website in Spain and Japan.
The visual noise and chaos can be overwhelming but also alarmingly captivating.
The web real-estate is much like Tokyo's urban real-estate.
"Densely populated home pages, ads and text crammed into any space that would fit and dazzling bright colors."
This design has been around for some time and it isn't going away any time soon.
These sites have a growing number of users who rely on design consistency.
"Thus, depending on your target demographic, the UX should address different user needs."
Understanding Japanese consumer behavior helps to paint a clearer picture of their digital world.
"The modern mouse is wireless, laser-equipped, and bristling with buttons."
It took a change of format to create something that even comes close to rivaling the mouse - the touchscreen on your smartphone.
Touchscreens are perfectly suited to a tiny mobile device like the iPhone.
"But like the mouse, they're still fundamentally a physical, tactile technology."
Understanding our love of hybrids requires delving deep into our evolution and brain anatomy.
"I'm a photographer, so I spend a lot of time thinking about and using cameras."
"I shoot both analog film and modern digital photographs, so I own both vintage cameras and modern digital ones."
"My favorite camera, though, is somewhere in between: the Leica Q."
"Is this some kind of hipster throwback - impractical, but intended to impress other photographers?"
Leica built the Q that way because it's the most logical way to set up a camera.
"All the functions you need are laid out for you in an intuitive, physical way."
"After taking 550,000+ photos on my Q, I can literally operate it with my eyes closed."
"When I press the shutter button, I can feel the tiny click of the physical shutter firing."
The Q is such a fantastic camera in part because it's a hybrid.
"Steve Jobs reportedly hated buttons, and did his best to eliminate them from Apple's devices."
"Other devices exist entirely in order to give digital information a physical, analog presence."
Most of us are totally capable of reading e-books on a cellphone screen.
"Amazon says that the case develops a natural patina, making each cover unique and opens and closes just like a book."
"Our skin contains four different kinds of mechanoreceptors, which allow our brains to perceive touch."
"Three of them detect basic touch sensations, like pressure and the stretching of our skin."
"But we also have a fourth kind of special, exquisitely sensitive touch receptor: the Pacinian corpuscle."
"Unlike other mechanoreceptors, they're quickly overwhelmed by direct skin contact."
"When you use it to hit a nail, tiny vibrations travel up its handle and into your hand."
"Your Pacinian corpuscles detect those minuscule vibrations, encode them into electrical signals, and send them up to your brain."
Your brain then processes them using the same regions it uses to process stimuli that directly touch your skin.
It's as if you've embedded mechanoreceptors into the hammer itself.
"Especially if you hammer things a lot, your brain becomes adept at understanding the vibrations that your Pacinian corpuscles detect."
"Pacinian corpuscles allow you to interact with other kinds of tools, too."
The same is true when I press the physical page turn button on my Kindle and feel its satisfying click.
Even tech devices without real physical controls find ways to engage your Pacinian corpuscles and other mechanoreceptors.
Cellphones' virtual keypads are easy to use in part because they produce artificial vibrations when you touch a virtual key.
The same applies to an app that changes its haptics with each new update.
"The lack of haptics also explains why virtual assistants can seem like a strange, alien presence."
Even a baby can pick up a physical device like an iPad and immediately begin interacting with it.
That kind of connection is hard to replicate with any other input device - especially one that relies on audio alone.
Tiny details - like how a button clicks or the haptics of a virtual keyboard - may seem minor.
"But they connect to something deep, physical, and fundamentally human."
Getting hybrid interactions right can mean the difference between building a decent tech product and creating a life-changing one.
"We knew the bus had no windshield when we boarded it, but we felt unconcerned."
Maybe we'd been in Africa too long at that point to be surprised.
Perhaps we couldn't envision what the ride might be like without glass.
We'd chosen to travel at night hoping sleep would help the 12-hour journey pass more quickly.
"Twenty years later, I sit in an Airbnb on the Oregon Coast, about an hour from my home in Portland."
They're as cozy as they'd be in their beds at home.
"When the insects appeared inside the bus with no windshield, riders in front of Jimmie and I started to fidget."
Women drew their wraps over their mouths; men dropped their foreheads on the seatback in front of them.
"Big insects, small insects, stick-like figures, and meaty, juicy bugs."
He reported back that the driver wore black sunglasses as he transported us down the unlit road.
"Sitting nearby, a friend who had brought burning coals onto the bus, boiled fresh glasses of tea for the driver."
The unflappable person who lugged mattresses into the African sunshine to scorch bedbugs and peered into the faces of deadly vipers?
"Maybe our early risk-taking tendencies fade, or our mortality becomes palpable."
"Perhaps we stop caring if others consider us tough, cool, hard, and strong."
Now we appreciate hotel rooms with king-sized beds and can't imagine sharing a bathroom in a youth hostel.
"These powerful moments are the pigments that make up the messy, colorful, complicated, textured canvas of our lives."
"I want my daughters to have moments like this, moments awash in adventure, uncertainty, risk, and boldness."
"Though motherhood, ever the ultimate damper, wires me to keep them secure, protected, comfortable."
"Do I want my daughters to coexist with vipers, live six hours from a hospital, and take dangerous bus rides?"
We barely found the story of our journey from Mopti interesting enough to share with our Peace Corps friends.
"They were in their 20s, too; they had sensational tales of their own."
The best copy in the world isn't going to work if it's sitting in your Drafts folder.
You also know that sometimes getting copy out of your Drafts folder and into the world is easier said than done.
"If it's the blank page that scares you, start by thinking big picture."
"You might want to go into detail, making a note of every point you need to hit."
"With an outline on the page, you've given yourself a structure to work to."
"Personally, I always create a structure before I start to write."
I use the more detailed method when I'm less familiar with a topic.
"If you have no idea where to start or don't know what to say, you aren't ready to start."
"If you struggle to start simply because writing copy is hard work, there are several things you can try."
"If you struggle to start because you get 'stage fright', I have a couple of tips."
"This brings lots of benefits, quite aside from removing the fear factor."
"Having said that, feeling tired can also work, especially when you need to be creative."
"I often find that when your barriers are down because you're tired, that's when the most creative ideas creep in."
I use the Forest app to stop me picking up my phone.
There are also lots of tools to stop you faffing on your computer too - here's a useful list.
You've got a first draft you're happy with and you send it off to the people who need to approve it.
Everyone's got an opinion and they aren't afraid to share it!
You end up in an endless feedback loop and are working on your twentieth draft before you know it.
The brutal truth is that sometimes this is inevitable and you just have to live with it.
"The one person responsible for corralling stakeholders, collating all the necessary information and getting a decision made by the agreed date."
"They have knowledge or expertise that may influence the decision - i.e., they have a voice, but no vote."
This helps you because it reminds you whose opinion you have to listen to and whose you don't.
"For example, your fellow marketing colleague might be the 'Informed' on a piece."
"Knowing this, they know they can just glance at a piece not find time to give detailed feedback."
You can then ask people to sign off before you proceed to writing the full document.
"In other words, you can try to get the arguments out of the way before you start writing in full."
"Finally, when you're sending a piece out for feedback, set it in context for people."
"At the very least you want to say, for example - '"
This is the letter we'll send to people with their first order to welcome them to our company.'
You may also need to go into more detail to pre-empt questions and concerns about what you've said and why.
"For example, 'We know from our research that the majority of people who buy from us value sustainability."
It's why we've chosen to highlight some of our sustainability projects they may not have heard of yet.'
"By giving people the context, they can offer feedback that's relevant and useful."
It can be really hard to let go of copy and publish it in the world.
"If you're scared it isn't good enough, there are a few things you can do."
"If you're using printed literature, use different codes on the order form so you can track which version gets better results."
"Ultimately, writing copy is hard work for all sorts of reasons."
"There are, however, things you can do to ease the journey."
"If there are others that you use, I'd love to hear them!"
We have all experienced those unwanted spam emails and have hit that unsubscribe link as soon as we could.
This has resulted in my mailbox filling in with huge number of emails from websites that I have never registered to.
Rogue businesses want to make it as difficult for you as possible to unsubscribe from their mailing list.
They do this by making you log-in to their website to unsubscribe.
My namesake went ahead and registered my email address on this website.
"I learned about this on Dec 22, 2020 when I got an email saying I should check my new credit score."
So the first thing I do is hit the 'unsubscribe' link.
It takes me to this page:This clearly is not what an unsubscribe page should look like.
"Just because we usually do not unsubscribe from a lot of mailers, we do not realize this."
"Or worst, they were not aware that what they are doing is considered evil design practice."
The realization that you probably have less time ahead of you than behind you makes the memories even more precious.
"So, when I heard someone randomly mention Classmates, it ignited the tiniest memory ember."
"Classmates launched in 1995, around the dawn of the modern internet, and it is arguably one of the first social networks."
I liked the service enough to stick with it even when it started charging a yearly membership fee.
"Classmates.com is alive, kicking, and in some ways very much the same as I left it."
"It felt, in some ways, like I was thawing a cryogenically preserved site."
"Like Sylvester Stallone in Demolition Man, Classmates looked untouched by the almost 15 years of neglect and ready for me to reconnect."
"The service is still owned by United Online, a sort of retro online company that also owns remember when?"
It has tomes featuring pimple-faced teens going back to 1885.
"The catalog is not complete, but I found entire yearbooks for both of my graduating classes."
"One scan was poorly done, but the other was virtually perfect."
This was especially meaningful for me since I left the Colorado high school I attended for three years right before senior year.
"I discovered the counterintuitive solution: If I used Microsoft Edge to zoom out on the webpage, the yearbook image got larger."
"So many faces I hadn't seen in almost 40 years, frozen in time."
My time there felt like visiting a library where all the books were dusty but familiar.
"To see the names of those who expressed a passing interest in me, however, I'd have to pay."
"I appreciated the attention, and then thought that if they cared to reconnect, they'd probably seek me out on Facebook."
"It happened to me before, and I felt incapable and vulnerable."
You've been in so many places where you did not speak any local language.
"I have also had real challenges in a country like China, where the language is so different."
"I'd say it again, they'd repeat it - and this went on for five minutes."
"Or, go this way to where my train is about to depart?"
"In many places around the world I have also felt vulnerable, incapable, incompetent."
"This is something unwanted, something that is not necessarily positive about the travel experience."
"But when I look back on those occasions, I always laugh and I always have a good memory of them."
I love how languages like Basque and Gaelic are being kept alive.
"I can communicate with the people in my hometown on a language level, they can understand the words I say."
Once I did a wonderful hiking trip to Colca Canyon in Peru.
"On top of that, Chilean is a very complicated Spanish to understand if you don't speak Spanish."
"Because communication is not just about the language we speak - it is about how we act, the ideas we have."
"And I found that as human beings, we want to make a connection with other people, with like-minded people."
"And 99% of the time, we're open to try and make that connection."
"I got my rice, we made a connection, we had a laugh about it."
"It would be better if I could get the rice in a minute, but - that's life."
I'd really encourage you not to think too much about how language can be a barrier that makes us feel uncomfortable.
Think rather how language can be a part of how we make a new connection with another person.
"If everybody in the world spoke English, we'd have a very superficial culture."
"Everybody would understand each other in some way, but deep down we would still be completely different."
"And when we overcome it, there is much to discover on the other side."
Listen to Stephen's travel tales and insights on the Kated Travel Podcast.
We can't waste any more time addressing the global warming issue we're facing.
"Nevertheless, due to political conflicts of interest, governments are slow to act."
"Moreover, the US is not exactly one of the frontrunners in fighting climate change."
That's a shame because the US's wealth and resources could prove pivotal in global climate action.
"There are many ways we can contribute to a better environment ourselves, however."
"Through extensive lobbying with the Trump administration, oil companies structurally undermined the effectiveness of the US democracy."
"Activist shareholders buy ownership in a company to change the strategy for various reasons, but usually to generate more profit."
"For oil companies to remain profitable, they need to pivot away from fossil fuels to green alternatives."
The goal of big oil needs to change from fossil fuel producers to energy providers.
"In Europe, NGOs such as Follow-This are filing climate resolutions at AGMs."
"They buy shares with donations or ask for proxy-votes of other shareholders, essentially lending voting power."
"Shareholder voting is a democratic process in Europe, as it should be."
"That means that if you get enough votes, the company has no choice but to adjust its strategy."
"Apparently, the power of shareholders over senior management has been undercut by the US government."
"A slap in the face of democracy, as all people should be able to make their voice heard."
"Apparently, discussing the strategy of a company in which you have ownership is micromanaging?"
Saving the climate and determining the strategy sounds like macromanaging to me.
"This is also planning to introduce climate resolutions to US-based company Chevron, where they previously focused on European companies."
"Corporate lawyers are already getting ready for battle, aiming again to refuse shareholder voting."
"Again, comparable arguments are used:I hope that Biden will make good on his promise to fight climate change."
I approached them and asked them to help carry me and my very heavy powered wheelchair onto the train.
"Now, I wouldn't recommend this, but desperate times call for desperate measures."
"It was either that, or spend my first night solo travelling in a train station."
The global impact of the Coronavirus pandemic has particularly been felt in the travel industry.
"But taking a step back, the decision to travel alone is a big decision for any person."
Solo travelling with creativity and planning can really be a life changing experience for everyone.
"Happy travels!Elvy is a London based disabled blogger whose focus is on disabled travel, dating and lifestyle."

"Like a lot of millennial dudes, I grew up in a pervasive culture of toxic masculinity."
"Modeled by the behavior of my abusive father, I equated strength with a stoic demeanor."
"As a young man, I equated this possibility with failure on an existential level, with the death of my masculinity."
The culture of this stony and cruel toxicity came at me from every direction.
We believed that this was a man's duty: righteous violence without complaint.
"Over and over, the world taught me and my guy friends that this was how guys saved the day."
Long stretches of outward calm where inner turmoil ravaged under the surface and inevitably blew up later.
My interpersonal relationships were characterized by extended stints of my emotional unavailability peppered with fiery outbursts.
The parts where I was quiet about what was bothering me - that's when I thought I was doing well.
"I convinced myself the outbursts were small hiccups, failures at meeting the disciplined standard of the stoic strong man ideal."
"Each time I resolved to do better, to not let it happen again."
"Repeatedly, I hurt people and hurt myself with this inability to analyze my thoughts and behaviors through the right framework."
"Maybe it's for some people, I'd say, but not for me."
I thought therapy was where broken people went to try and become less broken.
Can you imagine the T-1000 laying down on a sofa and talking about his woes?
I'd spent decades doing it the other way and it wasn't working.
"Little by little, one session at a time, the endeavor seemed less like pointless bitching and more like purposeful reflection."
I didn't realize until later how much of the emotions were just buried as a way to cope and function.
Suddenly a whole lot of decisions and dynamics in my life made a lot of sense.
"In many ways, life is even harder than before I began."
"But these are good things to understand, even if one must learn them the hard way."
"Therapy is not about fixing ourselves, and the people who go are not broken."
I've learned that abandonment trauma and my insecurities don't make me inherently undeserving of love.
"I've learned that my thoughts, emotions, and behaviors can be understood, analyzed, improved."
I've learned how all this reduces needless suffering in my life and in the lives of those around me.
"Most of all, I've learned that going to therapy doesn't make me weak or broken."
"It makes me vulnerable, but I understand now how a willingness to be vulnerable is a vital component of strength."
"If we want to build back jobs, we have to look to the entrepreneurs of the country."
The COVID economy is unlike anything we expected at the start of 2020.
"By this past summer, 10 million American workers were giving up on returning to their last employer."
These issues are incredibly stressful for hard-working people looking to provide for themselves and their families.
"When the government spends money to support the unemployed, it's a Band-Aid, not a sustainable solution."
"With jobs scarce and millions looking to the government for help, we tend to overvalue what government can do."
The only power the government has right now is to buy the American worker some time.
"So, where can we turn for sustainable opportunity and meaningful hope?"
Free enterprise works for all of us - a rising tide lifts all boats.
But entrepreneurs as a group have not communicated this crucial idea well enough.
"If that business does well, and the entrepreneur prospers, people may even feel like that prosperity is inequitable or unfair."
We ought to feel good when we see new businesses opening and entrepreneurs succeeding.
"We should support new ventures and consider whether we could be part of one, too."
"If you're out of work yourself, your new job will probably come thanks to an entrepreneur."
"That same decade saw the rise of Apple, FedEx, Microsoft, and Oracle."
"Some of those companies were Uber, WhatsApp, Venmo, and Instagram."
"I also know that Americans will respond with creativity and grit, as we always do."
"There is even a name for it - survival entrepreneurship, as noted by Rich Karlgaard on Forbes earlier this year."
Jobs will come back as long as our free enterprise system allows entrepreneurs to build new businesses.
"Joe Ricketts is an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and founder of TD Ameritrade."
"Can you think of all your terrible, micromanaging bosses and the things you hated about them?"
What parts of their leadership do you want to stay away from?
One of the best bosses I ever had gave me two pieces of leadership advice:1.
Create more leaders around you to work yourself out of a job.
"You want a smart, diverse team to be able to see your way around problems and find innovative, creative solutions."
You want to work yourself out of a job so that you develop your team and create other leaders.
"This allows you to go on vacation without worries, remove yourself from being the bottleneck, and also start succession planning."
There are two key ways to start creating more leaders: Delegation and Asking for Help.
"Yes, there is the process of prioritization which we all try to do."
And sometimes there is still too much very important work to get done.
Be a matchmaker and stop doing the things that don't light you up.
"Instead, give them to the people who want more opportunity, especially if it lines up with what lights them up."
You have to give up your control and your one right way of doing things.
"You first observe someone else doing it, or do your own third party research to figure out an unknown thing."
"Figure out what works for you, learn from your mistakes and from others around you."
"Watch them as they do it themselves, and provide the support they ask for."
"If you know what lights them up, you will always strengthen the relationship."
"Asking for help shows your vulnerability, acknowledges their expertise, and overall builds more trust in the relationship."
Leaders can stop doing everything themselves and create more leaders around them by asking for help.
"We may not always think of ourselves as a leader, and that's OK."
We can continue to do the work to become more of a leader both personally and professionally.
Start delegating and asking for help to be the leader who creates more leaders.
I left Facebook in summer 2019 to focus on leadership coaching full-time.
"If you're curious about coaching and how it could unblock your life, come learn more."
Python is a general purpose language so it is not just for data science.
"Web development, mobile application and game development are some use cases for Python."
"If you are using Python only for data science related tasks, you do not have to be a Python expert."
"However, there are some core concepts and features that I think you must have in your possession."
Here is another example that evaluates a word based on its length.
Creating a function that performs a series of tasks defy the purpose of using functions.
We should also assign descriptive names to functions so we have an idea of what it does without seeing the code.
"When a function is called, it must be provided with the values for the required parameters."
It has two parameters so we provide values for these parameters when the function is called.
"When a function is called, values for positional arguments must be given."
"If we do not specify the value for a keyword argument, it takes the default value."
Let's redefine the multiply function with keyword arguments so we can see the difference.
Python is pretty flexible in terms of how arguments are passed to a function.
"In a sense, the type is what explains us the object."
"Everything in Python is an object of a type such as integers, lists, dictionaries, functions and so on."
Classes possess the following information:List is a built-in data structure in Python.
It is represented as a collection of data points in square brackets.
Lists can be used to store any data type or a mixture of different data types.
Lists are mutable which is one of the reasons why they are so commonly used.
Here are a few examples on how to create and modify a list.
"List comprehension is basically creating lists based on other iterables such as lists, tuples, sets, and so on."
It can also be described as representing for and if loops with a simpler and more appealing syntax.
Here is a simple list comprehension that creates a list from another list based on a given condition.
The following list comprehension applies a function to the items in another list.
One way to create a dictionary is writing key-value pairs in curly braces.
This is the definition of a set in the official Python documentation.
We can create a set by putting objects separated by a comma in curly braces.
Tuple is a collection of values separated by comma and enclosed in parenthesis.
One of the most common use cases of tuples is with functions that return multiple values.
Consider the following function that returns the square of a given number.
The equivalent lambda expression is:Consider an operation that needs to be done once or very few times.
"Furthermore, we have many variations of this operation which are slightly different than the original one."
"In such case, it is not ideal to define a separate function for each operation."
"Instead, lambda expressions provide a much more efficient way of accomplishing the tasks."
"However, we should have a comprehensive understanding of basic operations and concepts of Python in order to efficiently use such libraries."
"For those who missed the previous lessons, check them out here."
"Today, for the final lesson, I want to talk not about making changes, but about making them last."
"You get an idea for a new working routine, schedule or system."
"And this was only an average, harder habits required almost a year before they felt effortless."
It's true that time makes a big difference in the transition between new ways of life.
"The reason willpower is needed initially is that the old behavioral patterns get triggered automatically, and they require conscious reflection to override."
"Yet, I would argue that this is actually not the most important factor in whether a change lasts."
"Instead, the problem is that most new systems we dream up and implement for our lives are actually broken."
They have broken parts that snag when we try to use them.
But eventually they break down and you retreat back to an easier default.
"Let's look at a concrete example: A few years ago, I decided I was using Twitter too much."
What should I do?My first plan was simply to limit my total time for checking the service.
"Except, I found myself frustrated when I would open up a browser, try to check the website and it was blocked."
"This happened often enough, that one day, a couple months after I started, I simply removed all the restrictions."
"In retrospect, one of the major problems was simply that the context for checking Twitter was never restricted."
The impulse was always there and this created a snag that pulled at my plans.
Certainly such a small difference can't matter much?A small snag may not matter if its only encountered once.
But in the long-run they're eclipsed by making the correct design choices.
"In the last homework for this lesson series, I want you to consider your own plans for focus."
"On Monday, Cal and I will be opening registration for the second session of Life of Focus."
They were so sure their product or service would succeed that they were willing to risk it all.
"There are many stories of start-ups that began from nothing, often selling their wares out of their cars or garages."
"We always felt we could do more, but we never felt confident to take a risk on an idea."
"Somewhat unexpectedly, I have made a career shift that has left me unsure, excited, and nervous."
"It took my husband telling me at one point, You just have to grind it out."
"For most people who start a new business or try to make it as a freelancer, the conditions are never perfect."
"Either way, it is your responsibility to create your own conditions for success."
The hardest part of making a career switch is starting something new.
It feels foreign to go to work in a new place or venture into previously unknown territory.
I have been paralyzed with the overwhelming situation of too many decisions when deciding how to embark on a writing career.
"I spent hours reading articles about blogging, freelancing, creating websites, and making money."
Each of these topics created a spiral of information that would suck me into the depths of the internet.
"When I resurfaced, I was positive that all of this newness was not for me."
"I knew that WordPress was better for a website, but the learning curve was too steep."
"I knew that selling my writing would require learning about marketing and SEO, but I was too nervous to try."
"Ultimately, entrepreneurs and freelancers spend too much time learning about their idea before actually buckling down and just doing it."
"If I want to be a writer, then I need to write."
"If you want to sell something, then you need to sell it."
"Ultimately, I decided to make a list of priorities for my new career."
Even if I don't submit a piece or have a particularly strong outline.
"The other tasks, like marketing on social media or searching for new freelance opportunities, come second."
Don't become paralyzed by the fear of what if one year or five years down the road.
"As a researcher and overall curious person, I like to know everything there is to know about something before I commit."
This means I spend too much time Googling and not enough time producing content.
"We all experience this with social media, work emails, and advertisements encroaching on our brains all at once."
One way I combat information overload is to create lists and goals that I refer to when I open my laptop to work.
It's up to you to prioritize how you choose to spend your time.
I commented to my husband that I needed to add another 40-hour workweek to my calendar to accomplish my goals.
It's easy to engage in off-task behaviors when starting something that is different from your usual work schedule.
You can't wait until someone hands you thousands of dollars to start a business.
It is crucial to take baby steps when beginning a new business venture.
"It can be tempting to go all-in, borrowing hefty amounts of money to finance a new venture."
Shark Tank often advised contestants to start small and avoid taking large loans.
They congratulated those who were able to grow their companies without much debt.
"My husband is interested in starting a YouTube channel, but we had a discussion about the items he would need."
Often those who are waiting for the right conditions become concerned with not having the stuff to start.
Starting small with what you have will give you the room to grow without accumulating financial stress.
Start with a small investment or product before diving into something that can quickly become too large to handle.
Waiting for someone to hand you thousands of dollars to fund your idea can be futile.
"It can be difficult to manage your time, money, and ideas without clocking in and making money for someone else."
Knowing that you are now in charge can create a helpless mindset that is hard to overcome.
"At first, I felt a little lost as I learned to navigate a day of relative freedom and autonomy."
This means using a calendar to schedule work activities and holding myself accountable to a personal to-do list.
"Now, as a writer, I have to make my own hours and decisions."
It's up to me to create my career; I can't rely on anyone else.
"As cliche as it might sound, you are responsible for your own destiny."
"If you want a new career or job, then it's up to you to do it."
This means taking a risk and creating the conditions to be successful.
This rumbling tundra of black has returned having had a taste of humanities demise during the first collapse.
I should say it didn't take long for them to arrive but due to COVID-19 games development almost came to a halt.
That was until the Pyramid they attacked showed up on the display once again.
"The great Warmind, the Tyrant that every other AI that ever existed had feared was Cntrl + Alt + Dlte'ed from existence."
Time has passed a new beginning is ahead of us as Season of The Chosen kicks into full swing.
A strike from Destiny where Rasputin calls for help to stop the fallen.
But a bigger question is; How will this tie into the state of our current war coming?
Will he be able to access all his other off-world memory banks where copies of himself may exist?
Since finding Bray-Exo Science on Europa there is no telling what will happen next with technology left behind by her grandfather.
Or if she will enlist the help of her sister Elsie Bray otherwise known as The Stranger to help her rebuild Rasputin.
"I hope you have enjoyed reading this article today, remember that no matter what you are facing today at this moment."
"Armed with a good narrative, a belief about the way the world is, one can endure a surprising amount of tribulation."
They say people make the place and the truth of that was easy to see there.
The city so untethered and young and restless and I shouldn't have been surprised because that was the point.
"To move in your twenties is to exercise that thoughtless freedom, revel in the youth and individuality and liberty of it all."
I guess I didn't realise these experiences came at a cost.
"That you can't have total freedom and the deep and steady contentment that comes from remaining, enduring."
"Instead, taking up a tireless dedication to ceaseless motion.-I know I write to try and justify the desire to come home."
"Because the dream of flight looks different once you're living it; better in some ways, worse in others."
Whoever you are today is who you've always been in the eyes of those who don't know you.
What isn't disclosed is the cloud it's around; the deep lonliness and stubborn shallowness.
Little chips when reality bumped against how I thought it would be.
"Then one day, the scales tipped and it became more lie than story."
"It's not because I couldn't hack it, I'd say."
"Or if, just like when I moved, I simply chose a narrative that fit the present circumstance."
"Go and stay gone, because even if it's worse, it's better because it's somewhere else."
"Funny how quick we are to question someone's return, but never why we think leaving is inherently better."
"The ones who hadn't skipped countries like river stones, prescribing postcodes like silver bullets for internal troubles."
I'm the last to deny the value new places have; whether it's a suburb or a country.
An unpredictable suffocation that tugs the mind towards the inevitable urge to burn your entire life to the ground and run away.
"The flight narrative pathologizes this as a symptom of a substandard life, for which the only cure is flight."
What I know now is that this isn't a warning sign of a mediocre life but an inherent quality of any life.
"As corporal beings with boundless minds, humans have always reckoned with a hunger for transcendence."
Popular discourse depicts moving overseas as the height of individuality and open-mindedness.
"It's delightfully ironic to consider how, occasionally, it's the very opposite."
"Not free of those urges to go, but using them as fuel to explore paths that don't involve flight."
"More subtle, more steady, but no less able to give us that incomparable thrill of seeing with new eyes."
"Nevertheless, nothing is better than pulling out an authentic Nintendo console to play some Golden Sun or Pokémon Emerald."
"So, I set out to waste some money and reinvigorate my trusted old GBA."
Here are some of the modifications that you can do to bring your GBA into the 21st century.
"With a flash cart, you can theoretically store thousands of games on a single cartridge."
"The earliest flash carts that I had were very prehistoric, the first one used a serial connection for data transfers."
"Nowadays the flash carts are a lot more intuitive and easy to use, often working with a MicroSD card."
"Full disclaimer, I am not being paid to promote products but my flash cart of choice is the EXSEK EZFlash Omega."
"It's reasonably affordable, available on Amazon, and it includes adapters for the Nintendo DS as well."
"There were plenty of handhelds before it that had backlit screens, but Nintendo still thought otherwise."
But in recent years there has been a rise in the availability of backlit screen kits.
"Now I know what you are thinking, you have to be an electrician to get this done, huh?"
There is not one specific mod kit that I can point out because there are thousands available.
But if you do a quick eBay search of GBA Backlight you'll be able to find one with ease.
Installation takes about an hour and the joy of being able to play the original GBA with a backlit screen is downright amazing.
You'll experience the games as you've never seen them before.
"Mario Kart Super Circuit, for example, looks great and so does one of the most recent games, Banjo Pilot."
"Finally, bringing some new life to the case of your GBA can be a great upgrade as well."
I went for a clear orange case because I had always wanted an orange Game Boy Advance.
If you remember there was not an orange console that was released in America.
"Thus, we didn't get to enjoy that limited edition color."
"The process is an easy one, you'll just need a Triwing screwdriver to open the original shell and replace it."
GBA.This one should be without question at the top of your list.
If you are going to be upgrading to a backlit screen you are going to need the power behind it.
My GBA was back on the road and looking and playing better than ever.
You'll wonder how you ever made it on the original batteries.
Handheld gaming changed universally when Nintendo released the 32-Bit console in 2001.
"I know for me, I was blown away by how great the graphics were and the variety of games."
"Sure, the Game Boy Advance SP offered a backlit design built right in."
But it was the original GBA that most of us enjoyed in middle school and on those long road trips during the summer.
"Like thousands upon thousands of other people, I am addicted to reading '"
"One thing led to another, and I'm now an unabashed asshole addict."
"As a lifelong fan of advice and 'agony aunt' columns, I am not surprised I've fallen hard."
"I moved on to Miss Manners, Cary Tennis, Dear Sugar, Dolly Alderton, on and on."
A person accepting of the universe's chaos while simultaneously longing for it all to make sense.
"Fully aware, and yet taking comfort in the fact that while there are no easy answers, there are often answers."
That life's most challenging situations can be boiled down to this: YATA - you are the asshole.
"It's the civility, the empathy, the generosity of the advice."
I have read hundreds of comments that read like they were written by professional advice columnists.
"After all, this forum exists to illuminate truths, and in doing so, light a clear path forward."
"To me, AITA feels like the internet as it could've been."
"When I think back on it, it seems obvious that my dad was unqualified to do this kind of work."
That everyone should've seen the dangers that lurked around the corner.
But opportunity called in the form of a lower cost of living and higher pay.
"When we moved to Texas, we rented a brick house, which was in full working order."
There was a swing in the front yard and a playhouse in the back.
"My mom fell into a depression, which manifested in physical symptoms."
"Headaches, earaches, none of which could be solved, no matter how many doctors she saw."
My dad bought a top-of-the-line minivan.
We dined in the chain restaurants favored by middle-class white people.
"Of course, things would soon fall apart, as they always were going to do."
"Then came the bills, stacking up for the things we could no longer afford."
"Eventually, we'd get booted from our home and wind up in a doublewide trailer on my grandparents' rural property."
"I don't particularly like to dwell on it, but I was a really lonely kid."
I wore baggy clothes and mostly tried to go unnoticed while secretly hoping that someone interesting might notice me.
"While my life was a depressing shit show, the internet of my youth was very much a place of possibility."
"In my digital glass slippers, I logged onto message boards, chat rooms, penpal matching websites, zine distros."
"I connected with others, based on our interests, our outlooks, our shared senses of humor."
"Judged only by the contents of my character, the history of my posts."
"Like lonely kids everywhere, when I left my hometown, my world opened up."
"I made friends, foged connections, started relationships in real life."
"With distance, I was once again handed a pair of glass slippers."
That I could speak of the symptoms I'd never gotten checked out at the doctor due to a lack of health insurance.
The firm orders not to answer the phone unless we were absolutely certain it wasn't a debt collector.
"The bitterness and resentment of my father, who emotionally checked out of the rest of my life."
"And meanwhile, while I was living IRL all of those years, the internet changed."
"Sure, shards remain - we still get people hiding behind non-descriptive screennames and pictures of sunsets."
We deploy exaggerations and half-truths and filters to hide our flaws.
"But, for the most part, today's internet consists of people we know and influencers we recognize by sight."
"We see the food others eat each day, their clothing choices, their home decor."
We can look up their husbands' salaries on Glassdoor and see how much their houses cost on Zillow.
"We get closer, and in doing so, we often feel further away."
"And that means the same things it used to mean, the same things it's always meant."
"People who ask for advice might be lying, making things up."
"Unlike social media trolls, people are choosing to use their anonymity for good - or at least neutral - reasons."
"They're choosing to don their glass slippers to connect, to share, to help, rather than to bully or swindle."
"In many ways, I read AITA to get my fix of gossip, human drama."
If my dad hadn't flown too close to the figurative sun.
"Of course, I can't blame him for wanting a better life for his family."
"But we all wonder these things from time to time, don't we?"
"To me, AITA feels like a small part of some alternate universe."
This is the third and final part of the series Linear Regression: Everything From Math to Program.
I don't want to share anything fancy with you guys at this point and make this blog lengthy and complicated.
There are no derivations in this part and we will use the same concept that we have derived in part 2.
We are not using any popular libraries like Scikit-learn to build linear regression model.
"In this tutorial, we are going to build general program which can be implemented on dataset of any size."
"Also, don't forget to follow me on medium.com for more such posts in the future."
"Let's begin!!!Step 1: Understand the datasetIn this tutorial, we are using an insurance dataset from Kaggle."
"There are 7 columns in the dataset: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, insurance charges."
"And then, assign the encoded variable to a new column using the cat.codes accessor."
"Calculate Regression coefficentFrom here onwards, all the steps for predictions are same as explained in part 2."
Please refer to part 2 in case you are unable to infer any part.

"Lisbon, Portugal is a beautiful, vibrant, and colorful city."
"It features hand-painted ceramic tiles on most of the buildings, which serve as both decoration and insulation."
Little did I know that mailing the tiles home to my mom would be far more complicated than actually painting them.
We left our tiles with the instructor to be kilned and would pick them up in a few days' time.
"I said to the instructor on the way out the door, receiving a sigh and an eye roll as my farewell."
"Lisbon is the first place I've ever lived where English was not the primary language, and I really struggled with Portuguese."
"Fortunately for me, many of the residents spoke English in addition to Portuguese and would greet me in English."
"I caught myself just before my face hit the box, then collapsed to the floor in pain."
"F#$%^&!!!I pulled my pant leg up to look at it, and it was a good one."
"Or a bad one, depending on how you feel about dim sum shaped contusions on your shinbone."
I sat on the floor and elevated my leg on the wooden box of death to slow the swelling and reduce the throbbing.
"As I walked upstairs to the locker room, the pain intensified."
"The endorphins from my workout were no longer enveloping me in a feeling of invincibility, and I was in agony."
"I need ice!But first, I had to go to the post office and mail the two tiles to my mom in California."
Which brings us back to the friendly mail clerk at the Agencia dos Correios.
I smiled and said hello as I pulled a couple of postcards out of my backpack and set it on the counter.
"She said nothing, just looked at me as though I had punched her grandkid in the face."
Her entire demeanor had changed from gentle and helpful to unfriendly and annoyed.
"I immediately started sweating, my hands shaking, my leg throbbing in pain from the extra blood now pulsing through my veins."
I held the postcards out to her like a child showing a report card to her parents.
"I turned to look at the boxes and envelopes for sale, picking them up to see if my tiles would fit."
"After what felt like far too long, the clerk asked me if my package was For Portugal?"
She reached under the counter and pulled out a padded envelope that would barely fit one of the tiles.
"Thank you, I said, trying to fit the tiles inside."
"It clearly wasn't going to happen, so I went to look for any other boxes that would work."
"As I stepped away from the counter, my backpack came crashing down to the floor."
"He looked at me, looked at the counter, back at me."
I'm fairly certain he and the clerk were mocking me in Portuguese.
Either that or they were sharing a hearty laugh over his stamp purchase.
"Once I had my mess back together, I slowly stood up, not wanting to make sudden movements on my leg."
I grabbed the envelope and my tiles and got in line behind the two customers.
I didn't realize that the Agencia dos Correios operated like a deli.
One woman kindly smiled at me and pointed to the number dispensing machine.
It looked like a big red refrigerator but with one button in the middle instead of a door.
"Feeling stupid again, I nodded gratefully at her, got my ticket, and sat down."
"I was sweating more, still wearing my jacket and scarf from the rain."
"I almost, ALMOST started crying, right there in the Portuguese post office, which made me feel even worse."
"I took a deep breath, calmed myself, and avoided eye contact with the other customers."
"The new clerk just chuckled at me as if to say, No shit."
"Before I said anything else, the first clerk said something loudly in Portuguese to my new clerk."
"She was gentler with me, probably not wanting to see me go full meltdown in front of her."
"I'm now miming a box, as if a post office employee doesn't know what a cardboard box is."
"She sighs, gets off her chair, and walks to the back."
"I stare at the counter, sweating more, tracing the lines with my finger."
"I wrap the tiles, put them in the box, and she hands me the address form."
"List the contents of the box, their value, and speed of shipping you want."
There are so many different ways this form could be filled out incorrectly.
I stare at the unchecked boxes and look at her like a frightened Chihuahua.
Oh for the love of - I have no idea how much cash I have left.
I stop for a bag of ice to treat my self-inflicted flesh wound.
"As the clerk at the market gets me the ice, I grab a bottle of wine."
I can just afford the wine and the ice with my last few Euros.
"I have three more months on this journey, and no doubt endless hijinks to endure."
"But for now, I toast myself to the small victory of surviving my first foreign post office."
"One small step for most, one giant leap on a broken shin."
"Considering your contracts won't be around forever, it's important to focus on your growth outside the contracts."
I will be focusing this article specifically on how to do that.
"After graduating in May 2020, I was a COVID-19 contact tracer for a short while before becoming a freelance writer."
"I write articles for multiple websites, one of which I write for as a contractor."
"In my spare time, I am working on an ebook and getting my blog up and running."
"However, I have the privilege of working from my living room on the outskirts of Cincinnati, no commute required."
"It was a fantastic contract in my eyes, and it has now been replaced with a new contract from the same company."
"The contract is different and more difficult, but it is also different in beneficial ways as well if you catch my drift."
"In order to meet the requirements of my new contract, I will need to write much more than I am used to."
This is a significant note for someone with limited writing energy who is trying to launch a blog and an ebook.
"I do greatly enjoy contract work, but when you're dependent on one contract, that's what you are: dependent."
"Most contracts have a clause where either party can end the contract at any time, and it can happen suddenly."
Having a successful blog would certainly help to alleviate some monetary pressure.
My income is mainly reliant on my one contract at the moment.
"It is a lot of work, and I am tired after doing it."
"Considering both of those are far more important than a single contract, I needed an action plan."
"You may find yourself in a similar position, so I encourage you to follow my plan if it applies to your situation."
This will only work for you if your contract doesn't include exclusive article rights.
I'm actually quite excited to write an article about my favorite place in the United States!
The point of freelancing is to be self-sustainable without a company.
"Work on your own products before those of others, even if those others are paying you well."
"Del Rey: I think it might've happened sooner, if not for the pandemic."
"So, anytime it was going to happen, it was going to feel like a big moment."
"And it is, but when I could digest it for a second, it was not altogether surprising."
"Why do you think he's leaving now?There are three theories, and I think they could have all played a role."
Does he want to be testifying in front of different congressional committees more?
And I think there's going to be more of that to come.
"And then, from a financial perspective, Amazon will sort of be lapping their amazing gross numbers from the pandemic."
"May. My book's not coming out for a bit after that, so I'm not super concerned."
"Amazon under Bezos had this retail DNA, which is notoriously cutthroat and frugal."
"So, Clark is running that retail business, and he's a tough guy."
"And they will point out Alexa, AWS, Kindle, and the initial idea for Amazon, basically."
"So, my big thing is will Jassy taking over in some way directly lead to the next great invention?"
I think Bray was talking more about the DNA that comes from Bezos.
"Well, there are a lot of similarities in management style and philosophy, but he's more human than Jeff Bezos."
"How that manifests itself externally, I have no idea, but I'm going to be looking for any signs of change."
I think the company's biggest weakness is that it does have a lack of empathy.
I don't know that being more empathetic will make it a more popular company.
I think the service has historically been so exceptional and far and away the best thing in retail.
People just make decisions that are best for them when it comes to buying stuff.
"Recruitment-wise, no one wants to be at the center of potential antitrust enforcement."
They had a lot of friends on Capitol Hill a few years ago.
"Now they go in there and every conversation doesn't start with,"
"It starts in a sort of interrogation, and that's what I've learned over the years reporting."
Maybe Jassy will instruct his comms and policy teams to take a different tack.
"She's in contention for the FTC commissioner spot, which would be a very big deal."
"As remote workers, we are always looking for great nomad bases."
We favor cities with suitable remote working spots but also intriguing sites that satisfy our wanderlust.
"Situated on two continents, its eclectic mix of cultures is second to none in the Western world."
"On this basis, here are six reasons why Istanbul is an excellent base for digital nomads."
Istanbul is the only city in the world that spans over two continents: Europe and Asia.
The city on the Bosphorus strait was founded in the 7th century BC by Greek colonists.
Constantinople became the capital of the Byzantine Empire and a global cultural and trading hub.
"In 1453, the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople and renamed it Istanbul."
"Today, Istanbul is a melting pot of ideas, cultures, and architecture."
"To some extent, Istanbul is a microcosm of Turkey, a highly diverse country."
"From conservative Muslim neighborhoods to hip bar areas full of nightclubs, you can find everything in Turkey's largest city."
"It's where East and West meet, ideologies clash, and people come together."
All of this diversity makes Istanbul such an incredible place to live and work as a digital nomad.
"When it comes to cultural and culinary sites, few cities compete with Istanbul."
"You couldn't summarize Istanbul's sites on a few pages, and it would take months to visit everything."
"All in all, Istanbul will undoubtedly guarantee the adventure aspect of your digital nomad lifestyle."
"Historic sites are great, but digital nomads naturally want to know about remote working locations."
"Both areas have lots of coffee shops, apartments with fast WiFi, and affordable coworking spots."
"Next, Istanbul's infrastructure is passable in most areas and first-class in some."
"You can find strong WiFi throughout the city, and SIM Cards are available at every corner."
The malls are world-class and sell everything you would find in Western Europe or North America.
"Istanbul does have some cleanliness issues, but these are limited to various areas."
"All in all, the infrastructure is satisfactory, and you won't miss any Western amenities - creating a highly livable environment."
"English levels aren't great outside of the tourist neighborhoods, but you'll get around."
Learning a few Turkish phrases will be helpful if you want to venture off the beaten track.
"When it comes to safety, Istanbul doesn't have significant problems with crime."
"Consequently, common sense will suffice to say safe in the Turkish megacity."
Most remote workers want to take advantage of geo-arbitrage by relocating to a cheaper city.
That's where the downfall of the Turkish lira plays into the hands of digital nomads.
"Having spent some time here in early 2021, I can safely say that it's the cheapest big city in Europe."
The last substantial advantage of choosing Istanbul as a nomad base is its public transit network - and its shiny new airport.
Istanbul has a rapidly-growing subway network that connects the city's main transit hubs.
"Better still, the streetcars connect the smaller neighborhoods, and the Bosphorus ferries make continent-hopping a piece of cake."
The last piece of the city's excellent transport network is the brand-new Istanbul Airport.
"Opened in 2019, this is hands-down one of the best airports in the world."
"I always like nomad bases that are well-connected with a vast offer of flights, and Istanbul excels in this area."
The new airport has flights to every continent and is one of the busiest on the planet.
Call of Duty as a franchise is something I've had an on-again-off-again relationship with.
"Like many of my fellow Call of Duty veterans, I bought the game for the online multiplayer mode."
"Team Deathmatch is and always will be a fantastic, simple gameplay mode players can enjoy over and over again."
"The Spy Plane is the 80s equivalent of Black Ops 2's UAV, keeping the winning formula for the series alive."
"In the menu screen, weapons are highly customizable, featuring as many as 54 possible attachments."
"You can equip up to 5 of these on your primary weapon, or up to 8 with the Gunfighter Wildcard equipped."
"But when most of them are locked behind paywalls, the average consumer won't be able to enjoy them."
Call of Duty isn't the same as it used to be.
"For example data uncertainty problem, data complexity problem, data dimension explosion problem, data scale boundary problem."
"At present, this kind of new scientific exploration methodology has not yet formed a final conclusion."
"Generally speaking, this kind of new scientific research paradigm is immersive embodied research with intelligence as the research goal."
"New methods emerging from cutting-edge research such as statistics, network science, and brain science."
"At present, it is still difficult to give a clear definition of the fifth paradigm ."
"By Haokun Liu, Hanzhi Ding, Wen Han TangThe technology for modifying photos and videos have been in use for many years."
"For example, a lot of people probably heard of or used Photoshop."
"This unique term has two components: deep and fake, where deep is the shortened form of deep learning."
Many might think that this is just another similar technology with traditional media modification.
The term 'Deepfake' was first brought up by a Reddit user in late 2017.
"Even though the name only came up in recent years, the technology idea has emerged since the last century."
"The technology behind Deepfake can be applied in the marketing business, fashion business, film industry and other fields."
"However, as the popularity of Deepfake increases, many abominable issues also occurred."
And some also developed anti-Deepfake detection applications to help combating those negative actions.
"First, we will introduce a few fundamental points about the Deepfake algorithm."
The Face Swapping PipelineHere is a flow chart of face swapping from the article Exposing DeepFake Videos By Detecting Face Warping Artifacts.
Then the Deepfake model will take the normalized face image as input and return a synthesized face image.
"Use the same transform matrix to refine the shape and apply post-processing, including boundary smoothing, to the composite image."
"The kernel of Deepfake is an auto-encoder, which is an unsupervised deep neural network."
The encoder and decoder have to be trained together but can be used separately.
"To swap two faces, it needs one encoder and two decoders."
"Finally, by applying decoder B on encoded face A, face A is swapped to B.Generative Adversarial Networks improve the Deepfake algorithm."
GAN is a deep neural network including a generative model and a discriminative model.
"Each decoder is a generator now, and it will let the discriminator distinguish the generated image in each turn."
"Application:What is the future of Deepfake, and which area will be used for Deepfake technology?"
I would like to share some existing cases and let you imagine.
Peele's production company used a combination of Adobe After Effects and the AI face-swapping tool FakeApp.
FakeApp is the most prominent example of how AI can facilitate the creation of photorealistic fake videos.
Researchers have developed tools that let you perform face swaps like the one above in real-time.
Adobe is also creating a Photoshop for audio that lets you edit dialogue as easily as a photo.
Project VoCo is designed to be a state-of-the-art audio editing application.
"Essentially, the software can understand the makeup of a person's voice and replicate it."
FaceSwap is a tool that uses deep learning to recognize and exchange faces in images and videos.
"They even have a GUI version, which doesn't require you to write a line of code."
"Of course, you could recognize your parents' voices and talking styles, so you believed this message and made the transfer."
But this does not only happen to celebrities; it is also possible for ordinary citizens to be seriously affected.
"In addition to personal harm, Deepfake may also cause damage to the public interest."
There might be other incidents brought by Deepfake that can be severely harmful and raise concerns.
We believe that all these would be profoundly serious issues that people need to be aware of when understanding the concepts of Deepfake.
"Anti-Deepfake:Due to its ethical problems, people have been trying to find the techniques to fight against DeepFake."
Then a finer spatial map indicates the manipulated regions in an image.
"In this blog post, we have introduced the basic knowledge and some possible industrial applications about Deepfake."
"Forgeries: < Gui, Zhenan Sun, Yonggang Wen, Dacheng Tao, Jieping Ye."
"A Review on Generative Adversarial Networks: Algorithms, Theory, and Applications: < Li, Siwei Lyu."
"Whenever we talk about writing, the conversation almost always revolves around language and grammar."
These tools serve to express the beauty in the work of art that is writing.
"Readers constantly drool over any piece of well-written content, and the authors are heavily applauded."
"However, a considerable disconnect exists between the appreciation most writing gets, and whether or not it serves its intended purpose."
"We are living in an age where information, news, and entertainment are abundant commodities available on multiple platforms."
"Every day, readers have to sift through a ton of data to find what they are looking for."
The resulting decision fatigue compromises both their attention span and their ability to grasp the message.
"To communicate effectively, writers need to recognize the existence of subtle neurocognitive mechanisms involved in language and information processing."
The goal is to expose writers to the powerful subconscious tools that govern how the reader's brain appreciates written content.
Here are a few research-backed highlights from the book that will transform your writing.
A journal published in Nature indicates that priming is an excellent form of implicit learning.
"Implicit learning is the learning of complex information in an incidental manner, without awareness of what has been learned."
"In the opening paragraph, I begin by establishing: Chronic pain is one of the major reasons people seek medical counsel."
"Yet, the available therapies are still ineffective or cause unbearable adverse effects."
"Virtual reality is emerging as an efficient, drug-free alternative to manage both acute and chronic pain."
Priming is similar to providing a subtle table of contents to outline the major learning points the reader should look out for.
Recent information is better remembered and receives more weight in forming a judgment than does earlier presented information.
"In writing, if you want some point to remain salient in the reader's mind, you should finish with it."
Short-term memory is the ability to hold a small amount of information in the mind for a brief period.
The only way to ensure that the information is retained is to recall It within the shortest time.
A good example of this is trying to memorize a phone number someone has read to you a few seconds ago.
The takeaway from the piece should be presented in the summary to reinforce the reader's grasp of the information.
A cause is something that produces an event or condition; an effect is what results from an event or condition.
Readers want to know what led you to come to the kind of conclusions you present.
They want to perform their analysis of the factors in question to see whether they agree with you.
"When you turn sentences into micro-narratives of cause and effect, you make your writing easier to read and recall."
The purpose of cause and effect is to determine how various events relate in terms of origins and results.
Research has shown that cause and effect explanations enable people to grasp new information adequately.
This is because they allow readers to make inferences and reason out the facts presented in a story.
You must already know this from all the fuss language experts make about the passive voice.
What you might not know is how the passive voice affects your writing from a neuro-scientific perspective.
The passive voice is more ambiguous to interpret and places a higher load on working memory.
The sentence The dishes were washed by Anne requires absorbing an action with no actor then parsing a supporting phrase.
"The reader still has to infer that Anne , the object in the supporting phrase, is the actor that was missing."
There are a lot of moving parts in the sentence that have to be held in working memory.
They have to be collected and assembled into something coherent to produce meaningful communication.
A journal published in 2013 explores the intricate neurological implication of the passive voice in sentences.
The moderate use of the passive voice is plausible when it's unavoidable.
"Let's face it, readers approach articles with over-ambitious expectations that sometimes a writer can't deliver."
"There's so much that qualifies to be bad news, no matter how insignificant it may seem."
Studies show that delivering bad news in the first paragraph creates unwarranted resistance and hostility to the rest of the message.
It will result in a cognitive bias that interferes with the reader's perception and reception of the vital information.
Open the second paragraph with a rationale for the unwelcome part of your message.
Then embed the most lethal content in a minor clause in the dead center of the paragraph.
"Close that paragraph with a neutral sentence, mentioning whatever benefits you can conjure to offer your reader."
It is important to recognize that writing is not only an art but also a science.
Take time to understand the subtle neuro-cognitive mechanisms involved in language and information processing.
Only then will you be sure that your work makes the most impact on the reader.
Backlinks are links from one website to a page on another website.
Earning high-quality backlinks is a very challenging part of SEO.
"Nonetheless, it is an essential part of ranking high with search engines."
A backlinks strategy is the approach used for managing backlinks and acquiring new backlinks.
Pages with a high number of quality backlinks tend to have high organic search engine rankings.
"By using your expertise and unique data, you can become a source for other bloggers and journalists."
Here is how content requests look like in the email when received.
Here are some quick-fire tips to implement this straight away:Everyone loves a tool that helps.
It covers enough information that you don't need to go elsewhere to learn more about that subject.
The reason why these Ultimate Guides attract inbound backlinks is that they help bloggers and journalists reference a concept they mention.
Infographics are probably the most common visual asset used to earn backlinks.
It's always good to experiment with them if you haven't done it before.
"Check out how to optimize infographics and images for SEO, regardless of whether you have beginner or advanced SEO knowledge."
Listing your website on online directories goes a long way in helping improve your presence on the web.
It's important to find high-traffic directories with authority links in order for this strategy to be successful.
"The challenge with this tactic is, of course, finding these broken links."
"They help improve rankings, establish trust and credibility, and earn trustworthy mentions."
"In this article, Julia McCoy shares how you can use this approach in four steps as part of your backlinks strategy."
Digital PR involves gaining high-quality backlinks from websites and online publications and honest customer reviews.
Why not jump on a trend and hop on Clubhouse while you are at it?
The skyscraper technique involves mirroring and improving upon the content of top performers in the key ranking positions for your desired keywords.
Links that come from authoritative sites will improve your search rankings more than links from low-quality sites.
"Check out this guide on how to assess the quality of a backlink, before you outreach to them."
Click on any backlinks website to get the exact URL that links to the competitor.
Give them a compelling reason that adding your business to the list will improve their readers' experience.
"Linking pages that are guest posts, also indicate that the site is a great guest blogging opportunity for your brand as well."
Ensure each mention of your brand includes a link back to your site.
Set up a Google Alert for your brand name and regularly search for your branded terms to find mentions of your brand.
"If the mention doesn't include a link back to your site, reach out to the publisher and request it."
"Just as some website publishers don't always link when they should, they might also include links that are broken or incorrect."
"Sometimes, these links are not pointing to the appropriate site, or they are broken."
"Keep an eye out for these opportunities as well, especially if a website has linked to one of your graphics."
Ensure that all of your graphics used on other sites appropriately link back to your site.
Relationship building is about leveraging your partnerships and contacts to grow your backlink profile.
The best relationships are the ones where both sides gain something through the connection.
"So as you engage in link building activities, spread the benefit to both sides."
Link to other sites to improve your chances of getting links back to your website.
"In the SEMrush Audience Insights report, you can enter up to 5 competitors to compare against."
Once you enter the domain you will see the Audience Overlap graph.
This will display each of the domain's audiences and where they overlap with each other.
"This helps you start the relationship, but it also increases your chances that the site you link to will return the favor."
Another way to get high-quality backlinks is by offering to give an interview or contribute to roundup posts.
You can also get your name and link back on websites by offering to write testimonials or leave a review about another brand.
Choose the top tools or brands you work with and contact them to offer to write a review about your experience.
Brands are usually eager to feature testimonials on their site and often link back reviewers in the credit line.
A perfect way of doing so is by hosting an event or sponsoring a meetup or conference.
"Lately, my eyes have taken on a heavier weight, my attitude has been shorter, and my body is slower."
I published my first story just under a month ago - 25 days to be exact.
Within 25 days I have managed to crank out 26 published stories and double my earnings from January to February.
I've truly stepped into the world of what some may call 'entrepreneurship' and others call 'self-employment'.
"Whatever it is, these past 3 weeks have taught me what it truly means to be a hustler."
"In the past year, for various reasons I've developed insomnia."
I've found that I am lucky if I can stay asleep for more than 2 hours at a time.
It's as if my mind and body know that there is more work to be done.
"No matter what you do in life, networking will always be a key player in your success."
"For the first time in my life, I am an active user of Twitter."
"Initially, I created my account so that I could utilize the platform to advertise my work."
"However, I quickly came to realize that it's a great way to connect with other writers."
I am can bounce ideas off of others and share my experiences while taking in other peoples.
Ask me how many Medium-specific Facebook groups I am juggling at the moment.
"Honestly, without a huge following, I have found that I spend about 75% of my time promoting my work."
I post links to my story any chance that I can get without being that 'spammy' asshole.
"Although, I have to promote my work as much as I can it's an integral part of my success."
"However, I have had a financial gain - a considerable one at that."
"But, with freelancing, your income isn't always going to be consistent and you have to be comfortable with that."
I shamelessly admit that I check my stats page probably every 10-15 minutes.
You can't control the internet - it is what it is.
"To work for yourself is exhausting, especially when you don't see the numbers that you'd like to."
I am a lot more stressed these days because I am constantly wracking my brain for topics to write about.
"I believe it was Mark Twain that once said,I love to write."
The joy that writing brings me outweighs the amount of work it takes to build a name for my work.
"In the grand scheme of life, everybody likes to consider themselves a hustler."
"We are all trying to make a living, and most of us do the typical 9-5 grind Monday through Friday."
Freelancing has shown me what it means to push the limits and work hard for your money.
To be a successful writer goes beyond being able to crank out meaningful content.
"As a freelancer, you have to be able to market yourself in a way that makes people want to read your work."
"I doubled my earnings from freelance writing but I am far, far, far from what most would deem a successful writer."
I'm just an initiative away from being an all-encompassing hustler.
"If you are not familiar with Boo, you can see the game mechanics in this video:Here's the gist."
"If Mario is looking at Boo, Boo covers its face and doesn't move."
"Mario, on the other hand, doesn't obey the true laws of gravity when you make him jump."
"But, there was still a rule the character obeyed that we could call physics ."
"In any case, all of the rules coded into nearly every video game ever made are derivatives of Newtonian physics."
The purpose here is to give you an intuition for some aspect of quantum physics.
"For a deeper understanding of quantum physics, you have to read this book."
"With that in mind, we ask: what if instead of super Mario, we had quantum Mario?"
"He will act as the scientist - or, as they are called in the quantum business, the observer."
Quantum Boo is never found in the space between the starting point and Mario.
Quantum Boo can only be found at its starting point or on Mario.
The only thing that changes for Quantum Boo is the probability of catching Mario.
"The more transparent Boo is, the less likely it is to find it there."
Quantum Boo starts to disappear from its starting location and simultaneously reappears at Mario's location.
"After some time, Boo's probability of catching Mario is 100%."
"Before then, there is some chance that Boo has caught Mario and some chance that Boo hasn't moved at all."
"At this midpoint, Quantum Boo is in a superposition of both locations."
Mario has the power of observation - the power of quantum measurement.
"Whenever Mario looks toward Quantum Boo, Boo is only either found on top of Mario or at Boo's starting position."
"If timed correctly, Mario can force Quantum Boo back to its starting position with a 0% chance of catching him."
"But now that your appetite is whetted, I know you want to dive deeper."
"Boo has a location, direction, speed, and whether or not it is hiding."
"Boo's position can be anywhere, which means the possible states are continuous."
You can't count the number of possible states in classical physics - it's uncountably infinite.
"In quantum physics, the possible states Quantum Boo can be found in are discrete and finite - you can count them."
"This is generally true in quantum physics, and the first identified departure from classical physics."
"In fact, a Nobel prize was awarded for this quantum hypothesis made in 1900."
The probability of being in one location or the other changes continuously.
"An instant after Mario turns his head away from Quantum Boo, Boo ceases to be in the starting position."
Boo is also not at Mario's position either at this point.
"It's not here or there, and it's not both here and there."
A lot of words are written about quantum superposition that are just plain wrong.
Here they might have said Quantum Boo is in two places at once.
"Quantum Boo is at neither location, so it can't be at both!"
The reason for this is the apparent need to always couch quantum physics in classical terminology.
You've always had blue and yellow flowers and that is all you know.
Do you waste an entire blog post about explaining why it is neither blue nor yellow?
You can't contort it into classical physics language - it's just something new.
"Now, where were we?Mario cannot see the quantum superposition state of Boo."
"As soon as Mario looks, Boo is either found on top of him or way back at Boo's starting location."
"In quantum physics, Boo is said to have collapsed into the state it is found in."
"In short, the problem is that there are two rules for how Quantum Boo behaves."
"When no one is looking, Boo seems to spread out potentially occupying every allowed state."
"But, when someone decides to look, Boo jumps instantly to one of those states."
Most of Zeno's paradoxes are little arguments for the impossibility of motion.
"Of course, we move all the time - hence the paradox."
"The most relevant one is the Arrow paradox , which can be simplified as follows."
There have been many arguments given about this paradox that I won't repeat here.
The simplest refutation is to deny that time is composed of instants of zero duration.
"After a few instants then, the probability of being in the starting state is still, say, 99%."
"If Mario turns around, there is a pretty good chance that Boo is found in the starting state."
"When Mario turns away, Boo moves again into slight superposition, slowing increasing the probability of landing on Mario."
"But, if Mario turns around again quickly, Boo will surely be found back in the starting state."
"In other words, if Mario turns frequently enough, he can ensure that Quantum Boo never moves."
"It's the quantum Zeno paradox, as taught you by quantum Mario."
"These entrepreneurs, business and government leaders, and venture capitalists, are working to amplify Black voices across the country."
By Marguerite Ward and Dominic-Madori DavisThis Black History Month seems different from those of recent years.
"In May, video footage of the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, went viral, sparking an uproar."
Business leaders denounced the killing and promised to do their part to effect change.
"I don't believe the problems that surfaced in 2020 will disappear with the shift of administrations, he said."
Naj Austin is an entrepreneur focused on building communities that foster inclusion and growth for people of color and their allies.
Austin said the Black Lives Matter movement brought more people to the communities she's been working to build for years.
The founder also shared her top advice for anyone looking to start their own business.
"I know how hard it is being a Black founder with the world stacked against you in almost every way, she said."
My advice is to keep pushing and to lean on one another.
"If we build alongside one another, we can create a lot of magic in the world."
His work focuses on investing resources and capital in entrepreneurs behind companies focused on making the world a better place.
His work centers on supporting people who have traditionally been left out of the startup ecosystem.
"When Freddie Gray was killed in Baltimore, in 2015, the fund committed to investing in underrepresented founders, Cherry said."
"As associate chief technology officer for New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio, Gary Johnson leads NYCx Inclusive Innovation."
NYCx Inclusive Innovation is an urban research and development program that works with entrepreneurs to develop solutions to problems in New York neighborhoods.
"For example, one group of founders developed a mental-health program for Latinx youth in underserved communities."
"In June, Johnson was selected to serve on the mayor's first task force for racial equity and inclusion."
About $87 million of that investment was redirected from the New York City Police Department's budget.
"Since the company launched, in 2016, the app has been downloaded 2 million times and used to book 20 million appointments."
"We're empowering barbers to become better entrepreneurs and to create the lives they want for themselves, Omlie told Insider."
Barbers are some of the first business owners that young people meet in communities of color.
"With theCut, Barbers are able to build stronger businesses and continue to connect and lead within their communities."
"Our goal has always been to make barbers' lives easier, he said."
In most rooms or conversations people will already have an opinion about you.
The program helps everyone from college students to more experienced talent find jobs.
"Sampson is also a partner of the 100 Black Angels & Allies Fund, which invests in the development of Black tech entrepreneurs."
"Creating policy and initiatives to help advance economic rights is key to the Black Lives Matter agenda, Sampson said."
"Black entrepreneurs need to persist through their pain and scale their productivity to be successful, he said."
"DeShuna Spencer is the founder and CEO of kweliTV, a streaming service that focuses on showcasing the work of Black creatives."
She added that the Black Lives Matter movement has made her more intentional about her work and role as CEO.
"KweliTV created kweliGIVES, in which it donates 1% of its revenue to nonprofits in the Black community."
"The media plays a huge role in how Black people are perceived, she said."
"While I may not always be able to march in the street, I am using my platform to speak truth to power."
Stefanie Thomas is an early-stage investor at Impact America Fund.
Impact America Fund is a Black female-owned and operated venture fund.
"In October, IAF raised $55 million for a VC fund."
Thomas also runs a digital resident program with a focus on infrastructure for the creative economy.
She said this past year has brought forth an unwavering commitment toward centering Blackness in the nation's political and social dialogue.
Time will tell how long it sustains and if it will extend beyond this moment.
"What do Seth Godin, Pablo Picasso, and Johann Sebastian Bach all have in common?"
"Seth Godin, for example, has authored 20+ books in his life, all of which have been bestsellers."
"The great artist Pablo Picasso has been estimated to have created somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 works of art in his lifetime."
That's around 1-3 new works of art a day.
"Similarly, composer Johann Sebastian Bach composed over 1,000 pieces of music."
"At his peak, Bach produced at least one new song a day."
"Unfortunately, most people are scared to be prolific because they're scared to be imperfect."
"Rather than put themselves out there, they'd rather spend years fine-tuning their ideas."
"Now, you might be thinking that there's a trade-off between quality and quantity."
"That in order to do truly 'great work,' you can't do very much of it."
"On the first day of class, Uelsmann divided his film photography students into 2 groups."
"Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the quantity group."
They would be graded solely on the amount of work they produced.
"If a student submitted over 100 photos, they would get an A in the class."
"Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the quality group."
"The students in the quality group, on the other hand, didn't do any of this."
"In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than one mediocre photo."
"This will allow you to learn from your mistakes, which in turn will allow you to get even closer to 'perfection."
"In other words, they don't always consistently create work that is great."
"Seth Godin, for example, has once said that over 50% of his posts are average."
"As stated earlier, Picasso created over 50,000 works of art in his life."
"However, Picasso is only known for about 10 pieces of art."
"Similarly, among the 50 greatest pieces of music ever created, 3 belong to Bach."
"But in order to create those 3, Bach had to write over 1000 songs."
"Not everything Picasso, Bach, and Godin created was innovative and revolutionary."
"Oftentimes, we tend to think that people who are successful have somehow cracked the code to success."
"In an increasingly unpredictable world, you have to leverage the statistical advantage of randomness by producing a lot of work."
"But successful geniuses like Bach, Godin, and Picasso aren't born geniuses at all."
"Instead, successful geniuses are just average people who have chosen to be highly prolific."
"So whatever your field of work is, start creating and make sure you create a lot."
"There is a vast number of methods that can be used, from simple statistics to more complex unsupervised learning methods."
"In essence, SaaS businesses want to understand how their customers are using their product and how much they are using it."
"In any case, a drop in usage can result in customer churn."
The kind of data to be used is very specific to the business.
"For this article, I will use randomly generated data of WhatsApp messages coming from a very simple simulation."
"In that sense, it is quite similar to the standard deviation in terms of measuring statistical dispersion."
Both the mean and the standard deviation are highly influenced by outliers and therefore are extremely bad for anomaly detection.
"In this post, I will show you how to use it in Python to detect anomalies or outliers."
Remember we are not going for a hugely sophisticated anomaly detector or a predictive model.
We just need to get a sense of what it would be normal usage changes for our clients.
Now we have our MAD and a boundary that can help us determine if an observation is an anomaly or not.
"In this specific case, it looks like that 50% threshold might be a little bit too tight."
We can try changing that until we are comfortable with the number of false positives.
I'm sure you can imagine a Slack integration notifying Customer Success Executives when one of their accounts has dropped their usage.
"However, if your product usage has a relevant seasonality, consider adjusting the notification service."
"Detecting outliers: Do not use standard deviation around the mean, use absolute deviation around the median."
Headline economic numbers aren't capturing the distortions and depth of pain in the economy.
"Simultaneously, small businesses failed by the thousands as PPP proved inaccessible, too restrIctive or too complicated for many independent business owners."
Before the pandemic many offline retailers were already under threat from online competitors and the pandemic merely accelerated the inevitable.
"A deeper look at other Labor metrics, such as the Employment-Population Ratio provide more perspective to the true Employment picture."
"The large number of restaurant closures has reduced competitive saturation in many trade areas, which creates pricing power for the surviving units."
"Even if Federal minimum wage initiatives are not passed, local municipalities and labor market pressure will put pressure on labor costs."
It's hard for the Federal government to get money to independent businesses.
"With nearly 9 million apps at people's fingertips, it's tough out there for a mobile app designer."
At least a thousand new apps pour into the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store each day.
"Yet, more than 75% of them are downloaded, opened once, and never used again."
"With 3.5 billion smartphones globally, it's losing hundreds of billions of dollars every year by not following UX design best practices."
"The site is either too slow, the search is broken, the UI is indecipherable, or the navigation is awful."
Things looked pretty dire for an unlucky development team when people kept leaving 1-star reviews on the app store about their expensive creation.
"Desperately wanting to correct the situation, the team rewrote the app over several months at an eye-watering expense."
"It turns out people meant that the navigation was awkward, using the UI was cumbersome, and finding things was too slow."
"Following golden rules and standards would have improved their mobile UX, and they would have received better reviews."
People don't want to learn a new mobile interface every time they open an app.
It's estimated that people check their phones about 80 times a day!
"Because they're often used for short bursts of activity, frictionless designs with great UX succeed more."
The brain evolved over millennia to be as efficient as possible - to save energy.
People crave consistency and ease-of-use because our brains prefer the least amount of friction.
"But if something is unusable, it means increased friction, and people will move on."
"Coined by Jakob Nielsen, Jakob's Law states that Users spend most of their time on other apps."
People prefer your app to work the same way as all the other apps they already know.
It's about not breaking expected patterns unless it provides significant value.
Usability is a quality attribute in UX made up of many components.
"Memorability: When people return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?"
"How many errors do users make, how severe are they, and how easily can people recover from them?"
"There's a saying in the UX world, discoverability always wins."
Discoverability in UX refers to a UI where every possible interaction is crystal clear to users.
"A hamburger menu, for example, is detrimental to usability because it's considered hidden navigation."
It impairs usability because it has low discoverability and a high interaction cost.
"Among many mobile navigation patterns, the tabbed view is a popular one."
Because it exposes the primary navigation and allows movement between primary destinations in an app.
"If unavoidable, designers can use a hamburger menu on the tab bar for secondary, less important options."
"A particular form of navigation may have become ubiquitous, but it doesn't mean it's the most efficient."
"After countless tests, Facebook and Spotify decided that a hamburger menu should not be used as an app's primary navigation."
It's best only to use a kebab menu as a last resort.
"Astonishingly, some UIs sport not one but two kebabs, as the last screen below demonstrates."
"Since ancient times, people have used symbols to communicate with each other."
"The Greeks, Egyptians, and Chinese used symbols in some of the earliest writings."
On the left side above are some symbols that Native Americans used to communicate.
"But when we see the descriptions in the lower right, they make more sense, and recognition becomes a lot faster."
"Whereas universal icons are instantly recognizable, non-universal, unlabeled icons are a guessing game."
User flow comes to a screeching halt!The screens below from some popular apps show unlabeled icons.
"At the same time, recall is much more of a cognitive burden that involves pulling related details from memory."
Showing users things they can recognize improves usability over needing to recall items from scratch.
"For example, using icons in a UI is powerful because it allows for the instant recognition of a symbol."
Most people do not want to learn and memorize what an icon means in one app when using many different apps every day.
The mobile UX design best practice for icons is: always label icons with text.
Labeled icons ensure that meaning is conveyed quickly and easily and that they are consistently understood.
"In mobile eCommerce, even a one-second delay in load time can negatively impact conversions by 20%."
"If a slow mobile experience drives customers away, a fast mobile experience can help attract and keep them."
"If handled well, they can boost UX and assist engagement but risk becoming an annoyance when executed poorly."
Too many unnecessary notifications can frustrate users who may then silence notifications or stop using the app altogether.
The first app above asks users if they're enjoying the newly updated app immediately after opening it.
There's a fine line between an interaction that works and one that is unusable.
"Because usability is crucial on mobile, well-executed interaction design plays a considerable role in implementing great mobile UX."
"Observing interaction design principles takes on added importance as screens are small, and various form factors come into play."
"Whether in digital product design or industrial design, design conventions are rooted in human behavior, ergonomics, and psychology."
These conventions have evolved by trial and error over a long time and are proven to be effective.
Designers should design UIs that let people discover features and interactions quickly.
"Although this seems like a straightforward concept, it's one that seems to confuse people the most."
"In practice, designers need to use signifiers to indicate what affordances are present in a UI."
"When we initiate something in the real world, we expect some feedback."
"Press an elevator button, and the button lights up, signaling that the system has received the call."
"Touch your transportation card as you get on a bus, and you'll hear a ding."
It's comforting in many ways - it's the world feeding back confirmation to an action.
Feedback is closely tied to the usability heuristic visibility of system status.
Mapping is about mapping UI controls to something natural - taking advantage of physical analogies and cultural standards in the real world.
Mental models are also called conceptual models and are closely related to mappings.
Remember what neuroscience calls the lazy brain and the case for frictionless design?
"For example, this Mercedes seat adjustment control is perfectly designed to align with people's mental models."
"When these interaction design principles are applied rigorously, they will provide excellent usability, leading to higher quality mobile user experiences."
Let's dive into six essential Laws of UX that mobile designers ought to observe and add to their arsenal.
Adhering to these laws is especially important for mobile sites and apps.
"Whether a UX designer acknowledges them or not, these laws of UX rule and operate and will impact a design's effectiveness."
"Great customer experiences are based on trust and meaningful, consistent interactions."
Any designer worth their salt must consider cognitive psychology and the effect of their work on their intended audience.
"For example, let's consider a bank with over 25 million mobile customers."
The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
"Even though mostly applicable to desktop UI design, Fitts's Law can also apply to mobile UIs."
The distance from one tap to another can be used to either assist or impede an interaction.
This would impede the interaction and provide enough time for the user to reconsider.
"Inversely, closely-related, non-destructive actions could be placed closer together to speed up interactions."
The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
Mobile UIs need not be simplistic but should be simple to use.
"We saw this earlier, and it relates to the consistency of mobile UIs."
"Designers can simplify the learning process by providing familiar design patterns, thereby increasing conversions."
Miller's Law states that the average person can only keep around seven items in their working memory.
"When this rule is disregarded, people are forced to think more than they should have to."
"Tesler worked at Xerox PARC in the mid-80s and was instrumental in developing the modern GUI, the foundation for Apple's Macintosh."
The Zeigarnik Effect says that uncompleted tasks are easier to remember than completed ones.
It turns out that our brain has a powerful need to finish what it started.
"Hollywood has used this trick for eons in episodic TV, known as the cliffhanger."
Last but not least: designers have other ways to boost mobile UX.
They can take advantage of hardware components in a mobile device in creative ways to enhance user experiences.
"All mobile devices have a camera that can be used for barcode scanning, computer vision applications, and augmented reality."
"People are looking for convenience, ease-of-use, and efficiency when using their mobile."
"Too often, however, they're frustrated with mobile experiences due to poor usability."
"As great mobile designs are becoming more prevalent, the bar is always being raised regarding what people expect from their mobile experiences."
"From 2017 to 2020, Ali Abdaal built a 7-figure online business while completing his full-time medical studies at Cambridge."
"While he built the last two pillars in his early online career, the first three emerged more recently."
Instructors make money for every minute watched by Premium students in their classes and for every student they bring through a referral link.
"Ali has seven classes on Skillshare, with more than 100,000 students watching his classes at more than 9,000,000 minutes of watch time."
"The pricing starts at $1495 for the essential package, up to $4995 for the premium package."
Brands pay YouTubers to feature their products or services in some way.
"Sponsorships require an existing audience, and Ali got his first sponsorship deal in 2018 when he already had 50k subscribers."
Affiliate marketers earn a commission by promoting other people's or company's products and content.
"The broader creators' reach, the more people will buy what they talk about."
The advertisements are the short 5-second clips before videos or the snippets you see while watching a video.
"To start earning money with AdSense, YouTubers need a minimum of 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 valid watch-hours on their channel."
"For reaching $136,859 in 2020, Ali published 98 videos with 1.3 million subscribers."
It's tempting to use Ali's success as an example for a get-rich-quick scheme.
"But if you look at his history, you see that he didn't cheat."
"A few months in, he expanded for the students among him, sharing learning strategies and university productivity desk set up."
He went from a niche audience to a broader audience by focusing on the group of people he can truly help.
How to apply this lesson:What do you know that can help other people grow?
What have you done with ease that other people are struggling to achieve?
"Whatever you do, focus on the single most important metric: creating value for your audience."
Ali started in 2017 and didn't earn a cent from his first 50 videos.
He needed to build a solid 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch-hours before he'd qualify for the income program.
That's the difference between Ali and most people on this planet.
"He continued to trust in his process and producing great content, while most aspiring entrepreneurs stop along the way."
"Before earning +$100k a year, he had published more than 300 videos."
How to apply this lesson:Making money from online creation is a long-term game.
"But if you keep working, you might suddenly hit a glass ceiling."
"Whenever you think about quitting, keep in mind, you're in for the long term."
"While preparing this article, I expected to find a secret sauce for growing a content channel into a thriving business."
He created one to two high-quality YouTube videos for more than three years and ultimately saw the results.
How to apply this lesson:Don't waste time searching for a secret source.
Use success stories as inspiration but don't get lost in them.
"Instead, spend all of your energy consistently creating user-centric content."
In 2017 Ali invested £ 2000 in buying camera equipment while he didn't make a single cent from his new YouTube channel.
"Three years later, he wrote in the advertisement for his part-time academy:Learning fuels growth."
The best entrepreneurs are lifelong learners and don't hesitate to spend money on themselves.
How to apply this lesson:Make self-investments and learning a priority.
Don't agonize about whether you should spend money on these things.
"Save on consumer goods, and invest the spare income into learning and growth."
Ali said he planned to launch his part-time YouTuber academy as another Skillshare course.
"Because he connected with people who've successfully done what he intended to do, he deviated from his original plan."
He learned that a top tier offer at a higher price is a better way to go.
How to apply this lesson:Make it a habit to connect with new people.
"In a Forge article, Michael Thompson shared great strategies for how to do it."
He suggests calling one new person every week and reaching out to people you already have weak ties with.
"By its very definition, freelance writing is about being a bit freer with how you approach work."
The kicker is when the projects pay the same but require wildly different time commitments.
It makes it hard to feel like I've 'achieved' success.
"Of course, there needs to be a degree of this factored into your work life as a freelancer."
Showing up positively and consistently leads to great results as a freelancer.
"Ultimately, these are the ways to measure your day - and output - as a writer."
Everyone knows famous quotes by Einstein that grant a lot of insights into his miraculous mind.
"Thus, the world has physicists that also delivered valuable views on the planet."
And they either lived long before Einstein or are colleagues in mind.
"The following quotes offer you the chance to reflect on your thoughts, and besides, shatter the belief systems of your audience."
"Newton used this quote in a letter to Robert Hooke, another expert in the field of optics."
Isaac Newton believes that Hooke was more like a dwarf in the respective science-field.
Newton was intensely jealous and could not have enough attention to all his achievements.
It also contributed to developing a unifying explanation of everything - the universe as one interacting entity.
And this quote has its brilliance as it explains the growth in everyone's life.
And this first quote gives kudos to all large projects as it highlights the bureaucracy involved.
Sometimes bureaucracy is so overwhelming that the original goal is not visible anymore.
She got her second Nobel Prize for the discovery of polonium and radium.
The first element might have gained notoriety as it was the poison for Alexander Litvinenko.
"And she lived her life like the child in her first quote:Sadly, she died due to aplastic anemia."
Even though she did not fear anything as she was a master in almost any field.
"They conquer the world with fresh minds, virgin eyes, and don't fear anything."
They enjoy the experience itself - something that we should try more often.
"Born in 1858, Max Planch is another recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics."
"Besides his significant triumphs in the world of physics, he loved quotes almost as much as Einstein did."
"As with all lies, the truth will come out one day."
And their enemies will not have the chance to hold up the lies.
"Born in 1564, almost no other ancient person received so many superlatives for his work."
"Known as the father of modern physics , he explored or combined fields that shattered the belief systems at that time."
He was tried by the Inquisition and spent the rest of his life under house arrest.
"If a person is mindful enough and firm in his beliefs, you can expect brilliant quotes."
"Before Kant's Sapere Aude, - Galilei used this quote to say the same."
"Especially for Western societies, you cannot ignore his influence on knowledge, problems, and inquiries."
"As with all great literature, the real power lies in the application of the newly obtained wisdom."
Some quotes date back more than 2300 years and are still valid today.
"Sometimes, it is worth looking deeper into subjects as Einstein was not the only genius on the planet."
I wish you great fun in exploring the world without focusing on the prominent parts.
"By Monica HumphriesBorn and raised in Delaware, Kirsten and Devin Trout had no plans to move."
"Then, one day in 2017, the couple both felt the itch to relocate to Nashville, Tennessee."
"We never talked about moving to Nashville, so it was very random for both of us, Kirsten told Insider."
"Since we never talked about it, we just felt like it was a God thing."
"She said they discussed moving to Nashville for the first time, and the next day they started making plans."
"For the Trouts, it was a place with new things to explore and where Devin could pursue a career in country music."
"With their sights set on Nashville, their next challenge was finding a place to live."
"After searching for affordable housing, they eventually landed on a tiny home on wheels."
"In the fall of 2017, the couple was set on moving, so they started exploring housing options."
"They searched for homes and apartments, but couldn't find anything that fit their budget."
"A van felt too small for the couple and their three dogs, but an RV could work, they decided."
"Then we fell in love with the lifestyle and the freedom of it all, Kirsten said."
"After spending two-and-a-half years in the RV, the couple decided they wanted to travel more."
"So, they abandoned their house plans, and by the fall of 2020, they decided to go smaller."
"A smaller camper meant they could have a smaller car, fit in more campsites, and save more money."
"The couple purchased the vehicle for $16,000.The couple fell in love with their current RV for a variety of reasons."
"The vehicle has a bedroom, bathroom, and living room, which also serves as the kitchen area and dining room."
The toy hauler also features one of Kirsten's favorite things: a fireplace.
"With their ideal RV model, Kirsten was excited to turn the blank canvas into a home."
"So far, the biggest expense has been hiring painters to redo the interior, according to Kirsten."
"Several months ago, I was part of a gathering for solutions journalists from around the world."
"The term solutions journalism sounds positive, but this form of media isn't focused on feel-good stories or puff pieces."
"I'm creating something I really believe has value, she told me."
"Like design, journalism is in the business of delivering the data + the why of human behavior."
Publications tend to have clear and thoughtful mission statements that answer the why of their work: Why do we think journalism matters?
And therefore: What kind of stories do we think should we tell?
In what ways do they rely on us to meet that need?
A service delivers something of value that people cannot provide for themselves.
"For an industry that describes itself as a service, this inability to evaluate its own success is a fairly large miss."
Designers and editors both know that what people say they care about is often different than how they actually behave.
"Service designers work to get beyond stated user preference, to better understand user behavior and lived experience."
What does safe water mean to the readers who said they wanted more stories about this topic?
"What kind of information about water safety, if any, do they need and rely on?"
This process is called contextual inquiry -gathering qualitative data on how people use a product in the context of their lived experience.
And especially: What do they do with it that surprises us?
Are there any points we would expect them to use this product and they don't?
"If you're an editor, ask: What kinds of information do your readers rely on for their wellbeing?"
Journalism's mission statement is to act as an informational service for its core audience and the public at large.
It took me about five minutes to figure out The New York Times app on my smartphone.
"It's occasionally frustrating, but not unfair or unexpected - I knew the rules when I picked the thing up."
"In our current rush to digitize everything, we struggle with two competing arguments about the value of simplification."
"When you use technology to cut steps out of a task, people gravitate toward it."
"These take time to learn, and they're not optional if you want to get actual value out of the tool."
"But there are plenty of technologies that connect people, without the steep learning curve - text messaging, for example."
"And others, like complex video games, that involve no people at all, yet take eons to master."
"The real correlation, I'd argue, is with how specific our expectations are."
"For TurboTax, it's a complete, legal tax return with the maximum possible refund."
"For Spotify, it's immediate access to a song, or a curated introduction to new bands."
"That's part of its appeal, but also what limits its simplicity."
"If I was using Twitter today like I used it when I first started, I wouldn't be using it anymore."
"Each of these was a successively better answer to the question, How do I hear that song?"
"For listeners, there's the question of intimacy with the music and of shared experience with each other."
"Instead, we want to see an immediate cause and effect, of fingers on strings linked indelibly to sensations in our ears."
"Hearing the song is a concrete, specific outcome, and it responds well to ease-of-use efforts."
"Engaging with music is something much more nebulous, that we often pursue despite - or because of - its unknowable outcome."
Similar things could be said about taking pictures: the ease of the smartphone snapshot vs. the cultivated skill of SLR photography.
What we're slowly coming to grips with is the unimaginable complexity of human experience.
This is why Vine and iMovie can thrive in a world that already has Adobe Premier and Final Cut Pro.
But I wouldn't trade our banjo practice sessions for the world.
"The Global YPO Community includes more than 29,000 members in more than 140 countries."
Membership is limited to executives and entrepreneurs who have achieved significant leadership success at a young age.
"Combined, they lead businesses and organizations contributing $9 trillion in annual revenue."
What I find fascinating about YPO is how intense and powerful the community is.
"The following interview is adapted from my podcast, Subscription Stories: True Tales from the Trenches."
Robbie Baxter: Tell me about the forever promise that you make to your members.
Our forever promise is that you'll never walk alone in your journey as you go forward.
Robbie Baxter: We all need that especially during times of COVID when we can feel especially lonely.
"For many years now, we've been doing this and we've been a quiet organization."
We've not been trying to put ourselves out there as anything other than helping our individual leaders grow and become better people.
It's me explaining to you how YPO has changed my life.
"I'm a better leader, a better husband, better person than I would have been without YPO."
"Once that process goes forth, this person is going to be recruited into a chapter more likely than not."
"From there, that leads into the formal application process, and the formal review process."
Then we'll either recommend them to a chapter or we have virtual chapters.
"Some of our incoming members will join virtual chapters because of where they live, maybe there's not a local chapter."
We've got about four hundred seventy-five chapters located around the world.
Robbie Baxter: There are few things I wanted to follow-up on.
"I'll try to do them one at a time, although I'm excited about the different topics."
The other thing that I find interesting is this is a friction-laden process.
It seems like you've deliberately put quite a bit of friction into the process of becoming a member.
"In a peer-to-peer organization, the members are the product or the experience for the other members."
We create a safer place for people to share ideas because they know they're speaking with peers.
We are seeking a sense of curiosity and a sense of commitment to the experience.
"As a result of that, a longer duration of the membership."
I have something else that you said that stuck out for me.
"You talked about the forever promise being, You'll never walk alone, which is beautifully simple but also very ambitious."
"Can you talk about that how, You'll never walk alone?"
"When we meet in our groups, we recognize that sometimes what's on my mind now is all my personal topics."
You were a member of YPO before you became YPO's leader.
"It would be helpful for people to understand what that might look like, bringing your whole self to the group."
"I had involved discussions with my forum about who I was going to be as Scott Mordell like, Who is Scott Mordell?"
It was extraordinary to see YPOs in Italy who I barely knew.
We're helping extradition and all kinds of support for the family.
Those people are acting with an extraordinary amount of grace and goodwill.
"When I'm not in crisis, I'm going to help people."
It's the spirit of togetherness that creates a sense of community.
"We also are clear as an organization, we're not allowed to be an advocacy organization."
"We welcome that and we welcome disagreement in, This is what I'm doing."
"At the same time, it can be implemented based on their local mores and the local ways that people engage."
"It's a lot of similar protocols and attitudes, but they're implemented with cultural and geographical diversity."
"Robbie Baxter: If I went to a forum meeting in San Paulo, would it feel like Auckland or Dusseldorf?"
To what extent are you like McDonald's where the experience is consistent globally but with little bits of local flavor?
The only way that we're similar to McDonald's is we both have menus.
"There's an opening, a reminder of confidentiality and norms of how people are coming together."
That process will be the same wherever you go into a forum meeting around the world.
"Everything that we do, every single event is led by a member."
"Our overall governance of the organization is led by member boards, committees and volunteerism as part of the spirit of the organization."
"More than two-thirds of our members have volunteered in some way, shape or form for the organization."
"Otherwise, I may develop bonds and delight as I go around and have different experiences outside of my workflow."
Nothing's going to make me do something more than me deciding to do it.
That sense that I want to do it because I want to support you and help you becomes a cycle of participation.
"In that sense, once you begin to get that, you want more of it."
"I've been CEO for many years, I've been a member for 25 years."
"I'm stepping out of this CEO role, I'm going to go back and take a breath."
"Going back to the earlier point you had raised relative to, it's more than business, it's the whole family."
"Therefore, it's not just a business pursuit, it's a personal pursuit."
Join when you're 22 and stay until you're 99 is close to as forever as it gets for people.
"Their one trusted peer friend says, This might be a good time for you to think about joining YPO."
Beyond that headline benefit is all of what I call engagement and retention benefits.
"Also, that commitment to say, We're following you on the entire journey."
"We're growing in New Zealand, or like a certain industry, We're trying to grow in Biotech or Pharm?"
We're seeing that the industries end up reflecting the geographies a lot of times.
"We do run our industry spread but we don't say, We're running low on financial services."
We don't do that because we haven't had to because we've been represented.
"What we do is we look at the markets, where we think are likely CEO prospects."
"One has been a growth area where in the last many years, we've grown from about 118 countries to over 140."
"Social media, the followers and we are not chasing just numbers, we want the right followers."
We'll break down our followers and track that as best we can.
Our members are getting Zoom fatigue like many other people as well.
The technological change is in need of technological change as is quite dramatic.
"We're matching them with the members that we have, who can offer and help that."
"We have a lot of givers and a lot of people in need, and we're personally matching them."
"Yes, and we created a mini marketplace group site where people could say, I've got a whole bunch of PPEs."
We've published every single week where we could make that available to people.
Inventorying all that and moving that along is quite a bit different than the programming we were doing before COVID.
"It's highlighting for us that beyond the pandemic, the needs that people have are very varied all over the place."
"Our urgencies, in a lot of cases, have become immediate."
That helped us create greater clarity about what it is that that member wants and needs.
We need to be there for them because that's part of the lifetime journey.
Robbie Baxter: I want to wrap up with the two last things.
"The first one is I would love to get your advice for people who are reading, who tell me all the time,"
"It's easy to rationalize large numbers, but losing one can be devastating if it's for the wrong reason."
"Continue to be more conversant in a person-to-person voice, don't speak on behalf of the organization."
"Every communication should come from a person, not from the organization."
Nobody has an alliance with the organization and they have an alliance with other people.
"Xavier Mufraggi, our new CEO who has replaced me at YPO, is all over that and pressing that."
He made me pay for my own subscription out of my newspaper route money.
"I've always been a generalist, reading and trying to see the world since then."
It's going to help me as I renew myself for my next chapter.
The word befuddlement comes to mind when I think about how I made it this far in life.
"No matter what course I was on, I always ended up with a drink in my hand."
"But once I turned 30, I achieved my only goal in life and had no idea where to go next."
"For four more years, my faulty GPS kept me on the path of this lubricated lifestyle."
"But shortly after turning 34, I opened my eyes to reality."
I faced this question before but never had I felt as ready as I was on this morning to answer it.
"Now, while that is true, it has not been an enjoyable journey."
"If I learned anything in my first few weeks, it was that this world is nothing but a torturous, spinning rock."
"Fortunately, once I regained the ability to function before 3pm, my feelings changed for the better."
I started looking forward to waking up clearheaded and coffee never tasted so good.
"I knew the nights were going to be the hardest, and they did not disappoint."
"During my first few months of sobriety, I cycled through so many emotions while binge eating through alcoholic cravings."
"The first question, am I doing the right thing, was an easy one, it was yes."
This devil in my head was hell-bent on getting me to drink again.
"He would constantly challenge me with the second two questions, why can't you just have one drink?"
"Which brings me around to the last question, Is there something wrong with me?"
"That's an easy one too, and the answer is yes; Alcohol."
I was nursing a hangover on the couch while watching a YouTube clip from The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.
That video inspired me to put forth a solid effort at quitting.
"Maybe you will connect with something in it the way I did, and it will jump-start your motivation."
That red bastard belongs in the back seat and he is only there to remind you of what you shouldn't be doing.
"Like all backseat drivers, he has no idea what he's talking about."
Here are a few resources that will jump-start your journey down a new road.
To do that ProtoPie needs to work the way a designer thinks.
I can't tell you the number of hours I've wasted trying to figure out how a designer has prototyped something.
"Patterns, processes, and principles all contribute to creating common practice and understanding."
So let's look at how we can apply some of these standards to ProtoPie.
Having a shared vocabulary of how things are organised and coded is crucial to enable a team of developers to work together efficiently.
I like to think of components as synonymous to classes in oop.
You use the Send response and Receive trigger to pass messages through your prototype.
"Think of channels as pipes or tunnels, each one is connected to a different part of your prototype."
"There are types of channels; Send to Current Scene, Send to Parent, Send to Child and Send to Component."
We can apply the getter and setter pattern from OOP to messages within ProtoPie.
Using this pattern makes it very clear what each block of interaction is doing.
We can think of receive messages as getters and send messages as setters.
"As an example, I might add a Receive trigger in a component and call it getActiveWindow."
A setter is the reverse and would be a message that you send out such as in the example below.
Setters could be triggered either by a getter or by something that happens internally inside your component.
Adhering to this format makes it very easy for you to see what's going on inside your component.
We can use the OOP pattern for variables in ProtoPie in two different ways.
"For internal variables, we simply omit the overridable check box and therefore can only change them internally."
Because overridable variable names are actually used in the overrides panel I tend to write them like this: My_Public_Variable.
Functions are the workhorse of programming and work like mini-programs normally with a singular task.
They are a great way of compartmentalizing your functionality into smaller digestible chunks.
In ProtoPie we can use the concept of methods inside of our components in two ways.
One way is using the messages channel Send to Component and Receive from Component.
You can do this by detecting a change in a variable enabling the detect to then execute a set of actions.
Have a crack at some of these approaches and see what you think.
"Like most things, there's a bit of an investment initially but you will reap rewards pretty quickly."
For more inspiration on how to build components in ProtoPie check out these.
"Since I was a teenager, I've struggled with chaotic thoughts."
"Most of the time I'm not in control, and it's been that way for well over a decade now."
Recently I decided to put my foot down and stop these thoughts once and for all.
"After hearing about mindfulness and meditation for what seems like my whole life, I finally took action."
I'm not about to stand up on a soapbox and tell you that this is going to change your life.
I will make one promise to you though:Using this technique will bring you instantaneous peace.
The first step is to simply relax and become aware of your breathing.
You do not have to breathe deeply or change how you're breathing at all.
"Now that you've noticed your breath, the next step is to inhale slowly and deliberately."
"Don't push your lung capacity, just breathe as deep as you feel comfortable doing."
"As you're inhaling, think to yourself Breathing in, I am aware of my in-breath."
It stops you from considering anything other than your breath for just a moment.
"As you exhale, think to yourself Breathing out, I am aware of my out-breath."
You're bringing your mind away from the chaos of the world and into the safe space of your soul.
"The whole exercise is one complete breath, but you can repeat this as many times as you need to."
"Each time you breathe, repeat the words in your mind and focus on your breath."
"When I wake up in the morning, I stretch and do this simple breathing exercise."
"When I'm confused about what to write next, I practice mindful breathing."
Mastering this breathing technique will allow you to create your own personal bubble of peace no matter where you are.
"If you're a creator of any sort, mindful breathing is an invaluable tool for creative clarity."
It's helped me come up with new ideas and fix up old ones.
This is my round 1 submission for the NYC Midnight Short Story Challenge 2021 competition.
"I'm flying, he cried, his chest bursting with joy."
Simon propped himself up on his elbows fumbled for the bedside lamp.
"Then he opened his dream journal, clicked his ballpoint pen open, and jotted down a few notes:3:34 a.m."
"Unfortunately, when Simon fell to the ground his head smacked the pavement, causing him to lose consciousness."
He remembered waking up under the bright lights of the emergency room to the sound of his mother's sobs.
"No, it's not like that at all, Simon insisted."
"Simon felt the heat rising up the back of his neck, creeping towards his face and ears."
I don't - Are you asking me if I'm crazy?
"Simon's eyes glowered at his mother, who shook her head as her worn eyes refilled with tears."
"I'm glad you came to see me today, Simon, the doctor said greeting Simon with a polite smile."
"Please sit down, he continued, motioning toward the chair in front of his desk."
"Dr. Graham peered over his glasses at Simon, pen in hand ready to write."
"Simon shrugged and started to say he had no idea, but then he remembered the tortured sadness in his mother's eyes."
But - he held up his hands as if he was trying to stop another bus from running him over.
"The doctor asked, his eyes narrowing as he listened for Simon's answer."
"And I've tried to explain this to my mother, but - Your mother?"
"Actually, I would not be here if my mother hadn't insisted."
"When the bus hit me, Simon continued, I ended up at the hospital."
"And after that, my mom insisted that I talk to somebody about my dreams."
"The doctor sat up in his chair now, adjusting his elbow to rest his chin on his hand."
"Simon tilted his head, wondering if such a subject would be in the realm of study for psychiatrists."
I could have sworn I was in the middle of a dream.
"You see, Simon lifted his wrist to show the doctor his watch."
"I stare at the hands, and I try to make them move."
"With my mind, Simon answered, and hearing himself say it out loud, it occurred to him how ridiculous he sounded."
"The more I do it, the more it becomes a habit."
"Only, when I'm dreaming, I can make the hands move."
The doctor sat up now and clicked his pen as if Simon finally said something worth noting.
Simon shrugged and watched Dr. Graham look down at his notepad and begin writing.
"Well, I did my watch check, and I could make the hands move."
So what possessed you to want to walk in front of a moving bus?
"He'd wracked his brain for days, trying to remember what he was thinking at that moment."
Was he testing the idea that he could pass through solid objects?
"The doctor's face was the size of the moon, eclipsing the light shining into the office from the window behind him."
"But in the blink of an eye, the doctor was back in his chair, writing more notes on his notepad."
"I didn't say anything, the doctor muttered as he continued writing."
You were telling me why you wanted to walk in front of a bus.
"A strange feeling came over Simon, and he glanced down at his watch."
A feeling of calm replaced Simon's confusion; this was a dream.
He glanced around the room and tried to make out the title of any of the books on the bookshelves that surrounded him.
"Instead of words and letters, there was nothing on the bindings but random marks and symbols."
"This is a dream, Simon declared, rising to his feet."
"No, this is a dream, Simon shook his head and pointed at the bookshelves."
"Just gibberish, he said, his eyes skipping from book cover to book cover."
"If this is a dream, that means you can fly, right?"
"The doctor's voice was calm, and he lowered his arms."
"Fine, Simon said confidently, raising his arms to his sides."
"Lift, he thought, waiting for the feeling of his feet lifting off of the ground."
"In an instant he was hovering a few feet above the ground, looking down at the doctor."
"Simon floated back to the ground, his thoughts returning to the bus dream."
"He thought how strange it was to be awake inside of this dream, trying to remember a different dream."
"Maybe I was testing a theory, seeing if the bus would pass through me, something like that."
"Sure, Simon nodded, visualizing the bus barreling down the lane."
How far away was the bus when you stepped in front of it?
I didn't want to give it a chance to slow down.
"You aren't real, Simon hissed at the man behind the desk."
"Because you just told me to wake up, Simon pointed his finger at the doctor's face."
"And I can do anything I want to in my dreams, Simon growled at the doctor."
"The doctor struggled, trying to kick Simon back, but with each passing second his strength dissipated."
"His face turned a deep shade of purple, and his eyes bulged out of their sockets."
"After a minute or so, the doctor collapsed to the floor, his neck slipping out of Simon's hands."
"This is just a dream, Simon whispered before running from the office and into the busy city street outside."
He glanced at his watch - the hands were no longer spinning.
"Strange, he thought, then shouted MOVE at the still timepiece."
He spotted a clock at the entrance of a shop a few doors down.
"This is impossible, he howled, grabbing the arm of a man rushing past him."
The man's face twisted in outrage and he yanked his arm away.
"In the distance, he saw a bus roaring down the bus lane closest to the curb of the sidewalk."
"This is a dream, he repeated, less certain than before."
The memory of the doctor's lifeless body upstairs sent a shudder down his spine.
"I'll prove it, he whispered, stepping into the bus lane and closing his eyes."
"The doctor will call you from 11.30, said the tired-sounding receptionist."
"Oh I see, but like from 11.30 to what sort of time?"
I'm quite alarmingly nervous of doctors and doctor's receptionists at the best of times.
"When I know I have an appointment coming up, I don't sleep as well,"
"They could apparently call at any moment, like say when I'm eating soup or on the toilet."
When I first heard of self-care it was from influencers buying themselves extravagant bouquets and taking complicated baths.
"I came across this quote from author Anne Lamott, and it resonated:I started to look after myself better."
"I felt more rested and began to enjoy all the little things I could give myself, many of them free."
"Even so, with all the unsolved worries I still had zipping around my head like pinballs, my core happiness remained unchanged."
I used to keep trying to add things into my life for increased happiness.
"Between starting and finishing this story, my doctor called and I was able to have my telephone appointment."
"Yes, I need to go in for further checks; perhaps I'll even have to have tests at the hospital."
"Nevertheless, I feel lighter just for getting started down the path to addressing a worry."
"Every time I solve a problem or worry, I grow more confident in my ability to look after myself."
"She experiences first-hand the benefits of laughter, teaching improv at the San Francisco county jail and performing at comedy venues."
"Jennifer Aaker: Through our past experiences, we realized we'd sorely underestimated humor's potential to transform work and life."
"For Naomi, it was about using humor as an outlet and asset to deal with the seriousness of work she was doing."
"We ended up creating and co-teaching the popular Stanford GSB course, Humor: Serious Business."
Now we want to scale this beyond the classroom to help people find more joy at work and in their lives.
"It costs you health, creativity, relationship-building, and negotiating power."
"Between the ages of 23 and 70, our ability to laugh declines precipitously, a phenomenon known as the Humor Cliff ."
The average 4-year old laughs up to 300 times per day; the average 40-year old laughs that many times in 2.5 months.
They spend one week and simply write down the moments when they laughed and when they made someone else laugh.
"So, for the next week, start a list and jot down these moments."
These moments don't need to be knee-slappingly-funny.
"By the end of the week, you'll be navigating your life on the precipice of a smile rather than a frown."
"You can also learn a lot from comedians, who are just really observant people with a sense of timing."
Just noticing what's a little off and pointing it out is a start.
This gets us not only laughing but also engaging more with what's around us.
Tip #2: Use Comedy TechniquesA common misconception is that humor involves inventing something from thin air.
"When you think of it this way, it feels terribly difficult."
"These truths can be really simple, like people video conferencing from home may or may not be wearing pants."
"The other thing, which sounds kind of crazy at first, is to laugh every chance you get."
It's in your interest to let yourself laugh if something's remotely funny.
"Physiologically, humor is kind of like drugging your colleagues, but in a completely healthy way."
Research shows that having a sense of humor makes managers 23% more respected and 25% more pleasant to work with.
JA: Even people who aren't funny should be using humor.
"You've heard, Don't quit your day job, right?"
"We agree with that; don't quit your day job, but DO bring a sense of humor to your day job."
"As long as you aren't offending anyone, your sense of humor will help."
"That doesn't usually mean telling jokes, but being willing to be playful and laugh with others."
"NB: In order to use humor and levity in the workplace, you don't have to be funny."
"JA: Also, sense of humor is not something you either have or don't."
"For example, standups and snipers are at greatest risk of offending or alienating."
Sweethearts and snipers are at greatest risk of taking away their own power through self-deprecation.
That means something - especially if you look at gender differences through the lens of humor.
"It is so context dependent, and we don't always know the context of our audience."
"It's like a helpful, slightly-annoying friend who gets you to work on humor on a daily basis."
"After those three weeks, a lot of this work will become internalized and natural."
"Also, we are the most enjoyable slightly-annoying friends you will ever have."
"Small shifts in behavior and mindset are all it takes to reap the benefits, which are particularly profound in hard times."
"From this work, five themes emerged: boldness, authenticity, presence, joy, and love."
Here's the big secret: humor mitigates all five of these regrets.
"And just like everybody else, I tend to succumb to distractions."
I hope they can serve you as much as they've served me so far.
Disclaimer: I am not receiving any compensation for any of the below tools.
I only genuinely appreciate how useful they have been to my life.
"Luckily, Google Chrome has developed a tool for people who open way too many tabs at the same time: tab groups."
"With a simple right-click on any tab, you can create a group and give it a name."
All the tabs you add to the group will then be compiled into one single tab.
A single click on it is enough to expand it and show all that's inside.
"Until you do, however, you get to have a less-crowded tab bar and concentrate on whatever you choose to."
"Yet sometimes, you fall upon some things you want to look into later."
Or you just want to go back to some pages another day.
This often happens to me when I'm diving into Korean resources.
"By the time I'm done browsing, I still have many other tabs I still want to have a deeper look into."
"Sometimes I keep them for months, sometimes they stay there until the next day."
It's extremely convenient to declutter your browser from tabs you already know you won't use the same session or day.
"When you're prone to falling to distractions, it can be useful to completely block certain websites."
This extension is based on the Pomodoro Technique and blocks certain websites for 25 min and then allows a break of 5 minutes.
"If you want, you can change the settings to different lengths of time."
I used this extension often in my previous job to concentrate on tasks that needed my full concentration.
"These extensions are a god-send for addicts of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram."
The only slight change is the added bonus that the Facebook extension replaces the feed with a random quote.
"There's nothing wrong with scrolling, as long as that's what you plan to do right now."
"Other times, it's better to keep this trigger at bay."
"Oh, and also because I'm much more addicted to YouTube than anything else."
The DF Tube extension can hide and block pretty much anything you want on YouTube.
My current setup only leaves the Subscription bar and allows playlists to be played.
DF Tube is among my most relied upon extensions of all time.
I'm an avid user of Notion and anyone who uses this platform will probably know and already be using this extension.
It is perfect for when you want to save some reading content for later.
"With two clicks, you can copy the entire text of an article without having to highlight it."
Notion Web Clipper recognizes what categorizes as the main content and then saves it.
The extension automatically blackens the browser's content the moment your mouse switches to another screen.
"It's perfect when you have one screen for your music, one with Facebook open, and one for work."
"This is the only paid one but, after using it for over a month, I feel compelled to mention it."
This tool is probably the most efficient and useful I've found in a very long time.
I used to write a maximum of one long article in the morning.
"When you can't even reach for your phone for some distraction, all you can do is be productive."
And it's a mere $19 per year after you use the code they automatically give you during the free trial.
"I don't know about you, but I find this worth it."
"They're everywhere, lurking and ready to jump on you to take you away from what you originally planned on doing."
It took me years to gather all those and have what I now consider an almost-perfect set-up.
You don't have to waste so many hours doing the same.
Give these a go and look for better only if they don't satisfy your needs.
"If they work well, then smile and be happy about it."
"To be fair, there is no difference if this is about a website landing page, a product feature or WhatsApp messages."
"However, because I work at Sirena, I find it appropriate to use the example of WhatsApp messages."
You are an online retail business operating through WhatsApp in the modern era.
"After your bot talks to them, they get transferred to one of your sales reps and the sales process begins."
"Probably they are currently alternating between a few options, but not really sure which one works best."
Let's find out!Obviously answering this question will require us to dig into our data.
"For the purpose of this article, I have generated a random sample of data that simulates 10K incoming WhatsApp messages."
The result can be twofold; either the contact converts or they don't.
It's a form of a controlled experiment where some fraction of the people get one treatment and another fraction gets another treatment.
"If you know anything about multi-armed bandits, you might recognize that this is not optimal."
"Now that we have assigned HSMs to every message, we can take a look at the data and explore the results."
I won't focus too much on this part since the point of this article is the Bayesian analysis itself.
The worst conversion rate was for HSM₁ with a conversion rate of roughly 3.4%.
We want to understand how different the conversion rates for our templates actually are.
"However, for the last couple of weeks, I've been obsessing about Bayesian statistics, so we'll use that."
The beautiful thing about Bayesian statistics is that it lets you incorporate prior knowledge or domain expertise into your analysis by using priors.
"In this case, let's not make any bold claims about our conversion rates."
We'll use uniform distributions for the two conversion rates to represent how we have no clue what those conversion rates are.
This can be interpreted as the gain in conversion rate that HSM₂ gives us compared to HSM₃.
Notice that our Bayesian analysis has yielded distributions as a result instead of point-estimates.
This represents our uncertainty about our estimations and is a perfect way to communicate results with business stakeholders.
We see that the difference lies between 0% and 5%.
"This means that in the worst-case scenario, HSM₂ has no difference in conversion from HSM₃."
I intend to get to discuss all these interesting topics in future articles.
"My friend who writes fiction in her free time, asked for advice."
"Despite having fun with her passion project, she wasn't sure if she wanted to keep doing it."
"After all, it took a lot of time and she didn't earn anything from it."
"When I first started following my passion, I offered free group calls where I helped people."
It was great to do something that felt aligned and that I felt passionate about.
I needed to figure out why my feelings about my passion project had changed so dramatically.
Motivation persists when efforts feel rewarding and the perception of reward can change.
"In other words: your passion project has to feel rewarding to you, and what that means might develop over time."
"At first, expressing you passion or getting positive feedback might be enough."
"But over time, you might also need other rewards to stay motivated."
Let's explore how you can start getting paid for your passion project.
You need to get clear if and to what extent you want to monetize your passion project.
"While turning your passion into a side hustle has many benefits, it also has drawbacks."
It can turn something that you feel passionate about into something that feels like a job.
The pressure to earn money from your project can kill off the passion that made you start it in the first place.
This is something I experienced when I started charging for some of the things I previously did for fun.
Would I like to turn it into a genuine additional income stream?
"Right now, I first want to start earning some money from it."
"In this step, you determine whether you can monetize your passion in its current form."
"For people to be willing to pay for something, they need to receive value from it."
"However, just because people receive value from something doesn't mean they'd be willing to pay for it."
It can also be useful to ask in online groups if people are aware of something that's similar to what you do.
Create a list of all the different ways you could monetize your passion project.
"Example: Hmm, so my fiction readers definitely receive value from what I'm doing."
I think there are also platforms such as Wattpad where some fiction writers get paid.
I could also check out if there are fiction writers who use Patreon and offer their supporters exclusive stories.
"Over time, you also want to try out different ways to monetize your passion."
"If the first one doesn't work, perhaps it just wasn't the right one."
"If you already have an audience who loves what you're doing, you might have made some money right away."
"If not, it could be that you don't yet have enough people who want to support your passion project."
I also want to expand to other platforms to reach people there.
"By following the steps above, my friend can start earning money from her writing."
"Over time, this can lead into a side business or even a full-time business."
"By monetizing your passion project, it might also stay more rewarding for you."
I give more advice on how to start getting paid for your passion here.
"A 5-day email course with tips on budgeting, investing, and productivity for 20-somethings."
Deep Learning is a task that was definitely not intended to run on a mobile device like your personal Notebook.
Usually local GPU clusters or cloud based Server Systems are used to train models in an acceptable time period.
"However, everyone that is in to AI in general likes to try out stuff on its own."
Depending on your field of interest it gets quite obvious that without any GPU at hand you should not even consider to start.
"These machines can easily handle daily work, but were for sure not designed to train deep learning models for 24 hours straight."
"Hence, I decided to buy a used eGPU to test what benefit it would give to my system."
I got my hands on a used RTX 2080Ti eGPU all in one solution from Gigabyte.
My system has an i7 9750H 6 core processor with 32gb of RAM running on POP OS 20.04.
"The dedicated Notebook GPU scored 17046 points, which is actually higher than the listed score in the ranking."
That is a performance loss of 37.2% compared to the eGPU set up.
The performance gain for training using the AI-benchmark was 34.8% over all tests.
"The test palette ranges from simple Image Classification tasks over Image Super Resolution Networks, Natural Language Tasks and TimeSeries problems."
I also did a real world test using one of my own projects.
I trained the EfficientDet D0 512 x512 for a two class object detection task using the facial mask set from Roboflow.
I trained the model on both systems for 10k steps with a batch size of 12.
"In comparison, the dedicated Laptop GPU needed 124 minutes to finish."
"Again, the TimeSeries models show no big improvement compared to other Image tasks."
It will not only save you precious time but also can retain a good health of your machine for a much longer time.
You spend your morning with the goal in mind - feeling really good about the decision.
"At lunchtime, you purposefully turn your attention away from the brownies the cabinet and feel virtuous."
You have a nice dinner and carefully eat the one square of chocolate you promised yourself.
Then 9pm comes around and finds you shamefully shoveling brownie into your face with your bare hands over the sink.
"However, there is one small change that may have helped mitigate this cycle."
"Imagine if the brownies were gone?In other words, if you don't create and control your environment, it will control you."
"Its harder for me to stick to my goals of waking up early because its cold, and my bed is not."
So I have my clothes waiting next to my heater so they are toasty.
Slipping into a pair of baked socks and sweater is a nice reward for leaving my bed.
"Example: While driving, I floss my teeth with a flosser."
"When I don't want to look to be on my computer anymore, I put in the trunk of my car."
These are just a few ways to be nice to your inner angels and starve your inner devils.
"And once you notice it, what will you do to make a change?"
"Thus, while containing similar amounts of elements, the data matrices from genetic variation and scRNAseq are dramatically different."
I refer to scRNAseq as Big Data since it gives a lot of flexibility and statistical power for analysis.
"Typically, I choose a particular type of analysis looking at the dimensions of the data."
"For example, if N ~ P or N > P we can use traditional Frequentist statistics."
"As you see, genetic variation data falls into P >> N limit."
One of remarkable manifestations of the Curse of Dimensionality in Genomics is the sparsity of Genomics data.
"In case of Genomics, sparsity is a consequence of inability to find enough carriers of rare alleles."
"Therefore, we can not in principle associate a trait of the 100 individuals with minor alleles of all the 3 SNPs."
"In the figure below, circles are the carries of minor alleles."
This however results in a problem known as The Missing Heritability problem.
The problem is formulated as a lack of reliable prediction of a phenotype of interest from the genetic variation data.
This however does not seem to solve the problem of false-positive discoveries entirely.
It can be derived that the mean pairwise Euclidean distance grows as a square root of the number of dimensions.
This law explicitly demonstrates that data points move further away from each other in high-dimensional spaces.
"The green curve in the figure below is the mean distance, and the red curves display two standard deviations from the mean."
"This implies that we can not group good , bad and ugly data points together based on their similarity metric any longer."
"In my previous post, How to Cluster in High Dimensions, I tried to explore the clustering problem in some detail."
Another manifestation of the poor grouping of data points in high dimensions is the very weak correlations between the data points.
The figure above displays the maximal Pearson correlation between pairs of samples as a function of increasing dimensionality of the data.
One should at least try to reduce dimensions in order to address this problem.
What can we do to minimize the damage from the Curse of Dimensionality in Genomics data?
Regularization should be used in my opinion more often in Genetics research.
"Follow me at Medium Nikolay Oskolkov, in Twitter @NikolayOskolkov and connect in Linkedin."
"In the next post we will discuss how to cluster in UMAP space, stay tuned."
I've got a real problem with how we're fucking up the next generation by attention farming for ourselves.
I'm not talking about protecting the environment as goodness knows plenty of well-intentioned people have already taken up this cause.
"They are unable to comprehend or control its growth and at the same time, we do little to stop it."
Do you not have access to enough media about the dangers online and the risks children face every day just by existing?
"The Internet has been around nearly 30 years, give or take, in its present form."
"We're immediately sceptical of anything we don't voluntarily do online, but embrace contradictory risky behaviour."
There are untold volumes of past transgressions and embarrassments online still readily found from blunders made decades ago.
That personal picture shared with a love interest they then shared with their friends?
"A lot of this gets dug up at the worst time, and the recent emergence of Cancel Culture is a perfect example."
"When I entered the workforce, new parents had to bring pictures of their offspring physically to my desk to show off."
They want you to take their picture and post it because they know that means they get more of your time.
"They get their very own social media accounts and, in time, may even repeat the cycle with their families."
"But there is a way forward, and it starts with thinking before you click."
"Asking yourself, is there any possibility this picture could come back to haunt my child in the future?"
Are you posting that picture on Facebook for Nan & Pop to see?
Or are you trying to mug for attention in front of your peers?
My kid is better than your kid is nothing more than a game of one-upmanship you'll never win.
"Are there posts, pictures, and videos that share more than you should?"
Is there any information shared that could lead a predator to your door?
You know the details you post online that get used in targeting you with advertising?
These points are not fearmongering as goodness knows there is enough already.
"Please go ahead and continue to use social media because it is, after all, to be social ."
And perhaps it's time to go back through older posts and remove any that could become a problem.
Disclaimer: The thoughts and opinions presented on this blog are my own and not those of any associated third party.
"Every year, it seems, something new comes along promising to decrease our pain and stress while improving mood and sleep."
"Products containing copper, specifically those which also provide compression, have become ubiquitous."
"They include copper socks, sleeves, and braces claiming to get you back in the game or even improve athletic performance."
"Worn just above the calves, compression socks are believed to improve blood vessel efficiency."
Another study in February 2019 of elite volleyball players suggests compression socks can ease the stressors of long-haul travel.
"When it comes to compression back braces, however, claims of improved athletic performance as well as enhanced recovery remain unverified."
Bracing of any kind is typically done to limit range of motion and provide stability after an injury.
"There's also a specified duration for using most braces, typically four to six weeks."
"Prolonged restriction of the spine, specifically, may lead to core muscle weakness."
"Humans come with a natural lower back brace, sometimes called the corset of the core, in the transverse abdominis muscle."
Perhaps the most surprising finding within the medical literature is the role of copper and its effect on skin.
Wound dressings that include copper particles or polymers were patented less than a decade ago.
A back brace will not improve your athletic ability and compression socks cannot help you run a marathon.
"Compression socks can, however, help in recovery - and the copper infused variety might minimize athlete's foot and skin infections."
"Since the early 2000s, from New York to Los Angeles, two varieties of health spas have emerged with increasing regularity."
"Among trainers and physical therapists, ice packs and baths are ubiquitous in locker rooms."
They concluded that benefits of treatment are often exaggerated and not backed by specific science or corresponding studies.
"Theories behind float tanks, cryo spas, or copper compression clothing all come from areas and disciplines with some scientific validity."
"It's slightly more difficult to expand these claims to whole-body, nitrogen-based, below-freezing therapy."
"Upon deeper study and until further notice, the tried and true way might just be the best way."
"The idea that if something works, more of it would work even better doesn't always hold up."
"So, before you reach for whole body cryotherapy, try a targeted ice pack, ice bath, or cold shower."
"Runners or endurance athletes might try wearing compression socks, and evaluating their effect on recovery."
"For those who suffer from athlete's foot, consider the copper infused variety."
"Whether it's floating, compression, or extreme temperatures, the smart bet is to experiment and find your Goldilocks Zone."
"Importantly, these data may understate the true debt burden of Pell students."
This is because Scorecard data exclude non-federal loans that play a crucial part in cumulative student debt of graduates.
They incur unbearable costs on organizations due to high turnover and reduced productivity.
In many cases this is because the wrong people are placed in these positions.
"These are the toxics - people who have generally managed up, impressing their bosses on the backs of their people."
They don't care about their people and never will as long as they achieve their own selfish goals.
"Sadly, they will achieve results for a period of time - results driven by fear."
You may have heard of the Peter Principle - where people perform well and are promoted beyond their level of competence.
I have led people in multiple high stress organizations during my career.
"I will be the first to admit, I was far from an excellent boss -"
Good = defined by being both effective at meeting organizational goals and doing so while maintaining a workforce with generally high morale.1.
And it is totally ok to not want to be in that role.2.
"You get training for the most menial roles, but not for the most significant."
It's as if you are supposed to know - from day one - how to keep a diverse workforce upbeat and productive.
It was not surprising that I encountered so many ineffective and failed leaders during my time in the service.3.
Show team members that you value and respect them as human beings and as contributing members of the team.
I cannot overstate the importance of taking the time to do this.
"I knew each person's first name, a little bit about each one's interests and family."
"It may take a little time for you to learn a bit about everyone, but it is time well spent."
Moreover during the learning phase you will have to approach every team member and ask questions.
People want to know you are interested in them beyond what they can do for you.5.
"You may have just had a fight with your spouse, or be in a bad mood for whatever reason."
It's exhausting sometimes - but your mood will effective the entire organization.
Then use it to put yourself in the shoes of your team members.
Recognize when a member of the team is struggling and engage that person.16.
"If the boss works out at lunch, members of the team will feel comfortable taking a real break too."
Exactly - your entire team will assume that is what you expect of them.17.
Even here you must own the failure though - and acknowledge your own role in the outcome.19.
"If all else fails, remember the leaders who motivated you in the past and emulate them."
"Others aren't helpful, trying to tell you to relax or scale back your expectations."
Are you taking the right path to achieve your goal?Should you quit and redirect your effort?
What would that signal to others?And what if you're chasing the wrong thing?
But don't lose sight of your long-term goal and the perspective of achieving God's plan for your life.
Michael Jordan was driven to be the best player in the game and to win.
"He famously said, I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career."
Twenty-six times I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed.
I've failed over and over and over again in my life.
"He replied, I have not failed 10,000 times - I've successfully found 10,000 ways that will not work."
He provided perspective in addressing why he had ultimately been successful in these endeavors when others had not.
The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
Jordan and Edison both exhibited a relentless pursuit of long-term goals.
Gary Vaynerchuk has built a $100MM media empire and a strong personal brand with equal doses of intentionality and hard work.
"Since then, he has built VaynerMedia into a full-service digital agency with more than 700 employees serving Fortune 100 clients."
He maintains a relentless focus on branding and continuing to stay on the leading edge of digital marketing media.
"He's transparent about all parts of his business life, but draws the line at his family."
He wants to protect his children and wife from his own maniacal commitment to business transparency.
"Too many influencers on social media have created personas, and they're too airbrushed and perfect in their current state."
I believe they manufacture backstories about all they had to overcome to reach this current state of Zen master perfection.
That transformation story seems to justify the thousands of dollars they want to suck out of your bank account.
I get the sense that he hasn't changed a lot since he was twelve.
"He admits his shortcomings and his mistakes - not just in his past, but maybe last week or even an hour ago.#1"
"He personally engages on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok and who knows what other social media platforms."
"Once again, I think he's been like this all his life."
Corporations like Nike hire him to get his insights in reaching the next generation of consumers.
He's focused on his own brand and helping others build theirs.
He wants to stay on the leading edge - or even bleeding edge - in the digital marketing space.
This offered his audience the opportunity to get answers to their questions.
"Over time, people began to refer to Pat as The Crash Test Dummy of Online Business."
"He would try things and risk the mistakes and embarrassment of failure, so that you and I could learn from him."
"He also had his share of successes and because you were emotionally invested, you celebrated with him."
"Contrary to GaryVee, Pat Flynn invites his wife April, and his kids, Keoni and Kailani, to participate with him."
"Involving his kids in his podcast, his book launches, etc., gives him perspective and keeps him grounded."
But Pat is equally passionate in his approach to his brand and his audience.
He is willing to risk getting a few bruises and some embarrassment so that he can teach you how it is done.
His formula?He has a relentless focus on impacting others who need a nudge or a road map -
"As the CEO of United Way of Broward County, she is part social worker, part strategist, and part evangelist."
"In 2013 Kathleen, and six local leaders, who were United Way volunteers, launched Mission United."
"Mission United has provided pro bono legal assistance to more than 5,000 veterans and housing support to more than 2,500 veterans."
"And she is a fierce, protective mother when it comes to her family."
Agencies funded by United Way of Broward County have to be able to document positive outcomes.
"It's not about pushing money around, so people feel good."
The organization's goal is to pioneer housing solutions for the one billion people around the globe who live without adequate shelter.
"Like a lot of people, I thought Brett had to pick one or the other."
"Brett had a failed attempt at an entrepreneurial venture, but was bit by the bug."
What began as a brainstormed idea in an Atlanta apartment gave rise to New Story.
"Initially focused on crowdfunding the funds to build one home in Haiti, the response was significant and the vision grew rapidly."
Each home would cost $6000 and would include electricity and running water.
New Story partnered with Ikon to build homes with a 3-D printer.
They plan to give the technology away to help governments and commercial businesses create affordable housing in their own markets.
Brett and his partners launched New Story when they didn't know what they didn't know.
Commitment to one another and to the overall vision got tested and strengthened.
"New Story employees, donors, advisors become tied to the families they help and the communities they build."
The New Story team is committed to reaching more people more economically and in faster time.
"With a relentless focus on the message, with an equally relentless focus on continuous innovation."
They're making it easy for people to participate and partner to impact the world.
And they're bringing us together - and helping us lift one another in the process.
"It's hard to decide when to go all in, and when to cut your losses."
"Not every initiative will have a positive outcome, and not every strategy will be successful."
"Critics are all too eager to tell you to give up, or that you should do it a different way."
They may help you evaluate your short-term strategies or your next action step.
"The profiles of GaryVee, Pat Flynn, Kathleen Cannon and Brett Hagler suggest very different personalities, backgrounds and missions in life."
Anything they get out of it personally is a byproduct of helping others.
Their dedicated commitment and sense of urgency to impact other people draws others to their cause and their vision for the future.
"It can be a segment of the population, it can be a team, or it can be an individual."
"In short, just be engaged with your five senses as you do the activity."
"After you are done the mindfulness snapshot, let your attention wander again."
"Some examples of these activities are walking or running, household chores, knitting, colouring, and grooming a pet."
"Then, simply do the activity while noticing the sensations in your body and your mind."
I found out about this mindfulness practice in the classic book The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron.
The book's twelve week program includes a practice called daily letters.
Don't worry if it makes sense or if it switches topics.
Don't stop to correct things - spelling and punctuation don't matter for this exercise.
You can choose to destroy it or keep it to read it in the future; just don't read it anytime soon.
It is also useful as a way to simply observe your thoughts.
I have kept up a daily drawing practice ever since I read Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain two years ago.
I can stay mindfully engaged for a longer time in this active state than I can while meditating.
The completed drawing gives me a tangible record of the relation between myself and the drawing subject in a given time.
Try to hear what the other person is saying without rehearsing what you are going to say next.
Mindful conversation helps you relate to others and yourself in a more honest way.
Active mindfulness practices like those I described can offer a way to benefit from mindfulness without having to meditate.
"While this is useful, I think these activities go beyond being meditation alternatives or beginner mindfulness techniques."
"They have their own, unique benefits that can be complementary to traditional mindfulness practices."
"Whether or not you like to meditate, I hope some of these mindfulness practices may be useful to you."
I have personally found my life has been enriched by practicing mindfulness outside of sit down meditation practice.
In July 2020 the team spent a couple of hours making a product demo and posted it to Twitter.
"Without many followers, they didn't expect much to come of it."
"Instead, it went viral, receiving around 1,000,000 views and reactions from prominent figures in the venture capital and technology communities."
This triggered coverage in high-profile media outlets such as the New York Times and Fortune.
"In the meantime, thousands of prospective customers put their names down for OthersideAI's waitlist."
With this momentum they raised a $2.6m seed round from prestigious investors.
"But, like all things, highlights don't reveal the whole story."
"What were the underlying factors, steps, and frameworks that made this chain of events possible?How can other founders replicate this process?"
To be clear - their software doesn't make decisions or formulate opinions for you.
This was not one of those product demo scenarios where hype was artificially manufactured by domain-expertise influencers or marketing experts.
Both the user experience and product proposition is intrinsically very cool and valuable.
"Make no mistake, this is a major contributing factor in their journey so far."
"Their demo 'sold itself' and was fundamentally shareable, so it spread organically."
The three founders met at the Blackstone LaunchPad & Techstars at Syracuse University.
The idea for OthersideAI came from an experience CEO Matt Shumer had at his previous startup Visos.
"So, he spent several weeks experimenting with GPT-2 in an effort to optimize his outreach strategy."
GPT-10.What you could do with it was mind-blowing and caused a social media frenzy in technology and venture capital communities.
Matt Shumer said they were able to move that fast because of their prior experience experimenting with GPT-2.Fair enough.
"They got the attention of people like former Shark Tank investor Chris Sacca, who retweeted and amplified the startup even more."
This led to coverage in major publications like the New York Times.
I definitely prefer the latter approach since waiting around for something that may never happen is frustrating.
Building a product with the latest sexy technology 'everyone is talking about' is a fantastic way to generate organic attention.
"When it's combined with a truly valuable and futuristic proposition, the technology community can go wild."
"But, unless you are already well-connected or an influencer it's hard to get their attention by simply tweeting alone."
"So, it seems like a mixture of an awesome demo and serendipity."
There are steps you can take to engineer a catalysing event for virality.
"I've done this personally, you can read up about it here."
"But, you can't make 'anything' go viral of course."
The appeal of the content must be capable of 'going viral'.
"This can be through a mention, direct message, or even a well-written cold email."
"Ever since they've continued to share their progress on Twitter, as well as taking interviews on podcasts and things."
"At the time of writing their waitlist is around 13,000!Well, a mixture of momentum and connections."
Hustle Fund put the first check into OthersideAI - after an introduction from a mutual connection.
"One of the founders, Jason Kuperberg, was fortuitously connected with investor Gaby Goldberg."
"And, Active Capital reached out to the OthersideAI team cold to invest."
It was more of a case of optimizing the process of finding the most ideal investors the fastest way possible.
CEO Matt Shumer says the best way to secure investment is to tell a story.

Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity had some awfully big shoes to fill.
"As a side note, I'm changing up the format of my Still Worth Playing articles."
"Okay, I know what I said five seconds ago, but I really think graphics are relevant here."
But never before have they essentially sent the entirety of a game's assets over to another company.
"Also, this meant that Breath of the Wild's clear, minimalist visuals were, of course, well-preserved."
"The music, on the other hand, does show some welcome innovation."
"There are eighteen playable characters, and while it was pretty obvious that some of them would make it in -"
"Unfortunately, this doesn't extend to every aspect of the game."
I got a quest early on that required me to get ten ice lizalfos tails.
"I had seven, three of which I'd gotten by grinding."
I wish this aspect of the game had been looked at more.
"While I loved the variety of characters, I have to admit that some of them felt a little bit underpowered."
"After you realize that Impa is literally god-tier, no other character really feels worth playing."
"That's a shame, because Age of Calamity's character variety is, like I said, one of its strong points."
Depicting a world in which the Hero and the Princess had been unsuccessful in sealing the darkness.
"There's a better view of the Champions as well, but we didn't really see new sides to them or anything."
"Really, for all the cutscenes, we don't get much new stuff."
I also wasn't sure I liked the brand-new story content.
I feel like Koei Tecmo was handed something good and turned it into something pretty forgettable.
"Ultimately, I think Age of Calamity did more or less what it said on the tin."
"He bent to brush dirt off his red trousers, a lazy cloud billowing around his legs."
I held a finger to my lips then pointed up at the ceiling.
I was suddenly aware of all the reasons why he might not find me beautiful anymore.
I looked down at my feet and tucked a strand of hair behind my ear.
I can't believe it's been an entire year since I've seen you.
He smiled back at me but it faded as he recalled a thought.
He bent to unzip his black leather boot and pried it off his foot.
"I ran my hands over my chest and torso, ironing out any wrinkles in my silk gown."
"I brought my hands down abruptly to my sides, my face burning with embarrassment."
I blushed and avoided eye contact with him as he approached me.
He brought a hand to my waist and pulled me into him.
"He tilted my head up gently, forcing me to look at him."
I brought a hand up to my mouth to stifle a laugh and I melted into his chest.
He brought a hand to the back of my head to hold me.
He chuckled and my body bounced against the rumbles of his laughter.
His eyes were framed with fine lines but the eyes themselves were bright and clear.
His iris' were Arctic blue with iridescent flecks of gold around the pupil.
"The apples of his cheeks were rosy, having been brushed with the cold from outside."
He repressed a smile through pursed lips as he watched me inspect him.
"I cupped at the body of his beard, the coarse hair conforming to the contour of my palm."
I felt his eyes following mine as I wandered over the details of his face I'd forgotten.
He wrapped his hands around me and clasped one of his wrists at the small of my back.
I snuggled my face into his chest and he rested his chin on the crown of my head.
The need for reassurance was in my voice and he caught it.
"He grabbed me by the shoulders and held me at arms length, white teeth radiating behind his grin."
I'm waiting for the day you trade me in for a newer model.
He brought his hand to the nape of my neck and cradled my head.
He turned his head and pointed at the dining room with his chin.
"And I thought, 'I've never seen someone so beautiful look so sad.'"
You stood so quickly from the chair I was convinced it was going to topple over!
"You threatened to call the police on me, do you remember that?"
"I had a busy night ahead of me, but for some reason, I just couldn't walk away."
"And I know, better than most, what that feels like."
You told me you were married to someone you didn't know.
"I'm not sure if I ignored the signs or if they had come out of nowhere,' you said."
You didn't want him to take it out on the kids.
"I sat and listened and watched you, your beautiful lips spilling these heartbreaking words - cruel poetry, it was."
"You finished speaking and sat there in silence, looking at your hands."
I opened my mouth to speak but that's when you looked up at me.
I rolled the question over in my mind a few moments before asking what kind of magic you wanted to believe in.
"I leaned across the table, getting as close to you as possible."
"I said, 'I don't know if that kind of magic exists."
"You leaned in close, our heads inches away from each other, like we were sharing some kind of secret."
It's so fragile the odds of it surviving are not in its favour.
"But with nourishment and care and time, that little acorn becomes an oak.'"
"I said, 'maybe but suppose science and magic are one in the same?"
"Suppose we learned how magic works and because we understand it, we call it science?"
That doesn't take away from these phenomena still being magical.'
"After a while, you leaned in again, ready to listen and you asked, 'okay."
"You repeated what I said, not sure if you heard correctly. '"
I nodded and said it again: 'you're the seed.'
He was much larger than me and my fingertips barely met around his circumference.
I shimmied and found a way to hook my middle fingers together.
"I stood, already well behind schedule, and told you that I had to be getting off."
You smiled at me and it felt like the sun was peeking through the clouds.
"I walked over to you and hugged you, the way I do now, and kissed you on the head."
"I came back the following year, same day, same time."
You must've thought I wasn't going to show up because your knuckles were white.
"You looked up and saw me and boy, did I give you such a fright!"
But you laughed and I could see how excited you were to see me.
"You came up to me and wrapped your arms around me, asked me if I wanted anything to drink."
"You wanted a small glass of milk, I mumbled into his chest."
"He nodded several times, his chin poking the top of my head."
We sat down at the table again and I asked you how you were doing.
"There was something different about you, I knew it the moment I looked in your eyes."
You told me how the boys had turned two and they were climbing and crawling on everything.
"You'd said this with frustration but your eyes told me a different story - you loved those boys, you sure did."
"We cozied up on the couch together, with what time I had left."
"You cried a small pool onto my suit, but I didn't mind; I just held you until you were done."
You had a lot of hurt that couldn't be put into words.
"You said, 'I'll see you next year,' and I nodded again."
"Every year, I'd come into the house and see you sitting at the table waiting for me."
"Small things and big things would change around you, but you always sat there waiting for me."
I hardly recognized you that one year you lopped it all off and dyed it blonde!
The one thing that never changed was this look you had in your eyes.
"But no, this look - this look was the opposite of that."
The dining room buzzed like something other than you and me were alive in it.
I walked over and stood at the table and that's when I saw it - your black eye.
"It looked like it was a couple days old, the border now a yellow-green gradient."
I had never seen the effects of the abuse even though you had mentioned it to me on many occasions.
And you repeated those words again when the echoes of the first stopped cascading through my mind: 'he's gone.'
I watched you and marvelled at this creature that was bruised but far from broken.
His shoulders fell in a sigh and said: You've been the oak ever since.
"We stood there wrapped in each other in the middle of the night, frozen in time."
My heart beat lazily against his chest and the residue of insecurity released me from its clutches.
"The second hand on the clock tick, tick, ticked, the refrigerator hummed and the furnace in the basement roared."
My boys - no longer boys - were asleep with their partners in two of the guest rooms upstairs.
"It filled my senses and it filled my heart and as fast as the hubbub would come, it would go."
"He pulled away and held me at arms length, bending at the waist so our eyes were level."
"When they kids grow up, as they do, and they stop believing in me, they'll still believe in you."
"He cradled my jaw in his massive hands, his fingers resting gently behind my ears."
"He brought his lips to mine, the tickle of his moustache and beard prickling my skin, and kissed me."
"Same time, same place, he asked, his face breaking out in a grin."
He put his boots on and turned the corner of the dining room.
"With a final turn of his head, he smiled and winked at me, then disappeared into the night."
"I smiled to myself and held my fingertips up to my lips, preserving the kiss."
"She stood and placed her hand in mine, still rubbing her eye with the other."
"Oh, my - well - I - I scrambled to find words."
"She looked up at me, blinking away the remnants of sleep, her gaze beginning to focus."
"I paused before smiling at her and said, that would be quite magical, wouldn't it?"
"She looked up at me, shrugged her shoulders and said, Does that mean we get more presents?"
I threw my head back in hearty laughter and bent to kiss her on top of her head.
Only a couple more hours till we get to see what Santa left you under the tree.
She nodded as she yawned again and tucked her head in the hollow of my neck.
She would be asleep before I reached the top of the staircase.
"She was in her late 30s, single in New York, and planning to die alone."
"This is why in 2016, she decided to make a change."
"She worked with a coach, shifted her mindset, and attracted Brian into her life."
They've since brought a wonderful boy called Charlie into the world.
"Now, she's a hypnotherapist and coach who helps others master their subconscious."
She's also been voted a top 20 coach in LA by Los Angeles entrepreneurs.
"When I spoke with Shonda, I was expecting my worries to be swept away."
"She asked me questions, led me by the hand, and even set homework."
One belief I've latched onto is feeling I'm not enough - that I'm not worthy of love.
It's held me back in relationships and I fear I may never settle down with someone special.
"If you're in a similar boat, hypnosis may just help."
"I've practiced this for years, and the main difference seems to be speaking aloud."
"Last month, a writer on Medium and I progressed from commenting on each other's work to swanning into emails."
We had our first virtual date last weekend and are doing a take-two on Saturday.
"It's exciting, though, particularly given how I wasn't looking for anything."
Funny how removing resistance does this!This is a far cry from needy behaviour I've exhibited in the past.
"If the girl I've been dating isn't the one, that's okay."
"If this is possible in such a short space of time, I'm excited about the possibilities of six months."
There's nothing to lose and potentially a whole lot to gain.
Most of my work has been in the publishing industry in either design or editing.
"In more recent years, I've taken on a lot of freelance writing."
I have never regretted leaving the traditional working world behind and embracing the freelance lifestyle.
"That said, I can say with a lot of confidence that freelancing can be a perfectly sustainable and enjoyable lifestyle."
Here are some things I've learned over the years that may help.
You should always have an idea where your next job is coming from.
It will come along as you get better at pitching jobs and tracking down work.
"Early in your freelance career, you're going to be tempted to take in every job that comes along."
"Take on what you are certain you can handle, and no more."
"Every now and then, you're going to run across a client who raises some red flags."
Maybe they are always trying to expand the scope of a project without expanding the compensation.
"If you're feeling unsure about a client, listen to your gut."
"If there is any such thing as a holy writ for freelancing, it's to keep the deadline sacred."
"One sliding deadline quickly leads to two, then three, then your entire schedule is turned upside down."
"Third, you'll feel better about yourself as a professional freelancer."
Plan your time carefully and accept jobs with deadlines you're confident you can manage.
"If you persevere in the face of difficult times, you'll eventually find the wait was worth it."
All of those five or six-figure freelancers you hear about on Instagram all started out struggling just as you did.
The trick is how long you keep trying and building before deciding that maybe it isn't for you.
Some people find they're much happier not dealing with the stress and uncertainty associated with freelancing's early stages.
"Say you've been freelancing for a few years, and you've raised your rates to match your skill and ability."
Your old client may not want to pay you what you're now worth.
It's okay to let them go and move on to greener pastures.
"Loyalty is fine, but being paid what you're worth is important as well."
"When you feel you've outgrown your client, it's okay to move on."
It just means you should enter the freelance world knowing what's in store.
I'd love to share more with you via my Bi-Weekly Word Roundup newsletter sent to subscribers every other Sunday.
"It will feature news, productivity tips, life hacks, and links to top stories making the rounds on the Internet."
"On February 8th, Treyarch released an update to bring League Play back to Call of Duty."
"For those who do not know the importance of this, let me educate you a bit."
Each game mode provides varying levels of skill and strategy to pull out the win as a team.
A total of thirty lives are given to both teams at the start of each game.
"Search and Destroy is a mode that requires a lot of teamwork, a good bit of strategy, and a little stealth."
"As a defensive player, your job is to ensure that the enemy team does not blow up the targets."
This can be accomplished by either killing all of the opposing players or diffusing the bomb before it explodes.
Each team must capture these rotating spots for a total of 250 seconds to win the game.
Each player must complete five placement matches to determine where they rank against all other players on the leaderboards.
"If you earn the title of Advanced, you are part of the top 15-20% of all players."
"Unlike the traditional experience in any Call of Duty game, there are many restrictions within the League Play playlists."
These are the same restrictions put on professional players within the Call of Duty League.
"There is a large list of weapons, attachments, scorestreaks, gear, perks, and wildcards."
Most of my games consisted of the hardpoint game mode but luckily rotated between multiple maps.
"I felt that my performance in these matches was good, but sadly, I still lost most of my games."
Those losses could easily be pinned on a lack of communication between myself and the players that I am matched up with.
Having a microphone is absolutely crucial to success in this game mode.
"If you do not have a mic, it will be challenging to perform at the highest levels."
"This is one of the major issues that I dealt with earlier today, and I found it rather frustrating."
It seems Treyarch will keep League Play following the same format as in years past.
"In Revenue , I had the pleasure of interviewing Abby Kircher, Founder & CEO of Abby's Better."
"In 2015, when Abby was just fifteen years old, she became invested in her health and creating a healthy lifestyle."
"Today, Abby is even more passionate and ambitious than ever to share her creations with the world."
"Abby continues to inspire other young entrepreneurs to pursue their dreams, even if it means taking the road less traveled."
"Before we dive in, our readers would love to learn a bit more about you."
"I was 15, it was the summer of 2015 and I started mixing different nuts with different natural sweeteners, like fruit."
"I was invited by Seeds and Chips to attend the World Food Innovation Summit in Milan, Italy."
"There I was, 17 years old, getting to meet one of the most amazing entrepreneurs and present him on stage."
An experience of a lifetime!None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way.
"Abby's Better COO, has always been a huge inspiration for me."
"We have very different skill sets, different outlooks and opinions, and that helps us complement each other in a work environment."
I first started on my health journey I remember struggling with being unsatisfied in the foods I was eating.
I found options that met my health standards or requirements but none that satisfied my taste preferences.
I am creating a clean label snack brand to be a one-stop-shop for healthy plant-based snacking.
I didn't know anything about eating to fuel my body rather than just filling it.
That's why I wanted to make sure that this podcast would be focused on YOUNG entrepreneurs and their startup stories.
The topic of this series is 'Five Strategies I Used To Grow My Business To Reach Seven Figures In Revenue'.
It is hard to plan for steady growth when you know that at the last minute BIG decisions will need to be made.
That was key for Abby's Better going into 2020 where our growth skyrocketed.
That was right before COVID hit and began to affect everyone's lives.
Everything from social media polls and comments to email newsletters that could get people engaged and talking with us.
Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you or your team made during a sales process?
Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?The amount of time we spent hand jarring each of our butters is insane.
Hours upon hours because we didn't know how to find the other option.
It taught me perseverance and to do the hard work that needed to be done even when it seemed insurmountable.
Since then we've now moved into our own manufacturing facility!Does your company have a sales team?
"Before now, to be honest, my family and I have been the sales force."
What are your Five Strategies I Used To Grow My Business To Reach Seven Figures In Revenue .
"Seems very simple, but learn your consumer - who is buying your products?"
We had the ability to know exactly who was purchasing our products.
Strategy 2 goes along with 1 - it's to listen to your consumer.
"As I mentioned previously, it's important to get that consumer as involved and active with you as possible."
Make it fun for them to help you get to know them better.
The minute the company is no longer being creative is the same minute the company is in a downward spiral.
It is vital that you are always taking the information that you are getting from the consumer and putting it to action!
It is about creating a strong returning customer base so that people are LOYAL to you.4.
"What would you advise to another business leader who initially went through years of successive growth, but has now reached a standstill."
From your experience do you have any general advice about how to boost growth or sales and restart their engines ?
"Creativity and innovation is key, however this is grueling work and can get tiresome."
In your specific industry what methods have you found to be most effective in order to find and attract the right customers?
To find YOUR consumer means you will have to be reaching so many eyes to see what sticks.
Make sure you have someone in that category be immersed in the product and customer service and maneuvering around the website.
Do you use any specific initiatives to limit customer attrition or customer churn?
"Focus on having a STRONG rate of people who come back after buying once, and then go from there."
If that rate is low it can say a lot about your brand.
There is something about you or the products that a consumer doesn't want to come back to.
She has overcome tremendous adversity and obstacles and has become one of the most powerful women in the world.
She is such an inspiration and it would be such an honor if I ever get the pleasure of meeting her.
"This was very inspirational, and we wish you only continued success!"
"If you're leading a SaaS company, you're thinking about churn."
I'd bet one of your biggest problems is reducing it or keeping it low.
"If you build a product your customers love, they'll stay."
But at the heart of any great churn strategy is customer feedback.
"Here's how these leaders actually use customer feedback to eliminate churn, as well as advice you can implement yourself."
"If you're lucky enough to get feedback from a customer, you must act on it."
"Good or bad, it's your chance to improve the relationship with your customer."
"The stronger the bond you have with the customer, the less likely they are to go elsewhere."
"If it's bad, do what you can to help them."
Make sure they understand you acknowledge the problem even if you can't do a lot about it.
"Offer refunds, replacements, or whatever, but try and go the extra mile where you can."
You can turn a bad situation around and give them a positive experience.
"Customers would use our product, reach their goal and then churn."
"We realized that we had to ask, What value can we bring to you when you're done using our product?"
"Using that question, we unlocked two value propositions that were adjacent to our offering."
"Together, those two changes increased our average customer lifetime from 3 months to 18 months."
We've since switched to having a team member manually email a personalized message to each user who didn't activate.
"We've invested in resources, technologies, and integrated sales processes to facilitate the interface between our employees and customers."
"Technology and automation are great allies, but we've found that offline experiences also count."
"The key, for us, has been to invest in more face-to-face interaction."
Remember that a solid relationship is built over time and your initiative is important.
Show your customer that you care about your business and your success.
"In this way, they will feel unique, well attended, and important to your company-and they will stay."
"Then, we ensure that we:This has helped us reduce churn significantly."
"We still look at customer usage data, but customer feedback has helped us immensely in the evolution of our product."
"When using a product-led growth approach, customer feedback is critical to help reduce churn."
"First, you must define how you're collecting feedback from customers."
"We've found that if we can solve those issues that generate friction for our users, we see our churn rate diminish."
Having a high customer churn rate only means that your customers are no longer happy with your product and service.
Customer feedback is one of the best ways to identify these root problems.
Make the most out of all the available channels you have and constantly ask your customers how they perceive their product or service.
Interacting with your customers and being attentive to them can help you serve them better and reduce churn.
"Each quarter, when we're prioritizing our projects, we review this customer feedback and decide which issues we want to address."
"Typically, we address issues that are the most common and the most severe."
The key is to ensure that customer experience teams are working closely with product teams.
"For example, in the past, our mobile experience had several dead-ends."
Visitors to our website could get stuck on a page if they tried to use specific parts of our navigation on mobile.
"We consistently heard this feedback over a few quarters, and the associated feedback was pretty negative."
"As a result, we decided to address this issue and saw our conversion rate on mobile decrease."
"For example, this year LiveHelpNow is launching a new operator's panel, with additional features and an updated design."
"We ask questions, get our customers to tell us what they like and dislike, what goes smoothly and what needs improvement."
Then we take that feedback to the drawing board and do what our customers want us to do.
"We use their feedback of their experiences in further development, improvement, and designs of the software."
That is a great way of putting customers and their needs first.
"Not only does that improve our product, it gives our customers a sense of true participation in our brand."
"And that, in turn, creates and strengthens customer loyalty, ultimately reducing churn."
Bertil Hörberg has become one of the most well-known indie developers for Nintendo-oriented gaming fans.
"He followed up those successes with a more action-oriented spin on the genre, titled Mechstermination Force."
Being an independent game developer requires a lot of introspection and self-critique.
"When trying to figure out what comes next, you only have yourself to turn to."
I can sometimes miss working on things that are more widely discussed on more mainstream forums.
I've written a lot about how important indie games are to the gaming industry at large in 2021.
Where do you think the game industry would be today without the brilliant independent work of people like yourself?
And I often wish I could have been part of the industry in the SNES or PS1 era.
What would be your main piece of advice for a new independent developer in the industry?
Both the Gunman Clive series and Mechstermination Force would be classified as platformers of some sort.
It removed a lot of potential difficulties of a fully 3D environment both for the player and developers.
What is the process for an indie developer to get paid for their work?
Hörberg: I'm currently taking some extended time off and don't know when I'll start working on a new game.
"Others, including the vaccines from AstraZeneca and Russia's Sputnik V, have been approved for emergency use in several countries."
"Vaccines are being rolled out in many nations, but access to vaccines and vaccination rates vary widely around the world."
"The United States is sixth, with 3.6% of its population fully vaccinated, and 10.9% partially vaccinated."
"Encouraging news came this week from President Joe Biden, who has now secured enough vaccine doses to vaccinate all Americans."
"In many states, Black Americans have had fewer vaccinations than white Americans, in large part because of a lack of access."
"To help improve vaccination rates among all Americans, online platforms are cracking down on vaccine misinformation."
"We've now purchased enough vaccine supplies to vaccinate all Americans, Biden said."
"Once it begins, however, it will still take several months to vaccinate everyone."
It is also a major step toward identifying what factors might promote autism.
The number of ASD cases has skyrocketed over the last four decades.
"The scientists identified over 800 DNA methylation sites from a cohort of 26 men, half of which had fathered autistic children."
These sites have the potential to act as epigenetic biomarkers to quantify the risk of fathering a child with ASD.
The team plans to expand these findings by testing larger cohorts of men.
"It will not be perfectly curated or articulated, and there will certainly be punctuation problems."
"The issue in general is that a color needed to be added that was more severe, above Red."
"Throughout history purple has symbolized anything from power, wealth, royalty, divinity, to mystery, magic, and creativity."
"While it has been used to represent sadness, more times than not its connection is not to caution or threat."
"Three years from now, the whole world will work in violet."
"I keep thinking of Neil Young singing red mean run, son from the song Powderfinger."
"While stop signs indicate the opposite of run, they do have in common the sense of alert."
"By contrast, purple is often a calming, soothing color-not requiring immediate attention."
It is a color of inaction in this context and to define space.
"Instead of taking the obvious next step in the color wheel to purple, I propose above red should lead to maroon."
"The blood tone has a closer connection to red, but gives off a sense of deeper danger through its density in color."
"It does so because all colors are defined within a 'temperature' of either a warm, cool, or neutral tone."
"Red, yellow, green belong to the warm side; blue and purple cool; black and white neutral for example."
Yes there are some purple tones that can be considered to have a warmer tone.
All of this to say that the choice of purple is a simplification of the very complex nature of color and perception.
"This series looks back at those phenomena and what they told us about the Internet, and ourselves."
We begin with the saga of Justine Sacco and her infamous Africa AIDS tweet.
"As she later explained it, To me it was so insane of a comment for anyone to make."
I thought there was no way that anyone could possibly think it was literal.
As I put it in a Deadspin piece that next week:Sacco had logged off.
"Pop Culture Crossover: Inevitably, it became a joke on Family Guy."
But what we know in 2021 is that no one is your friend on social media.
"The goal, the old joke goes, is to avoid being Twitter's main character for the day."
But she has learned the ultimate lesson from her ordeal: Now she doesn't tweet at all.
May. He also writes a free weekly newsletter that you might enjoy.
"Coming home was supposed to feel like a trip down memory lane, not like a nightmare coming to fruition."
"Maybe I shouldn't have chosen to come back at night, Harper thought as her car slowly ambled down the dirt road."
Harper could remember how her mother had begged and pleaded with her husband to be able to use the color.
"It's too obnoxious, it draws attention, he had said."
Her mother turned her green eyes on him and that was the end of that conversation.
It was a look that got her mother anything she wanted; a look her father said was passed down to Harper.
"The next day, the yellow paint was being unloaded from their beat-up old Chevy."
"Now the paint was chipped in huge splotches making the building look as though it was diseased, on the verge of death."
The color drained from it just as it had from her mother.
Harper turned off the engine but left the headlights shining on the scene.
"The screen door flapped in the wind, creating rhythm-less music barely audible from the car."
"Shaking her head, she got out of the car grabbing empty boxes from the back seat."
"She'd start packing in the morning, tonight would be devoted to sleepless thoughts."
Harper trailed her fingers along a For Sale sign as she walked to the house.
It'd been two years since she'd been to this place.
"Turning towards the kitchen window, he ran a hand through his auburn hair."
"Air escaped his mouth in a rush, filling the silent room."
"Ever since they moved away to college, he'd been the one leaning on her."
Light from the grimy window made Matt look older than he was.
"Lines stood out around his mouth; lines of sadness, not remnants of smiles."
"Beyond him, Harper's eye caught on the spinning wings of the bumblebee lawn ornament."
"Her father's voice echoed in her head, drifted away as the bumblebee's wings moved again in a breeze."
"Dust marked spots on the wall where pictures used to hang, outlining empty memories no longer wanted."
Harper's fingers rubbed the smooth outline of a lighter in her pocket.
And being Matt's best friend entitled Harper to be the head cheerleader of each moment.
"Give her an M, give her an A, give her a T, and give her another T!"
"Matt smiled and Harper smiled back at him, the corners of her mouth straining from the effort."
They'd been best friends for so long that Harper had quit keeping track.
Now there wasn't a day Harper hadn't found him annoying or needy or clingy.
Matt followed her gaze to the box; after a moment he went to it.
His footsteps reverberated off the kitchen's floor and down the hall to her old bedroom.
"They were all smiling behind the bumblebee on the front lawn: her mom, her dad, and herself."
What it didn't show was her mom's cancer and her father crawling into the bottle shortly after she died.
"Harper pushed back her chair, scratching the legs against the wooden floor."
She wrenched the picture from Matt's hands and threw it against the wall next to his head.
Why can't you just hate me like the rest of them?
"It wasn't enough that he had to ruin my life, but he didn't have to take yours with him!"
"Harper's hands were balled into fists, raised and ready to fight, but Matt stood with his hands at his sides."
"One set full of hurt and rage, the other set with determination and love."
"His t-shirt smelled of dust, sweat, and Matt."
"Pressing her hands against his chest, she pushed, but he wouldn't let go."
"Harper's head collapsed into Matt's shoulder, tears leaking from her eyes slowly at first then steadily."
Her hands still softly placed on Matt's chest furled to clench his shirt.
"When the sobs started, they came violently, echoing off of every wall in the yellow house."
We all want to feel pride and a sense of satisfaction in the things we work hard for in life.
"Unfortunately, we can't all be succeeding at exactly the same time."
Sow your seeds into the universe and then let them go without looking back or second-guessing.
All you can really do is put yourself out into the world with the most sincere intentions possible.
Keep your expectations for what eventually comes back to you grounded in reality.
This is about more than just creating good karma or believing that what goes around comes around.
"When you clap for someone else, you are really clapping for yourself."
"When you respect someone else's achievements, you are also learning to respect your own."

This famous framework could sometimes lead to completely misleading and biased conclusions.
"In Design, there is a widely accepted framework called, Customer Personas or just Personas ."
Jorge is 35 years old and lives in Philadelphia with his dog and his mother.
He goes out every morning to grab a coffee and a blackberry muffin from his favorite place in West Philly.
"He likes technology, but he is not a person one would label as a geek ."
"He uses Whatsapp to communicate with his friends and family, because that is the most popular messaging platform for Latinxs."
Designers create dozens of personas and create detailed fictional stories about them.
"Does he read the news, or does he prefer checking his stocks while waiting for his coffee?"
"To be fair, it is also necessary to mention that these Personas are not created in a vacuum."
"Many times, this process creates the false impression that the participants are being entirely objective."
"They define the average Jorge in those sessions, normally in glass-walled rooms full of post-it notes."
"Most decisions about how Jorge behaves, looks and acts are made then by these people in the room."
What they do not take into account is that nobody is objective.
We have many unconscious biases that play a major role in how we perceive information being transmitted to us.
"Furthermore, the method is designed to consciously exclude all the non-Jorges."
Our unconscious biases and prejudices are modeled by the culture and the environment in which we were raised.
"I may have other biases, but certainly not the same as my local community."
The lack of representation on product teams created fantastic and infamous failures recently.
"Apparently, tech companies could only imagine a woman complying with those tasks."
"We cannot draw conclusions about the average Jorges in 10, 20 or 50 interviews."
Even more so considering that a great part of people's innermost and most personal details will remain unknown to the team.
"At this point, I thought that not applying this framework would be better."
"It is true, at the same time, that having a visible idea of our users is necessary when designing."
"A couple of years ago, I saw something that the company OXO had on one of their walls."
The jump to fame for this company was thanks to their famous potato peeler.
"You probably have already heard this story, but just in case, here it is again."
"Designing for average is designing for no one and in some cases, this generalization can even have tragic consequences."
"And most importantly, how do we avoid the downsides of the Personas framework?"
"Most likely, what works for the former would work for the latter as well."
This method would not base its studies on imaginary people created by a design team.
"They would be real people, with real names, real lives and real routines."
"I could imagine who was wearing the gloves, and in which circumstances."
I could even feel like I was a carpenter when I stared at one of the wood working gloves for a while.
The level of abstraction of each one of these elements is the key.
We vividly recall moments in which we saw that object and revive the feelings we had.
Is that persona making us feel anything when we read his story?
"Everything is pretty much assembled, so there's no opportunity for us to imagine anything different to what is there."
"Then, setting the broadest limits possible to allow abstraction to happen within loosely constrained boundaries."
I see some similarities between this and mindfulness that I would like to explore further.
"The Customer Persona method has, in my opinion, problems that can jeopardize its effectiveness when designing products."
The most important concept in Allen's book is what he calls the open loop.
"As he puts it, uncompleted tasks take up room in the mind, which limits clarity and focus."
It's that these things create a trail of unfinished tasks or unfinished psychological commitments.
"Of course, these are mostly small, and unimportant, matters."
"But Allen's point is that cumulatively, they can still wreck your ability to focus."
"They are really, really big, and not easily close-able."
"Once the plan is formed, Baumeister writes, the unconscious can stop nagging the conscious mind with reminders."
"Until a few months ago, we didn't know when or even that we would have effective vaccines."
Most of us still have no idea when we will be vaccinated.
And the arrival of new variants means that we don't know how effective the vaccines will be.
"Of course, if you don't think the virus is serious, or worth worrying about, this isn't a problem."
"All of these things are unfinished tasks nagging at our minds, stressing us out, sapping our attention and cognitive energy."
An emotional blindfold that stops you crafting theories about this new reality.
Its ever-shifting structure reminds us that we are absolutely not in control.
Remedy masterfully wields its world and story to apply a pressure that continues beyond the narrative's so-called ending.
"Questions go unanswered, and that desperate, much-needed release is cruelly denied."
It's absolutely unbearable - and makes the feeling of control a rare and precious commodity.
"Again and again and again, every object thrown is a catharsis in microcosm, a fleeting glimpse of that feeling of control."
"It makes the game a desperate joy to play, as you scramble to relieve that invisible pressure."
"Without those small resolutions, Control would drive you insane long before its end - and certainly would long, long after."
"Our houses are those lives, forever at threat from the chaos beyond."
"Like The Oldest House, the rules of life feel murky and unknown."
"The would-be walls of infinite grey are there, secretly forcing us down a path not always of our own choosing."
"Like Jesse's powers, each small act is a moment of escape from that indescribable tension."
Note how eager we are to relieve the burden of navigating the unnavigable by accepting direction from sources so alien and unknown.
"That similarity between Control and life makes it easy to understand how Jesse feels, despite such incredible circumstances."
"Symbology and dialogue from The Board aren't easy to grasp, leaving Jesse uncertain - and us doubly so."
"For us, Remedy are the Board: they dictate what we do, where we go."
"We don't understand the or whats or whys, and yet still fulfil Remedy's confusing edicts."
"The former's rule we understand, the latter's we absolutely don't."
And at the heart of that feeling lies a supreme confidence from Remedy.
"To know that what you offer is enough, and just enough, is true craftsmanship."
"In taking that risk, Control has created what can only be described as the gem of a generation."
"A game that's masterful in its vision and ambition, if not always in its execution."
"And in making a game that breaks that rule, Remedy has made something truly great at the expense of commercial success."
"Why, do you think, there was no note?She told him."
Bobby didn't like that answer and began to scour the apartment for clues.
"In his mind, everything had been going along as usual, fine in his estimation, just fine."
Bobby looked under the couch cushions but all he found was the remote.
"Bobby looked in the kitchen cabinets, the dishwasher, the refrigerator and the oven."
What was he hoping to find there?Bobby went into the bedroom and riffled through his dresser drawers.
"He stood in the bedroom blankly for a moment, remembering that day."
"Wondering, what possibly could have gone wrong?That was the big question he needed an answer to."
"Where did she go?He ran his fingers through his hair, across his three-day beard growth."
"His eyes, a bit bloodshot around the rims of their sleepy blue orbs, but what did you expect."
"It had been six days since she'd left, after all."
Bobby was handsome even when rough around the edges and he knew it.
"Jesus, who's bothering me at this hour, he said aloud to himself."
Like a one-way mirror that cops always use in TV shows.
"But not just any woman, he could tell, as he stepped a few inches closer."
"He could see she was leaning in now, too, knowing the precision of the viewing characteristics of the door."
She would have guessed he was watching her from the other side.
"Bobby took two steps back and stood staring at the door, watching her."
"All that was keeping them from each other was some hardwood, some metal framing and a little red paint."
"The paint, that is, the door in need of a new coat years ago."
"His gaze fell into the living room, scanning the table, the chairs, the couch."
"The couch she left him, the couch they used to snuggle together on to watch movies and eat ice cream."
Opened to a dog-eared page for someone not yet done reading.
"He shuffled quietly over to the center of the room, picked it up and read the title."
"He read the next, and the next and realized it was meant for him."
Sometimes a thing is in plain sight but we don't even notice it.
Bobby set the magazine back down on the coffee table and stared at it.
Like a stain that needed cleaning but was just as easily ignored.
"In case I miss out specifying the pronunciation for any Chinese character here, you can look it up at dict.youdao.com."
"Let us now take an in-depth look at radicals, the most fundamental building blocks of Chinese writing."
The above TL;DR may only serve you well after you've read the fascinating details below.
"This article does not require you to know about Chinese writing strokes, but does lead naturally to those basic building blocks."
They're called indexing because they're used by dictionaries to help users look up dictionary entries.
"Using that indexing radical, you can look up the character '初' in a current dictionary like 现代汉语词典."
"Let's take a closer, but quick, look at this curious exception."
"In a time gone by, before the advent of computer games, people may have considered dazzling jade pieces as worthwhile toys."
Some indexing radicals are related to more than 1 abbreviated radical each.
I mentioned that most of the indented entries in the Table of Radicals are what we should term as abbreviated radicals .
"In reality, indexing radicals morphed from Traditional radicals when China promulgated the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme in the 1950s."
"Here's another example of indexing radicals in action, but with a twist."
"Yes, but they're still radicals, just another kind!Improvised radicals,"
"Instead, they are mostly basic building strokes that build up semantically significant structures we call improvised radicals."
"But before we're dive into constructing Chinese characters, please have a quick read about Chinese Writing Strokes: Basic Building Blocks."
"At the end of her life, she had even forgotten how to eat."
"After she passed away, both sadness and fear seeped into my bones."
"I didn't want to lose my memories, to lose myself."
"That changed, though, when I came across Dr. Daniel Amen's books."
"According to Dr. Amen, low blood flow in the brain is the number one predictor of future memory problems."
"After all, our blood is what supplies our neurons with nutrients while cleaning out toxins."
"As people age and retire, they stop learning and lose contact with people."
"Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:When we're injured, our body's natural defenses come to our aid."
Nearby areas swell and warm as our immune system fights against bacteria.
"Over time, it can damage organs and contribute to a wide range of illnesses, including Alzheimer's and dementia."
"Though genetics can worsen your odds, they don't have the final say."
"We must remember that though our skulls are hard, our brain is not."
Health and beauty products with toxic ingredients that are absorbed through the skin.
"No matter what, we must be on the lookout, minimizing our exposure in whatever way we can."
"Without a doubt, anything that hurts your mind also hurts your brain."
"Otherwise, these conditions can increase your risk of brain fog, memory issues, and dementia."
"Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:When it comes to hormones, the key word is balance."
"For example, when thyroid activity is low, you could suffer depression, irritability, and brain fog."
"Both lead to increased inflammation, depression, Alzheimer's, hypertension, among others."
"Moreover, belly fat turns healthy forms of testosterone into unhealthy, cancer-promoting forms of estrogen."
Actions Dr. Amen suggests for reducing the risk:Sleep is necessary for brain health.
"According to research cited in Dr. Amen's book, our brains cleanse themselves during sleep."
"Moreover, chronic insomnia has been linked to an increased risk of death from any cause."
"After watching my great-grandmother lose her spark, I've learned the importance of caring for our brains."
"No matter what, we should:Remember: The battle for a healthy brain knows no age or gender."

How do I do this and make sure I'm not sharing a political opinion?
"With all the challenges of this school year, educators, myself included, are overwhelmed."
"During our whole-class discussion, I left my questions open-ended, so students would feel safe asking theirs."
"I told them that I, too, felt confused about what had transpired."
Teachers like me need meaningful resources and recurring supports to help identify students facing trauma and how to best support them.
I did not feel equipped with tangible resources and support for students facing traumatic events in the world around them.
I needed concrete strategies to support my students in times of crisis.
"To ensure such programs provide what educators need, they must be tied to a sustainable, recurring funding source."
This would provide school districts with the flexibility to offer high-quality SEL and trauma training to educators.
"As an educator, I know my students are watching me for clues on how we react to events around us."
Visualizing the decision trees can be really simple using a combination of scikit-learn and matplotlib.
"As always, we need to start by importing the required libraries."
"Then, we load the Iris data set from scikit-learn."
"We will also go over a regression example, but we will load the Boston housing data set for this later on."
"In this article, we focus purely on visualizing the decision trees."
Now that we have a fitted decision tree model and we can proceed to visualize the tree.
We start with the easiest approach - using the plot_tree function from scikit-learn.
"That is why we will skip it here, but you can find the implementation in the Notebook on GitHub."
"Having seen the old way of plotting the decision trees, let's jump right into the dtreeviz approach."
"The code snippet is pretty much self-explanatory, so we can move on to the outcome."
"This way, we can see how the classes are segregated by each split."
The small triangle with the value at the x-axis is the splitting point.
"In the first histogram, we can clearly see that all observations of the setosa class have petal length smaller than 2.45 cm."
"The leaf nodes are represented as pie charts, which show what fraction of the observations within the leaf belongs to which class."
"This way, we easily see which class is the majority one, so also the model's prediction."
One thing we do not see at this plot is the value of the Gini coefficient at each node.
Another handy feature of dtreeviz which improves the model's interpretability is path highlighting of a particular observation on the plot.
"This way, we clearly see which features contributed to the class prediction."
"Using the snippet below, we highlight the path of the first observation of the test set."
"The plot is very similar to the previous one, however, the orange highlight clearly shows which path the observation followed."
"Additionally, we can see the orange triangle at each of the histograms."
"In this case, only two features were used for predicting that the observation belongs to the versicolor class."
"Lastly, we can print the decisions used for this observation's prediction in plain English."
"This way, we can clearly see the conditions that this observation fulfills."
"We have already covered a classification example, which showed most of the interesting functionalities of the library."
"But for completeness' sake, we also go over an example of a regression problem, to show how the plots differ."
Let's dive into the differences between classification trees and regression ones.
"This time, instead of looking at histograms, we inspect scatterplots of the feature used for the split vs. the target."
We already showed that we can highlight the decision path for a certain observation.
We can take it a step further and only plot the nodes used for that prediction.
The following plot shows only the selected nodes from the tree above.
"In this article, I showed how to use the dtreeviz library for creating elegant and insightful visualizations of decision trees."
It is also worth mentioning that dtreeviz supports some visualizations for XGBoost and Spark MLlib trees.

"Artificial Intelligence is intelligence displayed by machines, which is not natural."
Machine Learning is the art of the study of algorithms that learn from examples and experiences.
Machine Learning algorithms are programmed to constantly be learning in a way that simulates as a virtual personal assistant.
Machine Learning is based on the idea that there exist some patterns in the data that were identified and used for future predictions.
Machine Learning gives the platform the ability to automate millions of decisions based on user activities.
Netflix recommends the same genre movies based on your activity using Machine Learning.
"This suggestion is the Netflix recommendation engine at work, it uses your past activity and returns movies."
"Netflix doesn't use recommendation methods, because recommendation engines don't allow for Personalization."
Machine Learning can create smart platforms because it uses probability to discover the likelihood of a user liking a product.
"If you previously liked romance movies, your feed will have preview images of scenes with actors embracing each other."
The depth of the model is represented by the number of layers in the model.
"For instance, the Google LeNet model for image recognition counts 22 layers."
"In Deep Learning, the learning phase is done through an Artificial Neural Network ."
The Neural network is an architecture where the layers are stacked on top of each other.
The design of the Neural Network is inspired by the biological neural network of the human brain.
The most popular real-world example of Deep Learning is AlphaGo.
"AlphaGo has its neural network, it has sharp intellect and intuition."
AlphaGo created quite a stir when it defeated multiple world-renowned masters of the game.
The machine could grasp complex techniques and abstract aspects of the game.
Another example of Deep Learning that we use daily is a Mobile Camera.
"In every smartphone, the camera can predict a person's age, gender."
"These are all developed using Convolutional Neural Network, a class of Deep Neural Networks."
"Artificial Intelligence vs Machine LearningMost of our smartphone, daily devices, and even the internet uses Artificial Intelligence."
Artificial Intelligence is the science of training machines to perform human tasks.
Machine Learning is a distinct subset of Artificial Intelligence that trains a machine on how to learn.
Machine Learning models look for patterns in data and try to conclude.
"In a nutshell, the machine doesn't need to be explicitly programmed by people."
The programmer gives some examples and the machine is going to learn what to do from those samples.
"Machine Learning and Deep Learning functions similarly, but their capabilities are different."
"Machine Learning models progressively become better and better at whatever their function is, still they need some guidance."
"If an ML algorithm returns an inaccurate prediction, then an engineer has to step in and make adjustments."
Let's go back to the flashlight example described in Machine Learning.
"If the flashlight is programmed using Deep Learning algorithms, then it should turn on with words like I can't see etc."
Deep Learning models can learn through their method of computing - a technique that makes it seem like it has its brain.
Types of Artificial IntelligenceReactive AI MachineThis is the oldest form of AI.
Limited Memory AI MachineThese machines are capable of learning from historical data to make decisions.
"Nearly, all existing AI applications we know today come under this category."
This is the type of AI that the doomsayers of the technology are cautious of.
"The development of Self-aware can boost our progress rapidly, but it can also lead to a catastrophe."
The AI would also be capable of having ideas like self-preservation which may directly or indirectly be an end for humanity.
This refers to AI systems that can only perform a specific task autonomously using human-like capabilities.
"These machines do nothing more than what they are programmed to do, thus have a very limited or narrow range of capabilities."
Most of the complex AI that uses ML and DL that teaches itself falls under this category.2.
This AI will make AI systems just as capable as humans by replicating our multi-functional capabilities.
"While having such powerful machines is appealing, these machines may also threaten our existence or at least our way of life."
These systems correspond to the Self-aware AI.Powerful examples of AI in use todayOpenAI has come up with a breakthrough language generator GPT-3
"Different features of GPT-3 are,Like every other system, there are disadvantages too."
Some of the use cases of GPT-3 in action can be seen here.
"Future of AIToday, approximately 52% of users around the world use AI-powered technologies."
Even the most sophisticated AI technologies lack factors like Emotional Intelligence and the ability to contextualize information like human-beings.
This is the reason why AI has not succeeded in taking over a major aspect of our careers and lives.
"Therefore, infusing emotions into AI is the next milestone technologists wish to accomplish."
It can recognize the emotions of oneself and others and guide using our thought processes and behavior.
"Although AI is a technology created to assist humans and help them, it still lacks a cognitive quotient."
"How the integration of EI with AI is beneficial?In several aspects of our lives, AI has made our lives simpler."
Machines and robots are already used in the manufacturing and production departments of various companies.
The aim of AI in any field shouldn't be to replace humans but should make their jobs easier.
"We tend to live in a bubble, with races, religions, cultures, habits we encountered while growing up."
"It helps us evolve and grow as people, as cliché as it may be."
We are consequently exposed to different views on lives than our own.
"And the more we get exposed, the more compassionate we become."
"More compassionate we are, kinder we become, and instantly more compelling and irresistible to others."
"Less inclined to get bothered by small, irrelevant things, because we've experienced something greater."
The realization starts to sink in that we are only 1 individual amongst 7.8 billion people.
"There are people in the world, that exist now, in this moment, we haven't even met yet."
"You may yet have to meet your perfect partner, your closest friends, your companion in life."
"We see the struggles others face, but also the moments they enjoy."
"But all these moments, they make for the most intimate memories."
"They belong to only the people we shared them with, they connect us."
"It's true, we touch people's lives without even realising it."
"Maybe some haven't had a possibility to travel, and meeting us, foreigners, means a great deal to them."
Travellers with good intentions can have an utmost positive effect on people around them.
"The places we see might be beautiful, but it's the people that make it special and memorable."
Cost Measurement can be one of the more bewildering aspects of the online advertising industry.
"CPA, CPI, CPE, CPC, CPM, eCPM, and so forth."
And all of the different costing methods are calculated differently and used in different situations.
We will also look at how we can compare the performance of different cost measurements using eCPM or Effective Cost per Mille.
"Cost per Mille is the cost that an advertiser would pay per 1,000 page views."
We'll cover eCPM later and go over a few examples of its calculation.
"This kind of cost measurement is extremely common, and its name is rather self-explanatory."
It's the cost to the advertiser divided by the number of clicks received.
"If an advertiser pays $10,000 and receives 5,000 clicks, then his CPC would be calculated like this."
"CPA is a cost measurement based on the acquisition, rather than on a per-view or per-click basis."
Many advertisers are significantly more comfortable with this kind of cost basis and it is the default for affiliate marketing.
"Models which aren't guaranteed to drive installs, even if money is spent."
So the action is only completed when the user actually opens the app.
"In general online advertising, it is the cost per engagement with an AD."
"In this case, CPE is the cost per engagement with the ad."
"As mobile advertising continues to take off, it is important to understand another form of Cost per Engagement."
CPE is likely the most nebulous and difficult to understand of the various cost measurements.
One of the reasons that it can be so difficult to understand is the fact that what Engagement means can vary by case.
This is because mobile advertising engagement is defined by an event that occurs after an application is installed.
"Paying by engagement, at its base level, is a way to go even further with performance advertising."
"Let's take a look at when one would use CPE.Take an app, for example."
The rest either forget about it or uninstalled it shortly after installation.
"Any user that got past registration or initial setup would be considered engaged, and that's what the developer would pay for."
So our CPE in this case would be $16.67.Different cost measurements are used for different situations and to meet different goals.
So these mobile-focused businesses are much happier to use something performance-based like Cost per Install or Cost per Engagement.
"That way, their risk is mitigated, and they only pay for users that actually download and test the app."
"These performance metrics are often used on the demand side, where the advertiser is concerned exclusively with the result."
"Publishers, on the other hand, are only concerned with the revenue generated per page view or per ad served."
They're just too difficult to compare because they use different pricing methods.
Example 1 CPI to eCPMLet's say an app is being advertised on a CPI basis.
"Say, the app was installed 100 times at a CPI of $5, and 500,000 people saw the ad itself."
Say the measurement of engagement is an in-app purchase after a mobile application is installed.
Because eCPM is the most accurate way to look at the real revenue generated by traffic.
How the ad is being paid for further up the line isn't consequential to the publisher.
He just wants to see what he is getting paid per thousand views he draws.
"For a publisher, this second campaign would be significantly more profitable."
"Conversion flow and its relation to cost is rather logical, at least once understood."
Conversion Flow is simply the number of steps that have to be completed before an ad counts as converting.
"For example, the Conversion Flow for a CPI campaign would go View >"
"So keep in mind that the longer the conversion flow, the high the cost per conversion in a performance-based campaign."
Now you should have a pretty good understanding of the basic terminology used in describing cost in online advertising.
The different measurements of cost form a considerable part of the online advertising vocabulary.
So a deep understanding of them is necessary if you want to understand what's going on.
"I am a freelancer since 2016, working mostly in digital marketing."
"During those years, I went through many ups and downs in my work efficiency."
It ended up sitting each morning for up to 40 minutes filling all the data.
"Time-tracking is a must-have to all freelancers, in my opinion."
"The majority of us working from home, and it's easy to get lost without that data."
"There are various free apps to track the time, e.g., most popular, Clockify."
The connection of clear spreadsheets and time-tracking creates a great organizational system to develop work.
"For me, two hours after waking up determine the productivity of the day."
The days where I waste the morning are pretty normal until I realize that.
"Then I start running, trying to recover from wasted time, thinking that the day will be bad anyway."
"As a result, I'm overwhelmed by tasks and duties, which leads to unnecessary anxiety, stress, and procrastination."
It requires developing systems and routines to stay on the right track.
"I also recommend challenging yourself from time to time, e.g., trying to reach 50 productive hours in a given week."
"It's quite important because, as a freelancer, we often don't have the outside motivation to push forward."
Knowing how to deal with geographic data is a must-have for a data scientist.
"At one point in the competition, we wanted to visualize the data points and overlay them on San Antonio's map."
"All we had were a street number and a street name - no zip code, no latitude, nor longitude."
We found a great API by MapQuest that will give us exactly what we needed.
"With just a sprinkle of Python code, we were able to accomplish our goal."
Just scroll down to the bottom tab on over to the Data Catalog 2019.
Download the file by clicking on the link to the Excel file.
Head on over to and create an account to get a free API key.
Copy the 'Consumer Key' and keep it in a safe place.
Let's do something about it:Below are two functions that call the API and returns geo data.
Don't forget to replace the '#####' with your own API key.
This is the weird world a certain group of people called synesthetes live in.
Synesthesia is a condition where the brain mixes up the senses- and one sensory modality causes a simultaneous stimulation of another.
"For example, a person with synesthesia may hear color or see sound."
Some forms of synesthesia encompass more than two senses at the same time.
"In theory, there can be as many synaesthetic experiences as there are possible combinations of sensory or perceptual experiences."
"Remarkably, people have reported synaesthetic experiences that involve pattern recognition, spatial orientation, or emotions in response to certain stimuli."
One unique thing about the synaesthetic experience is that it is specific to each person.
The unique variations in the synaesthetic experiences make it somewhat difficult to study.
"For years, scientists have sought to understand the neural mechanisms responsible for this incredible experience."
New research is seeking to dissect the phenomenon to the core to help us learn how our brains work.
"However, studies have confirmed that the phenomenon is biological, automatic, and unlearned; distinct from both hallucination and metaphor."
"Modern behavioral, brain-imaging and molecular tools continue to provide new frontiers in uncovering the mechanisms that drive the synaesthetic experience."
A good starting point is to understand how the human brain is organized to achieve basic roles of perception and cognition.
The human brain is divided into specific regions that interpret different stimuli.
But there is evidence that the cross-talk between various sensory pathways accounts for the experience.
The explanation is that the two different regions in the brain were wired to interact directly.
"This means that when a synaesthete experiences stimuli along one cognitive pathway, another pathway activates as well causing an involuntary sensory experience."
They are therefore considered pathologic and should not be confused with true synesthesia.
They must be uncomfortable having their alternative senses triggered by the most minute stimuli.
"Don't they experience a sensory overload?Well, most synesthetes assert that the condition is not a problem for them."
They report that the alternative sensations are experienced deep within the mind's eye and therefore it isn't a cause for concern.
"All in all, synaesthetes treasure their unique abilities and consider it a bonus sense-"
"For them, it feels like that's what normal experience is like."
To have that taken away would make them feel like they were being deprived of one sense.
"From a medical perspective, despite being referred to as a neurological condition by some neurologists, synesthesia is not a disease."
"In fact, synesthetes normally perform better in memory tests than average persons and tend to be more creative."
"For example, seeing colors when hearing musical notes can help to achieve the perfect pitch."
"Once thought to be uncommon, synesthesia is now estimated to be very common."
"Furthermore, many forms of synesthesia are continually being identified signifying how prevalent the experience might be."
This is comparable to the presence of a tail- during human embryonic development - which regresses after some time to become the coccyx.
The difference with synaesthesia is that it has actually been conserved in part of the human population.
"A paper published in PLoS Biology explores how this may have occurred, and the possible implications on human evolution."
"One explanation for its conservation would be that synesthesia is a hereditary genetic trait, rather than an abnormality or mutation."
"Though its genetic basis hasn't been proven, synesthesia appears to run in families."
"The new paper points out that synesthesia has some benefits in terms of sensory processing and in particular, memory."
The number of subtle differences that make us so unique is quite remarkable.
Traits like synesthesia provide a canvas to push the boundaries and explore the mind from a magnificent perspective.
"Our species, Homo sapiens, descended from primates, yet we have evolved so much."
"Just compare the DNA sequences of humans and apes and observe where we diverged, right?"
Gene dimmers that have been positively selected are the ones that researchers want to study.
"This data was gathered using a technique called ChIP-sequencing, which lets us observe the interactions between protein and DNA."
"Additionally, HAR1 was found to encode a completely new type of RNA, which could have contributed to making us unique."
This brings us to an incredibly important question: why should we care?
"Well, what these researchers have done lets scientists finally observe differences in gene regulation between humans and related species."
This means that we can finally discover the true answer to what makes us so different.
"Additionally, it may help us improve our understanding of evolution as a whole."
"Tomas and Elena come shuffling down, wondering if they're in trouble."
"Aleks wanders in from the kitchen, where he has been making dinner."
"There's white flour on his cute nose, and he's wearing his World's Best Dad apron."
He hands Gaby a glass of white wine and takes a sip himself.
He goes back to the kitchen and retrieves two hot cocoas spiked with espresso for Elena and Tomas.
Elena and Tomas sip their delectable treat and giggle at each other's chocolate mustaches.
"When you're 6 and 4 years old, so many little things are amusing."
"Aleks picks up where Gaby leaves off, turning to their young children, We tell you never to keep secrets from us."
"When these things started happening to us that we didn't understand, we didn't know what to do."
"I mean, to be able to just pick up and fly ourselves to Paris or New York City?"
"She sits between their kids, wrapping one arm around each of them."
It's time to show Gram our wings and see what she thinks.
"Also, I visited a healer last week - Gram is knocking loudly at the door."
"She immediately notices the furrow of his eyebrows, the clouds in his chocolatey eyes."
"When he doesn't reply, she asks, What's for dinner?"
"I made paella for us, but we have something to discuss first."
"He looks at her worriedly, hoping she won't call them crazy and do something like take the kids for the night."
He and Gabriella discussed all their options and agreed it's time to confide in her mom.
"It's crisp with a tinge of sweetness and a bit of bitterness, too."
After Gaby recounts the hot summer day she poured the water on her head and saw into new realms where fairies adorned trees.
My grandmother told me about this when I was a little girl.
"As soon as Gaby hears these words, she feels an intense wave of relief, acceptance, and love."
"This is the 19th part of a series of stories about the family of Gabriella, Aleks, Tomas, and Elena."
Exploration is a riskier approach that emerges from experiments and it is focused on delivering ground-breaking and disruptive innovation.
This is how DesignOps can become the most impactful enabler for organisational ambidexterity and it can drive innovation at scale.
One of the UX designer's responsibilities is to conduct a design review meeting.
"Apart from dealing with high-level requests, I needed to conduct this type of meeting."
"After many failures, I built for myself a workflow that helped me."
Let's review some tips from my experience that can help you feel comfortable in these meetings.
What is a design review?Design review is a meeting where the designer shows the team one or more solutions for a challenge.
"In this meeting, the team gives him feedback and agrees on the solution before developing it."
"If you can get an answer without conduct a design review, do it."
"In case you have a question for the developers, please ask them, don't run a design review for it."
I prefer to build a presentation and organize there all the information I want to share.
WhyThis first part of the presentation is a slide that explains to the participants: why we do this meeting.
We do this meeting to review the user story 101 and make decisions about it.
This meeting will help us close the design part before we conduct a usability test and move it to develop .2.
What we review in the meetingIt is essential to let the participants know what you plan to review with them.
"If you perform a good investigation and show it clearly, the decision-making will be much easier and faster."
"Try to use visual content as possible, like images or videos.5."
"SolutionsIn this part, you will show the solutions for that challenge."
"The most effective way to communicate this part is by using prototypes, videos, and images."
"Apart from a video and the prototype, you can also use images to explain your solution."
Next stepsShort slide that closes the design review and shows the next steps you think are necessary to do.
"You are here to discuss, agree with the team, and generate shared understanding between all the team members."
Today the designer is not the only person that designs the product.
"Of course, the design is your responsibility, but the developers, the product manager, and the QA team have opinions."
They can give you great ideas and cover some topics you didn't think about.
"Record the meetingIf you do an online meeting, you can record it."
The video can help you to remember what the team talked about.
Pro-tip: You can watch the video at 1.5 x speed so that you will review it faster.
"Nobody wants to summarize the meeting, and as the meeting leader, you will need to take ownership of it."
Use the notes you write during the meeting and create a small summary.
The summary is critical because nobody will remember what you discuss or what you agreed during the meeting.
"Right after the meeting, write the summary and sent it to the participants."
"One afternoon in social studies class, while rocking my chair back and forth, I finally lost my balance."
"Thunk was the sound my head made as it smashed against the wall, and everything went black."
My teacher and a few of my fellow students were looking down at me with concern as I was shaking off the cobwebs.
"Oh thank god, said Mrs. Martin, her eyes wide and alarmed."
"You looked like you were out for a while, said Mrs. Martin."
"Mrs. Martin reached down to grab my hand, and as she pulled, I untangled myself from the desk chair."
"I think that the fall you had in school contributed to you developing your mental illness, she'd said."
I knew that some of the other kids were talking and spreading rumors about me.
"Some would furtively stare in my direction, giggle, and then turn away when our eyes met."
Others didn't care if I caught them gawking directly at me; they'd just point their fingers and laugh harder.
I'd respond to the ridicule by bowing my head forward and slinking away from their immediate purview.
"But when he became absorbed in his pack, he became a dog, barking and snapping."
I was standing a few feet away from David's pack when I heard him utter my name.
"Instead of slinking away from David and his crew, I took a step in his direction and listened."
"I braced myself for the question, spinning potential retorts to the question inside of my mind."
"I turned to face David, shrugged my shoulders and said, I don't know."
"Actually, I don't really care one way or the other."
"David raised his chin in the air, smiled wickedly and said, You know you're lying Eze."
"We should have had a more functional relationship, but he was a self-hating punk."
I just come here because my parents say that I have too.
His eyes widened in surprise as he retreated to his group of friends.
"My heart was beating hard against my chest and my forehead was perspiring, signals of onrushing anxiety."
"Apart from being accosted by bullies and fake friends, I enjoyed school."
It was too bad that some of the other kids made going to school a difficult experience.
"Anyway, I learned some valuable lessons in handling these types of confrontations."
But as more days flew by I became more sure that I was indeed the object of this bully's derisive comments.
I girded myself for what I was certain to come as I walked down the hallway.
"Get it over with Eze, I thought as I sidled up closer until I was only a few feet away."
"Two weeks later, the manger arranged a gathering of departmental - we were data entry operators - employees at a nearby restaurant."
My co-workers had insisted that I sit directly across the table from the manager.
She was well dressed in a crème white sweater and beige slacks.
"The other employees talked amongst each other, while seeming to shun me on purpose."
I knew from her intonation of her voice that she intended for her comment to be an insult.
"The cacophony of voices swelled, becoming louder and more discordant with each passing second."
I knew right then that I was no longer safe amongst these people.
"So without a word I just stood up and fled from the restaurant, and then things began to fall apart."
"Just put your hands inside of your pockets, said the man, as he approached."
"He shoved his two hands into his pockets in order to demonstrate, as if I needed some sort of instruction."
"Perhaps the man, noticing my hands and head exposed to the unforgiving elements, was looking out for my well-being."
"I heard him, but I deliberately kept my hands pinned against my sides as I stepped past the stranger."
"For he was a part of the conspiracy, an adult sized David who'd sought out to manipulate me psychologically."
David was trying get me act in a way that would be pleasing to him and his people.
"He wanted to be amused, wanted to point and cackle at me as I was being hauled away by the police."
Everyone seemed to pointing their fingers at me and gossiping the next day.
"I'd enter a place, feel dozens of pairs eyes burrow holes into all parts of my body."
"At night, I went into an eatery to order a coffee."
"He's going to have that coffee to go, said the voice."
"I went home, slid down my bedroom wall as I collapsed onto the floor."
My world became smaller because I didn't want to hear anyone's voice any more.
"The voices harassed and harangued me until the cops smashed the door open, their weapons drawn."
"One of the cops stepped to the forefront and said, Put your hands up!"
"I'm on a path now, and will not be dissuaded from that path by any kind of negative voice."
An Evidence Based Discussion Forum was created as a good-faith space for conversations about vaccines.
"On Sunday, however, the group was named by CNN Business in a story about misleading vaccine information on Facebook."
"The story was later updated, and it no longer mentions Vaccine Talk."
But the community has since changed its name to exclude the line a forum for both pro- and anti-vaxxers.
"I'm concerned that Facebook could misinterpret what we're about, Bilowitz said."
"That misinterpretation, she fears, could result in the shuttering of responsible forums where Facebook users can ask questions about vaccine science."
"At the other, staunch anti-vax groups and pages are actively mobilizing users into real-world acts of opposition."
It's unclear whether Facebook's own vaccine guidelines are capable of navigating these nuances.
This ethos is reflected in the group Pregnant and Nursing Women - Covid-19 Vaccine.
Boosting confidence in the efficacy of vaccines is critical to ongoing coronavirus response efforts.
"Legacies of medical racism committed against Black and Indigenous communities, for example, can contribute to lower vaccination rates."
"Often, people go online instead of talking to their doctor because of the cost of health care in this country."
"I'm not envious of Facebook's position of how to handle that, Koltai added."
"Empowerment of moderators is where Facebook lags quite a bit, DiResta said."
Some still decide to wait and we respect and protect their choice within the group.
"Some moderators are more focused on addressing anti-vax propaganda, for example."
"All of this accounts for roughly an hour of work per day, per person."
"The private group counts more than 1,600 members, and is run by a team of six moderators and admins."
"We have a zero-tolerance rule for anyone posting false information or pseudoscience, Karen told OneZero."
"If we see anyone asking for what we think is medical advice, we tell them to call their doctor."
The danger is: At what point is it too much moderation?
"Though Covid-19 vaccines have proven to be overwhelmingly safe, some reactions are normal and expected."
That's why it's so important to keep the false information out.
"The team has listed untested, Bill Gates, and Trump as flagged keywords, for example."
The tool allows moderators to track and delete problematic content more easily.
"Every post that gets submitted we approve or reject, said Bilowitz."
We don't want to be deplatformed for false information in the group.
"Bilowitz said that medical professionals also contribute to Vaccine Talk, adding their knowledge to group discussions."
"We feel the group is pretty distributed the way real life is, Bilowitz said."
"A majority are pro, followed by on the fence, followed by anti as the minority."
"Engaging with them and addressing their concerns is a really, really important thing for health advocacy."
Facebook did not immediately respond to OneZero's request for comment about the moderation of gray area vaccine topics.
Both Nizzero and Bilowitz say that some Facebook product changes would make moderating their groups easier.
"For one, they wish that Facebook would verify the credentials of groups and users presenting themselves as medical professionals."
"In the meantime, Nizzero and other group admins are doing their best to keep their forums science-based but empathetic."
"In a Monday announcement to the group, Nizzero addressed a viral claim that a woman had miscarried after receiving the coronavirus vaccine."
"The narrative has since been debunked as anti-vax propaganda, but the group had received numerous submissions about the trending story."
This is what allows us to have a rational view of causality and make informed decisions.
"Before I even met him, my roommate dubbed Ian Mr. Perfect."
My ridiculously kind and patient roommate spent an hour helping me pick out the perfect outfit.
"I straightened my hair, put on my best date night makeup, and made sure to pack extra gum in my purse."
"He drove a bright red Mustang, which seemed like the absolute perfect ride for a drive-in movie."
"As he guided us expertly through the Atlanta traffic, we had some wonderfully stimulating conversation."
"By the time we pulled into the Starlite Drive-In, I was already imagining what we'd name our kids."
I plucked the grapes from the basket and he opened a bag of popcorn.
"We settled in as the previews began, and I kept hoping he would put his arm around me."
"I really didn't care to see, but that was fine."
"I was there to find a connection with Ian, not to focus on a silly movie."
"I'd been happily chatting away about my research with the CDC, which Ian had asked me about with genuine interest."
"The movie had started, but we'd turned the sound down a bit low so we could still talk."
"I'd asked him a question about his own work, and he'd been silent for awhile."
"When I looked over at him, I realized I was wrong on both counts."
"He'd really been Mr. Perfect up until that point, and I wanted to keep that image alive."
"Surely he hadn't meant to drift off, right?I went with option three."
"Slowly, I inched my way over to his side of the car."
"His head was tilted, and a thin string of drool was dripping onto his shoulder."
"With as much delicacy as I could, I nudged him with my elbow."
"I tried again, this time putting a bit more force into my nudge."
"With resignation, I pointed my finger and poked him right in the chest."
"A poke like that would surely have woken me up, but, yet again, Ian didn't budge."
"At that point I was becoming rather concerned, so I held a finger under his nose to check his breathing."
"Yep, he was still there, but completely blocked off from the world."
"He'd driven me there, and I didn't think Ubers would be readily available on the outskirts of town."
"So, I spent the next two hours eating all of his snacks and watching a movie I really didn't enjoy."
What had started off as an incredible night was turning into one of the most unfortunate dates I'd ever been on.
"Ian was still asleep as the superhero finally overcame the villain, and the credits were about to start rolling."
"He looked at me with confusion at first, then his eyes cleared."
"Of course, and seriously, I didn't mean to sleep through our whole date, really!"
His Mr. Perfect image was really ruined by all the drool I'd seen him drip onto his own shoulder.
"I wasn't feeling very conversational anymore, so he didn't speak again until he stopped in front of my apartment building."
"I don't know, I said, feeling more tired than anything else."
"But more importantly, she is half-naked and the sun is pounding forcefully on her tan, glowing skin."
"All of this, this, stuff, it's distracting me!"
"The mountains, the man-made waterfall, the sky, and YOU."
That's when he jumps into the river in his blue jeans.
But she doesn't scream anything and she doesn't jump in.
"But people, other people, will still end up doing whatever is they want to do."
"Hi, he mutters as if it took everything in him to speak that two-letter word."
"That's not what I meant, she says and then swims away."
The kind of alone that he once prayed to get out of.
The kind of alone that he thought he was safe from once in a relationship.
The reality is we are often here wondering if we should be there and pissed off that we remain nowhere in particular.
Maybe she needs to focus on discovering herself before she embarks on a journey with another.
"The pandemic effectively put the world on hold, prompting the need for proper health precautions."
"If you're like me, you were probably very scared and anxious during that time."
"I stayed home a lot, and I finished my second semester of school online."
"However, I often found myself distracted, whether it be binging Netflix shows or just spending too much time browsing social media."
"As time passed though, I've found certain methods that have allowed me to pursue my passions with diligence."
I'd like to share some of my most effective tips today.
"This one may be the least controversial here, as it is rather cliché."
"Some students may find it difficult to start their schoolwork, and this is usually because they lack interest in the subject."
"So, step one in this process is to identify a subject or topic in which you are passionate about."
Step two is to explore this interest by finding different ways to develop it.
The reason why I am actually writing on Medium today is because I followed that second step.
"In searching for ways to build and develop my interest in math, I stumbled upon this amazing platform."
"Ever since, I've felt that my time has been used in a more productive manner."
These terms were researched and popularized by professor Carol Dweck from Stanford University.
"Essentially, a person with a fixed mindset is someone who believes that one's qualities are set in stone."
"On the other hand, somebody with a growth mindset believes that one's qualities can change over time."
These are the people who actively seek feedback and try again and again when confronted with failure.
The key to achieving this requires the understanding of only two words: right now.
"For example, if you did poorly on a math test, you may think, Man."
"Instead, just append the two key words to the end of that phrase."
"Now, you will be more inclined to work towards your goal of mastering the topics for the next math test!"
"After adopting this mindset, you will find that it easier to get started and work for extended periods of time."
"Eventually, you may even realize that you do not have enough hours in the day to do your work!"
"To learn more about the importance of the growth mindset, consider watching either of the two TED talks below."
"This tip may be specific to certain people, but it has worked wonders for me in the past."
"By moving around right before I need to work, I often feel more energized and determined to complete the task at hand."
You do not have to do any extensive full-body workouts.
"In fact, all I really do is some stretching, a few light exercises, and a quick walk."
"If you would like to get some inspiration, I've written a rough outline of my routine below."
Albert's Motivation RoutineYour routine does not have to be the same as mine.
"In fact, it probably won't be given that I have shadow boxing on mine."
The key is to get moving and to get your body ready for the difficult work that you are about to do.
"It helps you stay organized by listing exactly what needs to be completed, while also providing a motivational boost."
"For schoolwork, this is usually covered with learning websites that list your assignments and assessments for a given day."
"Therefore, the checklist you create can be more geared towards your activities outside of school."
I recommend writing the tasks out in order of when you're going to complete them.
"As you start working, check off each individual task when you finish it."
The process of becoming more productive is not simple by any means.
"I am still working on it, but I have seen changes that I never thought I would ever see."
"Although it has been hard, I must say that I've thoroughly enjoyed the process."
Seeing the amount of work I have been able to complete on certain days truly astonishes me.
"But, I know that there is still more to go to reach my most passionate and productive self."
"Until I have reached that state, I will never stop learning about ways to surpass my current mindset."
"Hello you lovely people, this is part of my friendly freelance guide to taxes."
"Alright, enough dilly-dallying, let's get into it."
These concepts are central to understanding who you file taxes with and how much you will need to pay.
Your state's Department of Revenue is the state government agency responsible for collecting taxes from state residents.
Your tax filing software or accountant will file your state tax return with the Department of Revenue.
Here's a list of state government websites from the IRS.Your filing status will depend on your personal circumstances.
It's responsible for collecting taxes from taxpayers like you and me.
Freelancers are normally self-employed and will typically pay self-employment tax and federal income tax to the IRS.
We'll report that income on a Form 1040 and attached schedules.
An itemized deduction means you can itemize legitimate costs and deduct them from the federal income tax that you owe.
"QBI is only applied to federal income taxes, it does not apply to self-employment taxes or state income taxes."
The federal standard deduction is a set amount that you can deduct from your income when you're calculating your federal income tax.
Note that the standard deduction does not affect the amount of self-employment tax that you will pay.
"You can choose to either take the standard deduction or itemize your deductions on your tax return, not both."
You would take your overall income and deduct this amount to calculate your total state income taxes that are due.
"These extensions extend the deadline for filing your tax return by six months, to October 15."
"In almost all cases, extensions will be accepted by the IRS and your state."
Forms to extend state filing times do vary from state to state.
"Note that you will still owe interest on taxes from April 15, even if you file an extension."
You will need to file a separate extension with the IRS and your state.
These terms will help you understand the taxes you will need to pay.
Federal income tax is a tax you pay to the federal government on all of your income including your freelancer earnings.
"Federal income tax is charged in bands, depending on how much you earn."
"Most freelancers will pay tax at a 10%, and then a 12% rate."
"The three main types of taxes a freelance business will need to pay are federal, self-employment, and state taxes."
"These taxes vary between states, and are out of the scope of this guide."
This is a tax that self-employed freelancers pay to the IRS on the profits made by our businesses.
Self-employment tax goes towards paying for Social Security and Medicare.
State income tax is a tax you pay to your state government on all of your income and earnings.
"It is reported to your state's Department of Revenue, and the forms used for filing do vary by state."
These terms will help you understand the various tax forms you use to report your freelance and other income.
Your federal tax return lists all of your income from all sources in the previous calendar year.
"Income from your freelance business will normally be reported on a Schedule C, which is filed along with your 1040."
Form 1040-ES is a form you use to calculate and pay estimated taxes.
"It captures the income you receive when people pay you via debit card, credit card, and other means."
You will receive a copy of the 1099-NEC that you can send to your accountant or enter into your tax filing software.
A business gets your information to file a 1099-NEC from a W9 form that you will complete and send to them on request.
"You may also need to file a W-9 with freelancing platforms, or marketplaces where you sell freelance products or services."
"Your state tax return lists all of your income from all sources in the previous calendar year, including your freelance business."
The state tax return is used to calculate your state income tax.
"But if someone had asked me this question then, I would've flatly answered No."
"This can vary from month to month, so it appears freelancing is a bit unstable and risky."
"However, this is only true for when you're just starting out."
"At that point, freelancing actually becomes less risky than being a full time employee of a single employer."
"This is because at any given time, freelancers can work simultaneously with multiple clients."
"If any of these clients leave you, you always have others to lean on for some time."
"When working full time, if you lose your job, you also lose your sole source of income."
"And in many cases, it might be more stressful to get a new one."
But most people only consider this freedom in terms of lifestyle benefits.
"That is, freedom to work anywhere, at any time when you like."
You also get the freedom to work on the things you want and the areas you want to focus on.
"While freelancing, you can choose the projects you want to work on according to the expertise you want to build."
"I did a few mobile app projects, but eventually decided to focus on the Web with the Angular framework."
"With a freelancing career, you're a regular visitor of freelance platforms and job boards to get work."
"Freelancing also offers you the freedom to set your own salary, so to speak."
You're not restricted by the market rate - just by your own unique level of expertise.
So it is quite common in freelancing to see professionals charging more for their services than full time employees.
"Also, you can charge different rates for different types of services - based on the expertise it requires."
I know what you're thinking - all of the above sounds good and all.
"Wouldn't that leave you sort of stagnant when freelancing?Well, not necessarily."
But you can also start scaling your work by converting it into an agency.
You can start by hiring or working with more people and developing a team of professionals.
A big advantage you get when freelancing for a while is that you've already built a solid client base.
This can be something highly technical or even just a digital learning product such as a PDF or video explaining something.
"So as you can see, freelancing can be much more rewarding than simply giving you a different way to earn a living."
The biggest advantage of being a freelancer is the freedom it gives you to develop your career as you want.
What I've given you above is just a snapshot of the possibilities.
"Several of them, including Leigh Bardugo's Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom, I read for the second time."
"Like morning breath following the cheap cigar of late-evening vices, her stench clings to your palette."
"Her thick scent manifests from your pores, still swollen from the night before."
"The taste haunts your senses, but you can't even say her name."
"A moment in time, her memory never forgotten, now sewn into your very being."
"Your body sustenance for a succubus, cuisine for a night nymph."
"A vapor of vanity feeds, abandoning the carcass after her fill."
Wasting away; your leftover substance like a dead gazelle before the queen of kings.
Her cravings drive her hunt; lotus-eating woman turned carnivorous beast.
"Though you didn't know it, she carried your bones to her den, dropping them in darkness."
After the coarse clasp of her sensuous lips came the fluttering of her hand.
"A blade glistened in the moonlight, then your body grew cold."
"The taste of her rancid mouth - blood-stained teeth, washed only by fresher meat."
"Your spoils now spoiled, your metal turned rust, your soul discarded by the Lioness of Dusk."
"The room now serves as our breakfast room, which we eat while seated around what was once John Wayne's card table."
"Or perhaps, it's just as enchanting now as it was then, only it's us who have changed."
"At this very table, John Wayne and his cohorts would sit, playing Gin Rummy into the early morning hours."
"Even in the 1950s, they knew the value of getting away from it all."
Rumor has it they chose this place because it was off the beaten path.
"Still today, you have to travel down a long, pitted, and uneven dirt road to reach the abode."
"Over the years, this area of southern Arizona has become dotted with wineries and distilleries."
"Once abandoned buildings are cleaned up, turned into craft beer hotspots and antique shops."
"But the thing I hope never changes is the miles of rolling hills, blanketed in tall windswept grass."
"Jeff and Nisa are only the third owners of this land, which was the first cattle ranch in Arizona."
"This place simultaneously feels like something out of a magazine, and like home."
"Breakfast is incredible, given to us by the land and curated by our host."
The eggs are from the chickens who live in spacious coops outside my bedroom window.
The fruits and vegetables on my plate were in the ground yesterday.
"We have a full day planned, but part of my soul yearns to stay right here and soak it all in."
"In the evening, we return and learn the true meaning of the term golden hour ."
"The sky is on fire, bathing the wild landscape in a lush amber."
"It bounces off the smooth hills, sending radiant light echoing back up to the heavens."
The adobe walls of the old ranch house seem to glow with the knowledge of long-hidden secrets.
"His head is up, observing the brilliance of the sunset and how it transforms every piece of earth it touches."
"Then the burning sky softens into a deep purple, and we go our separate ways for the night."
"I sit with my traveling companions around a table outside, our voices hushed to not disturb the quiet of the night."
"There's no moon tonight, and the stars are out in all their glory."
"Our conversation drifts off from time to time, and we all seem to enjoy being in each other's company without words."
There's no need to fill the silence with conversation - the chirping of the cicadas does that for us.
"Instead, we sit with our heads laid back, taking in the landscape above."
"Not because of ancient heritage or a ritualistic blessing, but because of the ongoing relationship that is nourished here each day."
Those who live here honor the land by being faithful to the way of life it demands.
"The sun loves the grass, the plants, the hills, the vapor in the air."
"And each, in turn, loves to provide for those who trod its paths of solitude."
"This place is the living reminder that when you give love freely, love returns to you threefold."
That love may take the form of fresh food and beautiful sunsets.
I see it in the easy smiles of its owners and taste it in the food.
"It can't be easy, caring for this land the way it needs."
The premise is simple as well; rap battle against many opponents so that you can kiss your girlfriend.
"As players load into the tutorial, most will recognize the connection to Dance Dance Revolution."
"When they eventually overlap, the player must press the respective directional key through WASD or the arrow keys."
"Very simple, something that most people either have experience with or can understand easily."
"Unfortunately, what makes arcade games like DDR fun for most people does not translate well to a keyboard and mouse environment."
The enjoyment from DDR and more physical rhythm games comes with moving your body along to the music and dancing.
"When the only interaction the player has with the game is a keypad, that enjoyment gets diluted."
"Thus to make up for this fundamental lack of feedback, FNF takes a page out of Guitar Hero's book."
"Player motivation is tied towards contributing to the music rather than any high score, emphasized by the lack of any other motivators."
"The score is barely noticeable, reserved to a white text field at the bottom of the screen."
"There is no combo meter, no flashy animations when your timing is perfect."
There isn't even a grading system at the end of each level to tell you how well you did.
"It also adds a human element that normal instruments wouldn't have, perfect for the rap battle nature of the game."
"The first opponent, Dad, starts you off with breezy, light instrumentals to hum along to."
"Pico, the official Newgrounds mascot, brings hard-hitting and bass-heavy beats to rap over."
"They're not the most intellectual or emotional, but don't need to be in the first place."
"In line with the rap battle nature of the game, most tracks are of a call-and-response style."
"Your opponent sings, complementary with the arrows needed to play it, then you sing it back with some slight differences."
"Players can observe the rhythm pattern, making it a little less unexpected when they eventually have to sing themselves."
The game also happens to be quite lenient on you making mistakes.
Most of the motivation to play comes from wanting to keep the music going rather than avoiding failure.
But just because it's easy to get into doesn't make it easy.
"Rhythm patterns become more complex and come at you faster, twisting your fingers and confusing your brain."
"Dozens of arrows are strung together in a single passage, forcing you to move on instinct alone to keep going."
"Instead, it encourages players to jump right back in and try to get a little farther than last time."
The game never expands past the basic tap and hold gameplay either.
The developers are working on more levels and even plan to do a full release on Steam and Nintendo Switch soon.
The tech industry now seeks to fill that void through AI friends.
"Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum would create an early version of a chatbot in the mid-1960s, called ELIZA."
"Humans had easily developed attachments to a machine, in part because their minds had anthropomorphized it."
"Even at this early phase, humanity's astounding ability to project their own views onto a synthetic construct became clear."
"In 2015, a man, Roman Mazurenko, was killed by a hit-and-run driver while visiting Moscow."
"As publicity grew, Kuyda turned the business towards creating companion chatbots."
"People talked to it about the day they were having, about their views, about insecurities, etc."
"Created as a therapy bot, Replika AI's sympathetic responses made some humans to develop feelings for their virtual companions."
"By 2020, approximately forty percent of the app's regular monthly users viewed it as a romantic partner."
Replika AI uses OpenAI's GPT-3 autoregressive language model to learn from previous interactions.
The autoregressive system of Replika AI allows it to adapt to the user's conversational patterns while being used.
"In April 2020, during the first wave of Covid-19 in the US, the monthly download number spiked to 500 000."

This AI Has Sparked A Budding Friendship With 2.5 Million People in Forbes.
He strode across the room and placed a few gold coins on the bar.
"His clear voice penetrated the souls of all those present, his generosity doing little to allay their fears."
"Adam Tucker sat in his usual corner, unsure what to make of the newcomer and his largesse."
"The gentleman had not come to sample the rum, or to enjoy the company."
"He knew, as surely as he knew his own name, that he was looking into the eyes of The Devil."
"Tucker had long known that he would one day meet The Devil, and that day had come."
"It was a lame joke and it betrayed his nervousness, his fear even,"
"Oh, we were always destined to meet, to become friends even."
"Do my work, The Devil's work, and I will keep you from Hell."
How many damned souls had he sent to The Devil just to save his own?
"He knew every pirate's trick, ruse, and hiding place."
There is nothing more humiliating than hearing your own name uttered with contempt.
"Tucker stood, walked to the cabin door and opened it slightly."
"Nobody around, and he knew The Devil's voice had been heard by him alone."
"Old Jim was at the wheel, guiding the ship through the night."
"The storm blew up before the glass was turned, as Tucker had known it would."
On the first gust the masthead swung over the ink black water.
They are very clear that the goal is to 'assist' pilots rather than 'replace' them.
"On Tuesday, January 26th, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence met, recommending not to ban AI for such applications."
"In fact, Vice Chairman Robert Work stated that AI could make fewer mistakes than human counterparts."
"Unlike visible nuclear enrichment facilities and material restrictions, AI development is much less visible and thus nearly impossible to police."
"Further, the same AI advancements used to transform smart cities can easily be utilized to increase the effectiveness of military systems."
"Whether seen as a deterrence model or fueling a security dilemma, the reality is that the AI arms race has already begun."
We must define the circumstances where such systems can be used and where they cannot.
The first step in this task is to curate thousands of training images to teach the AI what to look for.
The resulting ATR is being trained to recognize both tanks and school busses as threat targets.
It does not make sense to ban AI weapons systems as they are already here.
My internship at a Data Science startup really humbled me and showed me how long the journey really is.
So I had to turn to other sources where I could meet my financial needs.
I put up an advertisement on Fiverr.com offering Freelance Data Science services on Python.
It wasn't something very challenging or something I had never done before.
"But by mid-December, I was approached for a big and very challenging project which really captured my interest."
The task was completely alien to me as I didn't know where to begin.
I decided to go with Financial Modelling Prep as their documentation was pretty easy and user friendly.
"But with time, all challenges were met and the client was more than satisfied with the progress on the product."
"Having experience with Python, I used Django for the backend of my application and Angular for the front end."
"I, for one, believe that not only is it a good source of income, but also an excellent learning medium."
"At the end of the day, It depends on the individual and his goals."
"Five Years Ago, Richard Branson invited me and my wife to spend 4 days on his private island."
That decision lasted exactly as long as it took to tell my wife about it.
"Necker Island beckoned, but it wasn't all going to be fun and games."
But that wasn't altruistic - in many ways it was a selfish way to feed my own startup addiction.
"As many as 10,000 people would sit and listen to what I had to say."
"My very first recorded call was with Megan, founder of Foxie."
"I learned to ask smarter questions, listen more carefully, and home in more accurately on the true nature of their problem."
That they were able to resonate with the advice as if they were the ones sitting across from me.
"I think it's a powerful experience, but I want you to find out for yourself."
Today I'm releasing the first two episodes of the That Will Never Work Podcast.
I'll say right up front that this podcast isn't for everyone.
"You will be impressed by the commitment, the courage and the creativity of the entrepreneurs I speak with."
"Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is used to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral."
"In this type of sentiment analysis, we analyze whether the sentence is subjective or objective in its composure."
"In a subjective sentence, the customers can write about their view towards a particular product or a company."
While objectivity is about stating facts without emotions which can be neutral or non-neutral to sentiments or emotions.
This sentence may be stating a fact but also contains negative emotions.
This analysis is used to identify whether the sentence has some sentiment or not.
"And if it is there, then we need to analyze that emotion belongs to a positive, negative, or neutral state."
"In some cases, a person can share their opinion without emotions."
Fine-grained:When you have clearly analyzed the sentiments then you can use this type to determine intensity.
"The sentences are broken into phrases, each phrase is analyzed by connecting with competitors."
"Through this, one can also see who is talking about which product and why is their behaviour like this."
It involves calculating the sentiment from the semantic orientation of words or phrases that occur in a text.
"The aspect of the local context of a word is usually taken into consideration, such as negation."
"Example: This room is not good. , which has positive words but negative sentiment."
"This type of sentiment analysis aims to detect emotions, like happiness, frustration, anger, sadness, and so on."
One of the disadvantages of using lexicons People have their own unique ways to express dissatisfaction.
The analysis looks at individual mentions or aggregates for sources or trends.
"When you are tracking as the customer service, then you need to consider each mention."
Example: The Loan Facility is good but the facility for a credit card is not that great.
We can clearly deduce which facility here is having positive and which one a negative sentiment.
"Where customer behavior can be related to demographics, transactions, and emotional profiles."
And the same kind of service can be offered to people matching the profile.
Brand MonitoringBrands or companies can monitor their mention on social media and determine the emotions customer has for them.
Public RelationsMany companies use sentiment analysis to help them develop and refine their public relations strategy.
By running sentiment analysis on their customer care data the company may know about how they are performing and how they can improve.
"For example, companies can use sentiment analysis to identify sales leads and spot industry trends."
"The reviews can give them insight into customer sentiment or emotion for the product, by their tone."
"Data MiningSentiment analysis can also be used for gathering competitive intelligence or data mining, about competitor companies and brands."
This is an excellent way to gain a competitive edge in the marketplace which is quite good to have.
Political AnalysisNew policies in politics and the reactions of people to them can be seen by sentiment analysis on Twitter for them.
Opposition parties can also see trends of opposition or support of people to new laws and can make agendas for their own party.
"ConclusionIn today's competitive world if a company wants to grow, sentiments are to be taken into consideration."
"Without this growth, reputition, or winning a competition seems harder."
If you want to grow get insights and analytics into your competition or your own product through sentiment analysis.

The Dark Tower is a one-hour private virtual escape room experience from Fantasy Escape Games.
"The experience can accommodate up to seven people, and occurs via a Zoom video call."
The gameplay of this room is one of the more unique ones I've encountered in an online escape room experience.
"From the outset, this experience feels as much like a fun roleplaying game as it does an escape room."
The puzzles themselves were thematically appropriate for the magical story world in which The Dark Tower takes place.
"Unlimited hints are at players' disposal, with the game master providing in-character guidance when prompted."
Players would do well to bring a notepad and pencil with them to write down important discoveries.
"The Dark Tower's brightly-colored, whimsical artwork is a hallmark of the experience and instantly adds to its charm."
"His characters were lively and expressive, and he maintained the same energy with admirable persistence."
It bucks the traditional escape room style with its character interaction-heavy approach and emphasis on storytelling over puzzles.
They take advantage of the digital format to successfully do what in-person experiences cannot - bring magic to life.
"To learn more about Fantasy Escape Games, you can check out their website, Facebook, and Instagram."
Book The Dark Tower here for $15 - $16.50 per person.
"The February bill is ready, an email tells me, noting that $156.46 is overdue."
Samuel Johnson described second marriage as the truimph of hope over experience.
I'm a journalist and that I've just published an article about Verizon.
Marie in Alabama doesn't put me on hold as she searches all the Verizon data bases.
"Marie in Alabama can only refund $149, the actual price less tax."
"As much as Marie in Alabama would be happy to just give me the credit, Verizon has to have safeguards."
Imagine if every customer service rep handed out a $149 credit to everyone who called.
"I try to find out just how large Verizon's customer-support force is, but it's not easy."
"More recently, thanks to COVID, most reps apparently now work at home."
"They make $12 to 16 an hour, according to Salary.com."
"At some point in time, in a conference room somewhere, someone is making these so-called customer support policies."
Someone else is writing a training manual and a script for reps to parrot.
I didn't bother to Google customer service at Verizon when I first wrote about this.
It compares the profile of the contemporary profitable business corporation to that of a clinically diagnosed psychopath.
R programming language is powerful when it comes to analyse and quickly visualise data.
"I explore daily statistics for trending YouTube videos, and you can find this data set from this link."
"Moreover, you can also find my Kaggle notebook regarding this work from this link."
"The more a video has likes, the more it has comments."
"Time of day is very important in broadcasting, so in video streaming nowadays."
That is why it is crucial to check when a video has appeared.
Above graph represents the percentages of likes based on time of day.
"Most used tags are video and music, 32 and 19 times respectively."
"In this graph, I only checked Great Britain's data set, so the English tags have been processed and visualised."
"It is important to know that if you are dealing with other languages, then you need to be careful about encoding."
"If you want to check my R code, then you can see my Kaggle notebook for this work."
Your ideas will never change the world unless you are willing to act on them.
We'd read case studies arguing how X educational theory was wrong and traumatized students.
"I'd raise my hand and say, Ok, I get that X is the wrong way to do this."
Sitting on the sidelines discussing strategy and mindset only works if you eventually play.
And I suspect many people will take issue with it because it is the inverse of what society expects.
"Go make money at a business, then get serious about planning it."
"Instead of spending a decade planning the next great American novel, just start writing it."
"You'll find that most people can't execute, and most people don't try."
But how many people get off the couch to put their plans into motion?No one cares about your philosophy.
I'm sorry to hear they've gone bust because they over expanded.
They have a loyal customer base waiting to get back in line in Brooklyn.
I'm not sure exactly when I knew that my then-partner no longer felt that sense of belonging with me.
"I have loved well, and I accept that not every relationship is meant to last."
"Of course, what we could have been together was only a dream, a vision for what life might have looked like."
I am a person of many interests with no intention of giving up anything I enjoy in my life.
"I didn't want to belong to someone else, but I did want to belong with someone else."
I feel there's a common misconception in relationships that we are meant to belong to another person.
You'll find this paradigm in the I can't live without you section of romance.
"Relationships should involve an element of dependence, but healthy relationships are interdependent, not codependent."
"In interdependent relationships, we don't need to be together; we choose to be together."
We maintain our individual identities while also having a strong sense of togetherness as a couple.
We still belong to ourselves while choosing to partner another person who belongs to themselves.
"The love doesn't subtract from our happiness, goals, or our sense of self-possession."
"As a person who grew up in a dysfunctional family system, I have struggled with codependence, particularly in my early relationships."
"By the time I was truly aware of the pattern, I had hit my 30s and filed for divorce."
"I wanted to belong, to be chosen, and to be loved."
I wanted to build a future with someone who didn't need me but wanted me.
I never wanted anyone to give up a single thing about themselves; I simply wanted to be there for the journey.
"I think sometimes, You could have remained yours - and mine, too."
"There was a sense of belonging there, too, of the family we could choose."
But we don't belong with those who don't choose us.
We maintain our separate identities and our belonging at the same time.
I am still deconstructing this dream and sometimes cursing my elaborate vision.
Taking it apart feels like destroying something heaven-sent and holy.
"Even when we're looking to build healthy, interdependent relationships, it's important to monitor ourselves for red flags of codependence."
"But for the life of me, I do not find technical writing particularly glamourous."
I can't help but feel that I'm not compelled to write technical content because it terrifies me.
"Perhaps, it might unravel deep-seated thoughts of me not being cut out for this world of Data Science."
Communication at all fronts is paramount to becoming an indispensable Data Scientist.
"With that being said, I've decided to actually take my own advice."
"Before we get it cracking, let's explore what is meant by Big Data ."
Plugging this loosely defined term into Google generates a whole host of varying definitions.
"Nowadays, leveraging data for insights seems to be the top priority for companies seeking to gain a competitive edge."
"Data Scientists are the individuals tasked with making sense of all this noise, generating actionable insights from complex datasets."
"Great, this brings us up to speed with the premise of this piece."
It is also compatible with multiple visualizations allowing interactive exploration of big data.
SQLite3 is a module that has been included in the Python Library since Python 2.5.
"Opening Jupyter Notebook, I began by importing all the relevant libraries for this assignment."
"Prior to loading, I had performed some rudimentary data cleaning on Excel achieving a more streamlined look."
The data was then converted into a CSV format for quicker processing on Jupyter.
Data Cleaning is 70% of the battle and you don't want to know what this dataset looked like beforehand.
Running the first line of code above creates a connection object in the default directory to store the data.
"Using the sql_read function, we can now read the data and write queries to the database."
Now you can really play about with it and write some more complex queries.
"Here, I am aiming to return all the columns on LinkedIn posts that garnered more than 500 comments ."
"I'd then like to display the Top 15 results, ordering these from biggest to smallest."
Sex is cool and all but have you ever closed all your search tabs after finishing a project.
"Ayyy, not bad for a first crack at technical writing - and not as scary as I anticipated."
"On the job front, I've been shortlisted for the final two."
GoFAR profiles our members in a variety of ways to showcase their diversity of work and interests.
"I remember taking it out to the backyard, getting to look at Saturn for the first time, and being blown away."
"You could say, at that point, I was destined to become an astrophysicist."
I didn't know it was possible to be an astrophysicist until I went to college.
I was the first person in my family to go to college and had some amazing mentors along the way.
"For astrophysics research, I think of myself as a star detective."
"I collect pieces of information using telescopes, both on the ground and in space."
"I collect those pieces of information and try to understand the stories of stars, specifically stars in binary systems."
"And those two stars, when they're close enough to one another, can influence each other's lives."
Their existence is fundamentally changed by the fact that they are in this pair.
Ones that have mass that transfers from one star to the other.
I'm also expanding on a research program where we're trying to understand why it's magnetically active.
"As a GoFA member, I'm interested in crossing the interdisciplinary between art and science."
If we all thought the same we wouldn't be able to ask new questions and come up with new ideas.
"It's about sexual orientation, heritage, and race and ethnicity, and all of these things."
"In my own self-actualization, I realized I can choose to make a different choice."
"I can choose a different story, different metaphors, and a different way to narrate my work."
"In doing so, choosing stories that are generative and are about connection and community."
But something happens in late high school or college where that interest dwindles or is squashed for girls.
My education proposal is to develop a creativity curriculum that's embedded in introductory physics.
That was the inspiration point for this creativity curriculum and my interactions with Janani and creating our installation theatre piece.
"Last year, a report came out of the American Institute of Physics called the TEAM UP report."
They were looking at the dramatic underrepresentation of black students in undergraduate physics and what we could potentially do about this.
"The proportion of students of color, especially black students, has actually decreased in the last 20 years."
We need to do something and we need to do it now.
"That maybe one day, at conferences, people can give a joint presentation."
"When I think about my work, my science is possible because of some deep collaborations."
There's this premise in science about a first author - a single person that's responsible for the project coming to fruition.
I would love for a keynote to be something that is shared.
The current model requires that a single person be given the literal space and voice to share their result with the world.
"She returned to her Colorado College, her alma mater, as faculty in 2016."
Dr. Gosnell's research uses both ground- and space-based telescopes to explore the stories of binary star systems.
Bahji Steele is currently a sophomore attending the California School of the Arts.
"She is a curious, outgoing, and intuitive person who enjoys learning about different arts and the cultures that accompany them."
"Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to work a creative job."
"For me, writing means that I am able to express myself creatively."
It's also an opportunity to educate and entertain people and to give back to the world.
"Although many journalists have stressful, hectic lives, I also imagine that they feel immense fulfillment."
I don't care about selling another product and increasing the profits of a company.
"Given the current circumstances, I am of course incredibly grateful for this work experience."
It will most definitely help me to find a job after graduation.
"The truth is I don't see myself in a regular 9-5, chained to a desk."
I want to wake up and be excited about what's to come on that particular day.
A job that perhaps even has the ability to make the world a better place.
"And I don't think that's crazy or irrational, even though many people pretend that it is."
"Considering that human beings spend about one-third of their lives at work, you better work a job you like."
So it's not just enough to be given a paycheck at the end of the month.
Does that mean you are going to get along and be good parents?
That is why I can't work a job that is unfulfilling for me.
I already struggle with depression and I don't need to make it worse by choosing to work a boring office job.
So pursuing a creative career is a means of protecting my mental health.
"Essentially, it would be self-harm if I chose a career that would make me miserable."
You might even work fewer hours and make more money as a creative than you would as an employee of a company.
"In her latest freelance report, Zulie Rane stated she made 7.763,53$ in January and only worked 65 hours."
"Of course, that is not going to happen in your first few months of being a freelancer or creative."
"However, it goes on to show what is possible if you finally listen to your heart and follow your desires."
Don't exchange your sanity and happiness for being able to pay your bills.
"In every state of the nation, there is a standardized test that rarely gets noticed."
"And yet, in many states, these tests are given six times each year and cost taxpayers millions of dollars.¹"
"By the time a student graduates, these tests take up two months of instructional time.²"
"With such claims, what parent, educator, or policymaker wouldn't approve of such a test."
But first appearances may be deceitful; the MAP test is all show and no go.
The MAP test tabulates an individual student's growth rate compared to a normed rate of growth nationwide for similar students.
But rates of change are not necessarily a good indicator of educational quality.
Knowing that a student did worse or better than a student in Georgia tells me nothing about that particular student's needs.
"For example, recent MAP score results from students on hybrid and distance learning merely reflect those students who have had home support."
Some families have even paid tutors to advance their child beyond the grade-level curriculum.
The high rate of growth these children's MAP scores do not reflect what is happening in school.
Comparing such a child with a child whose family cannot afford extra tutoring is inaccurate and unethical.
Another extenuating factor is the possibility of students working at a much higher level than their grade designation.
"Chances are, very little if any.³ Therefore, growth will be limited."
"The resulting data is merely an indicator of environmental constraints upon teaching and learning, not on the students' abilities."
"Just as formative standardized exams such as the SBAC are flawed, so are MAP scores when used in this manner."
"For this reason, MAP testing does not lead to instructional change."
The study found no impacts of MAP on student reading achievement or teachers' use of differentiated instructional practices.⁴
Let's take a look at the definition of a standardized test.
The MAP test selects questions from a bank of common questions within its program.
Test takers are all required to answer the questions in the same way.
"The questions are mostly multiple-choice, which only allows one correct answer, and therefore scored in a standard manner."
"In addition, NWEA states that MAP tests are not harmful high stakes tests."
Let's take a look at the definition of high stakes testing.
"With the designation of high stakes consequences, all the adverse effects of high stakes testing occur."
Test makers themselves will admit that their tests are not designed to diagnose learning.
Portfolios are a much more meaningful and impactful assessment method for they involve the students and the parents on a more personal level.
Such portfolios can provide rich and valuable resources to drive personalized instruction.
"If we want schools to be accountable for children's learning, we need to offer accurate measures of growth.¹¹"
"Furthermore, when the teacher's and student's focus becomes raising the test score, all other goals are subsumed."
"As Campbell's Law¹³ dictates, what is on the test is what is important and valued."
"To illustrate this point, I will use myself as an example."
"On the other hand, my GRE verbal reasoning score was well above the 70th percentile."
I have consistently scored high on standardized exams in this area throughout my student life.
"No doubt, I can acquire such types of knowledge and skills rapidly."
I can either describe myself as deficient and a slow learner or a student with exceptional abilities and intelligence.
That brings me to my point; we are not all equal.
"We do not have equal abilities, and students do not all have equal abilities."
That does not mean that we forgo excellence in schools or that we leave some students behind.
"By recognizing the unique qualities of individual students, we allow for all children to achieve success."
"Yes, we all need a minimum level of reading and math proficiency, but that is not the aim of MAP testing."
The MAP test may be an efficient method of acquiring sets of data to quantify learning.
"Still, by using this type of tool, educators falsely convince themselves that such devices are reliable, accurate, and useful."
"The ubiquity of the test deters criticism, but districts across the nation continue to use and misuse MAP data without critical scrutiny."
A new perspective is needed now more than ever to expose the damages that such tests do to education.
"If you agree there are too many tests, please sign the petition to suspend high stakes testing this year."
Have you ever heard the team Shadow Work and wondered what it meant?
"It is a term that is often thrown around in the universe but not fully understood, or practiced beneficially."
"In your shadow, you store different events, memories and moments, thoughts, and feelings."
"Your shadow contains things you do not want others to see, and things you do not want yourself to see."
"Many of us choose to avoid doing shadow work, just like attending therapy to work through our mental health."
"At least, that's what their ego would like them to believe."
"The deeper you dig into your shadow, the more areas, messages, and triggers will surface."
You will begin to find that there are years and years of shame-based messages to work through.
"Our shadows have grown from the shame put on by others, or the shame you have internalized and brought into your life."
Internal conflict can be anything from a voice in your head telling you that you are not good enough.
It can cause you to get into the same patterns of self-destruction over and over again.
Your fears tend to step inside of you and block you from embracing your shadow and from seeing your shadow.
This also can cause trouble when it comes to managing your mental health.
Doing shadow work can help you get to a place of self-love and acceptance.
"If you are not sure where to start or how to recognize your shadow, I would suggest taking the Enneagram Test."
"The enneagram test can help you learn what your desires, your fears, and internal conflict are."
You can take the Enneagram Test Here and do not forget to share with us what Type you are!
Find what you love and let it kill you .I have discovered that life's physical possessions do not provide happiness.
"Growing, learning and being mindful to others is ultimately what makes you come alive."
It hasn't been easy this past year but pursuing my dream is a reality and a joy.
"While Covid has certainly changed everyone's expectations, don't let it alter your dreams."
It has provided an environment where we can feel safe and secure in our surroundings while creating memories.
"Living on a Catamaran sounds very glamorous, which it definitely is."
"Here we have more than survived through our love, our patience and our empathy."
"Letting go of the shore has enabled us to successfully reinvented ourselves, becoming truer, better versions."
"But in doing so has unexpectedly brought us many new friends, new experiences, new cultures and a great new language."
We have been challenged by nature's perverse sense of humour and grown in ways we never could have imagined.
"Speaking of that growth, yes I am a different woman and I am grateful."
I say:When Covid hit Spain we were quickly amongst the worst-hit of countries.
"Fortunately, we managed to escape to Croatia and, in turn, the worst of Covid restrictions."
Coming back to Spain and reconnecting to the world has been easy thanks to our relative isolation onboard.
"For us, this is all about being out in nature with other like-minded athletes."
"But truthfully, I look forward to the day that I can connect to those loved ones in person again."
If I've learnt anything from this year then it has to be to invest in people.
"When it comes down to the basics and everything else is falling down around you, your people are what truly matter."
And it's these people who have asked what do you do during the day?
"My brain is always active - writing stories, staying in touch and creating new dreams."
Saying no to many things that in the past we wouldn't have thought twice about.
We do not have the luxury of a car; our bikes are paid for and double as transport and fun.
"And no matter how bad the weather is out at sea, this is our home and where we stay."
"Looking ahead, we are making plans to return to wonderful Croatia starting 23 March."
"With friends like Sergio, we have more than been looked after."
Reflecting on our journey so far and ultimately I have learnt so much about myself and Kevin.
"Oh, and more than that, let's not forget humility."
"In the beginning, I was gung ho, chasing freedom and adventure."
I found I was more than ready to adapt to a little consistency and routine that comes from being tied to the land.
"Is Croatia the end goal that I am looking forward to, or the voyage itself?"
One year has passed and another will be over before we know it.
"We have visited five countries and travelled 2408 NMs, sharing our journey through my blog."
What has shocked me most though is the number of people that have read my blogs along the way.
"How Social Media Disrupts Our Elections, Our Economy, and Our Health - and How We Must Adapt."
"On January 6, misinformation propagated on social media helped motivate a crowd to attempt an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol."
"On Jan. 23, social media was instrumental in driving tens of thousands of Russians into city streets to protest the Putin regime."
"In the past, social media has occasionally impinged on real-world events, as with the Arab Spring a decade ago."
But now the online power of crowds is crossing over into the real world as never before.
About $140 billion in equity value was wiped out in a matter of minutes.
"Pump-and-dump schemes also used social media, posting fake news on Facebook and Twitter to hype stocks."
The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday it is reviewing the recent volatility in GameStop and other stocks.
Not nearly enough is known about the perverse incentives and feedback loops driving these market movements.
"But many others just held up their cellphones, recording videos as if they were strolling through Disneyland."
FundsAnd what role has been played by hedge funds standing to profit from the dizzying price increase?
"It's coupled with systems that sense, mine, analyze and trade on sentiment expressed on social media in real time."
"Dataminr, RavenPack and other companies are constantly sifting through social media data to find the signal in the noise."
"If investment decisions are completely unmoored from the economic realities of the companies involved, the potential for destructive volatility rises."
The results of the SEC's GameStop review cannot come fast enough.
The Legend of Zelda series is one of the most loved series in all of video gaming.
I was instantly drawn to the gold Game Boy Advance SP on display in the window.
It was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.
"The twist in this title is that by wearing the titular Minish Cap, Link can shrink to a miniature size."
"The world itself, while by no means the biggest in a Zelda game, is packed with interesting people and locations."
Coming in 2 halves you have one side and you need to search out the character who had the other piece.
It's an excellent but under-appreciated entry into the series.
I played it again last year on the Wii U virtual console and it holds up really well.
"So many of us want to break into the tech industry, but don't know where or how to start."
"I don't know exactly how I'd do it, but,"
"That text came from then CMU student Matt Spettel, a friend who Madonna had met during his high school years."
DeltaTrainer came to life when Gabe was starting his junior year at MIT.
"The response was good, and so they started building the app."
"The impetus for the pivot was, what are people asking for now that they have some baseline product?"
"Madonna elaborated: If you never pivot, then you're probably just too married to your original idea."
"It doesn't have to be a billion dollar idea, but just try it."
"Try to get them to buy something that you want to make for them, because it doesn't happen on its own."
What's it been like working with a close friend as a business partner and co-founder?
It's like going from being friends with someone to marrying them - it's just so different.
"I had never even done a project with him at this point, since we hadn't gone to the same school."
"At the end of the day, it's a relationship, and it's all about communication."
"In the end, he decided to finish his degree, and he's glad he did."
"Just like starting a startup, going to school is a really unique opportunity, so you should probably just finish it out."
"Our Final ThoughtsSince Gabe and Matt went full-time, DeltaTrainer has been rapidly growing."
"The user base is doubling every month, in no small part due to gyms closing nationwide."
"Every startup has a unique story, and DeltaTrainer is no exception."
"That being said, we found some takeaways from Gabe's story that we think could help anyone with an idea."
"Gabe's biggest refrain was to start working on a project now, and iron out the details once you've started."
"The week I found out I was pregnant, I drove to Target."
I thought of several atrocities that would result in me having a miscarriage.
I thought about a world in which I or the tiny embryo inside me no longer existed.
"The more terrible I felt, the more I cried and wanted to cease existing."
"In those first weeks, I would teeter between despair and ambiguity."
"Now it was the burden of responsibility, the burden of motherhood."
"In those first weeks of my pregnancy, I mourned the life I was losing."
The CDC estimates that 1 in 10 women experience postpartum or prenatal depression.
"These are just the women that report it, we know that for many, seeking help isn't an option."
"If these thoughts were happening at just 12 weeks pregnant, I feared what would happen after I delivered."
I broke up with my OB right after my 20-week anatomy scan.
It's an hour-long sonogram where all sorts of measurements are taken.
"After getting the all-clear, I decided I would transfer my care to midwifery."
"But the truth is, my husband and I toured the birthing center in February 2019."
I didn't pursue it because I thought my OB would be the safer option.
"I was midway through my pregnancy, and the anxiety attacks were growing exponentially."
"During prenatal care with my OB, things were quickly changing due to the pandemic."
I was calling the hospital to figure out how to adjust my birth plan weekly.
Each visit to the OB would cause me more distress and anxiety.
I wasn't only given an impersonal survey to gauge my unhappiness.
I was directly asked what fears I had and if I wanted to discuss them.
"I nervously looked at my husband, who was allowed to be with me."
"It's a leading fear among first-time pregnant women, but still, I felt shame."
"Wait, what?It was a simple statement, but it stuck with me for my entire pregnancy, labor, and delivery."
"When we stub our toes and feel pain, that's something that happens to us."
"Pain is a part of the plan, and the body is prepared for it."
It was my job to prepare my mind for it as well.
But it is no question that women are bombarded with negative birth images.
"Picture someone in the birthing room in any movie, what is the woman doing?"
"I'll admit before I was pregnant, I thought laboring meant pushing the whole time."
I was pregnant and didn't even understand how my baby would come out.
"As I continued care with the midwives, it affirmed my decision to change from obstetric care."
I could call and talk to someone at all hours of the day.
"One particularly tumultuous night, while my daughter was just days old, I called the midwife in despair."
She hadn't pooped and I wasn't sure if my milk was feeding her appropriately.
"I was desperate, I hadn't slept in 24 hours, and I felt like a failure."
And she calmly asked if I'd like to come in the next morning.
"I wasn't a woman in labor, so I assumed I had to wait until Monday."
It has in one of the most competitive markets been able to break into it and rise above it.
Zoom is a great example of a bold company led by a true visionary.
Yuan dreamed of a handheld device that would enable two people to see and speak with each other from anywhere in the world.
"The company timed the announcement to coincide with its $6M Series A round, which was led by Qualcomm Ventures."
"One of the most significant updates to the core product to date came in December 2015, with the introduction of Breakout Rooms."
This feature allowed hosts to create smaller groups within a larger meeting.
Couple of sessions I have attended have used this feature severally to facilitate their training.
It has kept many businesses and employees operating despite the current economy pandemic.
A report by Forbes tells us that humans process visual information far faster and more aptly than text or audio.
"And, relative to audio conferencing, 62% of executives agree that video conferencing significantly improves the quality of communication."
"Also, 50% of those surveyed believe video conferencing also improves the degree of understanding."
"In July 2016, Zoom introduced virtual backgrounds to the core product."
But it did show that Zoom wasn't averse to developing and introducing fun new features that weren't essential.
"In 2020, when the demand reached unexpectedly high levels, they were in a position to take advantage of it."
What set Zoom apart from the competition is how they worked on mobile.
Zoom quickly capitalized on this and developed a product that can operate at a 40% connection loss.
"At that time, many web-conferencing companies, such as Vidyo, were focused on hardware solutions for desktop conferencing."
"Zoom ran seamlessly on all platforms, including iOS and Android devices."
"The product's screen-sharing functionality was smooth, and the image quality was superb."
"Likewise, with Zoom, scheduling a meeting has never been easier."
"When members of my team travel, scheduling meetings is always a challenge."
"Now, the possibility of people embracing more remote work is on the increase."
Millennials have recognised that they can get the job done without physically going to the office.
Web-conferencing products like Zoom have redefined the entire way we do business and interact today.
We propose here a possible proxy for monitoring the vaccine effects on the epidemics.
The robustness of the results led us to try a similar approach to compare the two waves in Italy.
"The first wave was fought through a harsh national lockdown, starting the 9th of March 2020."
We will refer also to this set of measures as 'lockdown' for simplicity.
This also led to a much slower slope down for the second wave.
"Aside of the normalization and shift that make compatible the initial conditions, the curves are indistinguishable within the error bands."
Also in this case the measures were not taken all at once.
Israel 'first' wave in March was almost negligible and we will not consider it here.
The relative equivalence of the second and third wave lockdowns will be tested below using our approach.
So we can conclude that it was essentially caused by the lockdown itself.
We thus propose a similar construction as the one shown for Italy.
D3 is a JavaScript library that supports highly customizable and interactive web-based data visualizations.
"It's short for Data Driven Documents, and it allows developers to create and manipulate web documents based on data."
These are just a sample of the many types of shapes that can be easily generated with D3 code.
"To start making visualizations in D3, you will need a text editor, such as Atom, to edit your code."
The HTML file allows you to render visualizations that you create in D3 in your browser.
"The head tags mark the document's head element, which contains its meta data."
The text within the title tags is rendered in a browser tab when you open the HTML document in a browser.
"The next two lines inside the head tags reference the CSS file and the contents of version 6 of D3, respectively."
"The same goes for the 'shapes.js' file referenced within the document's body, which contains all of its visible contents."
"Finally, the closing html tag marks the end of the document."
"CSS is a style sheet language that handles such features as colors, fonts, and spacing in a webpage."
"This sequence of numbers starts with 0 and 1, and each following number is the sum of the two numbers before it."
The height and width attributes are both set to 100% so that shapes appended to this element will fill the entire page.
You may give these parameters any name you'd like and the function will still have the same output.
"The second rectangle is also 15 pixels high, the third rectangle is 30 pixels, and so on."
You can change the values within these attributes' functions to observe how the rectangles' position changes.
Notice that we select all 'circle.first' elements on the page.
Creating classes and specifying elements of a particular class eliminates any confusion about which shapes you intend to select.
These attributes allow you to separately adjust the horizontal and vertical radii of the ellipses.
The steady increase in the horizontal radii create this appearance as the x:y ratio changes.
The '.text' line adds each data point in the data array to the text.
"Sure, I run a large group of Medium writers, built on Facebook."
"But not everyone uses Facebook, and it is very hard to follow the various conversations as a group gets larger."
"Use your custom theme color, add a logo, customize categories and topics for a fully branded experience."
"There is also a 30 day trial, so you can test the paid plans risk free."
"Black Edge Consulting is a strategic communications firm, specializing in online reputation management, digital marketing, and crisis management."
"Prior to founding Black Edge Consulting, he worked for BGR Group, a bipartisan lobbying and strategic communications firm."
"Casey is the founder of the Cryptocurrency Alliance, a Super PAC dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain advocacy."
"He is a graduate of The University of Pennsylvania, where he received his B.A. in Urban Studies."
Model explainability and state-of-the-art research seem to constantly be engaged in a tug of war.
Complex models are difficult to interpret and simple models are often much easier to understand.
Explainable AI is one of the most vital emerging subfields in machine learning today.
Research in explainable AI is ongoing and there are a number of fantastic projects and groups out there doing work.
The library on which transformers interpret is built is called Captum which is a package designed for model interpretability in pytorch.
Much like the design philosophy behind Hugging Faces Transformers package transformers interpret was designed with ease of use at the forefront.
It is opinionated in its selection of attribution methods and how it summarizes attributions.
All of this allows end users to get word attributions and visualizations for their model's output in just 2 lines of code.
To install the package:With the package installed we are going to start by instantiating a transformers model and tokenizer.
The numeric attributions can be difficult to read especially for much longer sentences.
However question answering models are also very possible to implement as are NER models and both of these are currently planned features.
I'm also interested in exploring the feasibility of explanations for causal language models and multiple choice models.
I'd also highly suggest checking out Captum if you find model explainability and interpretability interesting.
"The business was hard, pizza was one of the most competitive businesses back then."
"In yellow pages, it was the only food item that had its own category."
Then one brilliant idea saved it and made it one of the most popular pizza vendors.
The offer worked so well and placed Dominos in a dominant position.
"What made the offer so successful is that it factored in a tired, hungry, time constraint employee or employer."
A hungry American with not more than 30 minutes to wait for pizza.
Let us now look at different ways you can craft your offers.
"They can be used to welcome new customers, encourage repeat buyers, or even encourage more spending by buyers."
They are applicable to both brink and mortar businesses as well as online businesses.
Spend $25 to receive a $100 coupon-Google Ads.
They have been a pillar in multi-billion dollar SaaS businesses.
"They come in all shapes and forms, free trials, free forever packages, free courses, etc."
These changes tend to be positive to both the consumer and the business.
It's rumored that membership offers can totally change the eCommerce business model.
Paypal heavily relied on invite offers to scale in its early years.
"When inviting a new user, both the inviter and invitee would earn $20 dollars."
The ripple effect from inviting users turned into an unstoppable force that strengthened its foundation.
This also influenced mouth-to-mouth advertising which later strengthened PayPal's positioning.
"When used appropriately, invite offers can be very powerful in scaling a business."
An Insane affiliate program is one of the quickest ways to grow or scale a business.
This can create a ripple effect and free mouth to mouth advertising.
ExamplesSiteground invite offerMailchimp - Both the inviter and invitee earns a $30 bill credit.
They are mostly used to avail related products a specific buyer might require.
They are a good way for marketers to leverage each other's customer base.
They can also be used to introduce new products into the market.
The majority of e-commerce brands currently use them to boost sales.
"They are basically in the form of limited-time deals, sales promotions, deals of the day, etc."
"Some of these brands include Amazon, eBay, Best Buy, Walmart, among others."
Microsoft winter salesMost of the big brands have offers for certain groups or demographics.
It's a way for a brand to show concern or give back.
"These groups can include, students, kids, nurses, military, teachers, firefighters, etc."
These offers can also be used to create brand awareness and foster mouth-to-mouth advertising thereby increasing brand positioning.
Brink-and-mortar exampleLet's say a restaurant observes that there is a low turnout of couples on Mondays and Tuesdays.
"This has the advantage of more sales, increasing brand awareness, and fostering free mouth to mouth advertising."
"Ultimately, this increases brand positioning and pushes the brand to a higher height."
"From such an offer, the restaurant is unlikely to make profits on Mondays and Tuesdays."
"Despite this, the long term advantages of such an offer by far outweigh the benefit of making profits on Mondays and Tuesdays."
"When used appropriately, demographic offers can push a brand to greater heights."
"The incentive can be in form of an additional free item, discount on the next item purchase, etc."
"In consumer goods and e-commerce, they can be used to introduce a new brand into the market."
"In some instances, they can be used to get rid of old products to give room for newer products."
"With SaaS, you are billed the time you use a service."
"In such a situation, these kinds of offers tend to have huge discounts on the length of subscription you purchase upfront."
A monthly subscription will cost you more in a year compared to purchasing a yearly subscription upfront.
"Subsequently, a two-year subscription bought upfront might be cheaper compared to buying two one-year subscriptions upfront."
ExamplesGrammarly - Purchasing one-year subscription upfront gets you 61% off.
"Staples - Buy 4, get one freeTheir main purpose is to get the very first users of a product or a service."
"Depending on the goals of a company, they can be offered to the first 2000 users or the first 100,000 users."
Appsumo is one of the best places to find one-time subscription fee software.
"On the other hand, product hunt is among the best places to get completely free software."
One-time subscription software and completely free software can also exist independently without being on the two platforms.
"On 12th November 2020, two years later, they introduced Rank Math Pro."
These were previously completely free tools but now they are subscription-based software.
Offers can be a really powerful way of introducing new products into the market.
You need to craft offers that are in line with your current situation.
They should also align with your goals and principles as a company.
"In the case of Rank Math, instead of having a free trial or an insane invite system."
"For a start-up with limited funds, going free for two years while maintaining a development team may not be feasible."
Having a diversified approach when looking at problems to finding solutions is the way to follow.
"The power lies in that once a customer uses your services, they are more likely to buy from you."
They carried the same philosophy to their hosting and the other services they provide.
"Having hooked you with a free forever package, the driver of sales in the backend are their offers."
"A free forever plan, and insane offers in their email sequences or Newsletters."
Loyalty programs act as an incentive to both new customers and existing customers.
"Basically, they build a loyal fan base and improve customer retention."
A single offer can single-handedly transform a business from a struggling company to a multi-billion dollar company.
"For an offer to work so well, it needs to be what your customers want to hear."
Uber marketer Mark Joyner has written a whole book on the topic of offers.
An offer created on the main offering is likely to have a huge impact compared to offers created on additional secondary offerings.
The information shared here will help fast-track you to creating great offers.
"It enables us to drive incredible change, and affect countless people's lives through the decisions we make."
"When it comes to building and designing businesses, products, and experiences, it is what elevates the best above the rest."
"But why is that?At their most fundamental, and throughout history both modern and ancient, stories have taught us how to survive."
"They give us a sense of purpose, a sense of self."
"We also see ourselves reflected through other people, both in comparison and in contrast."
But how do we take this and apply it to disrupting and redefining crowded or outdated industries?
"We all contribute for the collective good, and when one of us needs it, the money is available to help them."
"And there are still plenty of industries, both crowded and outdated, that are ready to be disrupted and changed."
This is the very foundation of user or human-centred design.
"Redefining supplements as food for your brain, as a part of supporting mental wellbeing and living a healthy life."
They put the story that the user wishes to tell at the front and centre of the product.
"What about smacking your device to knock some sense back into it?No, you restart it."
We immediately jump to this troubleshooting step as if years of electronic device-usage tattooed an instruction manual to our minds.
"So, why don't we try this approach when our brains aren't working?Unproductive days happen."
"We're human - we get tired, distracted, disinterested, and unmotivated."
"I feel like the typical person fights unproductivity with more unproductivity, like dousing a fire with gasoline instead of water."
"Instead, I've tried to follow the standard instruction manual's first step:Power off the device."
"Instead, the goal is to stop thinking, clear your conscience, and reset your brain."
"We want to temporarily forget to-do lists, impending deadlines, and any other stressors."
The methods for inducing a state of clarity aren't revolutionary - they're pretty mundane activities.
"Plus, taking a stroll around the park is much more convenient and replicable than sporadic showers or naps."
It allows me to appreciate the aspects of life I take for granted and tackle problems with a clear head.
It's easy to fall victim to life's neverending to-do list.
Listen to your internal instruction manual: power down once in a while.
"People with mentors advance in their careers faster, perform better, and tend to be happier in their current jobs."
The first step to kicking off a good mentorship is looking within.
"Evaluate what areas you want to grow - visibility, communication, influence, presence, etc."
"Try to get specific as possible about what you want to accomplish, and by when."
Write out the specific qualifications they would need to help you achieve your goal.
So just start by reaching out to people for a quick meeting or phone call.
"When scheduling, don't be vague and just say you want to chat."
Help them understand what you hope to get out of our conversation and why they are the best person to help you.
"Then, I recommended you provide your availability or a Calendly link so they can select a time that is best for them."
This will make it so much easier for them and reduce the back and forth.
Send the calendar invite yourself and include any relevant information in the notes.
Share what you hope to gain perspective on and listen to what they have to say.
"Keep it enjoyable: You may have a thousand questions, but try not to overwhelm your potential mentor in your first meeting."
Show genuine interest in them and center the conversation around their experiences.
Show them they are not wasting their time on you; you're taking it all in.
So you had a successful conversation and are now wondering how to initiate another one.
"Sure, you can reach out thanking them again, but why not use this opportunity to provide value?"
Remember how your initial conversation was not all about you and how you intentionally tried to learn about their personal interests?
I'd recommend doing this within the first two weeks of your initial meeting as a friendly reminder you're still around.
"Next, you'll want to keep the mentorship-type of conversation going by proposing another conversation based on your last encounter."
Make sure you try what they give you feedback on before reaching out again.
Let them know you'll come prepared with specific questions to hope to gain their perspective on.
"With more interactions, they'll learn how committed you are to growing and achieving your goal."
"Hopefully, they'll continue to feel valued through your appreciation and continuation of reaching out."
"After a few conversations, you'll want to shift to a more formal ask for mentorship."
"From my experience, making an intentional, yet flexible, proposal and giving them time to digest it works well."
"Even if you think that person couldn't possibly have time to mentor, just ask and leave that decision to them."
Thank you for reading this article and a huge thank you to all my amazing mentors that helped me along the way.
"If you've successfully found and kept a mentor, comment below any other tips and tricks that worked well for you."
"And if you are considering becoming a mentor, stay tuned for the next article - How to be a valuable mentor."
Today I wanted to be more on the technical side in the core of Machine learning and data science which is Data.
For me sometimes I just LOVE to get excited about projects where I'll create my own data set.
I learned each time and gained domain knowledge every time as well as learning to use new tools and dealing with different APIs.
"Formulating the problemAs I said, before getting too excited about the project's flashy idea, pose these questions."
These 3 questions are everything and are EQUALLY IMPORTANT once answered everything else is easy.1-
Invest in this stage as much as you can so that you don't lose time and resources.
If your problem can be solved without this hazard just download the data set and don't waste your time.3-
Finally have fun and focus on the end goal which is expanding your skillset.
"I can stack books, put papers in folders and create order like no one's business."
I only happen to know where everything in my house resides because I'm the cleaning crew.
That's how we often make the mistake of not being fully ready.
Your organizing doesn't have to result in neat and tidy piles with nary a dust bunny.
"Many intellects and uber-successful people have messy offices, but that doesn't mean they don't know where things are."
Oftentimes we use the excuse I have no time because we honestly feel like we're running around without a handle on anything.
There are of course bigger projects and many of you are full-time professionals but this can still be a useful habit.
"Categorize your lists into two if you like, one for business and one for life."
Keeping the number of tasks to three keeps you feeling that everything is manageable.
"Being in the present moment, and doing one task at a time is an amazing feeling."
"It sounds simple, but it's actually not as simple as it seems."
"That's because many of us aren't paying attention, we're doing one thing while thinking about another."
You're never going to remember a to-do list on the fly!
"Pricing is a complex topic, and every business in the world has to deal with it."
"Over the last twenty-five years or so, I have had the privilege to work on several pricing related projects."
"Each one was unique, and each required considerable thought and, ultimately, a specific solution."
"That said, some general concepts are helpful when you tackle pricing problems."
"Note that in this exercise, I am using a python Jupyter notebook inside Watson Studio from IBM."
"Also, please note that all data used in this notebook is 100% fake."
"Although it is completely fake, it does accurately represent several projects on which I have worked in the past."
"If you took economics in school, you probably remember drawing a bunch of supply and demand curves."
"Hopefully, you'll remember the elegance of equilibriums and optimal spaces where things seemed to fit just right."
Elasticity is an integral part of price theory but also has tons of other applications.
"In this notebook, we walk through the basic concepts associated with pricing and price elasticity."
"As a first step, we will import and install the required libraries."
"All businesses have customers, and those customers will buy a certain number of items based on the price you charge."
Note that our demand curve has quantity on the vertical axis and price on the horizontal access.
"Based on the relationship between price and quantity, if the firm charges one dollar, it will sell 100 units."
"At 10 dollars, it will sell ten units, and for 6 dollars, it will sell 50 units."
Price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price.
It is a unitless number that details the price sensitivity at a particular point on the demand curve.
Note that the elasticity of demand will vary as you move up and down a traditional demand curve.
Note that there is also something called a constant elasticity demand curve where elasticity doesn't change from point to point.
We'll get back to constant elasticity demand curves in part two of our exercise.
"In this exercise, we will just let it be a negative number."
This means a 1% increase in price will lead to a 1% decrease in quantity.
"Now, Lets plot revenue with demandNow, let's plot price elasticity of revenue next to Demand."
The price elasticity of revenue is similar but also slightly different from the Price elasticity of demand.
"Price elasticity of revenue is centered on zero, which makes it easier to interpret."
"If revenue elasticity is greater than zero, a price increase will increase revenue."
"If it is less than zero, increasing price will lower revenue."
"Based on the charts above, you can see that a price between 5 and 6 dollars will maximize revenue."
One of the men walking into the store drove to the store in a car with air conditioning.
"The man who walked to the store is likely to be thirstier than the man who drove, right?"
"In other words, the store owner cannot price discriminate between the two customers."
Price discrimination is charging different prices to different customers based on their demand for your product.
"The more a firm can price discriminate, the higher their profits will be."
"There are books written on why this is so, but for now, understanding this basic fact is good enough."
"Historically, they separate consumers who book travel early versus those who book travel late."
"The earlier you book a flight, typically the cheaper the fare."
They offer a lower price because seniors have a different demand curve than younger moviegoers.
Inflation is the annual upward drift in pricing that occurs across an economy over time.
"If you've lived life, you have probably noticed that most things get a little more expensive each year."
Another way to think of inflation is the change in the cost of living.
"In the United States, inflation has been pretty low over the last twenty years."
"Typically, the US inflation rate is estimated to be about 1% to 3% annually."
"Understanding inflation is essential because when we set prices in the real world, we must consider inflation."
"Usually, this means that price changes account for changes in inflation."
"If the inflation rate is 1.5%, you may decide to raise prices by inflation plus 5%."
"Likewise, if you want to decrease the price, you can hold it constant."
"I remember when I was a kid, and all my friends were growing taller when I wasn't."
Now that we understand the basic concepts let's move to a real-world example.
"In this use case, we will examine price elasticity for a regional retailer with 219 locations."
"It could be a convenience store, a restaurant, or a coffee shop."
"Whatever the business of the retailer, their data should look the same."
"Although it is synthetic, it is very consistent with real data I have worked with in the past."
Environmental factors surrounding the store are also critical and typically not very controllable.
"For example, a retailer will naturally do better if the people living around the store are wealthy than if they are poor."
Our data set in this exercise is a combination of controllable and non-controllable factors.
"Our goal in this exercise is to understand better the relationship between price, quantity, and revenue."
We achieve this goal by estimating the price elasticity of demand and the price elasticity of revenue.
PERCENTAGE_OF_CHILDREN is the percentage of households surrounding the store that have children.
AVERAGE_INCOME is the average annual income of the households surrounding the store.
AVERAGE_AGE_IN_YEARS is the average age of the head of household in the vicinity of the retail outlet.
AVERAGE_LENGTH_OF_RESIDENCE is an average of the time individuals surrounding the retail outlet have lived at their current address.
QUANTITY is the number of items sold by the retail outlet in the last year.
REVENUE is the total revenue for the store in the last year.
This exercise aims to calculate the price elasticity of demand and the price elasticity of revenue.
A 1% increase in people's average income around a store will increase the quantity sold by .55%.2.3
"First, let's summarize the variables other than price that are significant in the model."
We will take the average and then evaluate the relationship between price and quantity when the other variables are at their mean.
"Then, merge the average value for the non-price variables to the prices we constructed above and calculate the log."
"Now we have a demand schedule, and we can plot it as a demand curve."
This is a variation of the demand curves we developed in part 1 of our exercise.
"Remember, in our earlier discussion, that elasticity was different at each price point of the demand curve."
"With this demand curve, elasticity is the same at all the price points."
"For example, for 6 dollars, our firm can sell about 75,000 units at each store."
"If you wanted a linear demand curve, you could get there."
"Of course, if you built your model this way, the coefficient wouldn't be an elasticity."
The difference is we will use the natural log of revenue as a dependent variable instead of the natural log of quantity.
The regression results suggest that the price elasticity of revenue is .358.
This means that a 1% increase in price will lead to a .358% increase in revenue.
"In other words, this firm would make more revenue if it increased prices."
That is a fancy way of saying that you shouldn't get too crazy.
"If you increase prices by 1%, you probably will increase revenue by .35%."
"However, if you raise prices by 100%, you probably would not realize a 35% increase in revenue."
Baked into the model is an established historical relationship between your customers and your prices.
"If you do something very different than the historical norm, don't expect the model to be predictive."
"Two, it is essential to understand this elasticity is an average across all stores."
"Some stores will recognize more than 1.05%, and others will discover less than 1.05%."
A 3% increase in prices may even cause some stores to lose revenue.
You could even decrease prices in some stores if it makes sense.
Tailoring each store's price increase based on their specific market will lead to an even more significant revenue increase.
"Previously, we learned that our organization's price elasticity of revenue is .35."
A 1% increase in price will generate a .35% increase in revenue.
"If we increase prices across all stores by 3%, we will increase revenue by 1.05%.Can we do better than this?"
"To price discriminate, we must identify stores that have higher and lower revenue elasticity of demand."
"The higher the revenue elasticity of demand, the higher the ability to generate revenue from raising prices."
"The lower the revenue elasticity of demand, the higher our ability to increase revenue from lowering prices."
"Now, create new fields by taking the natural log of each variable.3.2"
Build a Demand Curve for All StoresDefine the regressors and the dependent variable.
"As before, the price elasticity of demand for all stores is -.64."
The first step is to save the residuals as a variable in our dataframe.
"Now, let's take a minute and discuss what the residual from this linear equation means."
"The residual, as you recall, is the difference between the actual quantity and the predicted quantity."
"So, what do the previous statements tell us about the current prices at each store?"
It could be that the first store is over-performing because it is priced optimally.
"Next, let's take a look at how each store is priced relative to each other."
"That is, what stores are priced higher than average and what stores are priced lower than average."
The difference between the price of each store and the average price of all stores.
"For the store in the second row, it is priced 1.4 cents higher than average."
We still don't have enough information to know whether these stores deserve a price increase or decrease.
Let's see if we can use these new metrics to cluster our stores into groups that likely face a similar demand curve.
Import K-means librariesDefine the features for the K-Means procedureStandardize the features.
Note that I came up with 5 clusters after a little trial and error.
Cluster 3 represents stores that are priced very low and are under-performing.
Cluster 4 represents stores that are priced a little low and are way over-performing.
Cluster 0 represents stores that are priced a little high and over-performing.
Cluster 1 represents stores that are priced a little high and are severely under-performing.
Cluster 2 represents stores that are priced very high and under-performing.
"To accomplish this, we will need to create dummy variables that represent each cluster."
Note that we now have the segments expressed as dummy variables at the end of the dataframe.
Export the CoefficientsTransform the coefficient so that it represents the elasticity for each segment.
"This makes sense, given that it is priced less than average and is performing well."
It is priced higher than average and also appears to face a strong demand.
There should be one thing that jumps right out as you review these elasticity numbers.
Can you guess?Remember the overall price elasticity of revenue for all stores?
All of the segments above have a price elasticity of revenue greater than .36.
"Some should be lower, and some should be higher, right?Yeah, they should."
"While the five individual segments can have a higher elasticity than the five combined, it isn't likely."
This anomaly allows me to make an essential point about this data and all data observed outside of a laboratory.
We live in an imperfect world filled with random noise and random error.
"Most of the time, your models' output is directional and subject to the imperfect world that we inhabit."
That doesn't mean that the work we do as data scientists are not useful; it is.
"Just remember that the goal is to guide the business towards better revenue, lower costs, and higher profit."
"We are subject to an imperfect world, but data science can make it better."
"Given this, it makes me sometimes wonder about the emphasis on prediction accuracy that I've seen in the last few years."
"I mean, with the Kaggle competitions and the highly complex algorithms, are we really improving things?"
"I mean, at the end of the day, aren't still just left with a sliced piece of bologna?"
"Not always, but in many situations, I think you are."
"Having said that, given all the information presented so far, we can take action."
"If the historical rate increase for a market is 1%, I wouldn't recommend implementing a 20% increase in prices."
I would want to keep it consistent with what consumers are used to seeing.
"Two, listen to others in the organization, especially those in customer-facing roles."
"When it comes to antidote versus data, I am 100% in the data camp."
"Having said that, I don't think you can ignore those who are intimately connected to the business."
Here is an example of how you can use our analysis to set price changes.
We will assume that this firm increased prices for the last few years by the inflation rate across the board.
"For segment 4, price is below average, quantity is way above average, and the revenue elasticity is 0.72."
This should yield a 2.88% real increase in revenue for these stores.
"Again, there is no perfect answer here, but the recommendations above are solid and consistent with our analysis."
"For the heck of it, let's look at the demand curves for each of the segments."
"Chocolate wasn't even consumed as a solid, to begin with."
"In Mesoamerican history, it was a drink made of roasted cacao beans with cornmeal, vanilla, honey, and chilies."
"Then as it spread across Europe in the 1600s, chocolate houses popped up like coffee shops, becoming hotspots for social gatherings."
"As for February 14, the feast day of St. Valentine really had nothing to do with romance."
"Historians suggest that we have medieval English poet Geoffrey Chaucer to thank for the dreaded, I mean, special holiday."
"If the fact that it was called the Romantic Era had anything to do with it, I can't be sure."
The lucky maidens kept the beautifully-decorated boxes to store love letters and other mementos.
"And since then, Valentine's Day has been made, quite literally, sweeter."
The Cadbury story is one of the earliest testaments to the power of packaging.
How you pack your product isn't just a matter of presentation or aesthetics.
"The packaging is your most tangible, strategic tool of association - an opportunity to communicate something different."
I didn't even know what gatekeeping was until I faceplanted on Twitter.
"The challenge with tweeting writing tips, if you ever decide to, is in your tone."
It's easy to come off as high-and-mighty without ever intending to.
"My now-deleted tweet said something to the effect of, Writers don't talk about writing."
That seemingly innocuous tweet managed to piss a couple of people off.
It was a very softcore version of gatekeeping - compared to others.
"Remember those music snobs, back when we used to buy CDs and records?Me: I love band ____."
And it's been the grounds for some pretty tragic social media posts.
"Just as Joseph Epstein infamously did, losing his job as a result."
"It's an insult to people's ambitions, how difficult most Ph.D. programs are, and how many people flunk out."
"My partner was a top student and scholar, spending years sleeping in dirt, carbon-dating Bronze Age artifacts."
But she still has to see stuff like this all the time:Ben's tweet is not the first of its kind.
"A doctor is, by definition, someone who got a doctorate."
"Also, who is actually scouting dinner guests based on whether they can resuscitate us or not?"
"Even if they are well intended, the replies don't do much to help."
I'll never understand why a person feels the need to tweet out their definition of man and woman on social media.
But why broadcast such thoughts?Social media probably isn't the best measuring stick for humanity.
It enables people to stream every ill-advised thought into the void.
Controversial 'blanket-speak' posts tend to go viral easily because the comments boost it in the algorithm.
"Yes, we need to 'have a bold voice' and be authentic on social media, or risk being boring."
I try not to draw lines of inclusion using money or politics.
I actually think many of these posts come from a place of insecurity.
There's a difference between trying to please everyone and coming off like a judgemental jerk.
"Gatekeeping doesn't just offend people, it has very real consequences."
"Years ago, I once made an off-the-cuff post about how tattoos seem to age poorly."
"Stanford Professor of Evolutionary Biology, Doctor Robert Sapolsky said perfectly, When you pay too much attention to boundaries."
And it isn't my job to say who is and isn't a writer.
Make no mistake - an ill-advised social media post can follow you to your grave.
"She was pretty much status quo, said Scott Mackay, a longtime political commentator who recently retired from Rhode Island Public Radio."
"Jonathon Acosta, a freshman state senator and former Rhode Island educator, offered a similarly lukewarm review."
That trait was never more clearly on display than in the strong stance Raimondo took on school reopenings during COVID-19.
"She and her team have been very evidence based and data driven, he said."
Chan watched nervously when the state made its initial push for in-person learning in the fall.
"If Raimondo's push to open classrooms ruffled some feathers, it wasn't the first time the governor has taken heat."
"She understood the financial implications of not having a good education system for our state, said Commissioner Infante-Green."
We can't attract businesses to Rhode Island if we didn't have a great education system.
"The granddaughter of Italian immigrants, Raimondo comes from a working-class background."
"Through the GI Bill, her father became the first in his family to attend college."
"The governor really put herself behind this program, said Sara Enright, vice president of CCRI."
"To Community College of Rhode Island President Meghan Hughes, the effort showcased Raimondo's commitment to equity."
"At the time we approved the Rhode Island Promise program, few states had taken this path, she told her audience."
"CCRI leadership hopes, however, that this year lawmakers will pass legislation to lift the sunset provision."
The University of Rhode Island computer science professor attributes that accomplishment to Raimondo's leadership.
The initiative also receives funds from grants and corporate donors such as Microsoft.
"I think for some people, they reduced personalized learning to technology."
"The universal computer science push, known as CS4RI, also has had its growing pains."
"Equity in access has been a problem for the initiative, said Fay-Wolfe."
"Women and students of color have been underrepresented in computer science programs across the state, as they are nationally."
"Taking those disparities to heart, Gov. Raimondo did her best to set a counter-example, he said."
"She wanted to show that computer science is for everyone, said Fay-Wolfe."
But Commissioner Infante-Green cautions against judging changes to Providence schools too soon.
Rutgers education professor Domingo Morel agrees that true change will take time.
Were there any mechanisms in place to deal with the issues of resources?
"Others, however, contend that Raimondo did do her fair share to allocate additional resources to struggling districts."
"In 2010, the state overhauled its school funding system to channel more money to schools serving disadvantaged populations."
"In addition, Elizabeth Burke Bryant, executive director of Rhode Island Kids Count, appreciates Raimondo's investments in early education."
"The state's overall percentage of 4-year-olds served, however, ranks 35th in the nation."
"But though seats may remain limited, they have gone, Burke Bryant points out, to the kids who need them most."
I am feeling very positively that we will be able to continue to make great progress under the new governor.
It feels more like an overbearing hug as opposed to this one that felt like a slow strangling.
This place is too quiet for my head that finds an oddly enchanting beauty in cacophony.
I am used to roads that make you swear under your breath as your body is flung and tossed in the car.
"Look at that level of dysfunction, finding excitement in potholes and the gbas gbos of horrible roads."
"Discomfort after a while, morphs into comfort, or at least a dull ache you know as friend."
"The school had delayed and delayed and the initial enthusiasm I forced myself to muster, died a slow and final death."
Coming here felt like an inevitability I fought with the knowledge that I would lose.
"If there's anything I've become an expert at, it's listening to my body."
"Spending a few hours here, I immediately knew that shea butter was a necessity, not a suggestion."
My tub of Vaseline was about to become an accessory I couldn't leave the house without.
"And sometimes, you try to prevent the inevitable, and your body just smiles and shakes its head at you."
You will soon learn that you cannot lie to your body.
"With care and compassion, you must help your body find home in this new place."
I will tell you what to do when your body starts craving home.
"That this too will sustain you, keep you alive, keep you walking long enough for your feet to carry you home."
"Surrender to a certain child-like humour, where everything tickles you."
You will need this to fight the longing that may begin to gnaw at your insides.
A good laugh will bring light into your face and cause you to shake off some lethargy.
"Even the things that you think are ugly, have some kind of beauty hidden underneath."
It is my third day here and my skin is still not used to the heat.
"That it is not home, does not mean you cannot flourish."
Hello Everyone!!!This is the second part of the series Linear Regression: Everything From Math to Program.
We have also derived the general expression for calculating slope and intercept of a one independent variable linear regression problem.
"In this part, we are continuing our learning and derive a general expression for a multiple linear regression problem."
Later we will use the derived expression to solve one of the linear regression problems with two independent variables.
We will represent each step using excel and also implement the programming version using Python with NumPy library.
If you haven't read Part-1 of this series you might not be able to understand few concepts of residual error.
"But if you think you are good with those concepts, you can skip them."
I will try to explain each step as much as possible and will give you some resources to understand the derivation part.
"Y. Also, the relationship between X1 and X2 with Y should be linear."
The objective of the problem is to determine the best plane that fits for all the given values of X1 and X2.
"Note that in regression with one independent variable, the objective was to find the best line."
"It is possible to plot the graph and visualize the points using some visualization tools like FusionCharts, Plotly, etc."
We can also use 3-D plot packages in R and Python to visualize the data.
General form of a multiple linear regression equation is:Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂
"In case of a two independent variable regression problem, equ. 1 can be simplified as,Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ +"
"If you remember this formula, you would be able to answer all the questions you need to solve for multiple independent variables."
Let's start solving the problem we assumed and predict the best-fit plane for our data.
I will use excel for displaying the manual calculations and python in the jupyter notebook for the programming part.
You are free to refer to this code and implement it in any other language for your own data.
Transform the feature matrixWe need to append columns of value 1 into the feature matrix to take the bias variable Beta0 into account.
"Find transpose of the feature matrixIn Excel, we can do this using the TRANSPOSE function."
"In Python, it can be easily performed using the transform function provided by Numpy."
Multiply Transpose of Feature Matrix with Original Feature MatrixWe use the MMULT function in Excel to perform multiplication.
"In python, we use the dot product to multiply 2 matrices of any size, unless one of the matrices is scalar."
Step 5: Inverse of Resultant MatrixWe use the MINVERSE function in Excel for finding the inverse of a matrix.
"In python, we can do this using the multiplicative Inverse function of a matrix."
Step 9: PlottingWe have used matplotlib package to plot the points in python.

"In my first 18 years of working, I had never once given a peer or manager feedback."
"I had a whirlwind of thoughts, emotions, and insecurities rushing through my brain."
"After an awkward silence, I managed to remember an issue and put it into a coherent thought - her difficulty with delegation."
I knew she had very high standards and a problematic time delegating her babies .
I struggled to effectively reduce her load but didn't know how to build this trust.
"I felt fantastic for sharing a niggling annoyance, and she found an actionable way to grow her skills."
Leaders who welcome employee perspectives and see their feedback as a resource rather than a threat create a transparent culture.
This shared trust helps employees feel comfortable offering suggestions to their peers and superiors.
"Taking feedback isn't easy, but it's an essential leadership skill."
"By improving your listening skills, tamping down defensiveness, and building a growth mindset, you accelerate your potential while strengthening relationships."
"As a first time leader, I knew she was sincere in wanting to grow her leadership skills."
"She needed to find a healthy balance between appearing vulnerable and confident, especially with those who reported to her."
Or maybe it's because you disagree with the feedback in general.
Keep in mind that giving negative feedback is as challenging and nerve-racking as receiving it.
"However, getting defensive often backfires, and instead of being protective, it creates a shell that won't allow for growth."
"By reducing your instinct to defend or attack, you increase the emotional vulnerability allowing for real growth."
"By verbalizing both the issue and solution, we both learned and grew."
Reaching out to your employees and peers to ask for feedback is a great way to create healthy team communication.
Accepting feedback is a crucial step to motivate and engage a team.
"It allows for a deeper understanding of employee needs, motivations, support required to achieve their goals."
It's easy to lose perspective about how well you are performing.
"By accepting criticism, you can think critically about your strengths and gaps, which helps avoid negative results."
It's easy to overlook your skill gaps until either someone points them out or a significant failure forces self-reflection.
Creating a high trust workplace and growing skills are two of the biggest areas that leaders typically need to grow.
After all of this - including the heart-wrenching moments leading up to the ending - the game demands everything of you.
"I watched, both awestruck and horrified, as the game systematically showed the deletion of all my hard work."
"I watched as menu after menu, my items, weapons, and quests were permanently erased."
"NieR was an unusual experience, its narrative weight cemented by the oblivion that I had been made to choose."
What existed as a cult classic for years has recently entered the limelight.
Automata exceeded all sales expectations and has become one of the most critically lauded games of the past five years.
"Now, after a decade in obscurity, NieR is a series at the forefront of the action RPG genre."
"In only a few months, we will all be playing a reimagining of the doomed cult classic, NieR Replicant."
"We are in a ruined city, devoid of life, devoid of kindness."
"In a ruined store, an old man sleeps clutching a length of metal pipe, a book at his feet."
"As he mutters himself awake, the old man is suddenly attacked by dark, ethereal creatures."
The storyline of the NieR games takes place across thousands of years and extends into different possible endings and player choices.
"The solution is a complicated one, a path of gestalts and replicants, of androids and magic."
"While NieR and NieR: Automata are related mostly through concept, they share a common narrative purpose and structure."
"Despite the series being its own, unique entity, the existence of NieR is actually built upon the bones of Drakengard."
"The outcome of their fight has great costs, and the Tokyo of 2003 is irrevocably changed."
"The world of NieR is not one of expected coherence, but of emotional reaction."
"Taro Yoko, the infamous and eccentric designer of NieR and Drakengard, is known for his unconventional narrative choices."
"As of 2019, the sales of NIER, NieR Replicant, and NieR Gestalt barely total 500,000 units."
"After ten years of development, Cavia would become absorbed into AQ interactive - and NieR would be their final game."
"At the close of 2014, Taro Yoko was once again out of a job."
"While momentarily removed of his curious vision, the world was not yet done with Yoko."
Yoko seems less interested in the cohesion of the games and more interested in how the games make you feel.
The actual gameplay are a placating gesture to the idea of gaming as a whole - they're simply vessels for the narrative.
"Automata that after stripping its narrative of living humans, it is not bereft of humanity."
"After years of turmoil, a bond forged between two unlikely companies."
"Automata expanded upon every facet of the original NieR, but found an identity of its own."
"This gave incredible leisure to the design of the narrative, world, and gameplay."
What is it about NieR that so many people find so special?
"Automata was exciting, with several freelance developers desperate to put their own spin on the world of NieR."
Automata over the last few years has given rise to projects that fans never dreamed would happen.
The first was the partnership between the world of NieR and that of Final Fantasy XIV.
They sought to indelibly link what made NieR so infamous to the popular MMORPG's most successful expansion yet.
"To give him credit, Final Fantasy XIV knows as much about being destroyed and remade as NieR does."
"We are getting a reimagining of NieR: Replicant, and it comes out in a scant few months."
"Yosuke Saito, the series producer, clarified in the earliest introduction that this game is not a remake or a remaster."
"When it comes to Taro Yoko, it's often difficult to pry his dark jocularity away from his sincerity."
"Existing for even one second in the dreamland of Taro Yoko is an unbridled, chaotic joy."
"I can say with utmost confidence that as a longtime fan of NieR, I have no fucking clue what to expect."
"As part of my series about the women leading the Artificial Intelligence industry, I had the pleasure of interviewing Karen K. Burns."
Her goal is to improve the layout and design of urban spaces so people and objects can move around more efficiently.
She is a highly passionate advocate for increasing inclusion of women in STEM and management positions.
I have always been commercially minded and found I had a natural aptitude to lead teams and build businesses from scratch.
"This was also where I met my Fyma co-founder, Taavi."
We work really well together and have a complementary skill-set and temperament.
"Perhaps, experiences like mine can open the door for others to change career direction even more times."
"There is no such thing as a job for life any more, unless you create it yourself."
"I studied Film and TV and Law, and am now leading an AI company."
So it really isn't about the 'right background' any longer.
"Nobody can sustain 'doing it all' on their own, it is a myth that really damages women."
"Whether that support network is paid help, family, or friends - it is necessary."
The company is going through a fascinating phase of growth and learning phase.
We are hiring and closely observing how our clients use the technology.
"For example, a client is helping a university in their home country with an experiment."
"In this experiment, they aim to analyse the impact that a fake news billboard can have."
"To do so, they placed a billboard in an urban area, monitored by a camera."
The stats of people's behaviour around the billboard are gathered anonymously and securely with Fyma.
Can you share a story about that?I would not have been able to start building Fyma without my mom's help.
She played a massive role and provided crucial support when I needed it.
"Essentially, she has been helping out with everything in the household and with my kids."
"I would also mention my friend Triinu, she's one of my oldest friends."
"Recently, she started a journey of mindfulness, self-healing and self-improvement."
What are the 5 things that most excite you about the AI industry?
Why?The influx of women into the industry from previously 'uncool' female-dominated fields like statistics.
"Gender parity is not only a desirable goal in itself, but also brings a lot of other benefits."
What are the 5 things that concern you about the AI industry?
Why?Artificial intelligence is not something that most people are well-informed about.
"What most people know has also to some extent been shaped by fiction, fear of the unknown, or extreme cases."
"Misinformation and misconceptions, people not understanding the possibilities, the limitations of this technology."
"Also, legislators, instead of creating frameworks to exploit the technology in the best way, are creating a muddy area."
Some areas of the AI industry are over-regulated and some aren't even discussed.
There is also an alarming trend in the business and startup community.
"This ends up building mistrust from investors, the community and the general public."
"Our school systems are mostly churning out people who know how to use applications, but not how to create them."
We also need more information about what is and what is not allowed.
How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world?
"As you know, there are not that many women in your industry."
"There are so many cool applications for the tech, women need to discover these more easily."
"I recommend taking to see quickly and easily, if the field is something to move into."
"When I find a new quote I really chime with, I add it in."
"It also reminds me that with hard work, most difficult situations can be overcome."
"We've been campaigning almost monthly ever since, hosting webinars, meetups and building a strong community around it."
"How can our readers follow you on social media?On LinkedIn under my name, Karen K Burns, and @Karenkangro on Twitter."
The best place to follow Fyma is under the Twitter handle @AiFyma as well as on LinkedIn.
"As a part of a software development company, it often baffles me the way some executives think about technology."
"Yet, many of them still feel like technology is something of an asset, a tool to resort to tackle certain tasks."
"Technology allowed businesses to build resilience, stabilize operations, and increase their agility, things that will become essential moving forward."
"Of course, those things don't come by merely integrating technology here and there within your workflow."
There are implementation challenges and technical aspects you'll have to deal with in order to get the most out of technology solutions.
Collaborating with seasoned engineers and tech professionals can provide them with the digital capabilities they need to meet their digital goals.
"On one hand, you should aim to achieve talent agility with your own workers."
"On the other hand, you should consider using an on-demand workforce."
"Doing so can provide you with instant talent to fill in your talent gaps, thus ensuring a more seamless technological integration."
"For years now, executives have rushed their teams to launch products and services as quickly as possible."
The notion fueling that approach is that they can monetize the product rather fast while beating the competition to the market.
"Naturally, those things are important, so you should keep speed as a main concern of your technical development and implementation."
"However, you shouldn't, under any circumstances, put speed in front of everything else."
All of those things often lead to a decrease in quality which ultimately impacts the user experience.
"Given we're living in the golden age of user experience, you can't afford that."
"To avoid that, executives need to understand that developing and implementing technology takes time."
"Additionally, you should never ignore the proper QA and testing phases."
"Rather, it means that companies always have a place for technology in their businesses."
"Though it may be that way some time ago, technology company isn't a synonym for company that develops technologies for customers."
"Because technology company now means company that leverages technology, be it internally, externally, or both."
"So, you don't have to be an application development company to be a technology company."
Using technology at the core of your workflow provides you with agility and flexibility to tackle any modern challenge.
"Thus, executives have to understand that they don't have to offer the next Instagram to be a technology company."
They need to embrace technology as a revolution for their operational standards.
"In other words, businesses that fail to adopt them will see how they are quickly surpassed by those that do embrace them."
Surely you don't want to be among the ones that lag behind.
"So, if you're still thinking of technology as a tool, consider these concepts."
"Only you know precisely what you see in your mind's eye, and only you are privy to your inner thoughts."
So how would you react if you found out your mind's eye can be manipulated?
Their results support a theory of how we visualize and why we visualize differently.
"Although not often talked about, visual imagery varies wildly from one person to another."
"Or, like me, you might be one of the 3% of the population who sees nothing at all."
"In just the past few years, researchers have started realizing just how much visual imagery varies from person to person."
"The term aphantasia was coined in 2015, which goes to show how new this field is."
"In the brain, we don't cause any specific neuron to fire, but instead bring each one closer to firing."
"Without this increased excitability, a neuron might only fire if several other neurons trigger it at once."
"With the electrical stimulation, it might trigger with just a single neuron's input."
"And, perhaps unsurprisingly, when the activity of a brain area shifts, you start experiencing some strange things."
It was almost as if some people were more ready to see phosphenes.
"The more vivid someone's mind's eye, the less excitable their visual cortex."
"On the other hand, hyperphantasics, who see picture-perfect imagery, require a high level of electricity to see phosphenes."
"As exciting and satisfying these results were, the researchers couldn't stop there."
And that's where the sci-fi-like research of modifying your internal experience comes in.
"The smaller the jolt that worked, the more excitable your cortex is."
This is more like raising the temperature of the burner slightly and leaving it there.
"While this seems straightforward, there's another issue to tackle: how can we know for sure if your vividness is changing?"
"Importantly, the more vivid your visual imagery, the stronger this priming effect."
One thing to note is that this change in vividness is not day and night.
The participants didn't report an obvious change in their imagery when experiencing the electrical stimulation.
"Remember that a very excitable visual cortex is like a hot pot of kernels, ready to pop at a moment's notice."
"Remember that, when one kernel pops, it's likely to set off other kernels."
"So which pot would let your masterpiece shine, and which would cause it to be a fuzzy and unclear art piece?"
"The less excitable your visual cortex, however, the clearer a picture you can draw."
"Is there an experimental artist in your brain, poking neurons to draw on your visual cortex?"
"Visualization, then, is when our popcorn artist feels an urge to draw an image on the kernels."
"Many readers, especially those with aphantasia, will be quick to ask: can electrical stimulation give you imagery?"
Perhaps the most well-known resource for learning deep learning is Andrew Ng's series of 5 courses on Coursera.
"MIT has been exceptionally generous to have all the material available online for free, for anyone to learn from."
"In addition, there are 3 software labs that can be accessed."
It is currently one of the most exciting development in the field of Artificial Intelligence and it is evolving at a rapid pace.
Why is up-to-date important in deep learning?The speed of progress in deep learning is phenomenal.
Please don't expect this course to be a walk in the park.
You will have to put in the work and hours but the requirements to start making that effort are minimal.
"In fact, there's a strategy called value betting that makes the most of bookies' mistakes in order to maximize earnings."
"We always want to increase our earnings in any activity we do, and betting is no exception."
"This is the concept behind value betting, and it's how bettors make money in the long run."
Value bet occurs when the real odds of a match's outcome are better than what the bookies' odds suggest.
"Every time we make a bet, we should always look for value."
"Value betting is a profitable system backed by maths and statistics, but it's not risk-free."
"In case you're interested in a risk-free approach, check the surebets articles I wrote before."
Finding surebets will demand more of your time but will help you make some money in the short run.
"In contrast, value betting will demand less of your time but will help you make money in the long run."
"In this example, we'll find value bets for the match Liverpool vs. Man City."
"Using the value formula, we only found value bets for Manchester City Wins in MarathonBet, Pinnacle, and Unibet."
Value bets can be found across all betting markets in many sports events.
"Fortunately, you don't need to pay for it if you know at least the basics of coding."
"However, you don't need to pay for a betting tool if you know how to code."
"In fact, I built a profitable betting tool with Python's Selenium and Pandas."
In the article below I show the full code and explain how I did it.
The following 3 steps are a simplified version of the betting tool I built in Python.
They will give you an idea of the concept behind value betting.
"To find value bets, we first need to calculate the real odds."
That's why I calculate real odds on Python by using historical data.
"On this website, you can find historical data in 27 football leagues over the past 10 years."
"Instead of downloading them one by one, run the following lines of code to get them in a couple of minutes."
"The data includes several football stats such as goals scored, conceded, number of corners, shots on target, etc."
"With this data, you can calculate your own probabilities for any market you want."
"In this example, we'll only use data from 4 football leagues."
Then I just need this simple formula to calculate the real odds.
It's the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of events.
"For 'over 2.5 goals', this would be the formula."
This value also depends on the sample you pick for the analysis.
You can find the real over 2.5 goals odds of any match by introducing any pair of teams in the formula.
"Now that you have the real odds for any match, you have to compare them with bookie's odds."
"As we mentioned before, you can use webs like Odds Portal to find whether the odds were overrated or underrated."
These are the bookie's odds for the 'Over 2.5' odds in the match Liverpool vs. Man City found in OddsPortal.
There are many of these inefficiencies across many sports events in different bookies.
You just need to find value bets that will help you make money in the long run.
Today you learned how to find value bets manually with free betting tools and also automatically with some lines of codes in Python.
"On their never-ending quest to draw eyeballs to products, marketers increasingly turn to live streaming."
They compared top tips and tools for conducting a quality looking and sounding live-stream show and ways to start making money.
"When you've done the exercise, you'll have 20 ideas that you can turn into a show, she said."
"She recommended doing live streams of product demonstrations, interviews, promoting live shopping and tutorials."
"Once viewers realize that you're answering frequently asked questions, they're more likely to ask more questions, she said."
You can learn more about your audience and even turn your answer into a new episode.
I can't think of an industry that wouldn't benefit from live streaming.
"It's all about grabbing and keeping the attention of your target audience or consumer, she said."
Sixty-three percent of people ages 18 to 34 are watching live-streaming content regularly.
"I have been able to attend so many weddings, baby announcements, anniversary and birthday celebrations throughout the pandemic."
"Brick-and-mortar stars have started to embrace live shopping, Liu said."
"In fact, live stream-generated sales are expected to double to $120 billion worldwide this year, she said."
Take a look at what's happening with Amazon Live and Facebook Live Shopping.
The camera will automatically pan and follow you when you're live streaming or in a Zoom meeting.
Service-based entrepreneurs can use live streaming to connect with their audience and target customers.
Give them an idea on what it's like to work with you.
That's why we use Group Track CRM to follow up and seal the deal.
"For those who have an active Facebook Group, live streaming inside the group can keep members engaged."
We usually have our clients promote their biography link when they live stream on Instagram.
"Even if someone already asked a question, try explaining in different ways."
"According to Krost, entrepreneurs are great live-stream formats to explore."
Liu and Krost gave tips and tools to conduct quality looking and sounding live streams.
"Invest in an external webcam, digital single-lens reflex camera and mic, Liu said."
"More importantly, when you live stream, make sure you're connected to an ethernet cable, she said."
Check your internet upload speed to make sure that you have at least 5mbps upload speed.
"If you can get your hands on the Logitech Brio 4k, that's all you'd need, she said."
"If you already have a webcam or DSLR, buy them for your clients."
They'll associate you with their new gear every time they use it.
"Connecting the DSLR with CamLink is just like plugging in a webcam, Liu said."
"Once it's connected, just choose the DSLR from the camera options."
"Another tip to make your live broadcasts look a bit more professional is to really take your backdrop into consideration, she said."
I like to catty-corner my camera to give the backdrop more dimension versus being on a flat wall.
The next step is to simultaneously live stream on multiple social media channels.
"Restream lets you stream live to more than 30 social platforms at once, Liu said."
"I stream live on Twitter, Facebook personal page, Facebook business page, Linkedin and YouTube all at once, she said."
"Liu said that as long as you can deliver value, tell your audience about your show."
"In a well-meshed media plan, live streaming can enhance sales."
"If you have a Shopify store, you can power up your e-commerce sales with Livescaletv, Liu said."
You can broadcast from their platform and directly tie it to your store and see sales in real time.
The end of the live stream is the perfect place to insert the offer.
"These are examples:Although the format is inviting, people slip into miscues when they're live."
"Don't use live streaming as a straight-up infomercial or billboard, Krost said."
"As good as they might be, productions don't advertise themselves."
"A big mistake is not promoting your live stream ahead of time, Liu said."
I did a presentation on how to launch your live stream and get people buzzing about it before you even launch.
"Don't rely on channel notifications because the next big product feature can take over the notification alerts, she said."
Encourage your viewers to sign up for your email newsletter if you have one.
Liu encourages her audience to subscribe to her company's calendar events.
"We know that if it's on their calendar, then they've already blocked out time in their schedule, she said."
"A live stream is going to be a long-form piece of content, Krost said."
Chop up your 20-minute live stream into bite-sized 30- to 60-second clips.
We create GIFs and give them to our guests who love sharing that with their audience.
We are only going to get more innovative with the way we use and consume live streaming for our business.
"The pandemic may have nudged everyone to do it faster, but the demand and viewership is here and ready."
Liu sees advances - and job openings - on the technical side.
"With more industries embracing live streaming, we are seeing an immediate need for remote live video producers, she said."
Talented producers can help brands and organizations launch a live stream remotely.
"Let's not forget about the health and wellness industry, Liu said."
The AuthorJim Katzaman is a manager at Largo Financial Services and worked in public affairs for the Air Force and federal government.
The dictionary definition says it's a strong and barely controllable emotion .
"So, the passion career that you were born to do is a myth."
"You can be passionate about your food, your lover or your car."
"When I started, I had no passion for life-coaching."
"If anything, I had a passion for depression, anxiety and overeating."
I started by making a daily video of my thoughts on personal development.
"Seven years later, those videos have turned into a six-figure coaching business."
You don't have to be dead sure that it's your life purpose.
It's much better to start with a hobby or skill you think you like.
You'll learn more by doing it than you ever would by trying to find the perfect job.
"But can you get paid to practice your craft?Yes, here's how."
"They will pay you for the end-result that your skill provides - website traffic, a beautiful house or entertainment."
"When a wealthy mansion owner buys a $100,000 art-piece, he solves the problem of a boring wall."
That's because not everyone solves a specific problem in the same way.
People who are more skilled solves it better and hence get paid more.
"Still, don't wait to be skilled to start a business."
Even your undeveloped skills can solve a big problem in a small way.
And you'll get more skilled by starting where you are than if you were to wait and become 'good'.
As Mark Zuckerberg preaches to new entrepreneurs;I didn't wait to be the best life-coach to start working with clients.
"But now, I can charge 25x more and even get partnerships in some of my client's businesses."
"If you are a painter, it can be an entertaining time-lapse of you painting."
"When you watch them, you are behind the screen as a consumer."
"If you want to make money, you need to get on the screen and become a producer."
You can do that by uploading your daily practice on a social media platform.
"YouTube, Instagram or Medium, pick any platform based on the content style you are comfortable with."
"When you post, don't stress about being good at all."
"Even if people like what you put out, there are many hurdles to making a sale."
Mr. X may not be ready to take the next step in their life.
Or Mr. X may have had a fight with their spouse and dislike your offer.
The key to jumping over these cognitive hurdles is giving away free value and aiming for a long-term relationship.
"If you have a crush on someone, you wouldn't get down on your knees and propose."
You would first take them out on a date and see how it goes.
"Instead, give away a part of your service or product for free."
It can be a digital art piece they can print or a free trial of your new course.
"I give away free consultation to my clients, giving them a taste of my coaching service."
Here's an example of a consultation call that inspired me to write this article.
A percentage of people will take your free offer and not follow through with a purchase.
But you would never make money if you consider that as a loss.
All the advice above won't work if you don't have patience.
"To get good, build an audience and convert customers, you need time."
It took me a good one year of making videos to get regular coaching clients.
Don't be scared with the idea of working for a year with no results.
"Build something with it this time!A 5-day email course with tips on budgeting, investing, and productivity for 20-somethings."
"The paint comprises tiny luminescent molecules suspended within a flexible and sprayable liquid, which absorbs light and moisture."
"The oxygen and hydrogen is released into the air, and this hydrogen is used to produce clean energy for powering cells."
"Now with a one coat quantum dot solar paint, this can be achieved in under an hour."
"The main barrier with solar paint as of right now is its efficiency, which is generally between 3% and 11%."
"That means if a 7% efficient solar paint was taken, only 7% of the available energy could be used."
This will have to be overcome and at a minimum surpass 10% efficiency if solar paint is going to become commercially viable.
Stability is currently at its best when the paint is stored in the dark.
"There's also the issue of titanium dioxide sources decreasing over time, especially if solar paint goes widespread."
Alternatives and other formulations will need to be found to maintain this as a long-term product.
"Lastly, utilizing hydrogen regarding capture and storage is also somewhat of a difficult situation."
Solar paint could have some pretty wild implications because it is so much easier and cheaper to install than regular solar panels.
"Because solar panels are bulkier and clearly stand out, some people don't want them on their houses."
"Solar paint offers a simple, attractive, and non-obtrusive technology."
Let's do a quick overview of what we've learned in this article.
Affiliate marketing can be defined as a performance-based marketing technique.
It is a simple yet effective link between the advertiser and the product.
Affiliate marketing facilitates the purchase of a product right from the source while providing a small commission for the advertiser.
Affiliate marketing is one of the world's most popular methods of making money online.
It is a simple technique that can be used with any demographic.
"Since affiliate marketing is fairly novel, here are five things you should know."
These are the groups of people that are involved in affiliate marketing.
All of the payment methods are commission-based and they're usually provided to the marketer on a monthly basis.
The amount of money the marketer makes depends on both their payout method as well as their audience size.
"A lot of established YouTubers who use a lot of affiliate links can earn upwards of $100,000 per month."
"You can apply to be accepted and once you are in, you can sell any Amazon product."
"Awin is a huge affiliate marketing platform that has nearly 150,000 advertisers."
"In Awin, brands are very picky with the marketers they will work with."
"Even if you get accepted into the Awin program, it doesn't automatically guarantee brands."
This can be a good thing since it creates a better connection as well as better advertisement for the consumer.
I have seen YouTubers link their camera equipment as well as their outfits.
"From a marketing perspective, it is better if the marketer finds a niche and sticks to it."
"Personally, I am more likely to buy a digital camera recommended by a photographer than from a fashion blogger."
"Although affiliate marketing can sound ideal for anyone with an audience, there are some cons that stand out."
"When you have momentum, money can accumulate on a pay-per-performance basis."
If your audience is small or not receptive to the product it is likely that you won't make much money.
Creating ads that have no credibility can cause you to lose your credibility.
"Besides losing credibility, you are more likely to be rejected by sellers and networks."
It's better to focus on providing quality ads that are receptible to your audience in order to not lose your credibility.
"Over the last two decades, our society has collectively made many digital advances."
"Ultimately to be successful, it is essential to see which affiliate programs are right for you."
"Though it's easy, it still requires talented individuals to build an audience that will become their consumers."
"Twitter suspended the accounts of Project Veritas and its founder James O'Keefe on Feb 11, 2021."
"Immediately following that, one can find a prime example of how social media personalities influence how we experience reality."
"Mr. Posobiec is modeling motivated reasoning, a bias that often leads us to misjudge situations."
We assume our pre-existing beliefs are right instead of reassessing them when we get new evidence.
Ask yourself if there could be an alternate explanation and whether you've collected all evidence.
"Congress banned funding to a prior organization that the Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe ran, ACORN."
Veritas has a history of releasing material in what we would call coordinated disinformation.
It's clearly released with the intention of influencing the public and it works well.
That is why he is not only guilty of crimes for which he was fined but why he also continues to be dangerous.
"Shortly after, the Post Millennial and Sputnik ran the Zuckerberg story, other popular conservative outlets began publishing it as well."
"Another outlet the Gateway Pundit, also recently banned for lying, had premonitions about election fraud, too."
The fake article was written by someone who does not exist and intended to manipulate the West.
It's a testimony to the journalistic standards at the Post Millennial.
Right-leaning groups and media outlets generate more engagement and the algorithms FB uses prioritizes that.
Let's look at the top-performing posts from the past few days.
"You get the idea, but if not feel free to check the Twitter feed."
The account posts the results of a daily analysis that uses CrowdTangle.
"Actual audio, in context, leaked where employees confronted Zuckerberg about his negative effect on democracy."
"Analysts have shown, repeatedly, that the top-performing posts on Facebook are dominated by conservatives."
"That suggests that much like Twitter, the total accounts removed was less than 1%."
"The experience of feeling censored may be very real, but the data fails to support that claim."
"Instead, I suspect another phenomenon altogether is responsible for that shared experience."
Everyone knows the scenario of the jealous person who suspects their partner of cheating.
"Then, no matter what they do, the partner's actions become evidence of what the person already believes."
"Driven by fear or worry, our ability to process information and think critically declines."
"If you feel afraid right now, you're not alone and you're not crazy."
I too I would likely have been drawn into many of these claims of censorship.
"When our perception falls so far outside of the concrete reality, we must ask if that error happened on its own."
"Although recycling nowadays is an absolute buzz-word, only 9% of all plastic is actually recycled."
The rest of it usually fills up the oceans forming trash islands.
"Two years ago, in 2018, China restricted its import of recyclable waste products from the USA."
"Sorting rubbish is one of the most monotonous, repetitive, low-paid and even dangerous jobs, that automation can cover."
"In my previous article, I am writing about the reasons why humans should not be afraid of automation."
And recycling and waste sorting are one of the illustrative examples of that.
AI-enabled robots are usually a cost-efficient and a few times more productive than humans.
"It is estimated that already by 2024, waste sorting and recycling AI robots market will be worth $12 billion."
"For instance, AI can recognize an Oreo logo, blue-coloured package and a picture of a cookie."
Based on this info it can 'assume' it's a package from the plastic cookie pack.
"Similar to any AI-enabled robot, firstly AI-specialists need to 'teach' the system with the required knowledge."
"In the sorting process, the system continually teaches itself to recognize the most obvious attributes of different waste types."
There are many different designs of AI-powered robots that can be enabled by various systems to identify the waste types.
Some of these robots are designed to scan an object with computer vision or physically grab the particular object.
"In this case, its' sensors would identify the object's characteristics, height, weight, material, etc."
Recycling and trash sorting robots are already starting to raise interest and gain traction.
AI-enabled waste scrapping robots are already supporting Sweden in the recycling revolution and helping the country become almost fully sustainable.
The lavender colored napkin box looks at me closely from three feet away.
The words 'Feel Better' are printed on it in a motherly italicized font.
The manufacturers must have made it for the primary use of blotting tears.
I gather up my hair in a tie and pull up my sleeves.
The scattered roses and broken shards of glass need to be picked up.
"Returning home from a V-day party with friends, he insisted on driving despite being sloshed."
"Words dying prematurely on my lips, because saying anything would only make things worse."
The next morning there were the usual apologies and promises to do better.
Promises as empty as a cave from which even the bats have flown.
"Covid-19 put pause on my plans all last year, but now I'm ready."
"He arrived drunk, proceeded with the now-no-longer-shocking verbal abuse, and then shattered the vase."
"One cupcake still sticks to the wall, grimacing stupidly at me."
"Money is the path to dignity and freedom, my mom always used to say."
"This Ferris wheel ride is over, it's time to get off."
"While market economies excel at fostering competition and encouraging innovation, if left unchecked, problems inevitably arise."
"Now, some say the time has come for another round of landmark antitrust cases."
The Chinese economy had to first digest much of its inefficient and bloated SOEs before such concerns really rose to surface.
"Furthermore, while still heavily 'bloated' and overleveraged, years of reforms have marginally improved SOE efficiency."
"Through several new provisions, the Draft AML both expands the scope of the law and adds teeth to enforcement actions and penalties."
"Statutory penalties have also been markedly increased, providing more leeway in calculating penalties across the board."
This keeps with the trend of increasingly large penalties seen in anti-monopoly cases in the last few years.
"This will likely be advantageous in terms of efficiency, with regulators being able to more easily coordinate and avoid wasting resources."
"The guidelines cover monopoly agreements, abuse of market dominance concerns, and concentration of operators."
"The pick one from two practice is certainly not unique to Alibaba, though Alibaba may be the top offender."
It has shown this with steadily increasing fines as the years have gone by.
Heavy fines have been levied against many other companies in more traditional sectors.
"Gone was my ability to leave my house, which rushed in a new era of heightened anxiety."
And what I landed on was - for me and my particular mental health struggles - a game-changer.
"In a fascinating 2018 study, researchers figured out that exposing people to simulated threats through horror movies can calm anxiety."
"In other words, watching scary movies can actually make you feel better."
But I'm too much of a wimp to stream anything spookier than Scooby-Doo on Netflix.
"The treatments target the amygdala, which is the area of the brain that houses fear and fear responses."
"By exposing a patient to simulated and controlled experiences with the thing they fear, they can learn to reduce their anxiety."
"Curiously, it turns out that people with anxiety can benefit from consuming horror or suspense thrillers in entertainment."
"She figured I wouldn't make it through the first scene, but she agreed to allow me to watch it anyway."
What ultimately happened was that I was scared shitless and gave myself mental and emotional scars.
"Don't judge my mom, though; she truly didn't think I'd sit through the film."
"When the pandemic hit, and I was looking for ways to calm my brain down, I read about that 2018 study."
Would a book get into my head and screw me up the way that horror movie did when I was a kid?
"I had read rave reviews about Ruth Ware, so I started with her book The Woman in Cabin Ten."
"By the time I got to the end, I had found myself feeling overwhelmed with relief by what happened to the characters."
And I realized that Ware's book was a masterful example of what I think these researchers were seeing.
"And also, nothing terrible happened to me as I read the story."
I read Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia and couldn't sleep because I couldn't put that book down.
My imagination was on fire with the luscious descriptions of the haunted house - which is one of the main characters! -
These books allowed me to feel fear in a simulated manner and to manipulate my fears by vicariously experiencing bravery and adventure.
"And by the time the stories ended, the characters that I felt close to in my imagination were generally ok."
"For me, the uncertainty about the virus is what makes my brain feel frazzled."
And so I worry about getting sick every time I leave my house.
There are other ways that I am using self-care to tend to my mental health.
"Things like making sure my body is healthy, creating routines at home, and having healthy boundaries with friends and family."
Creating a safe outlet where I can express my stuff helps too.
Last week my old boss called me and invited me to travel with her to South Africa.
"Needless to say, it sounded like a dream - of sorts."
"What's more, essential workers are risking their lives so that we can have our necessities."
"While all of this is happening, the luxury travel market is growing and becoming even more exclusive than it already was."
It's the opportunity to be close enough to the exotic all while maintaining your Western creature comforts.
"In theory, well-managed tourism is mutually beneficial to both the traveler and the local economy."
"Additionally, hotels and lodge operators buy goods and services from local suppliers which further boosts the economy."
"This copasetic and symbiotic relationship, surprisingly, doesn't always come to pass."
Many countries are taking stock of their specific marketability and attempting to draw in travelers.
"In fact, they may be shuttled from the airport to the lodge without encountering anyone but the airport security and their driver."
They want to drink champagne in the middle of the African bush at sunset.
"While lux-travel might contribute to local economies, it's important to consider the wealth distribution."
"In many countries where tourism is growing, the lodges, shops, and restaurants are often owned by foreigners."
"From an environmental perspective, luxury tourism by its very nature requires even more resources than average tourist consumption."
"Plants and green spaces must be kept lush, air conditioning, spas, and monsoon showers must be powered."
"Beaches and other places are made private, with locals prohibited from using them."
"Additionally, waste from luxury tourist sites is often dispersed within the poor local communities."
"As I unpacked luxury travel alongside voluntourism, I realized that these two types of travel are antithetical."
"Luxury travel by its nature is meant to be exclusive, lush, private."
"Similar to luxury travel, there are numerous problems with the voluntourism industry - which you can read about here."
"Sustainable travel is not only about eco-friendly travel, it's about social impact."
"Despite the complexities and grey areas of traveling, the fact is - we're going to travel."
"People love to explore, see new places, treat themselves to luxurious honeymoons and celebratory trips."
"I highly encourage you to read them yourself, because the below points don't do them justice."
"Last month, Atomic Habits by James Clear, surpassed 3 million copies sold worldwide."
"It probably took me less than a week to read, which for me qualifies as quite fast."
"When I'm able to get through a book that quickly, it's usually a solid indication it's very good."
This is a motion that I do not at all take lightly.
Self-help and self-improvement can be a bit of a hamster wheel.
He warned about the difference between being in motion and taking action and he explained it perfectly.
"But for someone like me, whose real aim is to write and publish books and blog posts, that's all motion."
I still have to sit down and think and type and edit and read and rewrite and type.
Sometimes we do need motion to plan or understand our path better.
Because you get caught up in the safe feeling of progress that being in motion gives you.
"What is immediately punished is avoided, this, according to James Clear, is the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change."
It used to make sense to place a premium on instant gratification.
"Meaning, how our brains process and evaluate potential rewards is, inconsistent across time."
We naturally place a higher value on the present and discount the future.
"Low time preference individuals will thrive, while high time preference individuals will get crushed."
"And the inverse is true for good habits, like saving and investing."
"Of course, the cheeseburger you ate at lunch won't make you fat."
The grueling workout you did yesterday morning won't make you trim and muscular.
The $100 you transferred to your retirement account won't make you wealthy.
"A night out with your friends, a few too many drinks, and poor night of sleep won't wreck your health."
James Clear gives the example of two different approaches of people who are trying to quit smoking when they are offered a cigarette.
"And the other says, No thanks, I don't smoke."
The second person is making a small but fundamental distinction with their response.
"It's not about what they are or aren't trying to do, it's about who they are."
"Instead of wanting to write a book, figure out how to be the kind of person who writes books."
"Or a physically fit person, what would a healthy person do?"
Start at the identity level first and then build out from there.
The how and the what components will naturally follow once you figure out the who part.
"After nearly one-hundred years of mediocrity, the British Cycling team was suddenly dominating the Tour de France and the Olympics."
This concept is not unlike compound interest which Einstein is purported to have called the eighth wonder of the world.
There's a good reason business luminaries from Warren Buffett to Mark Cuban extoll the virtues of compound interest.
"As James Clear writes in the book, You do not rise to the level of your goals."
I'd strongly encourage you to pick up a copy and read the rest for yourself.
"If you're struggling with your habits, this is very much a book for you."
I think it's a book that can in fact change your life.
"When I was a kid, we would go into the woods with machetes all day unsupervised."
"It was the South, OK?We would literally work for eight hours a day, hammering away at trees."
"Machetes aren't really made to cut down trees, so our little hands would get all blistered and bloody."
We had slices of American cheese in there for when we had to take a rain-break.
"But we grew since we built it, so we have to crouch now."
What if God was broken into pieces by the Devil and we had to put him back together?
We would decide to search the woods for artifacts that were the pieces of God.
"Souls of hurt family members, things we wished would happen, etc."
"I can't remember all of them, but I remember it feeling like a dream."
That might be the best story I have ever come up with - and I've written many stories as an adult.
Here's how to tap into the storytelling genius of your inner child:This is simpler than it sounds.
You can do this so everyone pays attention to the stories you tell at parties - or become a great writer of fiction.
You are stunned to hear that all their myths are almost exactly like the myths in your own culture.
"They had a flood story, a heroic savior story, and many more."
"He's arguing that religious myths are random and wrong, while science is solid and real."
"What he's missing is that religious stories have emerged independently worldwide, over and over."
"The point stands - if you got rid of the Bible, you'd see the same stories appear again and again."
"When I talk to my friends about this, I see a glassy look in their eyes right about now."
You don't need to know the specifics of how this all works to use it.
I certainly didn't understand any of this when I was a kid.
I didn't realize that I was tapping into universal myths by following my unfiltered intuitions.
"When you start, you're sure you're going to fall and hit your head."
"Eventually, you realize that skating is about letting go, loosening up, and doing what comes naturally."
Your inner child-storyteller is waiting to get out of you.
"You let them out by:You can't go back to being a child, so you need practice."
They're following a human need to learn how to exist in the world.
"If you're trying to write to be clever, I hate to tell you: you're fucked."
It's the storyteller desperately trying to understand how to be in the world.
"I don't care how moral I am, as long as you buy my writing and praise me."
"Give us enough time on the ice, we'll be fluid and beautiful, and people will want to watch."
Getting the mindset right with the proper background knowledge helped me to find my inner child.
"Dutch, at first, comes across as a compassionate and altruistic leader who takes in society's most downtrodden."
"Certain core gang members were even discovered as adolescents, Dutch taking them under his wing."
"There he has acted as a mentor, teaching them the valuable skills of reading, writing, hunting, and shooting."
His means of accomplishing this mission is where his darker nature emerges.
They blindly obey Dutch's every word - clouding the distinction between a cult and a criminal gang.
"Dutch's radical ideology is heavily influenced by the fictional in-game author and naturalist, Evelyn Miller."
"Interestingly, there are notable similarities between Miller and Dutch, underlining how closely Dutch had based his rhetoric on the former."
"Miller openly labels himself a fraud, having previously reaped the benefits of mingling within high society despite advocating a naturalistic lifestyle."
"Had Dutch existed during the 1960s, he would have manifested as a Manson-esque 'hippy' commune leader."
A final connection between Dutch and Miller concerns their relationship with marginalized communities.
"Miller was an outspoken supporter of ethnic minorities and, most controversially, the Native American plight."
The humiliation resulting from Bronte's betrayal deeply impacted Dutch's enormous ego and accelerated his transition to barbarity.
His association with Bronte further highlights the dangers he routinely imposes on his followers through his arrogance and incompetence.
"By the time of Dutch's eventual demise, he closely personifies Miller's observations."
"Greed and the thrill of danger propelled Dutch's lifestyle, although he was never capable of enjoying the rewards."
"Perhaps he would have entitled this piece, 'An American Nightmare'."
"Studio' also refers simply to the taught design element of their studies, and the groups that we teach in."
"Here's a summary of some of the approaches we experimented with, and that hopefully contributed to the positive experience."
It seems like they understood that us being able to see them made teaching that little bit easier for us.
Sorting out tech Before the need for online teaching my computer didn't have a microphone or a camera.
It also turns out that it didn't really have adequate processing power for video conferencing either.
I worked out how to join a session on my computer for video and also join simultaneously on my phone for audio.
Without fail I was impressed every time with the level of peer inquiry that this method engendered.
"The tradeoff has sparked a heated debate, but not all agree whether it's the right issue to focus on."
"After a barrage of complaints, Apple decided to delay the switch until early 2021."
"To be sure, Apple's change burnishes its image in the area of privacy protection, but it challenges advertisers."
"Earlier, Legg was the managing director of Ola UK and CEO of Ad Parlor."
You can require login to access your site or maybe to gain access to some extra functionality.
"Many believe the wording Apple will use in its pop-up will be something like, This app wants to track you."
"Most people, obviously, would get spooked by that and opt out."
There's a sense in the advertising industry that 70% to 100% of people will opt out.
This problem also applies to non-logged-in publishers and news sites.
"About 10% or maybe 15% is look-alike; again, no impact."
About 30% is demographic targeting using Facebook data; no impact.
"What's left is the retargeting bucket, which accounts for about 20% of our Facebook spending."
"About 10% of that 20%, so about 2% of revenue, is desktop."
"That leaves you with approximately 18%, and about half of that is Android, which is not affected."
"When IDFA goes away, that doesn't mean Facebook loses 9% of revenue."
They just won't serve the ads that use IDFA for targeting.
"Based on my experience at Google, my gut says Facebook's CPM pricing probably will drop around 10%."
"But other advertisers would probably be attracted, so the drop probably would be more like 0.5%."
"In fact, it could be one of those things nobody even notices because of all the other noise."
"The walled gardens and other well-run companies have good relationships with their customers, not just walled gardens."
"Ben returned to the UK to become COO of Google UK, Benelux & Ireland, and then COO of Google Europe."
There are many things that President Biden and the Democratic majorities in Congress should spend money on.
"Total economic output rebounded relatively quickly, thanks in part to Federal Reserve reassurances and the CARES Act."
"This massive redistribution of wealth had nothing to do with skill, hard work, or clever business strategy."
Some rich people like to pretend that their wealth results from their skills and hard work.
"But in 2020, the primary driver of wealth inequality was pure luck."
"A country is a community of people who live together, a little bit by choice but mainly because of a shared history."
"Second, the tax will have no negative incentive effect on corporations or investors."
"In the example above, Corporation X owes $15 billion to the Internal Revenue Service."
"No cash changes hands, but now the federal government owns a piece of Corporation X and every corporation like it."
This will have the obvious and beneficial side effect of reducing wealth inequality.
"Finally, the Pandemic Windfall Tax could raise a ton of money."
We would have to choose a period over which to measure stock returns.
"The tax should be levied on total returns to stock investors, including dividends paid out during that period."
"For the average return, we could use the total return on a broad stock market index such as the Wilshire 5000."
"Most importantly, we have to decide what percentage of the excess returns to tax."
"I'm using 50 percent here, but you could defend a higher figure."
"Netflix, the huge beneficiary of pandemic confinement binge-watching, would owe $35 billion."
"Because it is a one-time tax, it does not affect any incentives to work, save, or invest."
"When I woke up Monday morning, I knew it was going to be a shit day."
I'd spent the weekend coaching clients but made the mistake of not decompressing Saturday or Sunday night.
"This caused me to skip my usual wind down and bedtime routines, which affected my sleep and wake schedules."
One of the many perks of working for myself is the ability to make my own schedule and cancel entire workdays.
"So, before my feet even hit the floor that morning, I decided to cancel Monday altogether."
I would take care of my body and my home and worry about work later.
"So, at eight o'clock that morning, I set out to the market."
"The air was cold and fresh, but the sun was bright and warm."
"Snowbanks flanked the streets, and coarse rock salt littered the wet asphalt."
"There wasn't any skidding, just a slap, then a thud, and a series of bangs."
"My anxiety ran amuck as I drove past the scene - the battered van, shattered glass, and deployed airbags."
I drove cautiously for the short time it took for me to turn onto my street and pull into my garage.
It felt as if I'd been holding my breath ever since I saw the crash.
"So, as I closed the garage door behind me, I inhaled and then exhaled deeply."
"So much has happened, everything has changed, and I haven't stopped moving."
"What I can do, however, is be still and intentional, quiet and caring."
"I can find ways to strike a balance between work, family, and being kind to myself."
"It may seem this goes without saying, but mindful breathing isn't natural."
Deep breaths helped lower my rapid heart rate and kept me from hyperventilating.
Each drop of sweat represented disoriented and anxious feelings pouring from my body.
"Shower: After my workout, I took a long, hot shower."
"I took my time mindfully scrubbing the day away with my exfoliating gloves, which I absolutely cannot live without."
"My mind was clear, and my body was coursing with endorphins."
"Next, I turned my attention to my skincare - facial and body."
I vigorously massaged my muscles while applying lotion and oil and indulged in using my decedent facial products.
"After seeing the crash, finding my center became more important than before."
"It was about reclaiming my balance, putting work and other responsibilities on hold, and grounding myself in my pleasure triggers."
Monday became a day of gratitude and prayer and taking care of myself first before caring for others.
"It reminded me to stop rushing around, to breathe more, and to be thankful."
"Last week, the Tokyo Olympics organizing committee president and former Prime Minister of Japan made some controversial comments about women in meetings."
"If one person raises their hand, others probably think, I need to say something too."
"As Michelle Kim, CEO of Awaken, wrote previously about traumatic events,Michelle's advice?"
Let them know what you've been hearing and seeing in the news and that you're here to support them.
"For specific ideas of what to say, read Michelle's article."
"She provides a boatload of suggested phrases to use in team meetings, one-on-ones, and emails."
"Here's your somewhat regular reminder that a group can be diverse, but an individual cannot be."
"When it happens, I point it out and recommend they say someone from an underrepresented group instead."
"Yes, it can be a mouthful, but it'll start rolling off your tongue the more you use it."
Nappy is a free stock photo website aiming to break down stereotypes and improve Black and Brown people's representation.

Mindfulness can bring you into discovering the fullness of your own potentials at any stage of your life.
"Creativity can be a way of accessing your inner self, your spiritual depths even."
It enables you to express yourself in ways that ordinary daily activity is unable to do so.
"I don't mind if there are many people who do not like my creative expression, there are those who also do."
We are all capable of being creative in one way or another.
Even just making piles of stones on a beach into a small balancing tower can be creative.
"Picking flowers and putting them into vases is another joy , playing with colour and form but keeping it natural."
I was brought up believing I had no creativity because I was no good at art at school.
"I can't draw well at all , and my handwriting is appalling."
But it left a profoundly mistaken understanding in my mind about who I was and what I was.
"I remember one geometrical design I created for making a screen print from was two specific shades, yellow and purple."
It matters that I wear clothes that compliment or challenge each other.
There are also colours I cannot wear at all because they make me feel overstimulated.
But give me a beautiful drift of orange marigolds and I love their shiny golden faces.
"Softer versions of these colours are wonderful, shades of apricot or sunsets generally are alive."
Flowers of all colours work though because they are natural and muted by their green stems and leaves of course too.
"Later I went on to love patchwork, knitting, gardening, and embroidery."
"The latter I lost interest in soonest but the other three have remained enduring activities one way or another, throughout my life."
"I sort of knew it would happen when the time was right, even though it took me by surprise."
"So I seriously never thought of myself as creative, let alone a creative writer, more a doer of crafts."
And then I started to meditate and to practice mindfulness in as much of my daily activity as possible.
Since we both wear any of the same rather limited palette of colours that is easy to do.
"Then I started to recognise that I created good garden designs, both in layouts and in planting schemes."
"I love the different stitches and textures they create, and found myself wanting to recreate modern artists paintings into my designs."
I have a Mondrian shift dress which is for cold weather over leggings.
"I am experimenting with colour in blocks, stripes and many other creative ideas for all seasons."
I still have dysgraphia of course - can't handwrite or draw for toffees.
"But I can plan, invent, design, create, play with colour and do that in many different mediums."
"You might even be one of them, seeing as you are reading this article in the first place."
Changemakers are those that do more for the good of the whole.
"This is a simplistic definition, but at the heart of a changemaker is an unwillingness to settle for the status quo."
A changemaker will never utter the cursed sentence but we have always done it this way!
"I have taught at one public school, three international schools, one virtual school, and one Department of Defense school."
I have worked with talented colleagues who are 100% invested in the outcome of their students.
"I have worked with jaded colleagues who are overworked, underpaid, and undervalued."
"In every school where I have taught, there has been a group of changemakers."
"These are the teachers, admin, and staff who actively advocate for continuous school improvement."
They acknowledge the uphill battles and hard-earned wins to improve student learning.
"To be a changemaker takes tenacity, creativity, originality, and confidence."
Changemakers have the ability to mold a positive school culture where every stakeholder thrives.
"At one particular international school, I had the pleasure of working with ambitious, driven, and knowledgeable teachers."
"The environment was conducive to professional learning, with voice and choice provided to students and teachers alike."
"Due to open-minded administrators, my every question was answered."
"Since I was involved in the committees, I was able to ask more questions and offer more solutions."
My curiosity drove me to seek change and to become more involved with the school.
"A changemaker must be curious - ask questions, ruminate, seek help, find answers."
"At one particular school, I could name the teachers who were the most actively involved in coaching, activities, and committees."
It always seemed to be the same teachers who stepped up over and over again.
"As a principal, I knew the teachers I could go to when I needed help."
I knew the teachers who would jump in feet first with a positive attitude and a willingness to contribute.
What would it be like if we all bore that same attitude?
I am not implying that we don't do enough as teachers or that our plates are not already overflowing.
Sometimes a jolt of belonging is required to lift teachers out of the confines of their rooms.
"When teachers are active participants in the school community, parents and students notice."
Active participation creates camaraderie and a we are all in this together attitude.
Changemakers participate and stay engaged to further the mission of the school.
I have had the privilege to work with exceptional educators who model their beliefs.
I have learned from them and aspired to follow in their footsteps.
This belief seeped into the culture and became the norm and expectation.
He modeled his values and worked with the director to ensure they came to fruition.
"He never strayed from his belief and actively engaged the faculty in their own development, which further cemented his authenticity and genuineness."
"As teachers, we provide students with exemplars to provide guidance on assignments."
"Setting core values, and then failing to abide by them, is worse than not establishing core values at all."
They walk the walk and can be counted on to accurately reflect their beliefs and values.
"When changemakers are keen to present an innovative solution to a problem, they are seen as authentic voices in the process."
They wear their values on their sleeve and colleagues know what to expect.
This was most obvious when I was a teacher tasked with collaborating with several departments that were out of my specialty area.
My job was to ensure the needs of my students were met by helping support teachers in their use of accommodations.
I quickly realized that teachers have a diverse set of background knowledge and beliefs.
We all came from different environments that have shaped us into educators.
I had to come to terms with the fact that not everybody has to perform the way I think is best.
"As a Type-A teacher, this was a difficult transition for me."
"In order to change to happen, there has to be a disruption of some kind."
There is an acknowledgment that something can be done better or differently.
This can offend those that have always done it this way or those that struggle with change.
We are at the table precisely because we have a different opinion.
I have sat on many a committee where it was not easy to find a sustainable and agreeable solution.
Changemakers have to sift through the noise and find the common thread.
It took me a long while to realize that both sets of relationships are important.
"When there are mutual respect and admiration, conflicts can be resolved productively."
"When there is an honest intent to view another perspective, then everyone feels valued and heard."
"We all have our own experiences that shape us, and with this comes a multitude of opinions and beliefs."
Sometimes it is difficult to walk in someone else's shoes as Atticus Finch wisely advised in To Kill a Mockingbird.
"For true organizational change to occur, all stakeholders must be involved."
I am not going to pretend that it is easy to take on the role of a changemaker.
"We are busy with our classrooms, our families, our lives."
"To create a culture where changemakers thrive, school administrators need to lay the groundwork for an open-door environment."
The culture of the school must clearly reflect the value of continuous school improvement.
There must be an expectation that everyone in the building will continue to learn and grow.

The human brain possesses a remarkable capability that most take for granted and few fully appreciate: It can watch itself work.
And there's evidence that practicing this sort of mental self-awareness holds immense therapeutic power.
And Newman says that the kind of objectivity that self-monitoring produces is a critical component of CBT in all its forms.
Brewer says that something similar seems to happen when people pay closer attention to their own mind.
"Like a neglected bonfire, negative emotions tend to die out if they're not continually replenished with negative thoughts."
"Thoughts don't always give rise to feelings, but they definitely keep feelings going, Newman says."
"You can start discounting or discarding any information that goes counter to what you're feeling, she explains."
"We feel identical to our thoughts, and so we're held hostage by them."
"This concept of identity-thought decoupling goes by a lot of names, including ego dissolution."
That work on psychedelics has identified both thought self-monitoring and ego dissolution as core components of the therapeutic experience.
There are countless ways to wield mental self-awareness to one's advantage.
"The payoffs can be truly life-changing, but they require regular practice."
"I don't know that that's the case, but I suspect it is, he says."
"This noticing, he adds, is often enough to set one's thoughts on a different and healthier course."
It's now five years since Campo Santo's Firewatch was released.
"The text itself is beautifully written, tracing the budding romance and, later, the crushing pain of ordinary lives gone wrong."
"A subtle piano score pulls at the heartstrings, but with melancholy rather than simple joy or sadness."
"And the rest of the game is about confronting, dealing with, and accepting everything I just recounted."
"For the player, it can be about your own regrets or the things you've failed to face up to."
"It could be about your own love of the outdoors, of the peace that solitude provides."
"On the other hand, it could be about how you use parasocial relationships to avoid the pain of your real life."
"All the while the fire rages on the horizon, coming ever closer."
"Worst of all: could it be the government?Spoilers, of course, but no it's not any of those things."
"A camper and his son went spelunking, and the son - an inexperienced climber - fell to his death."
"The father holed up in the forest, unable to return to real life to confront his grief."
"And now, at the impetus of player-character Henry, this man may have to finally accept his son's death."
"But I'm so pleased that it exists, as a testament that games can be art."
"I'm really sad that Campo Santo's next project, In The Valley of Gods, appears to be on permanent hold."
"I had a large AIDS based dermatology practice when I graduated, and I was treating serious medical issues."
AIDS treatments at that time produced major facial fat loss and deformity to the point that patients carried the disease on their faces.
"So, patients that were now going to live a long life became concerned about their cosmetic appearance."
I was given only 5 minutes to speak whereas other speakers were given 30 or 60 minutes.
"When your data is not so strong, 30 minutes will do it."
"But when you have no data, 60 minutes will not be enough ."
I earned a standing ovation from that tough crowd and those techniques caused a revolution in the cosmetic field.
Are you able to identify a tipping point in your career when you started to see success?
Are there takeaways or lessons that others can learn from that?My definition of success is based on contributions in the medical field.
Loving what you do and finding that area in your field that excites you are key.
Is there a particular person to whom you are grateful who helped get you to where you are?
We spent hours and hours having academic discussions and certainly shaped my mind and views.
The global beauty industry today has grown to more than a half a trillion dollar business.
Can you tell us about the innovations that you are bringing to the industry?
In a field that used to have a major breakthrough every five years now is yearly.
The focus of my research over the past years has been the field of thread lifting.
"Unspoken because besides surgery, there are no products that reverse the effects of gravity."
Thread lifting represents an alternative to surgery for repositioning facial structures affected by gravity.
"I developed a unique method and threads for this purpose, the BussoLyft."
"Awaiting publication, this technique is being taught with great acceptance in the medical community."
It is exciting and inspiring to work in a field that most people are interested in.
"With advancements to our field happening every year, we are constantly breaking boundaries and I can't think of anything more exciting."
"As opposed to most fields in Medicine, patients are happy to see us and be in our office."
Patients see us are their allied that will help them navigate through the different cosmetic choices and are eager to start the journey.
Can you share 3 things that most concern you about the industry?
"Today, each doctor has a different approach to cosmetics yielding different outcomes."
Too much information is being disseminated without proper peer review or evidence.
Still many patients are making decisions based on outcomes whereas safety should always be the most important consideration.
Can you share a few ideas that anyone can use to feel beautiful ?
"When someone is having a cosmetic emergency and needs to look fabulous asap, we recommend our Red Carpet Preparation ."
It consists of an at home exfoliation followed by a CO2 mask.
"It will eliminate most wrinkles, give a glow that people will comment and will last for at least one week."
Most innovation that affects our field is being introduced from different areas and countries.
It's the only way to stay at the top of your field.
"In order to discern between so much information and select fact from fad, evidence-based recommendations are vital."
"Before stamping your name on a new product or procedure, take your time to learn about it and experiment with it."
"The trust of our patients is all we have, and we can never lose it."
We learn when it hurts so mistakes and side effects are incredible learning opportunities and signs that something needs to be changed.
"Follow social media to know what patients are looking for and adapt, quickly."
"However, it is our inner beauty what differentiates us, we are all beautiful."
Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?Failure is the first step of success.
I proudly share before and after images of my clients and answer questions.
"A successful career revamping Fortune 500 companies was not enough for her entrepreneurial spirit, so Jilea began focusing her passion in startups."
"For far too long, people with tender heads have suffered in pain."
How is this possible?How can two simple ingredients create such a wide range of delicious products?The answer in a word: process.
"As a full-time author, filmmaker, and blogger, I write over one million words per year."
"Each piece in the puzzle supports my mission, goal, and identity."
"Hopefully, parts of my system spark ideas that will work well for you."
I've been forced to get creative: I spend half my workday standing and half my workday lying down.
Never forget that all the greatest works in history were written in ink on parchment.
I want my first conscious decision of the day to be directed at my most creative task.
I do all my writing on a six-year-old laptop that I bought secondhand.
"If you want to maintain some semblance of posture, open up your stance with a split keyboard."
"It's lightweight, foldable, safe, and pro-posture."
"Plus, elevating your laptop increases airflow and keeps your hard drive cool."
Pair it with your new split keyboard and you can start handing out business cards.
"By the time lunch rolls around, I'm tired of standing and my feet are ready for a break."
"Rather than sitting and destroying my neck, I hop on the couch and throw on a pair of periscope glasses."
"They're easily the nerdiest item I own, and probably the best $12 I've ever spent."
"If anything, they make you less creative because they create distractions and put space between your hand and mind."
"I have five core habits that sustain my writing career: walking, writing, reading, and thinking."
"I honestly don't think I could publish books, direct films, or produce articles without all five."
"Right after I brush my teeth, it's out the door for a 15-20 minute walk by the river."
"I typically chat with several neighbors, get fresh air, and loosen up my body for the long workday ahead."
"If I go two days without writing, I feel the rigor mortis setting in."
The elevation gets our heart rate pumping and the conversation often leads to dozens of ideas for new articles and stories to tell.
This helps clear my head of the week past and gets me pumped for the week ahead.
"Discipline is great, but it's also subject to the law of diminishing returns."
"Life is just too dynamic to schedule with Marine-like precision, especially if you're a creative."
Free yourself from the tyranny of only people who wake up at 5 a.m. can be wildly successful.
Fixed-order scheduling beats fixed-hour scheduling any day of the week.
To force either person onto the opposite schedule would drastically decrease their effectiveness and productivity.
Better the imperfect system that works than the perfect system that doesn't.
"Do that, and you'll start to produce your very best work."
One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.
The hypothalamus is located below the thalamus and is part of the limbic system.
"In the terminology of neuroanatomy, it forms the ventral part of the diencephalon."
The hypothalamus is responsible for the regulation of certain metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic nervous system.
The importance of these changes can be recognized by functional differences between males and females.
"If the sexually dimorphic nucleus is lesioned, this preference for females by males diminishes."
Other striking functional dimorphisms are in the behavioral responses to ovarian steroids of the adult.
"Male and female brains differ in the distribution of estrogen receptors, and this difference is an irreversible consequence of neonatal steroid exposure."
"In primates, the developmental influence of androgens is less clear, and the consequences are less understood."
"Estrogen from the maternal circulation is relatively ineffective, partly because of the high circulating levels of steroid-binding proteins in pregnancy."
Image: List of the hormones found in the endocrine glandes on the nervous system.
"Other hormones secreted from the median eminence include vasopressin, oxytocin, and neurotensin."
There is evidence linking hyperactivity of HPA hormones to stress-related skin diseases and skin tumors.
"The hypothalamus coordinates many hormonal and behavioral circadian rhythms, complex patterns of neuroendocrine outputs, complex homeostatic mechanisms, and important behaviors."
"The hypothalamus must, therefore, respond to many different signals, some of which are generated externally and some internally."
"The PMD has important connections to the dorsal periaqueductal gray, an important structure in fear expression."
"Besides, animals display risk assessment behaviors to the environment previously associated with the cat."
"Such structures are important in other social behaviors, such as sexual and aggressive behaviors."
"Moreover, the premammillary nucleus also is mobilized, the dorsomedial part but not the ventrolateral part."
"Lesions in this nucleus abolish passive defensive behavior, like freezing and the on-the-back posture."
"In his twilight years, Charles Darwin looked back on his life with a big regret."
"He recognized one simple habit would have made him a whole lot happier, every day."
"He was right about this, as has been proven recently by neuroscience research."
It's a habit that's beyond the trend-radar of most of today's self-improvement writers.
Darwin felt his failure to read poetry led to a curious and lamentable loss of his higher aesthetic tastes.
He believed the lack of poetry in his life had fundamentally altered his brain and numbed his emotional life.
Darwin reflected:Darwin's instinct that poetry alters your brain and leads to happiness has now been proven by neuroscientists.
"Poetry, neuroscience shows, hacks into your brain and lights up your bliss circuits."
"Reading poetry, the research shows, gives you tingles and leads to feelings of happiness."
There is one factor that makes a difference: whether you finish the poem.
The researchers found that the strongest goosebumps arise at the end of a piece of poetry.
"If you want to give yourself happy feelings, this is good news."
You can adjust the dials of your brain's neurochemistry to unlock feelings of bliss.
It doesn't take hours of meditation or the use of psychedelics.
It can be as simple as reading a few lines in a poetry book.
Carrying a book of poetry in your pocket gives you instant access to bliss.
"As a writer and creative, I've discovered plenty of other ways poetry improves my life."
But there was a long time when I wasn't into poetry.
"For years of my life, I struggled to understand the point of poems."
"I found poetry difficult to understand, and I didn't get why people would read it."
It's only when I found poets that make sense to me that I started to love poems.
"There are all kinds of poetry, and it takes time to develop your tastes and find what you enjoy."
"Or you can give a couple of minutes each day for a month, reading one poem each day."
It's a habit that's easy to build because it takes such little time.
Here's what I recommend if you want to try out poetry.
You can also carry poems in your pocket using a mobile poetry app.
"One that I like is PoemHunter, which features over 1.4 million poems."
My favorite way to read poetry is in an old-school hardback book.
"If you're new to poetry, I recommend getting a taste for poems online before splashing out on a book."
"When you feel a poem lighting up the pleasure centers of your brain, search for more by that poet."
"Poetry is a journey, so dive in and enjoy the ride."
"Happiness is much closer than we think, hovering just below the surface of life."
But we forget to look for it - or we don't know where to look.
Don't live with the regret that you never gave poetry the time it deserves.
Enjoy the journey!We're offering a free course to all of our new subscribers as a thank you for your continued support.
"John Karpinsky May 24, 2020There is an ongoing question in Physics as to why Mathematics describes the physical universe so effectively."
This paper is an attempt to show an approach that might illuminate this relationship and enable progress toward some answers to this question.
"DefinitionsIn order talk about this subject, We need some new words to describe Mathematics."
The problem with most presently defined words is that they assume a tangible substance to intangible entities.
"As we can see, we have a noun, a verb, and an adjective."
"Information is constituted of the structure of physical things, numbers, numerical relationships, thoughts, algorithms, ideas, and abstractions."
The structure of physical things is separate from the physical things themselves.
"It could be a zero dimensional entity, or it could be an n-dimensional entity."
"The fundamental characteristic of inistence is that it is logically consistent, just as we try to make mathematics logically consistent."
That is why mathematics often times describes existent reality or the Universe.
There is much mathematics that has no known correspondence to anything physical.
The main characteristic of that type of mathematics is that the mathematician tries to make it logically consistent.
It could correspond to something physical that has not been discovered yet.
It has happened many times that mathematical structures discovered by a mathematician are found to describe something physical much later.
There will be difficulty in finding words to describe this relationship because our languages are developed for describing existence rather than inistence.
There will be times when a word that is used for the discussion of inistence that belongs to the realm of existence.
"No doubt that in time, we will coin new words for this newly defined realm."
"Symbols are the atoms of language, and language is also inistent."
"Other forms of inistence are ideas, thoughts, algorithms and other abstractions."
"For instance, Mathematics, as I have defined it, may be causative in the existent world."
"But thoughts that are created by a thinker, and are not necessarily causative, but we must be open to this possibility."
MathematicsI use upper case for Mathematics because I want to distinguish the inistent entity from the study of mathematics using symbols.
"We may need a new word for Mathematics, but I will use that word until I figure out a better word."
"Just as a word is not the entity that it names, a mathematical symbol is not the underlying principle."
"As far as we can tell, it is eternal and unchanging."
"AbstractionsAbstractions, on the other hand often are created to describe something in the physical world."
"We don't know if they are causative, but they help us make sense of existence and inistence."
"As far as I can tell, all the inistent categories are either Mathematical or Abstractions."
"Ideas, thoughts and algorithms are all part of the abstraction category."
"Even when we do mathematics, we are doing it in abstractions."
"Mathematics is eternal and unchanging, and Abstractions are affected by the existent Universes."
The laws of Physics are abstractions of the Mathematics that controls the existent realm.
I did not include mass in the definitions because that would be redundant.
Information TheorySo how can we approach the problem of finding out why Mathematics has such profound consequences in the Universe?
One way to start is to identify the areas where Physics meets inistence.
"I don't know if this avenue of inquiry will be useful, but it might."
"The information that is transmitted has no energy, but the signal that carries the information does."
Black HolesSome Physicists have the idea that information cannot be destroyed.
Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorn had a famous bet with John Preskill on that very subject.
"Stephen and Kip said that information could be destroyed, and John said that information could not be destroyed."
"I am not an expert on that, and I don't know what is true."
"This could be true, but that implies that all information inists always."
This is consistent with the concept of 4-dimensional spacetime and General Relativity.
"For instance, when something physical falls into a black hole, it carries information into the hole with it."
"Are these two types of information the same, or do we need another distinction between these forms of information?"
"They are both without energy, but one was created with the big bang and the other was created by a thinker."
"We seem to have two forms of information, but both are without energy."
"However, the information on the structure of the object that falls into the black hole is more problematic."
The failure to separate these types of information from one another may be causing some confusion.
"So, if I am right, There are two types of information."
A book falling into a fire will have both the information contained in the book and the structure of the book destroyed.
"Two Types of informationSo, what is the fundamental difference between these two types of information?"
Things made by the activity of a wave function cannot be destroyed because of the conservation of energy.
They can only be transformed by an interaction with another wave function.
The structures are formed by the interactions of the wave functions that make up the Universe.
The information into how these structures are configured has no separate wave function.
"So, my hypothesis is that any information with no energy is destroyed when the object carrying that information falls into a blackhole."
"And since the tidal forces at the event horizon are extreme, the objects themselves will be spaghettified."
"So, it is not surprising that information in the structure of the object is not conserved."
Only the wave functions of the constituents of the star are conserved.
"The idea that inistence is eternal has some disturbing consequences for the concept of predestination, because it implies that predestination is true."
Every idea or feeling or thought must happen because it is present in spacetime.
"This has always been an implication in 4-D spacetime, and General Relativity."
"But, as pointed out before, inistence has no time or place, but is dimensionless."
It may be that discovering inistence dimensional properties could be a key to finding out how the existent Universe is connected to inistence.
Quantum MechanicsThe development of quantum theory was a major advance in our understanding of the physical world.
Quantum theory was developed with contributions from many scientists all during the 20th century.
The all physical systems have a unique wave function which describes how particles will behave and interact through space and time.
These physical systems can be very large such as the whole universe or very small such as an electron or atom.
A scientist defines the physical system and uses wave functions to describe it.
One could think that the wave function is the inistent entity behind the existent physical structure.
I like that concept very much because there is one to one correspondence between the inistent reality and the existent reality.
Remember that the symbols used to do Mathematics are not the inistent thing itself but represent the inistent thing.
I think that we have the smoking gun here that shows a link between the inistent and the existent.
But it would explain much about the link between inistence and existence.
"From that, we can see that it is necessary that the physical entities must follow or obey the Mathematical structures."
It is possible the describe the same Mathematical structure using different methods and symbols.
It is just that using the Schrodinger equation's wave function correspondence to the physical system is easier to comprehend.
We need to find out how the Mathematical wave functions create the physical universe.
But it does explain why Mathematics dictates the behavior of the existent universe.
"If the inistent-existent correspondence hypothesis is correct, the ability to use mathematics to understand and control physical systems follows directly."
Defining inistence should clarify the difference between Mathematical entities and the symbols describing them.
This should help us solve the mathematical mystery by giving us a language that does not muddy the scientific waters.
"Richard Courant lecture in mathematical sciences delivered at New York University, May 11, 1959 ."
"Unless you're a technophobe, most of us are consumers of AI products today-"
"Whichever category you fall in, AI and its underlying technologies, are already here and everywhere."
"You may be asking, that's all well and good, but how can our company take advantage of AI?"
"On a personal note, I thought my computer science background would enable me to lead my team beyond bolt-on applications."
"However, I soon realized that I had vastly underestimated the scope of the opportunities."
The good news is that we made the right decision several years ago to focus on a key ingredient to AI - data.
"Because, there is no AI without data, this gave us further momentum towards a data first strategy and culture."
"First of all, I'm not aware of any Introduction to AI or course outline with zero pre-requisite courses."
"Years ago, our progressive CEO spent some time at Singularity University, an event that sparked our AI journey."
He later sent our entire executive team to attend a similar program aimed at Achieving 10x Growth by leveraging rapidly accelerating technologies.
I also benefited from a data science executive education program which contributed to my appreciation of Statistics and the science of data.
Some of these companies even hosted visits to their HQ in Silicon Valley to meet with their data science teams.
"What is the difference between AI, ML, and Deep Learning?"
"Detect Patterns - given a hypothesis or business problem, use data to identify patterns using various AI algorithms3."
I'll use an example that's foremost in everybody's mind since it has to do with our health.
Some of us may have paid a visit to our doctor with a lingering question - do I have cancer?
"However, as mentioned earlier, vast amounts of sophistication and algorithms lay below what is visible in our AI iceberg."
This imagines a future where 25% of human jobs are performed by androids.
"Unlike Terminator, this timeline occurs before the technological singularity, when machines reach the irreversible point of super-intelligence."
Large companies with billions of dollars in AI Research have made AI ethics and principles transparent.
"In the meantime, as our world evolves, let's start our journey and take our place in the AI ecosystem."

"Eventually, she started a company and succeeded beyond anything she'd imagined."
Watching her career trajectory shaped my thinking about being a working mom.
My mom was a mom-entrepreneur back in the 1980's before that term even existed!
I grew up knowing I wanted to have both a family and a professional life.
"After five years or so, I took the helm at my mom's company."
"I ran that for a few years, but at the time I had very young babies and wanted more time with them."
So I sold that business and spent six years as a stay-at-home mom.
"When I had the idea for momAgenda, I knew that was the one."
"I was overwhelmed, with too much to do and not enough time to do it."
"I rang the doorbell, the hostess kindly invited me in and poured me a glass of wine."
"We sat for about 30 minutes before I finally asked, where's everyone else?"
"Is there a particular book, podcast, or film that made a significant impact on you?"
I think in our society women are encouraged to follow rules rather than be authentic.
Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?My favorite quote is from Joan Lunden.
"For the benefit of our readers, let's define our terms."
"It's about the bigger picture of the customers' lives, who they want to be and how they want to live."
"It encompasses your aesthetic and your products, and it also encompasses your core values."
There's a freedom of expression you get from creating your own brand that you never experience working for someone else's company.
"What can one do to replicate that?I'm very impressed with Gwenyth Paltrow's lifestyle brand, GOOP."
"She's been able to create a very high-end, aspirational brand with a cohesive look and feel throughout."
That shows me people are willing to pay more when the branding really speaks to the customer.
That helps them to really meet the needs of their customers who want that special aesthetic throughout their homes and their lives.
What are the common mistakes you have seen people make when they start a lifestyle brand?
What can be done to avoid those errors?I think one common mistake is to follow other people's advice.
It's so important to follow your gut when creating a lifestyle brand.
Let's imagine that someone reading this interview has an idea for a lifestyle brand that they would like to develop.
"Find out who they really are, what they struggle with, what they're afraid of, what they really want."
Knowing your customers inside and out makes it easy to develop a brand that can connect with those people.
What are your 5 Things You Need to Know to Create a Very Successful Lifestyle Brand and why?
The mom-life crisis has become an epidemic in this country.
We as moms deserve better - we deserve the same love and care we give our kids and partners.
"It's called Overcoming the Mom-Life Crisis, and it's based on my own experience."
"We are very blessed that some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column."
Some of the digital-native brands who opted in this year did successfully spark consumer interests with their big game spots.
"According to Ad Age, Robinhood considered pulling the ad but decided to run it after seeing its users increase during the controversy."
"Instead, the company chose a Lord of the Ring-themed spot that promotes its fiber home broadband service."
"In the end, most brands chose the easy way out and avoided any reference to the pandemic entirely."
"Still, some brands decided to keep it real and gave some nods to the difficult times we are living through."
"In an effort to keep things light and non-controversial, most brands stayed away from politics and social issues this year."
You can guess which one fared better with the Super Bowl audience.
"Similarly, Hellmann's turned Amy Schumer into a Fairy Godmayo that helps people to dress up leftovers and reduce food waste."
"As well as being a web developer, it's also my job to land new clients."
"After all this time, I still sometimes find myself trying to convince prospects that my offer is right for them."
"And when I do get projects this way, they usually go badly."
That's not surprising -what we've come to recognize as selling is unfortunately more like persuasion.
"But the truth is that when the product and the customer are right for one another, pressure-selling isn't needed."
This is called a product-market fit: it means that what you offer aligns perfectly with what the client wants.
"Instead, they expend a tonne of effort chasing anyone they think will throw a dollar their way."
This is not the freelance dream - it is a quick path to unhappiness and burnout.
"I've never enjoyed sales, but it took me a long time to realize that I was doing it wrong."
"Every time you drop your prices to win a project, you're doing the hard sell."
"With each sales objection you overcome, you're engaging in pressure selling."
"Hustling like this can build character and resilience, but after a while, it just becomes a pain."
"Nobody wants to spend their days chasing potential clients - in the end, most of them say no anyway."
A better approach is to inspire prospects to reach out to you.
This is exactly what I've done to create a sustainable freelance business.
"When I started out freelancing I targeted small businesses .But as a niche, small businesses is too vague."
You need a target customer you can easily visualize in your mind.
"You can play with the sector, location, size of the business, or any other variable that springs to mind."
The point is to massively downsize your market so that you aren't wasting time targeting everyone.
You can speak directly to a subset of people as their go-to specialist.
But I'm guessing you don't advertise them on the sides of buses.
Don't move on to the next two steps before you do this.
You can't find a product-market fit if you don't have a market.
"But the fact is that if you don't have one, you basically don't have a business."
I'd even talk about the tech I use and include the WordPress logo as if my clients would be impressed by it.
Crazy!The obvious problem here is that almost every freelance web developer says pretty much the same thing.
"But having been through steps 1 and 2, marketing your service is now much, much easier."
That is because you have dramatically reduced your competition by downsizing your market.
"Anyone who owns a website will know how tough generating traffic is, particularly from search engines."
The goal is a steady stream of the right kind of customers coming to your website every day.
It is possible to achieve this by focusing your content on long-tail traffic.
Getting a page 1 position for this won't be too challenging.
So much has been written about so many things that being a generalist is becoming a fast way to fail in business.
"To get your message out there you need to create content ruthlessly for your chosen niche audience, forgetting everything else."
"Once you establish some authority in this space, targeted traffic will pour in."
I then spent several months developing my own system for bringing in the right clients.
"This system, the one I have outlined here, serves my business well."
"If you enjoyed this article, please consider registering for my newsletter."
It's a vocabulary that solves many design problems and as a result appear over and over again.
"So if you're struggling with user flows and tasks, consider leaning into some common design patterns to optimize your solutions."
So I'll pour myself a cup of coffee and head over to nytimes.com.
The navigation is repeated on the hamburger menu on the top left.
"After finishing the story, I scrolled down and saw additional stories I might consider reading."
What's interesting here is that I'm not looking at a list of headlines but at three different article lists.
"The biggest visual emphasis is placed on stories I'm likely to continue reading, since I'm already inside a fashion story."
"And it makes sense that 'Pop Culture' is next in hierarchy, since it's a larger category that contains fashion."
The list of 'Most Popular' is ubiquitous and generally associated with this format.
This purposeful approach helps guide users to content that will most appeal.
It's a good thing to keep in mind when presenting additional stories to your users.
"In the games section, my options are organized using the 'cards' design pattern."
I decide it's time to face the music of real news.
"While this might seem peculiar and counterintuitive, it's very likely a deliberate choice."
"Perhaps user research revealed that when subscribers played these games, they wanted full immersion and no distractions that pulled them away."
The fact that full access to their games requires a fee could have also played a hand in this approach.
"Already, we can trace ~15% of recent productivity growth to the use of industrial robots."
"This is the automation of physical work, and has not caused civilization-breaking problems yet."
"What we're seeing now, however, is the automation of intellectual work."
How exactly do you do that?There are a multitude of ways to create useful AI.
"The easiest to explain involves creating lots of robots and then breeding, testing, and culling them."
The end result of all of these methods is automation of intellectual work.
This type of automation reduces the amount of intellectual labor required without generating significant numbers of new jobs.
"Apple provides 2,000,000 jobs and is worth over $1 trillion, meaning a value of $500,000 per employee."
"Ford employs 190,000 people and is only worth $35 billion, resulting in a value of about $200,000 per employee."
Lots of ink has been spilled in arguing just how much AI and automation as a whole will impact the global labor market.
"The conclusion drawn was that while most agreed jobs would be lost, no studies agreed on even an approximate amount."
"Now, we must determine what impacts this will have on the economy."
You may notice that modern capitalism relies on many of the things AI is expected to have an adverse effect on.
"Capitalism works best with a large middle class, and AI will increase inequality."
"Capitalism depends on abundant competition, and AI is most efficient when used at large scales."
The basic idea is simple enough: replace most welfare with a government-provided check that goes to all citizens every month.
"While at first this proposal seems simple and logical, upon closer examination, problems become apparent."
"For now, we'll ignore the political challenges and consequences of axing most welfare."
The most obvious drawback is the immense cost UBI would place on taxpayers.
The question of how these funds are raised will play a large part in determining the effectiveness of UBI.
"It is reasonable to infer, then, that UBI may simply add to the inequality intellectual automation will cause."
"Instead of softening the impact of automation, Bill Gates and others have proposed a robot tax, which would penalize automation directly."
It is likely that a robot tax would only be effective if a large number of countries simultaneously implemented it.
Another large challenge when confronting automation will be the immense need for worker retraining.
Failing to provide adequate education facilities for these citizens will lead to more unnecessary unemployment.
"Multiple approaches have been suggested, from government-funded education, to corporate training programs."
"In conclusion, automation forces us to confront many simultaneous serious situations."
"At the same time, it promises huge gains in efficiency, standards of living, and productivity."
"And yet, right now, we aren't heavily investing in any of them."
"For the first time in human history, productivity is becoming separate from labor."
"It's time we decide, as a society, how to deal with that."

In 1993 armed with my first paycheque the first thing I did was to upgrade that to a Mega Drive.
"Not long after, I upgraded to a Mega C.D. and marvelled at such cutting edge titles as Sewer Shark and Night Trap."
"Sony made TVs and Walkmans, what did they know about making video games?"
"Over the next year, more and more games were confirmed for the system and my anticipation grew."
This mushroom looking device plugged into the top of the Mega Drive allowing you to play 32-bit cartridges.
Confusion also reigned when it came to the system's release dates.
The Saturn released in July of 1995 in the U.K. for £399.99.
"I'd given away almost 20 games just to play 2 new ones, a decision I regretted almost immediately."
Here's where the cracks started to appear in my theretofore healthy relationship with Sega.
"Everything seemed to come out much earlier on PlayStation, was cheaper, and seemed to be a better version."
"It released in September of 1995 on PlayStation, and I played it with a friend on his console for months."
"It was January 96 before it came out on Saturn, it was £10 more expensive and didn't play as well."
I stood by my purchase and kept buying and playing games until late 1997.
"Arcade conversions kept on coming, F1 Challenge, Manx TT Superbikes and Athlete Kings."
Looking back it feels like all Sega thought they had to do to win the console war was to turn up.
"For every great franchise like Panzer Dragoon or Nights into Dreams, Sega made awful decisions like not releasing a Sonic game."
"Crash Bandicoot became the unofficial Sony mascot, Nintendo obviously had Mario but Sega's mascot skipped the whole generation."
"Learn about important tax and accounting terms including bookkeeping, tax types, filing, revenues, self-employment, and more."
Welcome to this Q&A article that answers some of the fundamental questions you might have about your freelance taxes.
Accountants are qualified professionals who can advise you on your unique situation and help you prepare and file your taxes.
"Consulting with an accountant about your personal situation, freelance business finances, and tax needs will ensure you're getting everything right."
Keeping up with your bookkeeping will let you understand the money that's coming into and going out of your freelance business.
I've created a guide discussing areas like business bank accounts and other basics you can get in place.
"Personally, I use accrual accounting for my freelance business - and accrual accounting is supported by bookkeeping software."
You can use the information from a P&L report to accurately capture important information for your tax return.
It shows the amount of money you have in your business at a specific time.
The tax software you use and your accountant can normally take care of this for you.
I've created a series of freelance tax guides that can help you understand what you need to do.
"You can use online tax filing software like TurboTax, H&R Block, and others."
This type of software generally has a fairly extensive user guide that will help you understand how to file your taxes.
"Once you've reviewed the results, you can then file your taxes electronically through the software."
"Your revenue is the total amount of income you've earned through freelancing, before deducting your business expenses."
Business expenses are the products and services that your freelance business spends money on to allow you to do your work.
"Typical expenses for a freelancer include things like home office deductions, computer hardware and software, payment processing fees, and similar."
"You typically only pay taxes on your profits, so expenses reduce your tax liability."
Learn more about freelance expenses and see my guide to the expenses you may be entitled to.
Your accountant will explain if that applies to you and what you need to do.
"In most cases, a sole-proprietor or a single-member LLC will be the most straightforward type of business structure."
"In some cases, though, it might be worth considering other options."
I've created a guide to freelance business structures for tax purposes.
"Instead, you file your 1040 tax forms along with the appropriate schedules to cover your freelance business and taxes."
I still remember sitting behind the family computer in the early 2000s and popping in my scratched CD of The Sims.
That quiet joy in losing yourself in different stories and characters has left me with pleasant childhood memories.
Even now I can hear the piano chords when you switch to Building Mode.
"Each time I load up the game, it feels like I'm returning home."
The Sims franchise holds a special place in the memories of so many.
"During the pandemic, I returned to it for comfort and a chance to breathe."
"That magic is only possible thanks to the creative minds, developers, and artists behind it."
"One artist that helped bring Sims 4 and its expansions to life is Nina Modaffari, a Maxis concept artist."
Most of us were kids and teenagers when The Sims game came out in 2000.
I think it was the expansion 'Makin' Magic' that got me interested in the game's art.
I remember seeing nothing else like it and being so impressed by the creativity of it all.
What is your role in the development of Sims 4?Nina: I am a concept artist!
I love pushing shape language and creating memorable silhouettes with my characters.
I prefer bright and colorful pieces and a good dose of rimlight for fun.
"I'd never worked on something so unique before, and I really think that it came out amazing."
We also take this time to get feedback from the art director or work together to solve difficult design questions.
It's making sure everyone is on the right track and also to see what great work everyone else is doing.
I usually wrap up the day around 7 pm and get ready for dinner -
Knowing that there's always more for you to learn is a lesson that I learned quickly -
Were you always interested in being an artist in the game industry?Nina: Absolutely.
"From the time I first played video games, I remember wanting to be a part of the industry."
It's really awesome to see people creating characters with assets that I designed.
I've been excitedly watching you and your art grow over these past years!
"I remember distinctly getting art books and flipping through the pages, and it just clicked with me."
I went to Laguna College of Art and Design and graduated with a Bachelors in Game Art.
The concept art field is highly competitive and sometimes it felt like there weren't many opportunities.
"I ended up spending two years doing contract art for companies like Bandai Namco, Hi-Rez Studios, and more."
"I think a game that had a huge impression on me was Dishonored, because of the amazing character and environmental design."
"Everything in that game looked like an oil painting, and the creative decisions were absolutely fantastic."
Is there a specific type of design that you enjoy doing the most?
Environments?Nina: I'd definitely say designing outfits is one of my favorite things to do!
I also really enjoy tabletop roleplay games because it's a way for me to express my creativity without actually having to draw.
Sometimes all it takes is one email to the right person at the right time to get a response back.
"Success isn't linear, and sometimes there will be bumps along the road."
Your work in The Sims 4 has brought incredible joy to the lives of many.
A special thank you to EA and the Maxis Studio for sharing The Sims magic with us today.
Can't wait to see what comes next!Make sure to follow Nina Modaffari here and check out her portfolio.
You'll need to be able to answer this question very well in order to convince investors to take a chance on you.
"Jack Conte, co-founder and CEO of Patreon, learned this lesson when he started trying to raise capital."
"Fortunately, the fact that Jack himself is an ideal Patreon user worked in his favor."
"Seven years ago, he decided to create a music video that included manufacturing a singing robot."
"Yet, despite his YouTube popularity, this creation only made him about $150 in ad revenue."
"So, he came up with a way for creators to make more money for their art: Patreon."
"He teamed up with his former college roommate, an engineer, to bring the idea to life."
"Two weeks after launch, Jack - Patreon's first creator - was making six figures as an artist."
"But when Patreon began fundraising, the startup was plagued with rejections."
Investors just didn't understand the target market enough to tie their bank account to it.
"Though Patreon ended up being quite successful at fundraising, Jack says nothing ever went as planned - it was always a struggle."
"We were just getting no, no, no, no no, over and over and over again."
"After each rejection, they called the investor to seek honest feedback and learn more about why he or she declined."
They wanted to figure out what the disconnect was so they could improve their pitch for future meetings.
Then we'd build stories and quantitative and qualitative models to get over those blockers.
"One of the biggest concerns investors had was: What is the creator market, and how big is it really?"
"From that point forward, he started every pitch meeting with that deck in order to set crucial context."
They just had to figure out how to adequately explain that to investors.
"When Jack first started pitching to investors, he felt intimidated and out of his element."
"I'm sitting at these tables in Silicon Valley, looking at investors, and I'm a YouTuber, he says."
"But, ultimately, it just didn't align with who he is."
"So, Jack made a vital adjustment: He threw away the pretense and decided to be himself."
"Instead of harping on numbers, he leaned into Patreon's origin story, excitedly telling the tale of his robot music video."
"And I went crazy on this music video, and only got paid 150 bucks for it."
"Telling them my story showed investors that we fulfilled those criteria, Jack says."
"For Patreon's seed round, Jack and Sam pitched between 20 to 30 investors with the hope of raising $700,000."
"When Jack told the other interested firms the round was full, some pushed back."
They encouraged the co-founders to raise more money so they could also take part in the seed round.
"Eventually, Jack and Sam agreed, and the round closed at $2.1 million."
Choosing to increase your goal isn't a decision to be made lightly.
"But if someone is practically begging you to let them invest, definitely consider it."

You probably think Amazon's online retail division where you buy batteries is massive and you wouldn't be wrong.
Yet AWS brings in over half the profits of the entire company on just 12% of the total revenue.
Amazon is a cloud computing company with a side hustle of dominating global online retail.
Everyone has heard of Jeff Bezos; both his flaws and gifts.
It's almost reassuring to understand the mindset behind someone with such immense power in the world.
They rush to create sleek brands and pick names with missing vowels.
They want to fix a problem most people didn't even realize they had.
They chase revenue numbers to brag about while at the same time have no idea how they will make a profit.
It took 3 years from ideation at a retreat with all the top Amazon executive to the first proper product launch for AWS.
He never made revenue predictions or oversold what the division would become.
The user experience of AWS is a nightmare except for people well-versed in the tech world.
This is a product built for people in the know and there was no attempt to dumb it down.
"Many businesses ran their own servers, which was often hell because of the expense and lack of flexibility."
It was an unwanted burden thought necessary because it was the only safe way to store data.
The big transformational win came from the CIA who migrated from a legacy IBM system.
If the Central Intelligence Agency could trust Andy Jassy's AWS then so could the rest of the world.
They paint being an employee as living torture and claim people need to open their eyes and be free.
Andy's AWS division was valued at an incredible $500bn by the Economist.
Not bad for a guy who kept the same boss for 24 years.
It started as a technology designed to help Amazon develop new products faster but the wider market opportunity was clear.
No other company could have started building similar software and have a tech giant as a client from the start.
The Financial Times notes how often he uses company slogans to make points in his interviews.
Sometimes it pays to stay at a company and be fully immersed.
"Usually, when an idolized founder-CEO announces they are stepping down, the stock price takes a hit."
People struggled to imagine Microsoft without Bill Gates or Apple without Steve Jobs.
It's not only the investors who think Amazon may be better under Andy.
"According to a survey, 90% of employees believe work-life balance will be improved under the new regime."
The majority believe it is a good decision to make him CEO despite many taking a wait-and-watch approach.
It shows he is more focused on what matters than the whole world knowing how good he is.
It seems Amazon is in good hands and scarily it seems Andy thinks the company has barely begun.
"During data cleaning and exploration, I am sure that everyone would agree that missing data is often encountered."
"Moreover, I usually get from people, What should I do with the Missing Data? ."
"For that question, let's define the missing data and the missing data classifications."
"In statistics, Missing Data is a condition where no data value is present in the variable or observation."
"It is different from the category Nothing or None or anything else, stating that this data belongs to some category."
"While it is not wrong to do this, it depends on the missing data reason."
"Removing missing data in the MNAR condition could lead to bias, while removing missing data in the MCAR condition would be safe."
"By far, this is the most simple approach, and many people use it."
What you need to do is remove the row which contains the missing data.
Because you still need to see what kind of missing data we are dealing with.
Depend on the classification I explain above; Missing data is data itself if you classify it right.
"In my opinion, imputation is a much better way than deleting data."
"It fills the data, assuming that the missing data would follow the variable's most frequent data."
"We have missing data in the age variable, and we want to fill it."
"Instead of taking the Age's mean, we could take the Age to mean for the Male gender."
This method's weakness is that we would reduce the variance within the variable as we take the data on its own.
Another way to fill the missing value is by filling it with a 0 or some constant number.
It works well with categorical variables but sadly would introduce a lot of bias if you use it to numerical variables.
The prediction comes from the closeness of the new data point with the training data.
K-NN method requires the selection of the number of nearest neighbors and a distance metric.
We set the K as an integer number and setting an appropriate distance metric based on the variables.
"Continuous Data: The commonly used are Euclidean, Manhattan, and Cosine2."
Multiple Imputation is better than a single imputation because it measures the uncertainty of the missing values better.
"For more information on the algorithm, you can check the Research PaperWe could test the method by a dataset example."
"If you do not have the impyute module, you should install it first."
"This is the mpg dataset that we have; if we examine it further, the 'horsepower' variable contains missing data."
We might then want to fill the missing data by using the horsepower and weight information as it is correlated.
"When it is finished, you could check the missing data once more, and it surely filled by the MICE imputation."
"To Whom It May Concern,I'm kidding, don't give me that look."
"We both know formality has never been my strong suit, so settle in for a ramble."
"Yours will be the only letter I bother with, but don't read too much into that."
As though death were a superstition and we had just stumbled upon a ghost.
"To come so suddenly upon such a stark token in our verdant playground was bewildering, and more than a little unsettling."
"All I could do was grimace, put up a tough front, push the shivers back down my spine and smile."
"Truth be told, it frightens me still, though the smile comes easier."
"A terrible reminder at the time, they've come to be something of a comfort."
"And as you can probably imagine, I've had plenty of time for contemplation lately."
Their bones lay not where they have fallen but where they lived.
Take all the pieces of me and sow them through our valley.
Tie stones to sternum and drop the cage in the lake around where we used to swim.
"Rig up the hyoid where the wind can whistle through it, like how we whistled our ditties flashing through the switchgrass."
"Lay scapula across our roof, where we would watch the water trickle through in the fall."
"Let the warblers nest beneath the sacrum's shield, make for the sparrows a perch of clavicle."
String finger-bones from the old boughs we bent and stake up their saplings with sinewy humerus.
Put my memory to rest in the quietest room of your mind.
"Forget me when you smile, and live your life as bold as we lived those springs."
And when you braid my wreath braid it of your favourite flowers and place it atop your own head.
Spellbreak is a multiplayer game from Proletariat that takes a slight variation on the traditional battle-royale shooter.
They've swapped the traditional weapons of guns and grenades for magical gauntlets.
"Spellbreak has a visually compelling UI that makes great use of audio cues, reminding me a bit of KOTOR."
"When a player clicks Invite , the game doesn't offer any indication that the invitation was sent."
One scenario to consider would be if the player clicks the Collections tab after inviting friends to their lobby.
"On the Play tab, the function of the Party button is unclear."
I address some of the Play tab's UX later in this article.
"As an Ubisoft product, Hyper Scape utilizes the Uplay interface for the majority of the invite experience."
The player doesn't feel the need to spam the invite action because they receive confirmation.
"The color of the notification also blends in with the neutral background of Uplay's interface, making it hard to see."
This could be improved by replacing the current notification with a higher contrast version in a more prominent location on the screen.
After sending an invite the player has to manually close the Uplay interface.
Controls could also be added to allow the player to cancel a Squad invitation.
If groups of two are more popular than I would opt for my proposed solution.
"For Spellbreak, I would take a feedback and information-centric approach to the lobby invite experience."
"Adding two basic notifications, one for invite sent, and one for player joined, would improve the experience."
"On the Friends page, there were a few features that were a bit confusing for me."
"Second, the status indication is broken up into two different places on the Friend UI component."
The green dot on the left indicates that a friend is online.
The text label on the right-hand side tells you if they are in a lobby or in-game.
"First, I would tweak the Friends section so that it appears as one list without duplicates."
I would also add a tooltip to the platform logo that clearly states what the Epic Games icon means to eliminate any guesswork.
This clarifies that there are actions tied to each Friend in the list.
I noticed playing Spellbreak was the class selection and readying-up experience.
The game combines the UX for class selection and readying-up into one button.
"Currently, a player has to click Ready , then select their class, and finally click Confirm to lock in their choice."
The ready-up button is also labeled as Ready and has no mention of class selection.
"Having played other battle-royale type games, this behavior was unexpected."
A second issue I see is that the game does not remember the class selection from the player's previous match.
This has caused me to run the Pyromancer gauntlet more times than I would have liked.
Let's take a look at how Apex Legends handles this sort of interaction.
"In Apex, the act of readying-up is separate from class selection."
"Their selection persists, so they don't have to perform this action between matches."
What could be improved with the Apex experience?I would move the Legends selection from the top navigation down to a button above Ready.
"In contrast, changing load-outs or visiting the store is not directly related to in-game performance."
"I would also relabel the button as Switch Legends , since Legends does not sound actionable."
I tried improving the Spellbreak class selection UX by separating it from the Ready action.
"Ideally, each player's class selection will be saved so that a new game is only one click away."
"A lot of people I played with agreed, wishing they could change their gauntlet right up until they drop into the match."
A bonus of adding a feature like this is that players may be less likely to leave games early.
"If they realize they chose the wrong gauntlet, they can switch instead of quitting."
I've had teammates disconnect while playing squads and have had to play quite a few matches without a third.
"As a new player, the post-match screen was a little confusing."
"When players acquire a new item, it's not inherently clear what the item is."
That's not to say the rest of the page isn't clear and well thought-out.
This makes a lot of sense because it helps the player associate their match performance with the receipt of a new item.
It's a refreshing change from the guns and gore of traditional arena-based multiplayer games.
I highly suggest checking out the game - it's free to play!
I'll close with a recent highlight of a match I played a couple of days ago where I landed a 5k.
This is almost certainly true - but only for the next few years.
"Currently, charging companies supply electricity as a loss leader, since EVs cost considerably more than the equivalent conventional vehicle."
It's a version of the freemium model - cheap until you are hooked.
"EV sales will naturally rise, and they may even go mass-market."
"At that stage, charging station proprietors will be liberated to raise the price of an electricity fill-up."
"It's true that the future of EV ownership will look simpler and cheaper, since electric vehicles contain relatively few parts."
"As evidence, look no further than Europe, where EV sales are the highest in the world."
"In the future, he said, Volta will raise prices for fast charging, but only a bit."
"Fast charging won't be free, but it will be priced modestly per kWh, he said."
Lancaster disagrees with my thesis that fast-charging prices are likely to be modeled on the tank of gasoline.
"That is the EV future - a frequent demand for fast charging, supplied at a premium."
"He, like me, had already had a decent amount of prior success."
There are a lot of ways for entrepreneurs to answer that call.
"My own calling is Teaching Startup, startup advice and answers on demand via a newsletter and app."
So of course I was interested to learn anything I could from his experience.
"His assessment is not only spot on, but it's also not uncommon."
There's actually a ton of available help out there for entrepreneurs.
"But people don't buy technology, they buy the benefits of that technology."
Teaching Startup is the alternative to decades of the same startup help offered the same way.
That experience includes starting and selling a company called ExitEvent that reimagined startup help once before.
"I removed friction, cut unnecessary fluff, and moved the most important and valuable parts from the back to the front."
Then I quickly went from prototype to MVP to pilot to the real thing.
"I'm building and running it like a startup, so I want to see if you agree."
"If you want to cancel, you can do that from any email."
Others have gone from independent schools to public schools to save money.
"At the same time, some public school families have gone private, fleeing the chaos of the public school system."
Schools are left wondering - will the students who left come back?
"And is virtual learning going to be part of our new normal?In this uncertain time, loyalty has never been more important."
"But back when I was falling in love with Netflix, it was early."
I begin to notice that many organizations were focusing on access over ownership.
The second thing I noticed was that their most important metric was retention.
People are much more likely to stay if they're watching both rom coms and documentaries for example.
I wish more people focused on retention more carefully - it's just not a very sexy metric.
"And engagement is the early predictor of retention - recency, frequency breadth and depth of activities."
The third thing I noticed was that they were continuously experimenting with the how of their delivery.
"They tried time sensitive downloads, streaming through video game consoles, and all kinds of content."
"The service they offer today looks nothing like the red envelopes of 2002, but the promise is the same."
"So how does this apply to schools?Well, the first thing is the importance of a clear forever promise."
Your brand promise is the promise of what your organization stands for.
What is it that you promise them in exchange for their loyalty and support?
"If you have a public promise and a secret promise, that can lead to complexity, confusion and other challenges."
"The second thing, retention - this is the heart of loyalty."
There is often a period after someone joins your organization when they're still wearing their consumer hat.
"They're still thinking about whether the should stay, and how they might leave."
"The superusers go beyond just being good members, because they contribute their own time and money toward the good of the organization."
Superusers are the students who build community and take on the less popular leadership roles.
"If you're a school head, I want you to think of a superuser who you wish you had more of!"
"At what moment did you take off your consumer hat, and become a member, not looking for alternatives?"
And when and why did you decide to start volunteering and donating?
It's often a personal friendship and invitation that launches the superuser journey.
If your forever promise is creating global citizens what is the best way to deliver on that promise in today's environment?
And yet many newspapers have been dragging their feet in the shift from print to digital.
"You could go beyond content to include the powerful triumvirate of Content, Commerce and Community."
"In some ways, COVID, the political divide, the movement for racial justice have created tremendous upheaval."
"But with that upheaval comes permission to move more quickly, to experiment more radically."
Organizations that have historically innovated only slowly and methodically are now racing to solve problem after problem as they emerge.
"Look at what you're offering your students, parents, and alums, today."
"If you were starting fresh, what else would you do to help them achieve their goals and reduce their problems?"
"How do you teach an AI to walk?Generally speaking, you don't."
"Then you step back and let it learn, and often marvel at the results."
"A recent paper entitled The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution, published by a conglomerate of European and North American researchers,"
"Eventually, it learned to sort of somersault upon landing, thereby walking a bit further."
"As humans, we tend to expect human-like behavior from AI anyway."
"The more intelligent something appears, the more we tend to see ourselves in it."
"The android Bishop does the latter in Aliens, with his calm pragmatism and self-sacrifice."
"Simulating human conversation, in fact, turns out to be one of the hardest tasks facing AI experts."
Even the most advanced AI is still idiotic at certain things that humans do as a matter of habit.
"They don't generally understand analogies, make leaps of insight, or synthesize unconnected information into more abstract concepts."
"They're rarely able to consider context or environment, or to break a cognitive thread and pick it back up again."
"They're not empathetic to humans, because they're not humans."
"This kind of useful ignorance can shine a light on our own assumptions, and lead to extraordinary creativity."
"Properly directed, AIs have the potential to be world champion out-of-the-box thinkers."
"Those assistants are going to get a lot smarter, but they're never going to be human."
"But it's not going to make them experience the world like humans, or behave like them."
"And really, there's little reason they should, except to make us more comfortable."
"When you imagine AI interfaces of the future, don't think of talking to a pseudo-human."
"Read practically any guide to canine discipline or behavior, and the central message is invariably one of respect for canine otherness."
"Common techniques like using firm, repeated commands when communicating, and establishing yourself as a pack leader all arise from this concept."
"Computers aren't dogs, but the underlying idea of respecting an alternate form of intelligence is similarly helpful."
This can blind us to its potential uses as well as its misuses.
"AI algorithms have helped spread fake news on Facebook, and pushed inflammatory videos on unsuspecting YouTube viewers."
"In the case of AI, though, humans are also the ones creating the environment in which they evolve."
We can't build other humans - only nature can do that.
Football is considered one of the most beautiful games because of how unpredictable it is.
"Underdogs' wins and comebacks make some games hard to predict, even for expert bettors."
"However, things change when it comes to making a model that predicts all the games in a league."
"It's no coincidence that the winners of La Liga, Serie A and Bundesliga were almost the same in the last decade."
Let's predict football games matches for the top 4 European leagues!
"We need three inputs to build the model: historical data, the current table, and the matches left."
"Luckily, the historical data of football matches in many leagues are ready to use in CSV format on this website."
"Although the website contains football data for many seasons, I'll only consider the past 5 seasons."
There's some debate about how much historical data is necessary for building a model.
"In my experience betting on football, I consider the last 5 years enough to make good predictions."
"Football clubs, rules and players change a lot over the years."
I also used this data to build a profitable betting tool with Python's Selenium and Pandas.
There are many websites that show the current positions and the matches left in many leagues.
I already built a CSV file with the table and upcoming matches for the top 4 leagues.
We should always know the math before writing any code and this time is no exception.
This is a histogram of the number of goals in every match over the past 5 years for the top 4 leagues.
"We could add more variables to increase the accuracy of predictions, but for now, let's do it the easy way."
So we're dealing with a discrete probability distribution of the number of events occurring in a given time period.
In our analysis lambda would be the median of goals in 90 minutes.
"This could be the median of goals of a home team, away team or in the league."
"Team B.To predict the winner of a match, we need to calculate a team's strength within a league."
Below you can find an example of the strength of Premier League teams.
This function uses the previous one that calculated the strength of each team.
"Also, we need to set limits for the number of goals used in the simulations."
"Instead of writing the formula, we use poisson.pmf function from the scipy library."
"The result would be classified into 3 categories: win, loss or draw."
The prediction for the 4 leagues are the following:Here you can find the result of each game in the season.
"However, before placing a bet, you should also consider the underdog's chances of winning the match."
"Hopefully, at the end of the season, I'll be able to make a better comparison."
"For example, in the analysis of a football match, I only considered head to head historical data."
"In real life, this would not be enough for me to place a bet."
I'll still need data about the performance of the home team playing home and away team playing without the home advantage.
"Let's be honest, the title Graphic Designer is not as glorified and romantic as it once was."
"You know, the people who have a knack for the visuals."
"Oh great, here comes another perseverance chat about working day and night and never giving up ."
"One of my favorite quotes from a popular career advisor and radio personality, Ken Coleman, states,"
"If your why doesn't make you cry, the price of commitment will ."
"There will never be the perfect time, opportunity, book, course, teacher, etc."
The difference between those who find success and those who don't always starts with taking the first step.
One of the practical ways that I firmly believe makes switching from graphic design to user experience possible is obsessing over it.
The people saying that are the same ones that are worried that you are going to succeed and take their job one day.
I have always been a learn-by-doing person who dives head first into the deep end.
Some people prefer to dip their toes in and test the waters.
But I believe the quickest way to familiarize yourself with an arena is to go all in.
I looked stupid moments which is the perfect recipe for explosive personal growth.
"If you get uneasy, anxious, and fearful about new things being shaken up, you are normal."
But I believe it is important to recognize that feeling for what it is and push past it.
"Process oriented, homework first mentality, and the ability to ball up your ego and throw it in the nearest garbage can."
The main thing they share is that at their core they both center around solving problems.
It has become a cliche but failing teaches you more than success ever will.
"From genes to lifestyle, from exercise to diet, many things matter."
"To make it even more complicated, these different factors interact with each other."
"Likewise, the effect of calorie restriction appears to differ among individuals with different genotypes."
"So, it's about the genes after all, then?Well, only partially."
But what matters too is how you use the genes you have.
"More specifically, we're starting to unravel the importance of gene expression and regulation."
"For example, in aging brains, changes in gene activity lead to several manifestations of aging."
"In that example, though, individuals still have a different genetic 'starting point'."
What if we use individuals that are genetically identical and raise them in the exact same environment?
"That's what researchers did in the tiny roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, as I detailed here."
RNA interference is a technique where designed RNA molecules are used to 'interfere' with the DNA →protein process.
This 'silences' a gene since the protein it codes for is no longer made.
"U.S. regulators confronted a similar problem in the wake of the 2008-09 Global Financial Crisis, with surprising success."
"This new challenge is far more daunting, however, and the stakes much higher."
A central policy challenge that emerged from the Global Financial Crisis was the problem of Too Big to Fail.
Studies analyzing post-2010 data have found that large banks are not receiving any material benefit in the pricing of their debt over smaller firms.3
They achieved a metaphoric miracle: they un-rang a bell.
"Now, post-COVID, Congress and the regulatory community face a far greater challenge."
Experience with the government sponsored enterprises - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - provides a disturbing precedent.
"Implied backing became actual backing in 2009, and that bell continues to ring more than a decade later."
"If for any reason that support were ever withheld, the results would be devastating."
"And, so, on our present course, it never will be withheld."
"Here, demand could be reduced in two ways, directly or indirectly."
"Money market fund reform seems most obvious, as two crises appear to have demonstrated its problems."
"For reasons too obvious to state, this option appears dead for the foreseeable future."
Hence the need for the Fed to make unprecedented interventions in these markets.
"See Federal Reserve Board, Agencies announce joint determinations for living wills, Dec. 19, 2017: and Federal Reserve Board,"
They also find that the decline in bailout probability has reduced the market value of banks by nearly one-third.

"Being an early adopter of the entrepreneurship mentality, Nick launched several small entrepreneurial ventures throughout middle school and high school."
"The first year it totally failed.. out of a total 250 people that could come, only around 25 showed up."
"But I knew I was onto something, I just needed to go all in."
I spent the next year planning one of the biggest parties I could think of.
"In May 2015, I hosted Club for Cancer Neon paint party."
We ordered 80lbs+ of paint powder and sold out the concert in under 2 weeks.
That night I raised over $3k for cancer awareness and knew this was what I wanted to do.
Club for Cancer was the start of one of the most insane entrepreneurial journeys of my life.
"I was young, naive, and didn't understand how the whole business worked."
"But every single one of those small, or big, failures is what is guiding me to success today."
Him and I are always at odds on decisions and thats what makes us great together.
"He hates risk, doubts everything, is insanely minimalistic, and very cautious."
I have ingrained this idea into every company I have run and it has always worked.
"Innovation is not reinventing the wheel, it's improving the experience and removing the pain points of a consumer."
Tesla could spend billions of dollars on building a better tire but are consumers asking for that?
"No they want a better, greener car, so focus on that."
"Like everyones teacher would always tell you in middle school, KISS- keep it simple stupid."

"Whenever scrum teams are prompted to consider their key strengths, they predictably point towards the team's ability to communicate."
What have anthropological theories about structural violence got to do with communication?
Well my hypothesis is that fatigue from interpretive labour is commonly being misdiagnosed as a communication problem.
"He talks about American sitcoms from the 1950s, where jokes about the impossibility of understanding women was a common trope."
"Well, Graeber recalls that girls find it easy detailing the minutiae of life as a boy."
"However, boys are often incapable of considering life as a girl beyond mere superficialities-"
"Interpretive labour is present wherever unequal social structures exist, underpinned by the threat of force or coercion."
"Well, if you think about it, members of a scrum team are relatively equal."
Most employees will instinctively sink significant time into thinking about the intentions of their managers.
"They have to, I mean, nobody wants to get sacked or get pushed aside."
"Yet, I'd also venture to guess that this effort doesn't feel reciprocated."
"It flows one way from those without authority, to those with it."
It is my theory that the chasm between these two experiences accounts for the common workplace complaint that communication is poor.
"The problem isn't that people aren't getting the message , but rather that people are excluded from determining the message itself."
"To add to their woes, the excluded are then expected to do the heavy-lifting of interpretive labour."
It will only serve to remind the excluded of their place in the decision-making process.
"That is, relegated to taking their orders from muffled voices behind closed doors."
"It'd also require the challenging task of defining and upholding a thoughtful, purposeful organisational culture."
"A confession: I've been using these terms for years, without knowing their origin, or what they really mean."
"Starting a tech agency around the same time with a friend from college, we felt intimidated by formal business plans and methodologies."
They seemed geared towards established businesses with trained Managers and we couldn't relate as 'upstarts'.
"This appeals to startup founders, engineers and teams with big ambitions but limited resources."
Ries defines the startup as any human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.
"Right now, that applies whether you're working alone, in an incubator or as part of a mature, multinational organisation."
Can we avoid these pitfalls and be one of the 10% of start-ups who don't fail?
"The route to this is engaging with and talking to customers, asking 4 key questions:1."
This vision is owned and driven by the founder and their team.
"At the heart of every seemingly technical problem is a human issue, be it design, management or training."
Have you ever come across someone's social media page to find a perfectly curated life.
It looks like all they do for a living is look good and take pictures of it.
"ON?It's called influencing, and it's more complex than most people think."
"There are 4 major types or categories of influencer, based on audience size."
"Think government leaders, religious leaders, popular local shop owners, etc."
This is due to the personal connection that the influencer shares with their community members.
"Clearly, the main drawback of working with Nano influencers is the small audience size."
"These influencers have built a following or community around a similar set of interests, otherwise known as a niche."
"This group typically includes your travel bloggers, food bloggers, game reviewers, wellness experts, and a variety of others."
Many brands prefer working with these smaller sized influencers because they have such high engagement and expertise within a specific niche.
The issue that tends to arise in partnerships with Micro influencers involves the investment vs. return aspect.
Macro influencers are what most people think of when they hear the word influencer.
"They have likely used social media to build fame, and along with it a large following."
These influencers can be classified as the best of both worlds when it comes to brand partnerships.
They tend to have both a niche following and a large following.
Many Macro influencers will be able to produce incredible results in brand partnerships because they have spent YEARS nurturing their audience.
"In addition to the great results, they are generally very professional and easy to work with."
"Mega influencers are the largest category of influencer, and they are more famous than influential."
"This includes people like Kylie Jenner, Selena Gomez, and Jimmy Kimmel."
These tend to be A and B list celebrities who naturally attract a large online audience.
"Unlike the other categories of influencers, there will be much less of a common interest or obvious niche within the community."
"They are not subject matter experts, but can absolutely provide brands with a large consumer reach."
"They often don't have the real influencer conversion power, although some do."
"Despite the massive online audience they have, collaborations with these influencers often come with a hefty price tag."
"For example, Kylie Jenner brings in upwards of $1M for a single sponsored Instagram post."
"There are a variety of income opportunities, but I will break down the most common ones."
Brand partnerships are the most common way for influencers to make their living.
Brand partnerships can include things like posting a picture holding their product with a caption about why it's a great purchase.
Affiliate links are another common way that brands choose to work with influencers.
"If an influencer loves a brand and naturally promotes them, they may choose to set up an affiliate link."
"This lets the company know that a particular influencer converted a sale, and can pay them out accordingly."
This is a great revenue stream for anyone with a very niche audience who does not want to create a business themselves.
It is also great for people with existing businesses looking to add more revenue streams.
An example of this might be a beauty influencer who partners with MONAT to start selling their hair products.
"Although affiliate marketing companies come with some stigma, the earning potential is incredible when you do it right!"
This is also where Nano and Micro influencers can scale to 6 figure businesses without massive followings.
"If this is something you want to learn more about, follow and connect with @justyne.biz on Instagram to learn how."
"Many podcasts, blogs and larger influencers will have budgets for paid collaborations."
This may include jumping on a live together to talk about a topic that interests both party's audiences.
Here are some fun behind the scenes facts that may surprise you.
This industry is a lot more complex than most people may understand at first glance.
Creating an outline is an important part of writing a good article because it ensures that your content is well-structured.
I didn't know that when I started writing and doing freelance.
"After getting a brief from a client, I immediately jumped into researching and writing."
"More importantly, I had to take much time reading the content again and again to make sure it was logical and persuasive."
Something like this:Some clients will tell you exactly what they want you to write about in the brief.
"If you have this type of brief, it's easy to develop a good outline that matches your client's requirements."
"When you create an outline, you don't need to care about the introduction."
Make use of what you already know about the topic and type them down.
"In doing so, you can have an idea of what you should research later."
Look at key points you've listed in step 2 to expand your searches.
This step is fairly easy because you already know what you'll talk about in the body of the piece.
You can quickly come up with how you want to start the article and close it.
"For the introduction, you can begin with striking statistics, draw a problem, or use a quote."
You can quickly put together some potential headline ideas that trigger readers' curiosity and emotions.
"Once you complete all of these steps, you can send the outline to the client to ask for approval."
A worthy note is that your outline doesn't need to be perfect.
You don't need to make your headings compelling because it's better to polish them later when you finish the first draft.
And I also know many excellent writers don't need an outline to start.
They can go with whatever they have in mind while still producing masterpieces.
"I'm not at that level, so I still need an outline."
"If you're like me, I hope this post will help you in some way."
"The Cloud II sells for $150, and offers a sterling blend of build and sound for that price."
"It might seem absurd to compare two headsets with such a large price gap, but they're impressively comparable."
I named it my favorite wireless headset of 2020 for its combination of a refreshed design and excellent audio.
It's one of the most packed-out headsets I've ever used at any price.
Bass lovers will prefer the default sound of the Cloud II Wireless.
"Its response digs down deeper, and has more power, thump, and clarity."
"With a little bit of tweaking in the sub bass frequencies, you can mimic the sound of the Cloud II Wireless."
"On the virtual surround front, the Cloud II Wireless has a nice implementation with good channel placement."
"Out of the box, I slightly prefer the sound quality of the Cloud II."
"But the Roccat also sounds great, and edges out a tie thanks to its EQ and surround options."
"TieHyperX is famous for putting memory foam on all of their headsets, and the Cloud II Wireless is no exception."
"It has a barely there feel to it, with soft ear pads and a well-padded headband."
"The soft foam and sleek, light build make for yet another headset that lives up to HyperX's legacy of comfort."
"The drivers inside the cups are angled, so your ears shouldn't touch anything while you're wearing them."
"Both headsets seal well on my head with an impressive, comfortable fit."
The suspension system and contoured pads of the Roccat Elo allow it to fit easily without any work.
"The foam has a much slower rebound than the foam on the Roccat model, and the leatherette covering feels less cheap."
The slight stiffness of the Roccat pads makes them feel like a constant presence on my head.
"Both headsets are perfectly comfortable for hours and hours of listening, but the Cloud II Wireless feels a bit nicer."
"HyperX's Cloud II Wireless is all sleek lines, curves, and bold red accents."
It's like a combination of the original Cloud II frame and a modern Bluetooth headphone.
"Every angle is smoothed out and clean, and it has a more pleasing overall look, in my opinion."
"Both headsets are built really well for the price, out of a combination of metal and plastic components."
"Both headbands use a metal core, and both use robust plastics that should hold up to years of normal gaming use."
"It also has a nice microphone, built-in mic monitoring and surround, and a 30-hour battery."
"At that distance I can't reasonably play a PC game, walls or not."
"Still, the Roccat software offers so much more flexibility and control over the sound, and you can store multiple user profiles."
The RGB is incredible to have in a wireless headset at this price point.
And Superhuman Hearing isn't just a gimmick; it really does enhance the presence of spatial cues in games.
"Both headsets also use USB-C ports for charging, as should all modern peripherals."
Roccat has proven here that you don't need to spend huge to get a huge features package.
It's also easily the best PC headset available for under $100.
"That's a seriously impressive move, and I hope it makes the rest of the business take notice."
The beauty and complexity of the tool lies in it's simplicity.
Cognitive biasses and mental fixedness are the major deal breakers for coming up with frugal solutions.
Using this canvas you can strive to have a frugal approach to prolem solving.
"However the various biases at work block us from being creative, and the only solution is to embrace constraints."
"Problem framing is an art, as Einstein says, the solution is in the problem formulation."
Various tools can be used to understand the problem and forumate it correctly.
I use specially mind maps and question storming or the question ladder to come to a proper question.
At this stage if you find solutions to the problem you can fill in the solution box.
"Specially for frugal innovation, what is more important than an intellectual problem understanding, is an emotional understanding of the problem."
"Once the problem has been formulated you would have identified the various constrainsts, if not brainstorm and prioritize the constraints."
When you have tight constraints you need resources to have multiple functions or uses to be able to do more within the constraints.
At this stage if you find solutions you can add them to the solution box.
Winning partnerships give you access to ressources that could be expensive to own.
Can you find a new use for your resources to solve the problem ?
Under tight constraints often frugal innovations have a modular or a multifunction design.
If you find solutions at this stage you can add them to the solutions box.
That's also how Tesla tested its demand for electric vehicles with the Tesla Roadster model.
Growth through innovation is more sustainable than growth through depleting precious natural ressources !

"The comfortable working environment ensures good collaboration, honesty, and appreciation."
Creating such conditions should be the top priority of every manager and every company.
"First organizational theorists like Edgar Schein, started to research organizational challenges."
"Still today it is considered one of the most important factors for teamwork, learning, and risk and change acceptance."
"Moreover, you can be yourself as the environment embraces diversity and honours inclusion."
We can think about the psychological safety climate within a team or in a company.
"You would most likely try to escape, run away from the source of fear."
"When you experience something unpleasant, you try to switch to something more pleasant."
"In a work environment, you sometimes cannot leave a meeting or cancel a call in the middle of it."
"If someone is shouting at you, disagreeing with you, blaming you for problems, you don't feel well."
"Your adrenalin levels skyrocketing, and you are ready to attack back or to disappear."
"As a manager, you need to learn to control different situations."
You will be often in a position of bringing bad news or communicating changes.
You need to train your eye in seeing that someone is about to run away or trying to attack back.
Onboard these communication strategies:Nothing can be worse than lying to your team.
"You always need to be fair, open, and honest with them."
"Instead, I chose to speak with each team member and explain my decision."
"This way, I was able to answer questions and tackle fear from the future."
You have to be patient when you see that after you announced something your team is shocked.
"Yet, during the company restructuring, it was decided that this part of the team would be disbanded."
"When managers announced it to people, they were shocked, completely hijacked by their feelings."
"As much as this was disappointing, we needed to keep on working."
"So, when the first wave of emotions settled, the discussions continued."
Handle your emotions as you must handle your team member's emotions.
"They can work with intuition, but not with the actual reality."
"So, mind your feelings to make correct decisions based on facts, not based on what you like."
"But, I didn't feel it was right for us to work on them as we were already busy."
I felt annoyed and not comfortable presenting this news to my team.
"Thus, I had to filter my opinions and cascade this news to my team."
"The simplicity was in the fact, that the company paid us for project work, and we got projects."
"So, we had to work them out and schedule plans as a group to mind the capacity."
"If we stayed annoyed as a group thanks to my poor communication, we would have not been productive and moved on anywhere."
"As a manager, you need to build an atmosphere in which people are not afraid of apologizing and acknowledging mistakes."
"The project manager suggested one solution, yet, I decided on the other."
I had to come to her and sincerely apologize for not listening to her.
There are never enough opportunities to either praise or apologize at work.
If you are stuck on some topic and discussion gets all over the place.
A lot of meetings from my experience end up in vain as there is no solution.
You must be flexible and find the right time to move on or to stop the meeting and move it to another day.
Take ownership over the situation and don't let people argue with each other.
Even if it means you have to have a series of meetings to solve one business case.
He periodically tried to hack meetings by diverting conversations to unrelated topics.
"During presentations, they hated him for being loud and stealing their thunder."
"So, I led a training about how to deal with disruptions during meetings and how to handle frustration while public speaking."
"So, we learned to flip such interruptions into a joke, if necessary made colleagues silent, and continued in a discussion."
"If they share these with you, you are on a good way to build a psychologically safe atmosphere."
"So, don't underestimate moments when people reply, 'I am fine, everything is fine.'"
Identify a problem in its beginning before it grows over your head.
"As a manager, try to be one step ahead and track conditions in your team."
"By listening to how people speak to each other, you can undercover potential problems of disrespect and competition."
"If your colleagues make fun of each other and genuinely bully one of them, then you have a problem."
"If you are not a leader of the meeting, you can watch how other people lead and talk together."
"Thanks to that, I could work with each of them on their 'thing' to make their communication more professional."
By knowing how they worked and communicated I gained their trust and respect for my feedback.
"So, don't be afraid of cancelling the meeting if you are not ready for it."
You can always go back and seek solutions when you are not steered by your positive or negative emotions.
Your priority should be always to create an atmosphere in which people feel safe.
"In April 2017, I participated in an event series designed to help students tap into entrepreneurship."
"A month later, I wasn't only dedicated to starting my own business but also dating one of the event organizers."
"Three months after I met Philip, we started organizing personal development workshops for students."
We've not been after the money but about the experiences we made and the people we met.
"Three years later, we decided to stop hosting workshops and to focus on building an online business."
"Luckily, we made that decision in December 2019, shortly before the pandemic heavily affected the event business anyway."
"In the following months, we used our time to build a 6-figure online business in less than a year."
"When I first told Philip that I want to schedule business meetings and write minutes, he thought I was joking."
But the reality is that business meetings and romantic dates can quickly become indistinct if you don't set boundaries.
"As a passionate entrepreneur, you might often find yourself working late at night or during the weekend."
"At the same time, you might find yourself talking about the business all the time."
We take an hour every Monday to talk about our goals for the week.
"Additionally, we decide on a shared activity we want to engage in to nourish our relationship."
"This can be a movie night, going out for drinks, playing billard, or anything else that we enjoy doing together."
"Apart from that, we're also careful about making sure each of us has enough alone time."
"My partner and I live together and work together, which basically means we spend 99.9% of our time together."
"And even though we love this reality, we both need our alone time too."
You might not be able to fully separate the business from your private life when you're running a company with your partner.
"However, you can at least ensure that you talk about important things during a more formal business meeting."
And make sure you don't forget to celebrate your wins during your date nights.
"Sometimes, we get so caught up in chasing the next big thing that we forget to embrace our successes."
"If you do both, the whole journey will be more fun and fulfilling, so make sure you also reward yourself."
"Effective leadership includes critiquing, empowering, and coaching those around you."
Keeping these three fundamentals in mind helps us perform at our best while improving as business partners and caring lovers.
"We both expect each other to provide constructive feedback, cheer each other up, and support each other during challenging situations."
This has become normal for us because we decided that's how we want to live our lives.
"Especially if you're starting a side-hustle, it can be worth separating your work from your relationship."
"Otherwise, it can quickly become hard to set priorities and you might lack intimacy and romance in your relationship."
"Sometimes, it's important to be in a co-founder role and act as business partners instead of a couple."
You really can't expect to build a successful business if you can't clearly communicate your expectations.
You can indeed be respectful and supportive while disagreeing with each other.
Just make sure you understand the needs and desires of your partner - in your relationship but also as a co-founder.
This will ensure that you can perform at your best while also enjoying your romantic partnership.
This led to lots of frustration as I didn't feel intrinsically motivated to work on our common goals.
"And in the end, he always knew that something was off anyway."
Just because you decide to work on common goals doesn't mean you can't make changes.
Regularly check in with your partner and talk about the big picture of your business and relationship.
Smart entrepreneurs don't start a business with someone who has the same skills and strengths.
"When Philip and I first started our business, we've been working on the same tasks."
We didn't know our strengths and weaknesses and often spent hours working on certain tasks together instead of assigning clear responsibilities.
This wasn't only time-consuming but also exhausting and frustrating.
It took us three years to realize that we have completely different strengths that would help us move our business forward.
Combining these skills helped us scale from zero to six figures in ten months without hiring employees or exhausting ourselves.
"If you want to build and scale a business with your better half, make sure your skills and strengths are complementary."
"Figuring out what you're good at might take some time, but it'll be worth it."
"Instead of working on everything simultaneously, we ensure that both of us can play to their strengths."
Welcome to this delicious and wholesome part of my guide to freelance taxes.
You might also want to see what business structure is best for you.
"These steps will make your tax filings a little bit smoother, and who doesn't want that?"
"If you're already running a freelance business, there may be some information you'll find helpful."
Here's what this part of the guide to freelance taxes covers:I am not an accountant or qualified tax professional.
"If you only have a tiny number of freelance transactions, then a business account might not help that much."
"Even if you don't need a separate EIN, it's often a good idea to have one."
"It gives your business more legitimacy, can protect you from identity theft, and can help when opening a business bank account."
"A bookkeeping system is the answer to many, many freelance tax and finance woes!"
Bookkeeping systems are so important that I have dedicated an entire section of the guide to them.
Here's a good explanation of retirement accounts for the self-employed.
"Specifically, contributions to these types of retirement accounts reduce your earnings for the purpose of calculating your taxable income."
Retirement accounts do not have an impact on the amount of self-employment tax you pay.
It's helpful to understand the various types of taxes and how they will be applied to your freelance income.
You will generally need to make estimated tax payments on your expected earnings throughout the year.
"Federal income tax is charged in bands on all your income, including your freelance earnings."
This tax is filed with and paid to your state's Department of Revenue.
"You may also need to pay other types of taxes, like franchise taxes or local and municipal taxes."
Talk to your accountant to see if you may be liable for other types of taxes.
"An accountant will provide you with expert, tailored advice for your freelance business and taxes."
"There are extra forms that these types of businesses need to file, and an accountant will ensure you're compliant."
"I would still recommend that you hire an accountant, to ensure that you're reporting and filing taxes correctly."
"Alright, that's it for this part of the freelance tax guide."
"Next, we'll take a look at bookkeeping and running your business and how that can optimize how you do your taxes."
The problem is that cash rebates to the poor don't easily compensate the long-term costs of carbon taxes.
This matters because it means carbon taxes create a larger distortionary effect that ripples through the economy.
These producers will then react to the rise in energy costs by scaling back investment and production.

"StereoType's blended fashion collection combines elements of style, design and comfort to inspire creativity, individuality and freedom of expression."
"After studying fashion design at California College of the Arts, Elizabeth found herself at odds with wasteful fashion industry standards."
It was the ultimate unlearning of the rules that we've all been taught about gendered fashion at a young age.
The lesson felt deeply personal and Elizabeth knew there was no turning back.
I would collect the scraps that she didn't use and then use those pieces to wrap around my Barbies.
"After studying fashion design at California College of the Arts, I found myself at odds with the waste of fashion industry standards."
"StereoType is a fashion-forward kids clothing brand, advocating for individuality and an evolution of an expansive sense of self."
My favorite part of this brand is working with my own kids.
They inspired the line so they are very much a part of the creative side of the business.
It's exciting for them to know they are the inspiration behind StereoType.
We've been taught that girls should wear princess dresses but not clothes with dinosaurs or trucks.
I am challenging those dated ideas with StereoType's blended fashion collection.
"I started my first business, Piece x Piece, I put way too much stock into my Instagram following."
He knows what it's like to start and run a business because he has done it a few times himself.
You have to take risks to get to where you want to go!
"For instance, when something is positively disruptive, it offers an opportunity to see something in a new way."
"For example, with StereoType, we offer equality to boys and girls, by disrupting the norms of gendered clothing."
"When something is disruptive in a 'not so positive' way, it makes people feel isolated or separate."
"In our business, we view equality and inclusion as a huge part of our mission and vision."
He explained to me the importance of moving through challenges without letting them stop you.
"Many people are really afraid to fail, so they don't even start."
There's always a way to figure it out and move on.
This is something that I self-discovered throughout my journey as a first-time entrepreneur with my business Piece x Piece.
I learned to not self-identify with the ups and downs of being a business owner.
"While you are the idea behind the business, you are not your business."
"For me, realizing that I won't know everything and being OK with it was an incredibly valuable lesson."
"Specifically, I have learned to trust myself when it comes to making big decisions and listen to my gut."
I trusted my gut on this and now have an amazing group of women working collaboratively with me on building the StereoType brand.
"For instance, boys love sparkle just as much as girls do."
"At StereoType, we are committed to elevating the conversation about blended fashion to make it mainstream and normalized."

Having a bi-weekly potluck is never going to be enough.
The manager that makes everyone question how you managed to land your role.
Everybody has things that they are good at and things that they are bad at.
"As a leader, it's up to you to figure out what skills and responsibilities are your strengths and weaknesses."
A good practice to do this is to create a 'T-chart'.
Think about all of the qualities you deem the most important for a leader to have.
"Then, circle the ones that you are confident in your ability to enact."
"After you've finished circling those, then, identify qualities that you oppose within a leader."
"Once that list is compiled, circle the qualities that you think you exhibit."
Spend time either working on practicing your strengths or eliminating your weaknesses.
"As a good leader, it's your responsibility to be honest about and own your defeats."
There are things that you can do as a department lead to prepare your team for your shortcomings.
For the year?Be vocal about the direction your company is headed and what exactly needs to happen to successfully get to the destination.
"There are multiple different types of feedback, 2 being positive and negative."
"As you would assume, positive feedback entails letting someone know what good, impactful things they have done."
Keeping your team in the loop on how they are performing is not only integral to the company but to each individual specifically.
You're placing confidence in them that you can successfully help them be successful.
The one that's pedestal is so high up that you aren't capable or willing to do mundane tasks.
That type of management style gives off the impression that you don't trust your team.
It tells them that you think they are incapable of working independently.
"You want your team to know that you care, are there to support, and are intuitive to their needs."
You have the power to become the leader that everybody wants to work for.
Take the time to reflect on who you are as a leader - what are your skills and weaknesses?
It's those moments of defeat that you can use to uplift your team and create a space that normalizes making mistakes.
Make sure that you are keeping the necessary lines of communication open with your staff.
"Finally, figure out what situations call for delegation and which ones call for your attention."
"Don't underestimate your team's ability to work efficiently, but also don't assume that they don't need support."
Encoded in the firing of its neurons is the embodiment of an evolving conscious experience.
"It dives deep down into the feelings of anguish, envy, and disgust."
And ascends all the way up to those of aspiration and unconditional love.
"In toto, it is a vehicle for conscious experience and evolution."
"And it can be argued that our perceptions of the world, the contents of conscious experience - apparently -are not even real."
"How do you define real?And electrical signals interpreted by your brain is, precisely, the problem."
It is an electromagnetic abstraction of experience shaped by evolution that is further distorted by the irregularities of expectation.
"In the game of life, this is all that matters, this ability to be shaped by and to reshape the environment."
"And at the core of reality, there are likely hidden causes that we can never directly access."
And minimizing free energy is the process of minimizing the difference between its model of the world and the perception of it.
"A tool for consciousness to model the world and update it, to render the effects of choice."
But part of that involves hiding from us the stuff we don't need to know.
"And that's pretty much all of reality, whatever reality might be."
"To construct a theory of consciousness we propose a simple but rigorous formalism called a conscious agent, consisting of six components."
"A key intuition is that consciousness involves three processes: perception, decision, and action."
"In the process of perception, a conscious agent interacts with the world and, in consequence, has conscious experiences."
"In the process of decision, a conscious agent chooses what actions to take based on the conscious experiences it has."
"However, when considering the processes of perception, decision and action, it does seem necessary to discuss conditional probability."
A general way to model such conditional probabilities is by the mathematical formalism of Markovian kernels.
One can think of a Markovian kernel as simply an indexed list of probability measures.
A Markovian kernel can also be thought of as an information channel.
"Nonetheless, consciousness - the platform of daily existence - seems to be abundantly obvious and it pretty much goes without saying."
With their equations we can catch a glimpse of whatever reality is and capitalize on it through the repetition of results.
"Truth is not found, per se, in the equations themselves but rather in the regularities of their predictable observations."
"It is the author of every equation, the conductor of every orchestra, and the audience of every illusion."
If we are to make progress with this axiom - that consciousness is fundamental-
"Life is, more than anything else, a tendency to act on inert matter."
Nature's simple act has divided itself automatically into an infinity of elements which are then found to be coordinated to one idea.
"In a general way, reality is ordered exactly to the degree in which it satisfies our thought."
"Consciousness, which is a need of creation, is made manifest to itself only where creation is possible."
It wakens as soon as the possibility of a choice is restored.
"Co-extensive with the fringe of possible action that surrounds the real action, consciousness is synonymous with invention and with freedom."
We show how a certain direction has been followed further and further by beings more and more intelligent.
"IIT offers a parsimonious explanation for empirical evidence, makes testable predictions, and permits inferences and extrapolations."
"Composition - Consciousness is structured: each experience is composed of multiple phenomenological distinctions, elementary or higher-order."
The conceptual structure specified by a complex of elements in a state is identical to its experience.
The process can also be viewed mathematically as a continual Fourier transformation of energy resonating between two orders.
The model is used to generate predictions of sensory input that are compared to actual sensory input.
This comparison results in prediction errors that are then used to update and revise the mental model.
"Over billions of years, energy has condensed, coalesced and coagulated into increasingly complex configurations of matter throughout the universe."
"And whatever consciousness is, it seems to be rooted in the act of choice."
And the advancement of science is expressed through results and repeatable observation.
And we can do that - simply - by doing nothing at all.
And then we can analyze the spectral domain of the EEG signals that were recorded in spacetime.
"Where we would expect to find repeatable patterns consistently expressed and correlated with conscious experience, not once, but every time."
The upshot of focusing social media on your writing is that it benefits both your career and your mental health.
There is an organic way around this - primarily by driving engagement and getting others to share your posts.
"In addition, groups are where people go on Facebook to find the topics they really like."
Most social media is more like a conversation than like writing in the traditional sense.
"Use this information to provide the value they crave, and grow your following while you do so."
"This is how I turned my nasty Facebook habit into something productive - you, as a writer, can too."
"If the leader cannot transfer thoughts to others in such a way to promote action, they cannot succeed."
Successful leaders understand the megaphone effect; how to use it and how to not abuse it.
They also understand the hazards of sending the wrong message by accident.
"Sharing fuzzy, poorly developed ideas lead directly into the next sin, Loss of Focus."
"When team members don't have the same priority, it's like a team of horses pulling in different directions."
"The wagon will move forward, but not nearly as fast as it would with everyone pulling in the same direction."
"When this happens, it will often drive the supervisor to micromanage."
"The manager doesn't trust people to do the right thing, so he spends his time hovering and looking over shoulders."
The ones who stay behind will take a daily bath in discontent.
"They've been hurt before and as a result, vow to never love again, I mean trust again."
It can be enormously difficult to escape the prison of past experience.
"Once upon a time, I took command of a basic training unit."
"A couple of weeks in, my supply sergeant asked me how many pencils to order for the next quarter."
I was exasperated until I realized my predecessor had been a micromanager.
Once I understood that it changed my approach to leading the unit.
That's the way we've always done it is an express ticket to mediocrity and reflects one of two things.
"The first is the notion, it's not worth my time to explain it to you."
This isn't healthy and is usually the result of that person's past experiences with leaders.
They've discovered a level of effort which doesn't overly exert them but renders minimally satisfactory results.
It can happen to the rank-and-file and it can happen to leaders.
"It's the leader's job to push, push, push."
The status quo is not good enough and leaders must push for improvement.
They don't get paid for trying; they don't get paid for staying busy; they get paid for results.
Sometimes people forget this because they're caught up in the daily soap opera which can be our work environment.
"When leaders say one thing but do another, their personal credibility is undermined."
"When leaders hold other people to standards but don't meet them personally, they lose their credibility."
"When leaders measure the performance of people below them but refuse to accept responsibility for mistakes or shortcomings, they're demonstrating hypocrisy."
"This can take many forms, as evidenced above, but they all result in the same thing: a low trust organization."
"Not only are there low levels of trust, but there will also be low morale."
"Lastly, the organization will become one where employees will only do what's explicitly checked."
Neither the leader nor the organization will benefit from employees' discretionary effort.
"The idea of someone going above and beyond, will not exist."
"Too many leaders get the idea that because they get a bigger paycheck, everything revolves around them."
"The leader is part of the team - not over them, behind them, or in front of them."
"Sometimes I'm mistaken, the perks are legacies, holdovers from a prior regime."
"When moving into a leadership position, keep an eye out for these things."
"It's one way to send an early, powerful message of change."
Solutions and AntidotesWhat do you do when you become part of an organization practicing these seven sins?
"Ideally, you about-face and go find someplace else to work."
I've told thousands of leaders this time and time again: your personal example is the most powerful tool you have.
"If you're walking into an organization with these poor practices, more than your personal example will be necessary."
Let's quickly look at actions we can take for each sin.
"To remedy poor communication, work hard at two-way communication."
"When you share information with your people, ask for back-briefs."
Ask them to tell you what they heard in their own words.
"Looking up the chain-of-command, press the boss for clarification."
This can be a little prickly but frame it in terms of efficiency.
Micro-management is the bane of every strong employee's work life.
One benefit I found with them is it forced me to better plan my work and sharpened my focus on priorities.
"To fight complacency, talk with employees about the greater purpose of the organization."
Tapping into this motivation creates a powerful spring of energy for many people.
Draw the line for employees from their personal success to the company's success.
"When employees understand the two are linked, it will often help them see their way to better performance."
"For complacency, focus your efforts on the people below you in the organization."
I would not invest time and effort in trying to lead up in this area.
"Apathy, while closely related to complacency, will benefit from the purpose discussion as well."
There will be a mixture of reactions with the majority exhibiting great resentment.
They like it because they've been carrying the rest of the team.
Those are important but leaders at different levels may need to supplement with more immediate measures for their teams.
Use both formal and informal feedback to give people the opportunity to adjust and adapt their efforts.
There will be a portion of employees who will initially resent it and then slowly warm to it as they see results.
They'll not only resent the change; they'll actively work against it.
People will make clear where they stand and what they think for the most part.
The most resistant need the opportunity to change and adapt but don't carry them forever.
Carrying employees who are unwilling to change risks spread of the attitude.
"Remember, that's what put us in this position in the beginning."
Performance feedback is also a large part of the cure for hypocrisy.
Holding people to standards should be a no-brainer for leaders but sometimes they fall short.
"As a leader, one of, if not the best way to grow an organization, is through performance feedback."
It's not a natural process and many people shy from it.
"Done poorly, feedback can cause people to become defensive, even confrontational."
"It is possible to create a climate where performance feedback is routine, positive, and moves the company forward."
Humility is the opposite of egoism but teaching humility is often painful.
"In my experience, life teaches humility as opposed to a leader."
Emphasizing the perspective of others and showing how they view the world may also help.
"Finally, explain how their attitude negatively impacts the workplace, especially in terms of teamwork and collaboration."
"Pride will often lead to over-confidence, hubris, and a sense of entitlement."
"Emphasizing respect for individuals, sharing in hardships, and building genuine relationships with people across echelons are all ways to combat egoism."
"Unfortunately, people with out-of-control egos usually refuse to do those things."
"They don't respect others because they see themselves as a different, superior breed."
"Because they're special, they don't see that they should endure hardships."
This is commonly seen when corporations lay off employees yet executives receive bonuses.
The self-view of being special prevents them from creating relationships across different levels.
I'm not saying the CEO should be cook-out buddies with the first-line supervisors.
"But they can interact with them, listen, and talk with them directly."
These are the things that leaders who are loved by their people do.
"Some call it as having the common touch, a phrase I dislike because of the embedded sense of royalty."
What the phrase speaks to is those people have no sense of different levels within the company.
There's never been a leader to go through their life without committing them.
"The goal is to understand the sins, to recognize them, and to work towards eliminating them."
"Just as religious sins will never go away, leadership sins won't either."
We must keep working towards recognizing them in ourselves and working to get better.
Biomedical engineer Chethan Pandarinath develops prosthetics - but not just any prosthetics.
Pandarinath hopes to achieve this by analyzing brain activity recordings of paralyzed people to identify neuronic patterns corresponding to specific movements.
"If that sounds complicated, it's because it is - hugely so, Pandarinath says in Nature."
And that's mainly due to the growing convergence of AI and neuroscience.
"Both disciplines, after all, share the same goal of understanding the secrets of human cognition."
"That means that instead of human instruction, these systems use a system of reward predictions that continually adjust based on experience."
Distributional reinforcement learning improves on traditional TD learning through its ability to predict a much broader spectrum of possible rewards.
"And a recent DeepMind research paper published in Nature goes even further, suggesting that the human brain also uses distributional reinforcement learning."
"We found that dopamine neurons in the brain were each tuned to different levels of pessimism or optimism, the authors write."
"Maneesh Sahani, of the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London, agrees."
"In the other case, we're looking at the sole existing proof that it can be solved - which is the brain."
"For impacting how your home feels, and how it is lit naturally, and how it flows overall."
"These details, unlike a standard window or door, can be interpreted in numerous ways."
"In particular, circulation routes are the pathways people take through and around buildings or urban places."
"It is the concept that captures the experience of moving our bodies around a building, three-dimensionally and through time."
"It can be broken down into direction, the type of use, the frequency of use and the time of use."
The speed of the movement of circulation can be fast or slow.
"Whereas a circulation route considered to as private, will include the back of house and staff circulation passageways."
"When considering the various circulation routes, you need to make sure the pathway is unobstructed and well illuminated."
"In restaurants, bars and cafes circulation routes are important for both staff and guests."
Circulation routes should be used to keeping minimal interference between front and back of house.
This will help to inform the visitor plan how they can progress through the interior during their visit.
"DirectionHorizontal circulation might include hallways, atria, paths, entries and exits."
Public circulation is the areas of the building which are most widely and easily accessible.
"Issues of visibility, how crowds move, and clear escape paths are key points to consider."
"Private circulation accounts for the more intimate movements within the building, or the more ugly ones which require a degree of privacy."
Designing CirculationThere are two rules of thumb when it comes to designing circulation.
"Similarly, circulation doesn't necessarily have to follow the shortest distance between two points."
"Commercial office buildings and apartment buildings, for example, will typically seek to minimize the amount of circulation space."
"Even in smaller buildings, such as houses, circulation areas such as a staircase can become architectural features of the home."
Stringers are the side components that support the treads and risers of the stair.
"In conclusion, treads with rounded edges are more practical and safe in case of intense usage."
"Open means the risers, or part of the risers, do not exist."
"You can also combine the two in your design, having some parts open, and some parts closed."
Stairs can be key in getting the overall design of our homes to work.
The way they are designed can prevent visitors in your home from feeling it is appropriate to travel up them.
Visibility on stairsLighting can create a dramatic impact in a staircase - during the night and day time.
"Low level lighting used on stair walls, or in LED strips, will create one effect."
"Alternatively, pendant lighting will create a feature during the day time as well."
Just be cognizant of how you're going to change light bulbs and that you can service them in a safe way.
Improving visibility on stairs significantly reduces the risk for common mishaps caused by misjudging distances.
"Such mishaps are a routine cause of twisted ankles, sprained knees or more serious injuries incurred by a total fall."
"Stairs may open up the homeIf privacy is created by not seeing where stairs lead to, the reverse also occurs."
Opening up your home's volume can happen through creating open areas at the top of the stairs.
It may be a lounge room on the upper floor or simply a small space to sit that creates a small library area.
"This will lead the eye up, to experience the openness of your home."
"Make stairs ,a hero in your home?Staircases can create a sculptural and very strong aesthetic element in your home."
"Of course, there are the sweeping, grand staircases, a la Gone with the Wind, or Sound of Music."
"In contemporary homes, glass, steel and timber may be used instead."
Staircase adds dignity and charm to your home when it is carefully designed and built! .
It provides easy and quick access to different floors of the house.
"Stairs are available in a variety of style and materials like wood, glass, brick, R.C.C., etc."
"Celebration of the staircase as a sculptural, feature piece can come in smaller ways."
Balustrade designThere are a variety of materials you can use for your balustrade.
"At its simplest is a plastered wall, with a handrail or timber cap."
"There are also open timber balustrades, glass and steel, or steel mesh or powder coated aluminum panels."
"Alternatively, you can choose other materials, based on your budget."
"Some fantastic stairs are fabricated from glass treads, and checker plate steel."
"You may have a simple run of continuous treads, or the stairs return on themselves in a U."
Some designs can include intermediate levels in the staircase that are integrated with things around them.
"You may start on a large plinth, or something that creates a small bench seat to sit on."
"If your staircase is on an outer wall, you could put windows in it."
You can also position them based on how you're going to experience that view as you move through the staircase.
You have a light well in your home that will bring natural light into the darkest parts of your floor plan.
"It's not only people that need to move from one floor to the next, but also stuff."
Split levels make a home more interesting to navigate and they can be used to create different ceiling heights.
Then you can borrow the joy of that stair space to bring joy into the other spaces in your home.
We continue discovering the redesign of the EPAM's time-off management system - Vacation portal.
"CJM.As you can see, I treat it wider than a UX artefact."
It is a good way to analyze the user's flow in the product.
"With it, we could shine a light on the user's problems and help the team to solve them."
"To make our Journey mapping more precise, better to take a single hero and a single scenario with a definite goal."
Some details about what the designer could add to the CJM:It depends on the product's environment.
"If you could do it with a team, stickers and board-great."
"If you are in the remote team, it's better to make it in Miro, or another web service."
"Often it is done simply, without graphics, in Excel or Spreadsheets."
"In Miro, CJM process is far more collaborative, with digital stickers and wide interaction with a team."
"Even if you are doing product from scratch, usually you have a competitor's product."
"Often we, designers, are focused solely on user's needs."
"Sure, the designer is a user advocate, but usually business isn't evil."
The management shouldn't get the outcome of the CJM out of the blue.
"Maybe, they would not participate deeply, but their attention is important."
"After making the CJMs for main Personas, I had almost all the cards in hand."
"The team was aligned, the design process was established, users and their needs were discovered."
And we have almost all the crucial flows of the user in the service built by words.
"Managers also gain a product view, current problems assessment and see the possibilities for improvement of the solution."
"In some cases, it's necessary to make the most problematic current flows more visually appealing to stakeholders."
Below you can see an example of the flow for the user to take a time-off in the original system.
Reworking such flows with stakeholders and users helped us to get the next solution.
"At first, some stakeholders were surprised, that it could be so simple-you could take any request in any place."
"To do that, necessary look at them-some people could be persuaded by numbers, better conversion rates, etc."
"Clear UX flows, presented by the designer, help to win both types of stakeholders."
"Researching, I already saw a lot of issues in the navigation of the service."
"I made an expert review, analysed the structure of the information in the service."
"To highlight issues, I took prioritized Personas and did sitemaps for them."
"Below is the sitemap for the original navigation for the Administrator, who could do everything in the service."
"Stakeholders clearly saw the problem with navigation: duplicated elements, difficult orientation in the service and other IA issues."
"After decomposition, I understood the links and interconnections in the service."
"We made a card sort, to see essential navigation elements and what could be removed."
Below you can see the result of the work-improved navigation for Administrator.
"On the team demo, I could defend my decisions, using the researched data."
The accessible and comprehensive audit report helped to rework the Information architecture.
"As the team was involved in the card sort, their opinion impacted the result."
"Working with information to the user with PO, we applied a new approach to giving the user the necessary power."
"After improving the navigation and flows, we could gather everything in one place."
"In the demo, they actively participated, by themselves answering on some sceptical questions about navigation."
"We eliminated almost 70 % of the previous structure, gaining clarity and functionality."
"Most of the existing back-end solutions were supported, that was especially appreciated by management."
"We moved step by step, applying UX techniques in the redesign process."
"Making Value Proposition Canvas, designer finds the balance between the needs of the user and business."
The Problem statement helps to reduce risks of solving the wrong problem of the product.
"Building CJM and Flows is connecting the dots between the user, existing problems, product and behaviour."
"Analysing Information architecture, the designer acquires the logical and clear structure of the product."
"In the redesign, based on the result of the research, we changed the approach user's starting point."
We used the good-working pattern: user wants to make all his actions in a single place.
Sometimes users were in trouble because they don't know the rules of different types of time-offs.
"Previously, to get this info, they needed to go to the external knowledge base."
"We give them a handy 'cheat sheet' for terms, numbers, etc."
"Sure, the rules for time-offs are complex, and often people don't know the legal information."
"Previously, to take a specific request, the user needed to go through complex navigation to find a form."
"We totally reworked the request forms, the user now could take any request from any place."
"Also, the approach to the legal notes and informers was changed-only essential info is shown."
"Users loved the clearness of new design, appreciated the handy possibility of quick access to the request details, etc."
"The most recent name change occurred on January 10, 2021, roughly 10 hours prior to Parler's removal."
"At the time of the Parler platform takedown by AWS, the post had been viewed upwards of 1 million times."
Analysis of the message history shows abnormal activity in the month leading up to the January 10 spike.

Reinforcement learning is one of the most exciting and promising research topics of AI.
"Trust me, as with everything in this world, it is just a matter of truly mastering the basics."
"At the very core, reinforcement learning is based on an agent that repeatedly interacts with an environment."
"So, what the agent really wants is to take actions that allow maximizing the rewards received in time from here on."
"Indeed, this quantity is called return, and so the agent wants to maximize its return."
"While rewards and next states do depend on the environment dynamics, the agent can only decide how to act."
"In each state, it can either play deterministically by selecting one action or randomly choosing across multiple possible actions."
"We will say that the agent has a policy, which means it has a strategy to use across the whole game."
"So, we realized that our agent has uncertainties about its future!"
"Once the end state is reached, the agent creates another branch by considering a different possible evolution and repeats the process."
This is done again and again up to all the possible branches which can be derived from our state are considered.
Now let's try to focus on these concepts with an example.
If she says yes you are very happy and so this will give you a return of +100.
"To keep things simple, let's compare the two simplest cases coming from the two deterministic policies:That's it!"
"As you can imagine, computing the possible returns for each of the states would take ages indeed!"
"Also, the Bellman equation suggests an interesting way to compute the value of the state."
"Still, we have to scan at least once all the possible states, which can be prohibitive in many environments."
Hope you enjoyed this introduction on reinforcement learning as I did in writing it!
"My friend Jessica, also on the Zoom meditation texted me that I wasn't muted."
I quickly put myself on mute and then entered into a shame spiral.
"I became unable to concentrate and though I stayed on the video call, I could not resume my personal meditation."
"My head was spinning and, with every rotation, spitting out a new criticism."
"In a way, their blooper is a gift, a reminder that we are all human."
"I gave the gift of making a mistake, something probably every person on that call has worried about doing at some point."
I thought about all of these people who've I've meditated online with for the last fifty days.
When I interrupted the flow of our practice it was a blip in time.
"They didn't think I was a loser, that I didn't belong."
They probably didn't give it a second thought after it happened.
"In my shame mind, these people would be spending the day gossiping about the nitwit who wasn't on mute during meditation."
But as I contemplated this intrusive shame-thought I realized how utterly narcissist and self-important it is.
"That two-second interruption was just that, a two-second interruption."
"At the end of the daily meditation, we all unmute for a moment to say goodbye."
I thought about my mistake like the gift that it was - an invitation to being human.
"Like I do every morning, I felt the love and acceptance from the group."
"When I graduated college, I was on top of the world."
"I had a degree, and I had a job lined up after graduation."
"But after graduation, I was surprised to find that life wasn't as fun or as glamorous as I had hoped."
"Well, the obvious answer is after graduation, but it doesn't always seem to occur at the same time for everyone."
"I had begun my full-time job, and, at least initially, things were going great."
I wasn't used to doing the same thing every day with no end in sight.
"I was used to having two classes on Monday, one on Thursday night and one first thing on Friday."
You might find yourself feeling ready to shake things up after dealing with the mundane-ness of your week.
"Either way, you'll probably get to a point where you're tired of your new life."
"The post-graduation slump isn't fun, and no one wants to stay there for long."
The options are endless if you put your mind to it and try.
The possibilities are out there if you're willing to put in the effort.
"Post-college life can be monotonous, with your day to day schedule largely the same five days a week."
"If you're feeling the slump in this regard, figure out ways to make each day slightly out of the ordinary."
This could be scheduling something small into your day or shaking up the workweek by taking the occasional vacation day for yourself.
Maybe take time to do a hobby you'd long forgotten about when all of your free time was spent writing essays.
Take time to read for fun at the end of each day.
"Whatever it is, find something that makes you happy and work it into your new schedule."
Embrace where you're at and find things to love about your life right here and now.
"Figure out the good things you still have in life, even if those things no longer revolve around school."
"This may seem contradictory to the last point, but you can embrace where you're at and remain hopeful for your future."
Life post-graduation is all about taking baby steps to get to where you want to be.
That could be working diligently at your new job so that one day you earn that promotion you've been dreaming of.
It could be pushing yourself outside your comfort zone now for the rewards that it'll reap down the road.
"The post-graduation slump won't last forever, so find ways to lift your spirits now and in the future."
Don't let the changes coming your way after graduation make you forget that you accomplished something amazing.
"IntroductionIn my opinion, quantum fluctuations and entanglement are the least understood elements of quantum mechanics."
"By examining what is happening in the double slit experiment, we can see more clearly how they work."
The equations describing the interactions don't give one any feeling for what is happening.
The surprising strength of quantum entanglement is one thing that becomes clear when looking at this experiment.
Another puzzle that has not yet been explained in any reasonable way is the randomness of the location of the interactions.
"The Higgs FieldAccording to our present understanding of the Universe, the Higgs field permeates all of space-time."
"This is a scalar field that particles interact with, giving them mass."
"One is the experimental verification of the Higgs boson, which is the particle causing the Higgs field."
Another is the brief existence of what we call virtual particles in otherwise empty space.
Some of the most common virtual particles are electron-positron pairs.
These particles can be detected indirectly by various measurements including the Casimir effect.
These experiments prove the existence of the Higgs field in empty space.
"First, being a field, it has the characteristics of a wave."
These waves have all possible wavelengths and all possible directions in space-time.
"As waves propagate, they interfere with each other resulting in a very noisy Higgs field environment in free space."
Figure 1 shows a simulation of what these quantum fluctuations look like.
"In quantum physics, a quantum fluctuation is the temporary random change in the amount of energy in any point in space."
These fluctuations have more effects than just the appearance of electron hole pairs.
"Changes in the path lengths of both waves result in a phase shift, creating an interference pattern."
"Another version is the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which splits the beam with a mirror."
"However, such experiments demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through."
"We were sure that they were particles, but this experiment showed that particles also have wavelike characteristics."
"Additionally, the detection of individual discrete impacts is observed to be inherently probabilistic, which is inexplicable using classical mechanics."
It is merely stated that the shape of the calculated wave function describes the probability with no convincing reason.
This is puzzling because other types of waves like sound waves and water waves appear to be continuous.
"The particle, whether an electron or a photon, is really a wave."
This pattern is the same even if only one particle at a time is passed through the slits.
"Then when the wave encountered the slits, it is diffracted just like any other wave."
"Also, miraculously, all of the energy of each electron or photon passes through to the other side of the barrier."
Figure 5 shows how the noise of the quantum foam is combined in superposition with the coherent particle wave.
The energy of the Higgs field is random at every location in space-time.
"Most of the time, the Higgs field has much less energy than that required to produce an electron-positron pair."
But the energy that is there is enough to alter the location of an interaction when the wave is near an atom.
"We have not analyzed this mathematically yet, so there are questions to be resolved to verify this picture."
"The picture looks good qualitatively, but we don't know if it is correct quantitatively."
"But, it is still a better explanation than the current QM explanation."
Let's put that atom in or on the screen that captures the electron.
"So, as the electron wave approaches the atom wave, they are both in super-position to the quantum foam noise."
That is altering the wave shape of both the electron and the atom.
"This is why the Schrodinger wave is incorrectly called a probability wave, when it is actually a matter wave."
"You can see from figure 4, the wave is extremely diffuse."
How does it get localized again?The most powerful forces in the universe are the result of symmetry.
"In a properly set up experiment, two electrons become entangled to have opposite spins."
"When one entangled particle is measured, the opposite entangled particle behaves as if it was measured too."
The universe will move heaven and earth to keep the conserved quantities balanced.
We don't know of any deeper cause for these particles behavior than the fact that they are entangled.
"The electron in free space is a coherent wave, and thus entangled with itself."
This causes the whole electron wave to be attracted to the atom.
All of the energy of the electron wave now becomes part of the atom's wave function.
The interacting particles do not care if we are looking at them or not.
"For these quantum interactions, the localized energy does not need to exceed any threshold."
The total energy of the entangled wave is used to make the interaction proceed even though the localized energy is very small.
It is very important to the universe to make these interactions happen.
"No energy is allowed to be lost, and No entanglement is allowed to be ignored."
I think that is an important principle in the laws of Physics.
The biggest problem for quantum computing today is how to keep an entangled state of a particle long enough to do a computation.
"Even though we know entanglement is important, very little is known about it."
Most of the research is devoted to trying to solve the quantum computing problem.
"That is very understandable, but it does nothing to fully understand entanglement."
Some time ago I thought that it is not so important to think about microcopy in designs.
The biggest misconception is some designers believe that microcopy has a very low priority in the design workflow.
"But to be honest, Microcopy has a significant influence on the quality of user experienceFirst, you need to define your brand."
It's essential to always think about the Brand and Audience when you start working on any project.
"For example, for a wealth management application, humor would be irrelevant; it needs to have a businesslike tone."
"But a business tone would be irrelevant for social networks, fitness applications, e-commerce."
It all depends on who are your users and how will you communicate with them using your app.
The main purpose of microcopy is to create conversations with users and let them know that everything you write is addressed to them.
"Also, it is recommended to use a Natural Tone in microcopy."
It has to be short and precise; don't use long speeches because users will lose interest in your writing.
The users' first impression of the app will be based on these pages.
"In' or 'Sign In', you'd better write a more friendly message that will make people smile."
"Nobody will keep in mind standard titles and messages, but everybody will remember the original greetings in your application."
Another point is that users don't know WHY they have to Sign Up for your application and spend time on it.
Examples:Remember that users need to have the opportunity to Reset the Password in case if they forgot it.
"It has to be very neat, easy, and without extra information."
Reset password and get a new one is the main goal on this page.
Build a warm and friendly tone that will help to form a positive impression of your application.
Success Messages give users the satisfaction that an action is completed and everything is fine.
"This is the most expected response that they want to see, so don't deprive them of their happiness."
It will help to create a positive feeling about your brand and even bring about smiles if you use friendly messages.
Try to figure out why you created this page and how it will help users.
"Examples:Be friendly with your users, and never blame them for errors or mistakes."
"Using an effective microcopy, you could avoid misunderstanding between the user and the app."

"Some of the major observations on public sentiment about the recent Farmers protest in New Delhi, India."
And how sentiment analysis on twitter sample data played a key role in understanding the public sentiment.
Noise removal plays a major role in finding a correct sentiment from a tweet.
"Non-English tweets, and the emoji's are not considered for this study."
"NLTK ,Text blob, regular expressions are used here in various stages of pre-processing."
Word frequency graph and word cloud are the easy way of representing your text data to others.
"Example, support is being used in positive and neutral word clouds, which indicates both positive and neutral tweets contain this word."
"There is nothing wrong in getting words like this, as the word meaning changes when it is in a sentence."
"Do international celebrities involvement correct or not? , leaving the main topic behind."
"Most of us don't want a protest, when you can settle the terms with government."
"To be short, it indicates they don't want any violence to happen and the settlement to happen with farmers."
The sentiment analyzer model is not trained as part of interest in this study.
Text Blob is used as a sentiment analyzer for predicting the scores.
"As the text blob model is trained on large corpus of text data, this package is used for better results."
Note : This study is a part of understanding and handling the unstructured data.
And study is not done in favor of any of the sides in the conflict.
He receives an increased scholarship as he is an active and dedicated student.
"Also, Charley is full of ideas and eagerness; he dreams about creating an online store."
"So he opens Google, types open an online store from scratch individually ."
"When the Internet appeared in the 90s, there were no UX."
"It was chalked up as an accomplishment to create the Hello, world!"
"At the cusp of the millenniums, the situation has changed drastically with the emergence of search engines."
The number of pages has increased and the first SEO signs appeared.
"For appearing at the top of the search results, it had to correspond with the search request as much as possible."
Website owners clued into this and began grabbing the audience with the keywords.
"Sysadmins understood all these efforts of the resource owners, but they were reluctant to sort the search results."
"Over time, more websites appeared, so the algorithms and requirements also changed."
In 2017 analysts marked a turning point in distributing the traffic between mobile and desktop devices in favor of the former.
This determined a new trend known as mobile-first named after an eponymous Google search algorithm.
The mobile-first algorithm and trend are about the priority of optimization of the Web-page optimization.
"The more users leave the website, the worse the behavior is."
"So, the website will be shown on the 3rd-10th page of the search results."
This impression is demonstrated by the following actions:These actions reveal different user's impressions from the website.
Many non-experts confuse these concepts and think that there is no difference between them.
Let us consider what is usability using a flat plan as an example.
The flat plan usability can be considered from different points of view:These are ways of operating a flat - one object.
This allows determining what hinders the visitor from making a target action.
"In the sphere of website development, it is recommended to consider usability on the stage of the project vision."
The usability audit is also made later - during the website work.
But the main work is performed at the beginning of the project design.
"When you buy a puppy, the first thing you should do is to train him to do number one during walks."
"In simple terms, it is the percentage of visitors who have made a target action."
It is the number of tomato sprouts that has taken roots and will be fruitful at the end of the season.
"If you water and fertilize them, you will get more tomatoes."
"If you do nothing, there would be no harvest at all."
There are two types of conversion:This can be visiting your blog found by the visitor in the search results.
The visitor also subscribed to the news not to miss the updates.
A simple example: the second part of the Frozen cartoon had been rumored long before the opening night.
"If the website developer and owner always understand the call, the visitors sometimes don't."
"If all visitors open the door properly for the first time, this means that the usability is appropriate."
To put it in a nutshell: don't make mistakes while designing it.
"If Charley wants to open an online store, he needs to know what does he want to receive a year later."
But now he has nothing except the dream about becoming an owner of a profitable resource.
Charley has to realize that even an online store that has a certain sales volume will not last long without such gizmos.
"Currently, entrepreneurs do not have to study 5 years at a university for opening a successful business and manage it."
"If you want to save money, better apply a resource allocation approach, not the economy."
There are a lot of tools that allow solving routine problems individually on the Internet.
You only need to choose the suitable ones for reaching the goals of your enterprise.
Search engine algorithms based on artificial intelligence track every action of Internet users.
"Besides analyzing the UX, these tools have other advantages:These tools perform other functions described here."
"By practicing consistently, lowering the stakes, and embracing useful constraints, you give your mind and spirit the room to expand."
"One group was graded on the quantity of work, the other was graded solely on the quality of one piece."
Guess which group had better pieces?The quantity group did better by far.
"You see, instead of theorizing, planning, and talking about what makes the best pot, the quantity group took action."
"Freed from the expectation of competence, they spent their time exploring, experimenting and creating."
"While lecturing at a Chinese University, I taught a few sections of a course called Innovation in Business."
"Do you need to ask which group had better ideas?Of course, the weekly group knocked it out of the park."
"Since creative people are prolific idea-generators, they have more misses than hits."
Consistent and focused practiceWe all know that more practice equates to better performance.
"Instead, research shows that trying many things in quick succession and consistently has more impact."
"Now suspend that same board between two-20 story buildings, 260 feet in the air."
Would you still be willing or able to do it?The skill needed hasn't changed.
"In my experiment, the quality group had one high-stakes project."
"If they failed to produce a good piece of work, they'd do poorly in the class."
"Because of this: they were less willing to take risks, to experiment with new opportunities."
"The second group, on the other hand, had no such stakes."
Time-pressure and the need to continually ideate and create led to better ideas and outcomes than those with no such constraint.
"In your own life, you can use these three elements to increase your work's effectiveness and creativity."
"In most cases, you're probably familiar with downloading Python libraries from PyPi using a command like pip install pandas."

"And if you're like me, you also likely use GitHub as a means to showcase your personal portfolio of work."
"That said, we're going to both install git and git your Git working with your personal GitHub account."
All you need to do is run the following command: sudo apt install git.
"Before jumping into connecting our Git to our GitHub, let's first set our git configuraiton settings."
"In any case, we'll just go ahead and create a new one to make things similar on ourselves."
This is a very simple process that can be covered in two swift steps:We're just about there!
This is where things get a little odd since we're using the iPad to connect to our Pi.
These steps are only going to make sense if you installed the Screens app in our previous step.
We're going to use a small tool called xclip to copy the contents of your SSH public key file to your clipboard.
"To install this, we'll use our old friend apt once again: sudo apt install xclip2."
"If you haven't already, it's now time to fire up the Screens app."
"Fortunately, the Screens app allows us to transfer clipboard contents back and forth between the iPad and Pi.3."
"Just to ensure we're on the same page, this is what I'm looking at right now:4."
"In the bottom-right corner of the Screens UI, you'll see a small square with an arrow pointing up."
Open up your favorite browser and navigate to your personal GitHub account.7.
"In the left navigation menu, click on SSH and GPG Keys."
Paste in the key from your clipboard and give the key any arbitrary name you'd like.
"Click the green Add SSH Key button, and we are done!Congrats!"
"Once again giving credit where it is due, a big thank you to Sofija Simic at this website for providing these instructions."
"Chances are that you've used Jupyter notebooks or JupyterLab, but you might not be familiar with JupyterHub."
JupyterHub takes things to the next level when it comes to creating a legitimate discovery environment.
"This is because JupyterHub allows multiple users, multiple compute resources, and multiple data sources to come together all under one roof."
"It is super nice, and we actually use JupyterHub in my day job at my Fortune 50 company."
"So you might be wondering, why do we care to enable this enterprise-grade thing on our tiny little Raspberry Pi?"
"I have two reasons for that, and you admittedly might not care about the one but will definitely care about the other."
The one you might not care about is enabling of multiple users.
"Once again, many thanks to Gerold Busch for providing my basis for this section."
"If you haven't already, ensure that you have all your Python configuration settings all good to go."
"If you've been following along with this series so far, you can skip to the next step."
JupyterHub uses a Python-based configuration file to store settings for JupyterHub.
We now need to edit the bind_url in that configuration file we just created.
"We're going to set it to port 8888, but it doesn't necessarily have to be that."
We will then need to uncomment and update the following row with this information:6.
"Okay, the basic behavior of our JupyterHub start-up is now good to go."
Now we just need to have our Raspberry Pi start up JupyterHub on OS bootup.
"To do that, we'll first need to create a new file in systemd."
"Speaking of Juno Connect, you might remember from an old post of mine my recommendation to use Juno as a Jupyter interface."
"They both have their use cases, so I personally have both installed."
All you need to do is open the app and tap on Add Jupyter Server.
"If you prefer a more native experience, you can connect to JupyterHub with your IP address directly in a regular web browser."
"I'm sure there are more tools we could add, but I think this gives you more than enough to get started."
I'm not sure if there will be another post in this series or not.
"If I can get it working, I'll write another post on that."
"But even if I don't write another Raspberry Pi + iPad post, I'll definitely write more data science posts."
"And yet, it may not be obvious how to connect existing business practices with all these amazing innovations."
One of the domains that allows organic application of ML is risk management for financial institutions and insurance companies.
There are many questions that organizations face regarding how to apply ML to improve risk management.
Here are just a few of them:· How to identify impactful use cases that can benefit from using artificial intelligence?
IBM DSE has built various accelerators which can help organizations jump start their adoption of ML.
"In 2020, multiple financial institutions were hit with fines exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars per individual organization."
This triggered a call for financial companies to ensure high quality of the large numbers of risk controls they have to work with.
"This includes explicitly identifying risks, implementing risk controls to prevent risk development, and finally establishing testing procedures."
A simple definition is that risk controls are put in place to monitor risks for a company's business operations.
"E.g., a security risk may be that an intruder guesses a password and as a result gets access to someone's account."
An important element for risk managers is whether the controls are well defined.
"E.g., some risk controls may be built by copying other existing controls with minimal modifications."
Another example is that some risk controls may be formed by integrating multiple risk controls into one.
Common consequences of this approach are duplicated controls and the presence of controls that are not relevant to the business any longer.
One of the most difficult challenges is to assess the general state of quality for the existing risk controls.
"However, this becomes a much more challenging task if we would like to find semantically similar descriptions."
"Additionally, it became a common practice to analyze the internal structure of information through ML techniques such as clustering."
The previous use cases were focused on the analysis of existing controls.
Another use case focuses on helping risk managers create new risk controls.
Recommending controls for a given risk using semantic similarity can significantly reduce manual effort and provide a flexible template for building controls.
Machine learning can help here with analysis of the risk description and figuring out the right set of controls to address each risk.
"In large organizations, it is typical that teams work on solutions and best practices which may be used by other teams."
The accelerator delivers a cognitive controls analytics application that integrates the developed models and applies them to unstructured risk controls content.
Let's look under the hood of the accelerator-based implementation using IBM Cloud Pak for Data.
Before we do this let's briefly review the IBM platform and approach.
IBM has a prescriptive approach to the journey to AI called the AI ladder.
The following diagram captures the details of developing an implementation in the context of the AI Ladder.
Keep an open mind to the lessons that come as giants fall.
Tim Cook of Apple called Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg out for their lack of ownership in a recent speech.
"However, in some ways, my worst leader was one who just bugged me out of principle."
Ed was the owner of a small campus café I briefly worked for in my freshman year of college.
"In preparation for Parent's Weekend on campus, he printed new menus with a 50% markup on most items."
Students called me a cheat as I struggled to work around the messed up computer.
"Still, everyone needed to use it after coming in from festivities, causing a continuous game of musical chairs."
"Ed screamed at me at one point, as yet another party of eight left the café in disgust without receiving their food."
"Having already turned in my two weeks notice mentally, I said in the coldest voice I could muster,"
"Ed then walked to the register, took the cash drawer, and went to his office."
"He cheerfully shouted, let me know when it's all clean, and you can go home, before shutting the door."
Cook's speech highlighted some of the best lessons I learned from Ed.
Cook pointed out the short-lived joy of claiming credit without accepting the responsibility.
It took me three hours to get that place back into reasonable shape for the morning shift.
"And finally, Cook said,Ed's café closed a few weeks later."
I was thrilled and unsurprised to see the closed sign hanging on the door.
"Students, who were the cafe's bread and butter, were disgusted that he overcharged their parents."
"Taking into account newly purchased equipment and wasted food, Ed lost more money than he earned."
And it was not a shock to anyone when the staff walked out or quit days after the fiasco.
"Learning by example is easy, and learning what not to do is even easier."
Tim Cook has harsh words for the leaders of industry that control our lives.
"However, keep your mind open to the lessons that come as those giants fall."
A T-test is a hypothesis test with a t-distribution that uses a t-statistic.
You would use a t-test when you don't know the population variance and have a small sample size.
Cherry picking refers to the practice of only selecting data or information that supports one's desired conclusion.
Significance chasing refers to when a researcher reports insignificant results as if they're almost significant.
The central limit theorem is very powerful - it states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution.
"To give an example, you would take a sample from a data set and calculate the mean of that sample."
The mean of this distribution will closely resemble that of the original data.
The central limit theorem is important because it is used in hypothesis testing and also to calculate confidence intervals.
A permutation of n elements is any arrangement of those n elements in a definite order.
Confidence intervals are often very important in medical research to provide researchers with a stronger basis for their estimations.
Hypothesis testing is the basis of any research question and often comes down to trying to prove something did not happen by chance.
Observational data comes from observational studies which are when you observe certain variables and try to determine if there is any correlation.
An example of experimental design is the following: split a group up into two.
The test group is told to drink a glass of wine every night for 30 days.
Simple random sampling requires using randomly generated numbers to choose a sample.
"More specifically, it initially requires a sampling frame, a list or database of all members of a population."
"Going back to our example, you could take every fourth name on the list."
"Cluster sampling starts by dividing a population into groups, or clusters."
What makes this different that stratified sampling is that each cluster must be representative of the population.
Stratified random sampling starts off by dividing a population into groups with similar attributes.
This method is used to ensure that different segments in a population are equally represented.
"To give an example, imagine a survey is conducted at a school to determine overall satisfaction."
It might make sense here to use stratified random sampling to equally represent the opinions of students in each department.
A type 1 error is when you incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis.
A type 2 error is when you don't reject a false null hypothesis.
The power of a test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false.
There are four major assumptions:A model is heteroscedastic when the variance in errors is not consistent.
"Conversely, a model is homoscedastic when the variances in errors is consistent."
Interpolation is a prediction made using inputs that lie within the set of observed values.
Extrapolation is when a prediction is made using an input that's outside the set of observed values.
Types of selection bias include:Handling missing data can make selection bias worse because different methods impact the data in different ways.
Mean imputation is the practice of replacing null values in a data set with the mean of the data.
Mean imputation is generally bad practice because it doesn't take into account feature correlation.
"Second, mean imputation reduces the variance of the data and increases bias in our data."
This leads to a less accurate model and a narrower confidence interval due to a smaller variance.
"When there is autocorrelation, the errors show a sequential pattern and the model is less accurate."
Potential biases include the following:You would perform hypothesis testing to determine statistical significance.
An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations.
"If the outlier is caused by a measurement error, it's important to remove them from the dataset."
"IQR, the concept used to build boxplots, can also be used to identify outliers."
The IQR is equal to the difference between the 3rd quartile and the 1st quartile.
"Other methods include DBScan clustering, Isolation Forests, and Robust Random Cut Forests."
An inlier is a data observation that lies within the rest of the dataset and is unusual or an error.
"Since it lies in the dataset, it is typically harder to identify than an outlier and requires external data to identify them."
"Should you identify any inliers, you can simply remove them from the dataset to address them."
The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution that gives the probability of the number of independent events occurring in a fixed time.
"Otherwise, you cannot relax until you got 61 out of 100 to claim yes."
"Since 99 is within this confidence interval, we can assume that this change is not very noteworthy."
Let's say the first card you draw from each deck is a red Ace.
"This means that in the deck with 12 reds and 12 blacks, there's now 11 reds and 12 blacks."
When there are a number of outliers that positively or negatively skew the data.
Therefore we need to know the probability of it raining in London on a given day.
I hope you found this useful in refreshing and patching up your statistics knowledge.
"As always, I wish you the best in your data science endeavors."
They showed that their approach is better than a Bayesian decoder for predicting a rat's location in a 2D environment.
Our secondary goal was to investigate an anomaly that the original research authors noticed when examining the gradient strength in their neural networks.
A brief overview of that is also provided in the last section of the current blog post.
"Before we get too rigorous, let's do some simple training and predicting with neural networks."
"In the original article, the researchers used a neural network with LSTM nodes in order to predict the rat's current location."
"LSTM nodes also remember information for some arbitrary amount of time, perhaps similarly to what a brain does."
LSTM based RNN input was formed by the measurements at 100 of such consecutive timesteps.
The network was then asked to predict the rat's location at the center of the last time window.
"In this way, the researchers got a pretty good approximation for the rat's current location."
The simple approach for predicting the future is to just use this same architecture and input data but change the location we predict.
Notice that we cannot use an analogous approach to estimate the past location.
"Therefore, we need a different approach to test if the place cells remember any location from the past."
"As you may be aware, training large neural networks might become quite slow."
"If you want to achieve something in a reasonable amount of time, you should really use some GPU acceleration."
Luckily Google Colab is the perfect place for this kind of experimentation and that is what we used.
"After training these models for 40 epochs, these are the results we got."
"The further into the future we predict, the bigger the error becomes."
There is no clear cutoff point here where we can say that the given rat did not plan this far.
There might be some overfitting happening and some models would perhaps perform better given more training epochs.
We need to develop an approach which is a bit more clever.
For the Neuron Spiking Decoder we selected an ML algorithm that is able to detect the location signal from neurons spiking data.
The neuron spiking data provided in the original paper's GitHub repository is readily preprocessed in multiple different breakdowns.
The measurements of neuronal spiking data and rat location were taken during a 20 minute timespan.
The X-axis reflects the time range from 1 minute past to 1 minute future.
The blue dots on the upper chart are the mean absolute errors of the baseline models for given time ranges.
"Remember, the baseline model did not have access to the neuron spiking data, just the location, speed and movement direction."
"In order to better understand what is going on on those charts, let's explain some observations here."
"These are the boxed areas, added to the lower chart, to better locate those MAE differences."
This result is interesting enough that further more diligent research should be conducted on this matter.
Why are we seeing such an oscillating trend both in the MAEs and the difference of the MAEs?
Why does the advanced model get worse results than baseline in regions far away from the t = 0?
"This means that, on average, the MAE of the baseline model is slightly smaller than the MAE of the advanced model."
"That observation is not surprising since the past is a firm fact, and thus the rat should have concrete memories about it."
Below are the respective charts of those:We can observe similar patterns for these rats as we did with the first one.
Our secondary goal was to understand the gradient behavior of the original model.
"Neural networks are trained using some variant of gradient descent, where the weights of the network are iteratively modified."
"The question was, how the neurons decode this information and is this reflected in the parameters of the neural network."
"We would also expect the last timestep to be the most informative, with the highest gradient strength."
"However, the gradients of the neural network showed a different picture."
"Namely, there was a very distinct drop in the gradient strength in the last time window."
"The recurrent layer architectures were either simple RNN, LSTM or GRU."
"Each subplot is for a different network layer architecture, and on each subplot one line corresponds to one cell architecture."
"As we can see from the graph, the gradient dropping behaviour exists regardless of which network we use."
If we looked at the neurons separately the drop in gradients for the last timestep was still there.
"However, for simpler models with just one layer the drop was less significant."
One option would be to use attention models and analyze the attention weights.
"In summary, we would like to emphasize that all the results and explanations here should be taken as speculative."
This blog post is by no means a peer reviewed scientific paper.
We hope that the thoughts presented here provide inspiration for further research in similar areas.
"It's not about the people you know, but what they can do for you."
"People that didn't know me before, but trust my expertise to help them out."
It still feels a bit surreal - who would hire a copywriter with less than a year of professional writing experience?
"I didn't know who either, but lucky for me, I found 2 people."

This learned me one crucial thing:Knowing how someone interacts with your product is priceless.
"Looking back, here are the three tactics that have helped me the most."
It looked like a daunting and grueling task: selling myself to strangers.
"In the beginning, this can be tough as there isn't any experience to show your client."
I'm capable of the thing I said I was by doing the work.
"Let's say, a potential client needs help with their brand identity and strategy."
"In preparation for this meeting, I go over their resources - website, ads, blog posts, etc."
"Based on this, I come up with little tweaks or initiatives in their current strategy."
"I'm all about overdelivering at first, to blow them away and present them the big-time value."
"Landing a freelance client becomes difficult when the focus is too much on your hourly rate, coupled with the actual output."
I don't want to be the freelancer that has to defend every 30 minutes he's working on something.
My first project?I built a website for a good friend of mine.
"Not actually what I aspire to do in the long term, but I helped him."
"Plus, I got paid for it, so I could satisfy my landlord and I gained valuable experience with the freelancing thing."
"Ask friends, family or coworkers, if you can build, design, or write something for them."
The goal is not to make as much money as possible yet.
The goal is to build up a portfolio and get acquainted with the freelancer journey.
Working together with real clients requires you to step up your game and provide the best value possible.
"Yet, if there's money to be made, never let it slip."
It shows they can rely on you to find the work needed to be done.
Use this information to decide whether there's more opportunity to jump in.
Move back and forth by giving advice on different aspects of their business.
"Know that they've helped you in the past, so they will in some way or form in the future."
You can look at their business model and activities and give them a refreshing point of view.
"Plus, being an outsider comes with a certain level of freedom in terms of things you can or can't say."
"Being a freelancer means you're on a continuous learning curve, the moment you stagnate, your product will decline as well."
"Learn to tackle bigger problems, and you can increase your price."
Believe that your work is good enough to justify this and you're halfway there.
"You have to treat yourself as the business because as a freelancer, you are the business."
Invest in yourself the same way as you'd have done in case you had inventory or employees to take care of.
One of my current projects contains activities and responsibilities that I've never done before.
"Yet, I'm comfortable that I will be able to nail them."
"In a way, I oversold myself to this client, but I see it differently."
I take pride in the fact that I'm an autodidact and possess a great degree of self-discipline.
"Yet, sometimes it's nice to apply this extra form of pressure to my development."
Being a freelancer doesn't mean you have to do it alone.
Do this for a month consistently and see how many opportunities will arise.
"At least, that's what I'm hoping for you, considering the fact you're reading this article."
"Having two clients doesn't fully satisfy me yet, I'm hungry for more."
"I'm not unthankful at all, I just know that relying on two streams of income isn't rock solid."
"I want to build my own stuff - digital products, a community, or a cohort and help others."
"I feel I'm on the right path, but only time will tell if that's the case."

The easiest way to accomplish this is to bring your team together with regularly scheduled virtual meetings.
This can also be a great time to start new company traditions.
"When the world is turned upside down, it is paramount for leadership to communicate openly, frequently, and honestly."

"This is another opportunity to build connections while we are apart, says Ariel."
"It's important to me that we have a happy, healthy and motivated team, but 2020 definitely brought up some challenges."
"What you can control, however, is the support and leadership you offer through the turbulence."
"Think about this: when something resonates with us, we connect with it on a very deep level."
It indicates how well we relate to a specific brand and how intense our relationship is with the brand.
"It makes us feel good, comfortable, happy, joyful, and even loved."
"When brand resonance occurs, it means customers feel completely in sync with a brand."
"In the book Strategic Brand Management: Building, Measuring, and Managing Brand Equity,"
And we can't form a relationship with customers unless we've triggered the proper responses from them.
"As marketers, we need to do something to communicate our brand with customers."
"We have to teach our customers who our brand is, what it stands for, and why it's unique."
We have to give them the meaning of our brand so they can know how much it's relevant to them.
On the right side of the pyramid is branding objectives corresponding to branding development stages.
"But it's not just any kind of awareness; instead, very deep and broad brand awareness."
"Then, we set our points of parity where we're similar to others and points of difference where we're different."
"In doing so, we try to get positive, accessible reactions from customers and ultimately move customers to the resonance level."
"When we say that something is salient, we mean it's important."
"When we say someone makes a salient point, we mean their point is excellent."
We know it out there and easily recognize it among others and recall it under various circumstances.
Some questions that can help measure brand salience:Brand performance measures how well a product or service fulfills customers' functional needs.
Some questions that can help measure brand performance:Brand imagery refers to the way customers think about a brand abstractly.
It depends on brands' attempts to meet customers' psychological or social needs.
"Customers can establish associations with the brand from their experience or through advertising, or from other sources of information."
"Read how this customer thought about Harley-Davidson, and you'll know the power of brand imagery."
Some questions that can help measure brand imagery:Brand judgments are customers' personal opinions about the brand.
"They may evaluate your brand in terms of quality, credibility, considerations, and superiority."
Brand feelings are customers' emotional responses and reactions to a brand.
These feelings can be mild or intense and can be positive or negative.
"When customers feel resonated with a brand, they'll continue to choose and incorporate the brand into their life."
"With true brand resonance, you can gain significant brand equity, meaning strong customer engagement and loyalty."
That's why a lot of people prefer Mac OS to Windows even though it's much more expensive.
It may take you years of trying a lot of things to build a brand and make it resonate with customers.
Many people severely underestimate the hard work it takes to get started in a freelancing career.
Even those freelancers who've been doing it for a while are guilty of underplaying the effort required.
"This causes people to think it's just that easy, but in reality, they got lucky."
"Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they don't deserve their success."
"The theory is appealing, but do you know what it takes to create an ebook?"
"Because I do, I've written several books and even self-published one of them."
"And the worst part is, even after you've finished everything, this does not ensure your book will be a hit."
You need a successful marketing campaign before and after publishing it to get the traction you'd want.
"Unless you work on marketing, not everyone can do it, which means you need to pay someone else to do it."
"After all, you write it once, and you sell it potentially, thousands of times."
"However, you need to consider the whole process before jumping into the writing an ebook bandwagon."
The reasoning behind it: you create it once and sell it forever.
"Even if you sell it at 1 dollar, eventually it'll turn into profit."
The problem with this approach is that not everyone knows how to teach.
You can't just blurb out a bunch of definitions and expect someone on the other side to understand -
"Anyone can create a YouTube channel, but that doesn't mean anyone can live off the income produced by that."
"What do you need to have a successful YouTube channel, then?"
"Just like with the other options, there is no insurance with YouTube."
"The phrase If you build it, they will come doesn't work with the Internet."
Just because you put quality YouTube videos out there doesn't mean others will find them and like them.
Do you think you're capable of that?This one is my favorite.
I understand the whole 1000 true fans theory and what it can mean for someone trying to build a freelance business.
"And if you manage to get the email of these true fans, then you're golden."
"But that's just the theory, how can you find these people?"
Can you request their email addresses and expect them to give them to you?
"If you can't nail point #1, you won't benefit from the other two."
So make sure you understand how to get people to sign up before you get started.
"You need to have something to sell to these people; otherwise, income will never come."
"Starting a freelance career is not easy, no matter how much those so-called experts advertise it."
Svalbard is a small Norwegian archipelago that sits about halfway between Norway and the North Pole.
"Longyearbyen, its largest settlement with around 2,000 residents, is the world's northernmost town."
"While anyone can move to Svalbard visa-free, it's not an easy place to live."
"Luckily, Blomdahl was happy to give us a glimpse into an average day for her."
She said that this is somewhat unusual: Most people spend weekends in such cabins but live in town full-time.
"You'd be surprised by how easy it is to live without water, as long as you just have the right mindset."
"The view here is worth so much, she said about her decision to live on the outskirts of town without running water."
"Her boyfriend gets up at 5 a.m. for his job in logistics, so she usually has mornings to herself."
"Blomdahl said that if a polar bear was nearby, Grim would alert them."
"Blomdahl is a photographer and videographer, but she also works part-time in the town's only women's clothing store."
She explained that the school is mostly about how to survive in the arctic.
"As Blomdahl notes in her viral TikTok, even walking a dog is an adventure in Svalbard."
She said that this time of year she likes to eat porridge with chia and hemp seeds.
"Because we don't get any vitamins from the sun, it's really important to try to put them into your food."
"I eat supplements, but you do want it integrated into your diet, she said."
"You just need to drink coffee and keep the spirit high, she said."
"That can literally go on for like five hours or at least until my boyfriend comes home, she said."
"He usually comes home around 2.30 p.m. and then takes a nap, she said."
"We're living pretty normal - we go to restaurants, we go to the gym."
"Blomdahl lives on a pretty isolated road, with just four other cabins nearby."
"She describes Longyearbyen as incredibly vibrant as it's home to around 50 different nationalities, thanks to its visa-free situation."
"It's like a metropolis, people come here from all over the world, she said."
You'll just find a little note that says 'chicken will be back in three days.'
Svalbard is in some ways super expensive and in some ways really not.
"Like if you want to order something online, it's going to be cheaper because it's tax-free."
"But milk is going to cost you half of your bank account, she said."
She said each resident has a little card from the government they must present when purchasing alcohol.
"If you're having a party, you need to get together and buy together, she said."
"While items can arrive in as soon as three days, the timing depends on flight schedules and weather conditions."
Blomdahl's boyfriend is a chef and usually cooks some sort of protein with a side of vegetables.
"Blomdahl said that she usually meets friends for snowmobiling, hiking, or skiing."
"Before the pandemic, she'd meet them for dinner at a restaurant or to play badminton."
"They are more magical than I could ever explain to people, she said."
She cites the incredible nature as what has kept her in Svalbard for so many years.
We're surrounded by mountains and glaciers and polar bears and Northern Lights - every day feels like an adventure.
"Because of the coronavirus pandemic, Svalbard is closed to visitors from the US."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19.
"After spending a weekend in a camper van, an Insider reporter reveals the most disappointing sides of van life."
"By Frank OlitoWhen it comes to the growing van life movement, reality rarely meets expectations."
"But after a weekend filled with mishaps and frustrations, I quickly learned there are some disappointing sides to the van life movement."
Here are photos of 13 disappointing moments from my short stint with van life.
Many stay overnight at Walmarts and Cracker Barrels all over the country despite never showing it on social media.
My social media feed is filled with images of vanlifers opening their two back doors to showcase a picturesque landscape.
"In reality, those people aren't staying there overnight or waking up in those locations because parking there is illegal."
"When I woke up in the campground, I took a photo of my back view."
There were buttons all over the van that all had different functions.
"During my weekend adventure, the heat in the van broke, so it was unbelievably cold."
"Although it helped fix the temperature issue temporarily, it felt unsafe to keep the burners going for an extended period of time."
I was surprised by how much the windows fogged up in the van.
"When I saw it in person, though, I was disappointed."
"This was the first time I used a composting toilet, and I would never use one again."
"Whenever someone went to the bathroom, the whole van smelled like a public bathroom for a few minutes."
"Also, I had to deconstruct the toilet at the end of the weekend to empty it."
"In the camper van I rented, I had to convert the two back benches into a large bed."
"First, it was difficult to find a place for the large cushions in the van when I had to unfold the platform."
"Once the bed itself was built, I had to put the sheets on the bed, which was another hassle."
"Since three sides of the bed were up against a wall, it was very difficult to put on a fitted sheet."
"For my weekend road trip, I packed a small duffel bag and a backpack."
"The rest were filled with machines that help the van run, kitchenware, and first aid kits."
I couldn't imagine fitting my entire life into the limited storage space even if I did downsize most of my belongings.
"Had her mother not been dying, the visit would have been Will's best homecoming ever."
"One morning, Will let her niece lead the way, and she chose an old, familiar route."
They crossed a wooden bridge and stepped onto a path leading into the trees.
They walked in silence as the air grew dark and the path narrowed.
"Becky stopped frequently to add wildflowers to her basket, but still managed to stay several steps ahead."
Will wondered if her niece felt the same pull into the woods that had drawn her as a child.
"It was sad that she didn't have a little sister for company - or a cousin, she thought with a stab."
"Becky clambered down a muddy trail to the stream, and Will followed."
They moved swiftly and silently toward their destination and soon found themselves in a clearing where the stream ended in the Bottomless Pool.
"Will and Becky stood close to the edge, looking for anything of interest in the murky depths."
"I would have to have my scuba gear to breathe, of course."
"Even then, I probably would just get tangled up in a bunch of weeds and stuff."
"I wouldn't travel very far at all, and there wouldn't be much to see or do."
"I would like it if it did come out in China, Becky persisted."
"Then, if you were on an expedition there, you could still live with us."
"Just jump in to go to work, and jump out to come home."
Will idly wondered why Becky wanted to consign her to a future of deep-sea diving in China.
"Then again, maybe her ruined reputation wouldn't follow her there."
"Its plump body popped, leaving a smear of her own blood."
"Okay, kiddo, let's move on before we get eaten alive."
"It's Ophelia - one of Mr. Shakespeare's girls, Becky said."
"Gran tells me everything, she added, as though sharing a secret."
"Just 'in your darkest hour, you must never give up.'"
Will saw the strained look on Becky's face and felt a flash of anger toward her mother.
"I guess this is her darkest hour, because she's so sick."
"Gran's going to heaven to be an angel, Will said lightly."
"I have to get her out of this place, she thought."
"Will's immediate plan of action was to keep Becky from being alone with her grandmother, ever again."
"So she joined in the ritual bedecking with flowers that afternoon, waiting apprehensively for Cora to say something unacceptable to the child."
Will was ready to pounce with her only weapon - her scientific logic.
"Will felt a moment of tenderness for her mother, and the accompanying flow of guilt over her own stoniness."
Copernicus was a muscular orange tabby whose favorite sleeping arrangement was on top of Will's feet.
"My guess is not in private, either - am I right?"
Sunlight glancing through one of the hanging crystals fractured her face into prisms of colored light.
"That was when you stopped loving me, Cora said matter-of-factly."
"I have been patient with you, daughter, but I'm running out of time, she said sharply."
"I wanted you back, but I'll settle for you present."
"Now stop working so hard to shut me out for a minute, and pay attention."
"She's going to say it anyway, so I might as well get it over with."
"Her anxiety evaporated, and she saw her for the confused old woman she was."
She walked over to the bed and tentatively picked up her hand and held it in her own.
"It was an awkward gesture, but it helped Will feel in control again."
"With unaccountable strength, the old lady squeezed Will's hand until it hurt."
"The short answer, Hart-Unger noted, is that for the most part, it's futile."
You can't really make people do things they don't want to do.
"With a partner, though, it's a different matter, especially if there are kids involved."
Erica is not alone in having a spouse who refuses to plan.
"In the context of family harmony, the fact that someone doesn't like to plan doesn't matter much."
And non-planners with complex lives are almost always already benefiting from a planning process.
"In his words, you can arouse in the other person an eager want."
Attending a sporting event might require getting tickets and arranging a work schedule to allow for the possibility.
"In Covid times, safely seeing friends outside means planning around the weather."
That's because doing nothing often means autonomous hours spent relaxing and not being responsible for kid requests and the like.
"Mention that you really like to anticipate your fun, and you suspect that your non-planning family member might too."
"Yep, it's a plan - we just don't need to call it that."
So the second tactic is to promise to keep planning time to a minimum.
I'm a big fan of a weekly planning meeting of 30 minutes or less.
You talk about fun future things you'd like to arrange and assign any logistics.
"And then - this is key - you don't talk about logistics and plans until the next meeting, unless absolutely necessary."
Sometimes this can be enough to nudge an anti-planner into the game.
"If your next search for the car keys sets off such thoughts, keep in mind two reassuring facts."
"Second, there's a simple, enjoyable technique that can minimize age-related decline."
"The specifics vary from person to person, but the idea is the same: Change things up."
You've been intellectually and emotionally engaged for a very long time.
"You can choose to cease that engagement, or you can plan a rich retirement filled with activities."
"In order to keep your memory sharp, she reports, you have to do exciting, interesting, challenging stuff."
"The normal aging process can slow, or inhibit, each of those steps."
"In general, memories are a compressed version of reality, says Yassa."
"You may remember what happened, but not when and where it happened."
"Older adults are more likely to say, yes, it's the same thing."
That suggests their initial encoding of the memory was not at the highest level of detail.
The mild forgetfulness we all get as older adults is perfectly fine.
And those hours spent at home can be utilized in brain-boosting ways.
The combination of novelty and light exercise is a kind of fertilizer that surrounds brain cells with nutrients.
"Sabina Brennan, PhD, an Irish neuroscientist and psychologist and author of the book 100 Days to a Younger Brain, agrees."
"If it's frustrating or annoying, it's not going to be beneficial."
"Both Yassa and Brennan have another, somewhat surprising recommendation: Participate in activities that stimulate as many senses as possible."
"But, alas, when we go to school, we are discouraged from touching, tasting, etc."
Actively engaging your senses can play a powerful role in embedding memories in your brain.
"The olfactory system evolved together with the memory system of the brain, so it has direct access to it."
Olfaction is one of the most powerful stimulants for our memory system.
"He also samples new artisanal chocolates whenever possible, stimulating both taste and smell."
Trying new podcasts - Brennan has one called Super Brain - could also provide valuable stimulation.
"In addition, she endorses an everyday behavior that will be novel for many of us: staying mindful."
"Our ability to form memories for recent events does appear to decline with age, she says."
"But in many instances this might not be due to failures of memory, but rather failures of attention."
"So, to keep a sharp memory as we grow older, the key steps are clear."
"And above all, stop that internal chatter that says, I'm really getting old."
I can always rely on my mother for her unwitting contribution to my blogging content.
I could write for days about her odd behaviors and emotional baggage and the challenging nature of our relationship.
I have periods where I cut off communication with her for my own sanity.
I haven't spoken to her in several weeks after a disagreement.
I can't even pretend to find any sound reasoning in this if I would ever want to.
It is no secret that the relationship I have with my mother is tumultuous at best.
The last four years have proven to be a catalyst in my choice to remove toxic family members from my life.
"Yet, lingering guilt still surfaces as I reflect on my choices."
"We wouldn't tolerate bigoted, racist, hateful behavior from people."
"However, we tend to accept deplorable behavior from our family in the name of love or loyalty."
"We had fought long and hard to abolish racism, bigotry, homophobia, and hatred."
"She proudly shared that she registered to vote, for the first time in her life, to cast her ballot for Trump."
"Over the last few years, I have listened to her spew all the typical Trumpisms and Fox news headlines."
"Despite my best efforts, she refused to listen to reason and dismissed all my attempts at providing her with facts."
She was repeating the things she had heard from my grandfather or the right-wing media.
The nature of the hatred she felt for him was glaringly obvious: it was because he is black.
"While I didn't hide my feelings towards her views, I attempted to avoid the topic of politics altogether."
"I knew where she stood on things, and I had no desire to go down that road."
Inevitably she would bring up two topics that we would never see eye-to-eye on: politics and religion.
I think that she genuinely enjoys riling people up and causing a fight.
"We are born into a group of people, and as children, we unknowingly assume that these people are good and kind."
They mold our thoughts and behaviors and impact the type of adult we become.
"Baby Boomers are being constantly ridiculed, and whenever someone behaves poorly, they are quickly labeled a boomer."
"Intolerance, segregation, oppression, racism, and sexism ran rampant."
"Yet, history has long proven that just because something appears normal in society, doesn't mean it is morally acceptable."
"When we endure bad behavior in our relationships, it slowly deteriorates us."
"We are left questioning our truths, even though we know that truth and ethics should always prevail."
I plan to continue living my life surrounded by people who are committed to living morally and decently.
I can't deny the lingering loss I feel from shutting out members of my family.
I wish I could call up my mother to tell her good news or cry to her when things are bad.
"Yet, the pain and conflict that came with that relationship outweighed the good."
"As I write this, I am watching on television the Inauguration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., our 46th President."
A light dusting of snowflakes falls on the crowd standing before the Capitol Building.
"Music plays, and smiles are visible in the eyes of the masked group."
Hospitals are used to certain medical supply distributors and are wary of testing out new masks.
"In the nonprofit sphere, Black people make up about six percent of organizational leaders, according to this 2017 Battalia Winston report."
"For context, the Black population in the United States is more than 13%.The disparity is clear."
And the odds that your organization also lacks diversity in its positions of power is high.
"In addition to examining your leadership team, review your managers in the organization."
"And review those in the organization who have been recently promoted, received public or organization-wide recognition or earned special awards."
"While you're at it, why not review salaries and tenure?"
Are people who hold the same position and have similar years of experience earning the same amount?
"Or, is there a difference between what men, women and underrepresented team members are receiving?"
"Without as much exposure to Black people, colleagues have fewer opportunities to correct for stereotypes they've picked up."
"Stating you're not racist, are color blind, or have Black friends or family members·"
Telling a Black colleague he or she is not like other Black people ·
Asking a Black colleague to weigh in on Black-centered issues and cultural norms or explain them·
"Not only does this cause a potential PR or, possibly, legal issue for an organization, it's also incredibly costly."
"All that said, not talking about race and race-based interactions is a mistake no matter how you look at it."
"Question 3: Similarly, do managers and leadership talk about what's happening in the world as it happens?George Floyd."
"These are things that need to be acknowledged, addressed and given the time and space they warrant."
These are markers of growth and building blocks of victory felt by the Black community - and space should be provided for reflection.
"In the past several years, organizations, of all sizes and across industries, have touted cultures that hire for fit."
It's really a win-win - you're doing the right thing and being rewarded for it.
"That is, it's one thing to have a DEI program in an organization -"
"And, when individuals betray the DEI mission, they're held accountable for their actions."
"But it all starts with a conversation, and then the intention is supported by ongoing dialogue, be it uncomfortable or not."

"By following a series of steps, you can examine your options from different points of view."
"As a result, you'll reach ethical decisions that you can explain and defend."
"Information about a decision-maker's alternatives may come from reports, news sources, conversations, or interviews."
Identifying stakeholders - Stakeholders are people who have an interest in the outcome of a decision.
"To choose the most ethical alternative, the decision-maker must identify all the people who will be affected."
Decision-makers should ensure that they recognize how decisions will affect all stakeholders.
Decision-makers may find that different solutions to the problem support competing values.
"Consider a chain of fast-food restaurants giving away small, inexpensive toys with each children's meal."
The chain contracts an independent consumer's group to test each toy and ensure that they're safe for small children.
The marketing manager must decide whether the company has an ethical obligation to recall the toys.
The marketing manager collects production and shipping reports to learn how many of the toys had been made and shipped to restaurants.
He refers to sales reports to estimate how many had been given away.
The marketing manager lists the people and groups that would be affected by his decision.
Parents of children who had received the toys would also be affected.
Recognizing consequences - The marketing manager evaluates how each solution would affect the company and other stakeholders.
Gathering relevant information about the issue helps prepare decision-makers to evaluate the usefulness - the utility - of their options.
Decision-makers must avoid selective information that supports only one point of view.
"They must also be careful to focus solely on the facts at this stage, not opinions."
"Decision-makers might identify some external stakeholders from the facts they gather, but they also need to think more broadly."
"For example, they could check people or groups who have a history of complaining about the company's actions."
"After decision-makers have gathered facts and identified stakeholders, they must recognize the consequences of their actions."
"Although they can deduce some consequences on their own, others will be identified by stakeholders."
Decision-makers should also judge whether the benefits and costs of their decisions are distributed fairly to stakeholders.
"Once the consequences have been realized, decision-makers must prioritize the importance of competing values."
"In general, ethical decision-makers give a higher priority to values that support important relationships."
"If decision-makers ignore relationships, their decisions may produce unforeseen reactions from stakeholders."
"The word ethics refers to the values a company shares with its employees, customers, suppliers, and even competitors."
"When decision-makers consider ethical questions, they should examine those questions from many perspectives."
"The decision-making steps are gathering facts, identifying stakeholders, recognizing consequences, and prioritizing values."
Following these steps can help decision-makers examine ethical questions from appropriate points of view.
This was crazy to me and left me wondering about all the possibilities of what might exist at the bottom of the sea?
"I fantasized about sea dragons and giant megalodons and who knows, maybe they do exist down there."
But I wanted to take it a step further than just fantasizing about these creatures.
"So, for example, all faces have a relatively similar distribution of features."
"They have two eyes which are above one nose and one mouth, etc."
This fake image is fed into the discriminator along with real images from whatever dataset it is being trained on.
"After processing an image, the discriminator returns a number between 1 and 0 showing the probability of the image being real."
But over time they continue to learn by being in competition together.
"The first layer is the input layer, which unsurprisingly receives the input."
"And sandwiched between those two layers exist the hidden layers, which perform the majority of the computational algorithms in neural networks."
"Most neural networks are fully connected, meaning that they have connections to the layers on either side."
"These connections each have a weight, which is either a positive or negative number."
The higher the weight the more influence one unit has on another.
"If this learning process by minimizing margin of error seems familiar, you are correct!"
The generator and dicriminator in the GAN architecture are both neural networks.
"The more layers you stack together and use, the more complex the features that you extract will be."
But eventually I got both of them working together and followed a PyTorch DCGAN tutorial from the PyTorch website to generate celebrity faces.
I pulled these off the internet and added them to a folder.
An important thing to note about these images is that they all have a black background color.
I mentioned wanting all of my images to appear similar enough that it is clear they are a part of the same project.
"I did this by making their backgrounds the same color, black."
This also helps the actual image of the sea creature to stand out.
For the rest of the code you can follow the PyTorch tutorial.
Generally the more image you can train your model on the better the results turn out.
I was disappointed by this image because I couldn't picture how it was a real sea creature.
But through further observation I realized on the right side of this creature there seems to be some kind of tail.
"If you'd like to see the rest of the generated images, check out the digital prints here!"
Step 2 in my new life as a digital nomad is Mexico.
"I really liked Lisbon, but now I feel like I'm finally where I'm supposed to be."
I feel at ease when it's hot outside and the water is never far away.
"After a good morning's work, I felt like taking a walk."
"I can put one foot in front of the other for hours at a time, going as I please."
I roamed the streets looking for the street vendors of Nutella mixed with cheese.
"Most often, they are located between 15th and 20th avenue, crossing 8th and 10th street."
"At 3 pm, I was outside in the heat, rocking my shorts and t-shirts, happily sweating."
There's almost nothing that makes me happier - especially when it's food that I've never tasted before.
"Or, even more interesting, some food I never thought to try."
"This is the most common version, along with the cajeta version, which is a kind of caramel."
"Especially since it's a popular dessert here, mainly eaten in the evening, while walking around town."
"I walked for miles looking for these street vendors, without seeing any."
"I knew they were around, and I was determined to find them."
"It was free of people, and the word Marquesitas was displayed in bold, colored letters."
The man put some dough between two pans placed on a fire and turned them over several times.
"The sun was shining on my back, while the heat from the pans warmed my face."
"After a few seconds, he opened the jar of Nutella and spread a large spoonful of hazelnut pasta over the pancake."
"Then he grated some Edam, a lot in fact, and sprinkled it on the Marquise."
"He put it in a cone, with a towel, and went around his stand to hand it to me."
You can see the result on the floor in the photo above.
"There was the sweet, burning taste of Nutella, with the comforting, salty kick of the cheese."
"Both melted and mixed in my mouth, the salt of the cheese making the sugar in the chocolate soar."
The crispness of the pancake added a bit of dynamism to the whole.
"I plan to try some more, from other vendors, just to see how different it tastes."
I could literally travel the world merely to try as many different dishes as I can.
"Whether you like it or not, you have to know what it is."
"To me, it was like a warm cloud of happiness melting in my mouth."
The Five Dysfunctions of a Team was the first leadership book I read after Physical Therapy School.
I read it as a staff therapist and a second time as a manager.
You glean different insights into the team dynamic as a member and as the leader of a team.
"While the dysfunctions build off one another, you will find some more prevalent and challenging than others."
I have found dysfunction #4 to be the most common and costly among leadership teams.
I'll also share personal book and article reviews that will help with personal and professional growth.
"The Silicon Valley startup, Clubhouse has been the talk of the town for almost a year."
It garnered love as soon as it was released in April 2020.
The Silicon Valley startup has one heck of a story behind its inception.
"Despite having just 1500 users in May 2020, it was valued at around $100 million."
"And fast forward today, it has raised Series B funding at an evaluation of $1 billion."
"Clubhouse is an audio-based social networking platform - free from photos, videos, and texts."
Another evidence of its exclusivity is that it is invite-only.
"To join the application, you need an invite either from existing users or from Clubhouse itself."
But you might have to wait an eternity to receive an invitation from Clubhouse.
"Once you join, you'll be asked to choose from a variety of topics."
"You can exchange ideas, listen to experts, connect with others through the app."
"While Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Oprah Winfrey are hosting conversations on the platform, Clubhouse has become the buzzword."
"Also, the reason behind keeping the platform invite-only has served its purpose."
"Clubhouse might bring in a creator program for people to monetize, benefitting not only the creators but the app itself."
Discord is another social networking application that has been around for quite a while.
Discord is mostly used by gamers for real-time communication will fellow gamers.
It is not something where you set up a topic for conversation or discussion in advance.
"Clubhouse, on the other hand, has the trust of many celebrities."
The big players can co-exist if they keep innovating and look different.
There has been a rapid growth in the user base that wasn't anticipated.
Clubhouse has to keep up the growth and has to maintain its exclusivity at the same time.
"Over the years, we have seen social networking sites bringing the same features as that of other social networking platforms."
"But later, Instagram, Facebook, and even LinkedIn introduced disappearing stories."
"TikTok, a video-sharing social-networking platform helps users create short videos and share them with their network."
"With unchecked conspiracy theories around COVID-19 spreading on the platform, Clubhouse is learning it the hard way."
Though CEO and co-founder Paul Davidson said moderation is a top priority.
It will be interesting to see how Clubhouse deals with the challenges and whether it will make be able to make it big.
"If you are expecting a 100% realistic answer you may be disappointed, as this theory has a more abstract approach."
"If you're familiar with David Lynch, you'll feel right at home."
The quotes below are from G-Man at the ending of Half-Life Alyx.
"The G-Man: He represents Valve, the story writers and developers, those who decide the future of Half Life."
He's the tool via whom stuff happens in the Half-Life universe.
He's the cog between Valve and stuff happening inside the game.
You can hear him admit this: Some believe that the fate of this world is inflexible.
"For example, he's the one who wakes up Gordon Freeman."
All players playing the game connected with the Half Life universe via Gordon's eyes.
"Between Half-Life 1 and Half -Life 2, 6 years elapsed."
"Gordon served the series well, but after HL episode 3, the series went on a halt."
Valve worked on lots of prototypes with Gordon that led nowhere and got canceled.
"Until now After 13 years of effort, Valve turns to Alyx for the protagonist of a new game."
"Too large, given the interests of my employers The interest of Valve is to make new Half Life games."
"If the Combine are gone, there would be no interest for a new game."
This is a nudge that can be made by G-Man.
"Valve has no issues with that, as it would push the plot forward and create an opportunity for a new game."
"So, what about the vault where G-Man was trapped?"
I think that it represents a place with no time or space as the game is concerned.
"It's like a simulation, closer to the game engine and the developers."
"If this was Matrix, it's where the architect would be."
"Until the next game is released, G-Man hibernates Alyx as he used to do for Gordon."
Alyx VanceStatus: hiredAWAITING ASSIGMENTSo probably the next game will be with Alyx??
"No one knows how early the work begins, but it is constant, relentless, and devoid of effective impairment."
"Without our awareness, it is systematically stealing that which is most precious to you - your memory."
A warning about its inception and progress came from Dr. David Snowden in his groundbreaking study of cloistered nuns in Minnesota.
Snowden developed a hypothesis for early learning and education as a move against the memory-killing intruder.
"But none of the tests is an absolute diagnostic, and only on autopsy can a somewhat definitive diagnosis be made."
One woman I watched as she was tested used her humor to try to get by.
Her incredibly patient aide tried to coax her with a promise of lunch after the testing was completed.
Her face lit up with a big smile as she asked the question.
"A former college professor, she had problems with the most basic question, such as her own birthday."
"The search for a more robust, definitive means of diagnosing Alzheimer's has been in existence for decades."
"But the puzzle is far from anywhere near fully formed, and the search goes on."
Would you want a death sentence hanging over your head for all of those 30 years?
"Longevity may mean a long and happy life for a family, but it also brings concerns that must be faced."
"We know that many older individuals want to remain in their homes, which underscores the need for more in-home care."
It's hard to believe it's really been a year since I started writing as a job.
I consider myself extremely lucky to have found a career I can love like this.
"Essentially, my motivation for freelancing can be boiled down to one thing - flexibility."
"I was planning to move, and wanted a job I could bring with me."
I wanted a job I could bend to my schedule rather than having to bend to someone else's constantly.
"Initially, I hadn't considered freelancing to be a viable career path for me."
"I eventually stumbled across Upwork, I can't remember how anymore, and from there, I was on track."
This has helped me build a network of clients that understand and can vouch for the value of my work.
"Because I was applying for work all the time, I would occasionally have multiple contracts come up at once."
I've definitely overloaded myself and caused a drop in productivity because of that many times.
I'd rather be turning out quality work than a huge quantity of work.
"Once in a while, I still get pulled into too-good-to-be-true projects."
"The budgets look great, the clients are nice, I do the work, and suddenly I'm ghosted."
"It's not that I'm doing anything wrong, necessarily, it's just that, sometimes, bad judgment calls happen."
Now we come to the part of the article everyone clicks in for.
"Work on what you want, when you want!You still have to work."
I keep track of my work using a couple of different things.
I use the Annual Business Budget Tracker from Intuit Quickbooks to keep everything in one place.
"No matter how much you love it, doing the exact same thing all day can be exhausting."
"I tend to try and take on a variety of projects, from article writing to website copy to game writing and more."
"You're also working hard, and people are paying for that work."
Don't ever let someone devalue your time and effort because of a perceived lack of experience.
How many times have you heard the term user experience design being thrown around loosely?
"Yet, the result is a few poorly sketched up designs without any user participation or feedback."
I wrote this article at my current company in an attempt to bridge the gap between the disciplines about this commonly misused concept.
"Secondly, design with simplicity and elegance in mind to produce products that are joyful to use."
McKinsey tracked the design practices of 300 publicly listed companies over five years.
"The results applied to the three different industries examined: Medical technology, consumer goods, and retail banking."
Implying that the importance of useful design remains regardless of industry type.
"Evidently, well-designed user experiences result in organizational profits which highlights the importance of having designers with the required competencies."
So why do we assign UX tasks to people that lack competence?
UX is just drawing boxes entails the assumption that anyone can do it.
"However, the wireframing phase of a formal UX design process only describes a fraction of the work performed."
"There is a wide range of various research techniques, but two that are commonly used are primary and secondary research."
The secondary research serves the purpose to build a foundation whereas questions arise regarding the user group and context of use.
"Then, primary research is done to validate the insights gathered and to complement any uncertainties derived from the secondary research."
The primary search includes conducting user interviews and surveys to truly understand the users and how to efficiently design to satisfy their needs.
"This is especially important since every project, use case, and customer is different."
"Therefore, the research needs to be adapted to the specific case."
There is no educational overlap between a degree in UX and UI.
A person who is great at UX might be a poor artist and vice versa.
"User interface design is a strictly digital term, it is the point of interaction between the user and a digital product."
"UI design covers all the visual, interactive elements of an interface, such as typography, spacing, color schemes, etc."
A system that users find too difficult to learn and operate will most likely be underused.
The worst-case scenario is users that are forced to use a poorly designed system due to their current working methods.
"Ultimately creating frustration and reduced productivity, work satisfaction, and costs."
Delivering a technically genius solution becomes irrelevant when the user cannot successfully use the system.
"User experience design is not a one-time happening, and launching a product or feature is not the end of iterating."
UX is a never-ending loop of attaining user feedback and tweaking accordingly.
If you have any feedback feel free to reach out to me.
"All too often, I see freelance writers bemoaning a lack of work."
So why isn't that the case for every other freelancer out there?I'm nothing special.
"I'm not writing for high-paying, high-profile publications."
I think this is one of my biggest strengths as a freelance writer.
One of my very first gigs was writing online profiles and marketing copy for call girls.
You never know when a client is going to go belly-up.
"But if you're constantly pitching and constantly looking for new work, you'll never run out."
Something always falls through and then too much work becomes just enough work.
"This results in me, often, getting around 3-5 new gigs or assignments per week."
"On top of my regular, reoccurring work, as well as my wait list, that leaves me in a great spot."
"I might not know how currently, but I'll sure as hell figure it out."
"So, the next time a client proposes a scary, new-to-you project, go ahead and say yes."
"Don't say yes to something you literally cannot do; I do not say yes to design work, for example."
That means not every single piece is going to be a work of art.
It means putting your work style first and not making any apologies.
"Now, keep in mind that I've been freelancing full-time for more than two years."
"However, if you put in the work, you, too, can be swimming in work."
"Of course, that also depends on if you want to be swimming in work."
Some freelancers don't prefer this work style and that's fine.
Just don't complain when you don't have any work in your pipeline.
"Holly Riddle is a freelance travel, lifestyle and food journalist and copywriter who dabbles in fiction."
"As Valentine's Day approaches, I wonder how many of you are flirting with the idea of watching Love Actually."
"The business of online matchmaking is a hugely profitable one, with an estimated value of around £3 billion."
Today's love-hunters are much more particular about what they need and want from a relationship.
"The problem is, they're less willing than before to put in the work."
It takes users from an initial phone call through a face-to-face rendezvous and then onto follow-up.
"I'd say that's about as personal as matchmaking gets without involving an actual human,"
"Put simply: the more data there is, the more artificial intelligence can do for singletons."
I still remember the look of horror on my roommate's face as she described her blind date.
It was like he didn't know how to be a human being.
"And it's not how you want your website described, either."
"Technology has made it easier than ever to create beautiful, functioning websites."
Gone are the days of spending a fortune hiring developers or learning how to code.
The bad news is too many people believe a nice looking website is all you need to get your customers excited.
"Because a website, especially for first-time visitors, is like a blind date."
You can't just show up looking nice and think your work is done.
So let's take a look at three websites from actual small businesses to see if they pass the first-date test.
Do they leave us wanting more?Spoiler alert: They all fail to impress.
"But with a few tweaks, I'll show you how they could easily win a second chance."
Note: I've stripped away any identifying elements while keeping the copy and overall design the same.
What to fix:This site asks you to jump in without providing any crucial details.
Reading through the testimonials gave a lot more insight into the practitioner and her process.
"But she needs to get people interested faster, or they'll never venture over to those reviews."
The headline clarifies that she's helping a specific group of people - those struggling with depression or anxiety.
"With a clear headline and promise of an outcome, the I'm ready feels like a natural invitation to learn more."
"There is no clarity, no value provided, and it leaves us with too many unimportant questions."
The most challenging thing about any spiritual type business is pinpointing specific values and benefits.
"The clearer you can be on the benefits and outcomes you provide, the more likely people will stick around to learn more."
"Your BEST you is still a little vague, but it speaks to the organization's overall mission."
"As a tagline, it produces enough curiosity to move you toward the headline, which provides more specific benefits and outcomes."
I used the call-to-action to encourage a deeper dive.
Take a tour sounds like a sunny invitation to explore all the goodies inside.
"And yet, it doesn't even do a great job telling us who the person is or why we should care."
"After a lot of digging around, I discovered this influencer's goal is about helping women build confidence."
"First, I changed the focus from the influencer to the reader."
Then I connected the idea of confidence with superpower and success to create more emotion and an actual outcome.
"A pretty website is like a handsome face - nice to have, but only part of the package."
"If you want to seal the deal, you need to take a good look at the message your website is sending."
But here's the hard truth: you're likely wasting your time.
"Don't get me wrong, social media can be great for maintaining and even building relationships."
"And then what happens?That's right, you fall into the rabbit hole."
"Sound familiar?Eventually, you come to your senses and realize what it is you need to do."
"If you're drained of mental energy, more time is required to do the work."
"As far as finding new customers and getting traffic to your website, it's the absolute worst."
Here are a few ways to shake up how you use social media that are never talked about enough.
"RecurPost is a social media scheduler with built-in content planning, curation, and scheduling tools."
"You connect your social media accounts, create content libraries, set up a schedule, add your content, and more."
"You simply set up a trigger and then when one specific event happens, another event happens."
Or you might want to sync Instagram updates with a Pinterest board.
These kinds of options really can help you limit the time you spend on social media.
"Otherwise, you'll spend all of your time on social media and not be able to do anything else."
Do more of what it is you want to do and live the life you want to live.
Jim Woods is the co-author of the bestselling books Ready Aim Fire and Focus Booster.
To be an entrepreneur requires a lot more than a certain type of personality.
"Hosted by Guy Raz, HIBT interviews entrepreneurs from all disciplines about their journey towards success."
Below are the 13 most common traits from the world's most successful entrepreneurs and who they are.1.
"Later, they ended up at the same college and became roommates."
"Perhaps out of curiosity or determination, they decided to form a business together - Riot Games."
We believed that people would try it if it's free and buy it if it's great.
The one publisher that did take a chance on him was right.
"The majority of them are highly focused, obsessed with detail type pf people."
"Dave Anderson, founder of Famous Dave's BBQ, had an obsessive focus on detail."
"When he started his business, he wanted to have the best barbecue place in town."
So he studied the art of barbecuing with great fervor to ensure that everything would fall into place.
The result: he took a family love of barbecue to great heights -
"Dig deeper, and you'll find that Dave's journey was not without challenges."
"Back then, I was digging through the seat cushions to find money to buy my son milk."
"Later, while working on building Dave's BBQ off the ground, he developed a drinking problem -"
"That intervention led him to go into treatment, after which he was able to focus more on his business."
"A lot of them chose a family member, a friend, a spouse, or a colleague whose skills complement theirs."
"Ben was more spontaneous and entrepreneurial, while Jerry was more practical and simple."
"Together, Jerry made the ice cream and Ben did the tasting."
"The late Tony Hsieh, former CEO of Zappos, considered himself an introvert."
That's why he purposely surrounded himself with people whose personality are opposite of his - extroverts.
He knew that and worked on a plan to revolutionize the shoe buying process - by focusing vehemently on customer service.
"He knew that if you could win a customer over on the phone, they would buy no matter what."
"By focusing the company's mission on exceptional customer service, it changed people's buying behaviors and created a sense of trust."
"You do things that are nonsensical, that your competitors wouldn't do."
"Jo grew up in the 1960s, in a working class suburb of England and lived in public housing with her family."
"They had a major blowout, and ultimately Jo decided to leave."
"By the time she was 24, she had taken on her mother's debt."
They elicited enough excitement about the products that they had lines out the door by the time they opened their storefront in 1995.
"Within a year, they hit their revenue goal, without any investors."
"You have to create the buzz, you have to create the voice, you have to create the want ability."
"Later on, his father dabbled in other types of businesses, including vacation rentals, where he helped out."
"Therefore, he always knew that risk taking was in his genes."
The idea was easy - to bring coconut water to the United States to sell.
"Despite his failures, he continued the business and emerged as a top-selling coconut water brand in the U.S."
I was told quite a bit as a kid that I'm never going to be successful.
I think that sparks a little bit of the risk taking needed to be an entrepreneur.
Adam was doing research on climate change and Eric had a job in advertising.
"There's no such thing as low interest categories, only low interest brands."
You don't need to figure out what you want to do with your life.
"When you grow up in a motel like Shazi Visram did, you learn a little bit about business."
"Despite having parents who were small business owners, Shazi never planned on being an entrepreneur."
She went to Columbia University with the intention of becoming an artist.
"Tope Awotona, founder of the online scheduling service Calendly, grew up comfortably middle class in Lagos, Nigeria."
"As a result, he experienced trauma, lost his appetite and became an insomniac."
"Later on, they moved to the United States, where he attended college at the University of Georgia."
"The idea of entrepreneurship lingered on his mind for years, but he kept his day job selling software for technology companies."
"The key to success is the execution, not so much the idea."
Your parents couldn't drive you to school - they had their own things to worry about.
So Mike came up with a solution - to revamp old mountain bikes and turn it into electric bikes.
"A little trial and error later, he found himself a business owner right out of high school."
It's not just transportation; it's health and wellness as well.
"Katia Beauchamp, founder of Birchbox, a monthly beauty subscription service, took a bet when she opened for business in 2010."
"At the time, people got beauty samples for free, from makeup counters and stores."
"Even if people didn't know what they want, they still want someone to choose for them."
"And if you like the products, then you can go on their website and buy the full-size version."
"Through Birchbox, a lot of people have been introduced to new brands, new products, and new loves."
"A year after founding the company, Birchbox raised $10 million in venture capital."
"Later, the concept proved so successful that within two years, it reached $40 million in revenue."
What a scary life to not know what you're capable of.
"Most importantly, every single one of them had a problem they wanted to solve."
"Justin Gold, founder of Justin's Nut Butters, a popular brand of almond butter, had a problem."
He was a vegetarian who had trouble finding nut butters that he liked.
"At the time, the market was dominated by Skippy and Jiff."
"Because he couldn't find anything in his local stores in Colorado, he decided to make his own."
He labeled it Justins and soon discovered that his roommates were eating it with great enthusiasm.
"Soon, a lot of people began telling him that he should turn it into a business."
"After all, it's fundamentally what much of communication is about."
Many beliefs are even completely unconscious and can only be elicited through indirect means.
You just can't have one person review thousands of applications and get statistically significant results.
"AI systems, on the other hand, can handle being fed thousands or millions of test samples."
"And when we do find a bias in an AI system, we can change their mind on the spot."
We have control over the data and facts they're exposed to in order to build their knowledge base.
And we're getting better and better as a community at improving our understanding of the relevant knobs we have at our disposal.
You can also finely tune the tradeoffs an ML system makes to ensure equitable outcomes at no cost in performance.
But it wasn't the US-born middle-aged white male in their perfectly silent office setting that was most affected.
"It was the young and elderly, the non-native speakers, people in challenging, noisy acoustic environments."
"With Two WrenchesYou know, locks don't actually prevent people from entering a place."
MacGyver grabs two wrenches and uses them to pry the lock apart.
"Finding a Hidden Vault Room With GravityHow do you find something heavy, like a safe-room?"
"When one of the ball deviates from its straight path, that's an indication that there is something heavy there."
But you won't notice the force between you and a person standing near you.
"If you have a small force on a rolling ball, it's possible the ball could deviate a little bit."
There's an even better example of tiny forces - the Cavendish Balance.
This is a device that measures the gravitational force between two masses.
The idea is to use a horizontal rotating rod that can move with very tiny forces.
"OK, there is a second way this rolling ball trick could work."
It's possible that the safe room bends the floor - even a tiny little bit.
"With a small bend in the floor, a ball might not roll straight."
A curving ball would indicate a bent floor due to the safe room.
This method isn't as much fun since we don't get to talk about gravity.
DIY Gas ChromatographMacGyver wants to use gas chromotagraphy to find out what's in the air causing people to get sick.
"A gas chromatograph is a complicated, but useful device in chemistry."
But there's always bacteria in the air - that's why food gets messed up when you leave it out.
You can break experimental data into two groups: experimental and control.
"The experimental group has something extra added to it, but the control group does not."
"Instead, you need to use a stain to distinguish between different types of bacteria."
"The idea is that when UV light hits some materials, they fluoresce."
Sonic Weapon DetectorsThe idea is to use an ultrasonic transducer to detect the sonic weapon.
"If you want to know WHERE the source comes from, you can use triangulation."
"Since sound travels at a finite speed, the sound waves from the source should arrive at the different detectors at different times."
Just think about this simple case with just two detectors and a sound wave.
"Based on the time difference and the distance between the detectors, you can find the angular direction of the source."
"If you know the time difference between detectors, there are actually two solutions for the location of the source."
Audio Feedback and ResonanceMacGyver uses the sonic detector and connects it to the alarm speakers in the garage.
"When the bad guys use their weapon, this creates a feedback loop."
This is exactly what happens with many musical instruments - like a flute.
"Players could snag a Super Bell and transform into a cat, granting them the ability to scratch and slide into enemies."
"This new item is, without a doubt, my favorite power-up introduced in a Mario game."
"The add-on to this exciting experience, though, is something much more enticing."
"Bowser's Fury is, in a way, the successor the 3D World."
"Super Mario Bros. U, Bowser's Fury offers something different that maintains the themes of the original game."
Mario finds himself in a world based entirely around cats; it's straight out of Studio Ghibli's The Cat Returns.
"Cat trees, cat bushes, cat goombas, cat koopas, and more all populating the world."
One might think Nintendo should have titled the game Bowser's Furry.
His main use is to paint in question marks around the map that grant Mario an extra power-up.
A second player can also take control of Bowser Jr. and aid in your adventure.
"This option doesn't have many features, but it's a neat addition, and welcome nonetheless."
"Speaking of power-ups, my favorite addition to this game is an inventory system."
Mario can carry up to five of each item in his pocket activating them at any moment to benefit his journey.
"If you already have a power-up active, instead of being wasted, it will shift back into your inventory."
Mario himself controls as you would expect from any other Mario game.
"As expected, Mario can don his cat form in Bowser's Fury, fitting the feline theme."
"Scaling the walls of the various islands provided for some creative and, at times, difficult platforming."
"As you progress, Mario can make his way back to previously explored levels to do newly unlocked challenges."
"More intriguing and innovative, though, are the indestructible blocks hiding more Cat Shines behind them."
The only way Mario can destroy these new blocks is by waiting for Bowser to attack.
"During these attacks, a thunderstorm and approaches, and Bowser rains fire from above to take Mario out."
"As with any collectible based 3D platformer, the more one explores, the more collectibles you come across."
"This happens a few times throughout the game, and each occurrence unlocks more of the map."
"These fights are flashy and turn the entire map into an arena, dwarfing the world players were exploring mere moments before."
"By the end of Bowser's Fury, I managed to collect 64 out of the 100 Cat Shines available."
What Nintendo provides to players in Bowser's Fury isn't your run-of-the-mill Mario experience.
"It's similar enough to not confuse players, but different where it counts,"
Especially my fellow cat lovers who want to retreat to this cutesy cat paradise!
"There's an old Jewish proverb that goes, If God is omnipotent and omnipresent, what does he lack?"
"I wish I were smarter, didn't need to sleep, and could generate unlimited income at a whim."
Learning to love your limitations is opening up this paradoxical hugeness in you.
Here's how it works so you can implement it in your life today:I love music.
I tend to get obsessed with one band at a time and play them over and over.
What if I played all songs ever recorded at the same time?
"Without the limitations of who we are, we would be everything - and nothing."
She owned a little bar with a spot in the corner for musicians to play.
She saved her money for years and finally wrote the musician a letter.
"I love your music, and if you came to my bar, it would make my whole life."
"When he arrived, he was shocked by the old, out of tune piano she had to offer."
I knew you wouldn't come if I told you the truth.
He considered what it meant to her and how far he had come.
It's the best he's ever played in his 40-year career.
Everyone there remembers it as a religious experience unlike anything else in their life.
"The crowd applauds, and the judges give her a 9.8.The next girl steps up."
The girl in front of her had done better than she had ever done in practice.
"If you do it with your whole heart, people will leap to their feet to cheer you on."
"Why?Sometimes, I wish I didn't have to take him out to the bathroom all the time."
"Other times, I wish he were a little bigger so that I don't have to worry about other dogs hurting him."
"I also wish he could feed himself, speak to me, and teach me to play guitar."
"Let's also make him made out of metal, so he never dies."
"They are fragile - precious, and they don't last forever."
"When you die, people are going to remember your faults fondly."
"If you got shot by the imaginary gun, you had to drop dead for the round."
"By sticking to the rules in good faith, he makes it a game that all the kids want to keep playing."
"Second, it means that disciple toward the rules gives kids to play a fun game - which is freedom."
The type of kids that break the rules don't get invited to play next time!
"If you don't have discipline, even as a 9-year-old, you don't get to play."
"By following the rules and being fun, you get invited to play more and more."
"The more you play, the more fun, status, and money you get."
"No matter how old you are, you don't get to play without discipline."
"Discipline is self-imposed limitations that, paradoxically, create infinite potential."
"No matter your limits, the quicker you embrace them, the quicker life starts working out in your favor."
"Your height, intelligence, talent, looks, family, and gender are all limits that set you free."
Stop comparing yourself to other people and start embracing what you are.
"They are a set of 3 islands just north of Venezuela; Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao."
"Of course, in order, they are actually called Aruba, Curaçao, Bonaire, but that's beside the point."
"In 2016, I sailed from Virginia to Aruba and then flew to Bonaire for two months to get my DiveMaster Certificate."
Curaçao is often a stopover on the way to or from Bonaire.
It was a nice trip on a nice boat and it went smoothly.
I took a video of the bus ride down to this area of town.
"There aren't any highlights, perse, but rather just a view of the area as I rode towards Punda and Otrobanda."
Just a look at the area for those who have never been there.
"Punda is an area in Willemstad, considered the eastside and the old city center."
Punda was established in 1634 and Otrobanda in 1707 and it was connected by the swinging bridge in 1888.
"There are over 700 UNESCO listed buildings in this downtown area, which creates a visual delight."
"Here are some shots of Otrobanda from the Punda side, getting ready to cross the bridge."
Otrobanda was originally developed because they were running out of space in Punda.
Eventually it became quite populated and Rif Fort was added to defend against pirates in the 1800s.
It's a wonderful little area and more than worth the bus ride to see it.
"It was a little nerve-wracking at first, but it really wasn't dangerous."
"If you get the chance, you really should go visit this beautiful town and country."
Not everybody spoke English but some of the Spanish I knew helped a little with the Papiamento.
Plus there were plenty of people who did speak English and they tended to go out of their way to help.
"If you enjoyed this read, take a look at a couple of my other articles."
"Or follow me on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, or Facebook."
"Is it a meeting or just purgatory?For those of you familiar with Agile, I would like you to think about something."
I only ask because nobody I work for seems to know the answer.
When I hear people sing the praises of Agile methodology I want to shake them and make them sit through my meetings.
"So, according to Agile methodology, why do we all have to suffer through this crap on a daily basis?"
I remember very few stand-ups that actually followed the many definitions of a stand-up meeting I have read.
I have listed a few so that you can get the gist of what a stand-up was meant to be.
"Why does it inevitably turn into the manager blathering on for 30, 40, 60 minutes?"
The 'stand-ups' I endured clearly deviated from what a stand-up was originally supposed to be.
"When I think more about it, I remember the most absurd stand-up I ever had the misfortune to participate in."
"Sure, I did not ever have a stand-up with other people in the room."
You can count me out of that; I have no commitment to Agile.
Agile was simply used as a tool to squeeze as much value from the underlings as could possibly be squeezed.
Agile held no value for me as a worker but instead opened the door for a flood of frustration.
"I don't, by the way, think Agile is bad."
"I saw Agile work really well for a different team working on a different, smaller project."
But let's go back to the 'commitment to Agile' I mentioned above.
Is the yellow snow really lemon-flavored just because I say so?
"What are the takeaways from this, for any manager who happens to be reading this article?1."
Nobody wants to sit around and listen to a few people discuss things that are not relevant to anyone else in the group.3.
There is no way around this apart from bosses not being in stand-ups with their employees.4.
Stand-ups are not meant to be status reports to management.
Agile sure sounds nice in principle but makes some gross misunderstandings about human nature that make implementation nightmarishly difficult.
"Somewhere in the vast universe, an alternative realm exists where everyone loves Mondays."
Most of us can only imagine what life would be like on that planet.
It only takes one look inwards to know Albert Einstein was right.
The perfection of means is for the most part a lifelong effort.
But removing the confusion of aims can be an easier nut to crack.
"Many of my workdays still aren't perfect, but these Monday motivation cues help me get closer every week."
"My corner coffee shop makes these fiery double-shots of ginger juice, cayenne pepper, and orange juice."
I love to chug a shot whenever I lack energy or feel a sore throat coming.
It's about the entire thousand-piece-puzzle of your complete ambition.
It gives me the chance to keep calm as I decide where and how to invest my time and my energy.
Only recently I've discovered the beauty of assigning an actual rank to each process and task.
I decide which biscuits can best feed the beast and then start from the top.
I also limit the priorities I must get done to only two.
"Because at the end of the week, it is always better to have two priority tasks ticked and off the table."
You don't want to be drowning in a chaotic mess of half-baked biscuits and inedible dough.
"Set your bar lower just to start with, and if you finish early, you can always add more."
"In 1977, an ordinary sound-engineer Robbie Wedel pushed a button."
He has been toying with the Moog Modular 3P synthesizer in a recording studio for days.
"At that time, this machine was only ever used to create a rhythmical baseline for classical composers."
"Robbie Wedel, however, sensed something strange and magnetic hiding in the guts of that box."
"Then one day, he finally grasped what kept him awake at night."
"That stomping sound was a tool, never intended for use on its own."
I Feel Love birthed a new epic era in the history of music.
It became the blueprint for what we now call electronic dance music.
Danger of unforeseen spikes in your heart-rate BPM.You can't chase a ball you don't see.
No point setting a reward system in which your first milestone is months away.
"Whether you meet your milestone early or late, reward your efforts with something you love."
And mix the rewards up each week to keep your experience healthy and fresh.
Most of us tend to think of mistakes and possible failures negatively.
"You know that whatever happens this week, you will be wiser at the end of it."
"But now, on Monday morning, you can control which direction you want to take."
Because you have the full power to decide the actions most likely to push things in the right lane.
"Think the Friday feeling, but not just in the let's kill a bottle of wine kind of way."
"And for a moment, become the person you will be once you get there."
"Imagine yourself lightminded, pleasantly tired, and excited knowing you have completed your top two priorities and more."
Imagine the you who is satisfied looking back and passionate looking forward.
That's the version of you headed towards groundbreaking ideas and a dreamy future.
"And not just any version of enough, but enough according to your own absolute ambition action plan."
"Next Monday, give your morning another cayenne and ginger shot of motivation."
What better way to understand complex phenomena than some good ol' analogies?
"Ideology aside, I hope this article provides you with some insights into the brain through the lens of economics."
About the author· Sources and further readingEconomics is largely about decision-making.
I was listening to an episode of The Knowledge Project the other day with angel investor Naval Ravikant.
There are so many factors to consider that predicting trends is as fruitless as analyzing the daily horoscope.
"Rather, he said, you should embrace microeconomics, which concerns the decisions of individuals and businesses."
Focus on decision-making you can actually understand before trying to tackle grand and abstract economic dilemmas.
"The brain demonstrates emergence, meaning it has properties its constituents do not have on their own."
"As you can imagine, this makes connecting the levels pretty damn hard."
Finding the links between what you do understand and what you don't is key.
"You might remember from your economics class that there are three main factors driving production: land, labor, and capital."
"Along the same lines, decreased grey matter tissue is found in conditions such as language impairment."
"Decreased white matter is associated with old age and impaired cognitive functioning, just like grey matter."
The labor of your brain's worker neurons is what drives the execution of all processes in your brain.
"By forming unions and harnessing the power of synchronous firing, these tiny employees produce an incredible variety of activity patterns."
"Fewer functional workers =less efficient processing and communication of information, which is a signature of neurological diseases."
"Capital is the liquid gold that runs through our veins and capillaries, the so-called currency of neural transactions - energy."
"A good circulation of ATP capital is extremely important, as the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides is highly expensive."
More capital is put into circulation by the consumption and metabolization of glucose by neurons.
"Specifically, ATP is produced through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation that occurs within the neuron."
ATP production rapidly adjusts to changes in energy demand so that more energy can be generated to sustain neural activity.
"In fact, neurons may be able to increase their own glycolysis in response to stimulation."
"In economics, scarcity refers to the gap between limited - that is, scarce - resources and theoretically limitless wants."
"People are forced to prioritize basic needs over frivolous spending and allocate time, effort, money, etc., accordingly."
"Our brain functions in the same way, as it is constantly operating in an environment of scarce resources."
"Take, for example, multitasking, which is a misnomer since the brain is physically incapable of simultaneously performing multiple tasks."
The brain has to be really careful about using its supply of oxygen and glucose wisely.
"Well, in the case of oxygen and glucose, the consequence of careless spending is death, or at least accelerated death."
"Once the resources stop flowing, the neurons return to their inactive states."
They're not gonna work no overtime shifts if they're not compensated.
"But in general, the CES tries to maximize performance while minimizing expenditure - in essence, an optimization problem."
But what happens when there's inflation and your one unit of glucose is now worth a fraction of its original value?
"People with diabetes are more likely to develop neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, which is now being called type 3 diabetes."
Insulin-resistant neurons that starve as they lose their ability to use glucose can potentially use ketones as an alternate fuel source.
"In other words, adopting the keto diet can help people with insulin resistance get the nutrients they need and fuel their brains."
"The best thing you can do is maintain a healthy, balanced diet."
"And, of course, consult with a doctor before you make any drastic changes."
"Reassurances from a teacher out of the game; exams, rote learning, desk time."
Home-schooling is the most difficult thing you will encounter as the modern parent especially after the 'holidays'.
So don't feel so bad about not having eyeballs in the back of your head.
"You're allowed to get frustrated, especially as you aren't even being -paid- to do this!"
"So, so super bored that even you are propping both sets of eyes eyes open with matchsticks."
Kind of like being forced to eat the same soup over and over and over.
"You, as a parent, do know your child better than you have ever known them before."
I bet you didn't know they could name every dinosaur in alphabetical order.
Your urge to fulfil the curriculum is constantly met with 6 major obsticals: 1.
"I don't think I'm alone when I say, as an educator, how much I cannot stand standardized testing."
"I hate exams, I hate strict curriculum and, my top personal loathing, children asking permission to use the toilet."
"Children learned practical, useful skills while gaining confidence in their community, and in themselves."
"Cooking, firefighting, carpentry, knitting, agriculture, prctical mathematics."
"Unless you live in Disney World, the chances are that your child will return, ready to learn more."
You won't be hauled into head office for not tackling them and ramming a protractor down their throat.
Build a routine that works for all of you; regardless of what classes are scheduled that day and when.
"But most importantly, there is no such thing as a normal family ."
"If you are all terrible at getting up early, start at 10:30am."
"If you naturally make your way to bed at 10:30pm, form your day around the natural life of your family."
Routine is vital to child development; but relative to when you are all prepared to learn and prepared for a break.
"If you're bored and are struggling to manage teaching without falling asleep, imagine how bored your child is."
Look at your child and consider that you could be doing the writing on the sheet while they tell you the answers.
You could be narrating a story to build their vocabulary but they have to write it down for you.
"Reverse roles, change it up and throw out the old ideas of what teaching was.3."
"Use your own hobbies, your own space and your own resources to be more inventive with learning."
"The best classroom is no classroom at all, 4 walls and a roof are limiting!"
"Create safe-spaces, inspiring places for free and open learning."
"If you have a spare 10 year old, take advantage of that;"
The great philosopher Willy Wonka once said I don't want a grown-up person at all.
A grown-up won't listen to me; he won't learn.
He will try to do things his own way and not mine.
It's perseverance that tends to be the thing children struggle with.
Parents have the great fortune to teach their children in a way that we old fossils in education never could.
"Forget the exams and focus on enjoyment in teaching, and your children will focus on learning for enjoyment!"
"To date, I have preferred to cultivate clients from direct sources."
"Periodically, I have explored working on Upwork and then thrown in the towel in frustration."
"This, in turn, speaks to the importance of diversifying one's income."
Which any investment advisor will tell you is an axiomatic principle of sound financial planning.
"This week, I have gone from working exclusively with direct clients to opening another channel of working with clients through marketplaces."
I've discussed the various ways in which one can find freelance clients on this publication before.
They include:Inbound marketing - such as using content marketing to market your content marketing writing business! -
I joined the party about four years late and wish that I had got going sooner.
Niche down is one of the most basic pieces of advice that gets bandied about in writing forums.
But equally I believe that one can go too far and limit oneself to too small a target market.
"As I'm not a market analyst I will leave you with the suggestion to go niche, but not too niche."
Freelance writing authorities differ in terms of the maximum client income percentage that they suggest one should aim for.
That is to say that no one client should constitute greater than that amount of your income.
One obvious way to lower your average MCIP is to take on more clients.
"Although I can't say that I've gotten to such a lofty position, I tend to agree with that idea."
Even a prodigious supply of caffeine pills cannot circumvent that limitation.
There are more sources to tap than was previously the case and remote work has been normalized thanks to the pandemic.
More than 300 biomedical researchers came together virtually this summer for CZI's annual Neurodegeneration Challenge Network meeting.
"Science and STEM fields are not immune from the forces of systemic racism, prejudice and lack of inclusion."
The vision is a community and network that is more than the sum of its parts.
Patrick and Yeo believe that the first steps to action and change are listening and learning.
"When I look back now, as a full professor, it's hard to figure out how that happened."
"While I was training to be a scientist, three passionate women neuroscientists -"
"Mentorship and community drive success, especially for young scientists who are finding their STEM identities."
You mentioned there were a lot of smart kids in your community.
"There are a lot of young kids who can contribute to the world of science, including neuroscience and neurodegeneration research."
"First, let me add a comment about the idea of serendipity or luck."
"In a sense, there's an ability to build structures that create more opportunities for luck."
"When I was growing up, it was a developing country of two million people."
Fast-forward to today when every kid in Singapore has an iPad or computer.
"Echoing Pasteur, I think structures can be developed to minimize risk and favor more opportunities."
"After Singapore became independent in 1965, one of its biggest problems was housing."
How do you house a multitude of people who came together from all over the world?
"We all go through basic boot camp, no matter your race, religion, or economic status."
"In a way, it levels the playing field and creates opportunities for individuals to meet one another across societal barriers."
Those friendships are critical for maintaining a common vision for how you succeed together.
Those are the lessons that reverberated with me when I was growing up and that made me think about how to create equity.
And I think they can help us as we build our own labs.
"Around 2015, I was working in my lab and got stuck in a bit of a rut."
"I wanted to impact the community, both locally and across the country."
I found the common threads that allowed me to take advantage of that community.
"At PATHS, the students get a four-year scholarship and personalized academic support."
"We build a family unit, so there are graduate advocates and academic coaches for math, physics, biology, and writing."
"However, I believe that the current U.S. reckoning with racial injustice is not a moment."
It is really an awakening from which we can begin to create a community that drives success for everyone.
It provides a forum for the community to teach each other about these issues and share our own experiences.
"Very early on, we decided that students and trainees should be empowered."
The goal is to raise awareness and help others surmount similar barriers in the future.
"So far, the students and postdocs organizing it are doing an amazing job."
There is no right or wrong here as both types of marketing are essential for most businesses.
"When you are comparing paid advertising and content marketing, look at the long-term gains."
"Nevertheless, by owning your own home, you don't have to abide by your landlord's rules."
"Similarly, content marketing gives you the freedom in terms of word counts, image sizes, or messaging."
You are likely to build a stronger brand affinity and engage with the customer.
Content marketing also allows you to create something that is much more personal and beneficial to your customer.
"So, in the end, are you looking for a quick gain or a long-term benefit?"
"Often, a combination of both is what companies could choose; however, don't ignore the importance of content marketing."
"Likability isn't required in leadership, but it sure does help."
I was thrust into it as a young Marine recruit who found himself in charge of 75 other recruits.
I've seen leaders people didn't like who got the job done.
"In other words, likability is the icing on your leadership cake."
"Here are a few ways I, science, and Einstein have found to be a likable boss."
It's really hard to like someone who doesn't like you.
"But when you realize they have struggles you may never know about, your heart can soften towards them."
You'll find something to like in everyone eventually if you keep looking.
They look for warmth so they know the quality of your intentions for them.
They look for competence to know whether you can deliver on those intentions.
I've always thought of these two things as components of the happy warrior concept.
"When we are brave enough to drop the camouflage of conformity, we appear as we truly are - uniquely ourselves."
They've built a mask they think they need to get by socially.
It's better to be hated for who you are than loved for who you're not.
A boss who can't walk in the shoes of those they lead will never be a great one.
"When a leader doesn't have it, they often can't make wise decisions about strategy."
If that bond is broken then the boss and the team wander apart and can never reach the summit.
"A boss should always be thinking about what they'd want a boss to do in any situation, then do that."
"Emotions are proven to be contagious, especially from leader to follower."
"The best leaders project hope, resolve, competence, enthusiasm, humility, truth, and even love."
"A good boss always looks for the seedlings sprouting through the ashes, then waters them."
They acknowledge difficulty or failure but meet both of them with hope and optimism.
And no one wants to follow a leader on that dark path.
"Arrogance, the opposite of humility, is simply insecurity wearing bravado - not a good look on a leader."
"They ask real, not pandering, questions and listen hard to the answer."
"It's a special occasion and so rare, especially today with our i-umbilical cords of information always at the ready."
Treat EVERYONE with the respect and dignity they deserve as human beings.
"This way, all that goodness is now being attributed to you."
"In this way, you can choose how people see you by what you choose to say about others."
"Like I said in the beginning, you can lead without being liked, but it's so much better to be liked."
"To recap:If you do these things, there's simply no way you can't be a more likable boss."
"I was standing in Menlo Park, California, in the middle of a street lined with shops serving muffins and pizzas."
I stood at a touch screen and scrolled through pages of small print before being prompted to sign 'I agree'.
"Like getting access to a secret world, once I signed, I could enter."
"The representative, from their communications and policy department, engaged in earnest tones."
It felt like a cordial walk and talk with a sensible colleague.
"Two years later, I wonder what that street looks like now."
This change has served to reduce the intentional and easy dissemination of malicious misinformation.
It indicates a shared purpose: Zuckerberg's vision of 'connecting the world one community at a time'.
We might feel closer to our own personal community of friends and family than before the lockdown.
Now we have proof: WhatsApp can facilitate feelings of community amongst its users during the good times and the bad.
"Yet, as with many things in Silicon Valley, 'community as business' is at best a metaphor."
The last few years have shown that big tech companies can't only sell us the benefits and ignore the challenges.
They have left us wondering how a company that claims to know so much about community knows so little about people.
The smaller sibling has sheltered under the shadow of its bigger brother.
Messages you really want to read are mixed with those you don't.
"Rumours, gossip, leaks and inside jokes are pushed to you directly."
"To social media users this may all sound familiar, but WhatsApp gets to us in a different way."
"It has all the characteristics of something you would trust, yet none of the qualities."
"Some of these misinformation nuggets are harmless but others create public confusion, entrench differences and extend generational and political divides."
"This is why WhatsApp cannot use automation to identify and remove fake news, as Facebook and others do."
The inability to read content algorithmically is now the main argument used by those who want to remove encryption for national security reasons.
We need to start by looking at the systemic nature of the problem.
We cannot allow a company to talk about a platform with 2 billion users being personal and 'small'.
"Equally, in looking for solutions, we cannot treat digital platforms as though they don't mix."
It cannot only be companies self-imposing solutions one platform at a time.
Information moves from encrypted channel to non-encrypted channel and back again.
Platforms are just the surfaces on which our viral information sits before it is picked up and passed on.
"When it comes to WhatsApp, they need to invest in their team."
"Now it is time to turn public scrutiny towards WhatsApp, along with all the other platforms."
That's why you should spend the majority of your efforts accessing the value of your product.
One great tool you can use to get this deep knowledge is talking with them.
"It sounds very easy on paper, but there are a few hacks you need to know to make these conversations worth it."
Getting specific about who your ideal customers are allows you to filter out all the noise that comes from everyone else.
"If you aren't finding consistent problems and goals, you don't yet have a specific enough customer segment."
"If you don't know what you're trying to learn, don't waste now your conversation shots."
You won't be able to moderate the conversations and you won't be able to make sense out of the answers.
"First, think about what your current big questions are and make a point to face the scary ones."
"If conversations are the right tool, then it's time to go and ask for conversations."
Isn't it awkward to start this kind of conversation out of the blue?
Now you have to make those conversations as useful and truthful as possible.
I have a few tricks and tips to help you with that.
And anyone will say your idea is great if you're annoying enough about it.
"People will lie to you if they think it's what you want to hear, that's how nice they are."
You're not here to collect compliments and the main source of compliment-creation is seeking approval.
You don't need to end up with what you wanted to hear to have a good conversation.
"Historically, in the vast majority of innovations, customers had no idea that what they now love was even a possibility."
"Customers might not know the best way to solve their problems, but they know what their problems are."
Don't waste this opportunity to dig around to find the root cause.
Now onto what you should do:A useful conversation should give you concrete facts about your customers' lives.
"The idea is to be fishing for their problems, cares, constraints, and goals."
"Addressing those, in turn, will allow you to improve your product."
"Quick note: before zooming in into something they share, make sure it matters."
"When diving into details, we already know that opinions on the future are worthless."
"To get real data, you need to ask about their life as it already is."
"Last but definitely not least, actively listen and give as little information as possible about your idea."
"The more you're talking, the less you're learning, and the more you are biasing the customer."
Your responsibility is to ask good questions to nudge the discussion in a useful direction.
"After a batch of conversations, your goal should be to have the learnings in your team's head and not only yours."
"Everyone will benefit from it: it will keep you all in sync, prevent arguments and lead to better decisions."
"Make sure to review the main takeaways of the conversations with them, as well as any problems you ran into."
"You'll probably want to write them down as well, for future reference."
"Also, check what could be improved on the conversation's process and decide on your next learning goals."
"I am single, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to sulk my way through Valentine's day."
And that's what I'm going to do for that time of the month for the first time due to the pandemic.
"We were always together back then, and nothing seems to be able to keep us apart."
"Ever since we all graduated college, we weren't able to contact each other as often as before."
"We were so busy with our own lives, getting along with new friends, and a little bit of forgetting the past."
"We also have a group chat, but it's very silent, only ringing during New Year's or Christmas."
"When the pandemic hit, it gave me more reason to contact them again."
"Around August of 2020, the hype of the game Among Us began booming."
"I asked my friends again whether they'd like to play this game together, and thankfully, they said yes."
That was when we were all able to reunite and played together again like we used to.
"While we were playing, we were able to have a short conversation."
All we cared about was that we got to see each other and played together again like we used to.
"We played together like we were kids again, we were so competitive, eager to win, and cursing amongst ourselves."
"But unlike when we were kids where we only spoke about the game, this time, our session was way different."
The thing about growing up is that our conversations became more personal than just about hobbies and interests this time.
"But now, I felt like we were opening up to each other."
"Unlike last time, I think we knew the importance of keeping in touch again."
"This time, we also shared our problems together like it was a therapy session."
"We have never done this before, being this open was never what we intended to do, it just happened."
"In a reunion, this was bound to happen, and I'm glad it did."
"All the things we did in the past, we brought it out to the table."
"It mostly consisted of silly stories, all the crazy things we did at school, and how it got us into trouble."
It was the funniest moment to share as we retold our past.
It really felt like it was just yesterday when we retold these stories.
"Just like when the teachers tried to separate us, life tried to do the same thing."
Except that we would constantly get back to each other and act like little kids.
We set a time to meet up virtually since we all live in different time zones and planned to bring chocolate and wine.
Valentine's Day means that we need to express our love to the person we care about.
But that doesn't always mean we need to be in a relationship to enjoy the day.
"I love my best friends, and I am happy to be able to celebrate Valentine's with them."
And I definitely can't wait until Valentine's Day arrives this year.
"That's what a lot of workers tell themselves when they take on part-time, temporary employment."
These are decisions many have had to make since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.
While The Brookings Institute estimates that informal labor arrangements are already the de facto model in many developing countries.
You can just as easily hire a web designer from Cambodia as Canada.
While crowd-sourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk also make it easier for companies to outsource a growing array of technical work.
"In developed countries, it is estimated that half of all new jobs created are in the gig economy."
"If you scratch the surface of the gig economy, you find things aren't as rosy as they seem."
There are several pitfalls for gig workers that much of the literature glosses over.
"In the US over 22 million workers have lost their jobs, bringing the unemployment rate to close to 15%."
"For this reason, many put their savings into their businesses, leaving them vulnerable later in life."
Gig workers are often treated like employees without receiving any of the benefits.
Some lawmakers have recently cottoned on to these employment double-standards and tried to pass legislation to protect contract workers.
Companies often hire contractors to solve particular problems or work on short-term projects to enhance a specific business segment.
These kinds of projects can often degenerate into a vicious cycle of unrealistic expectations and poor remuneration prospects.
The most insidious aspect of outsourcing jobs is that those who are earning the least are affected the most.
"In the U.S., the minimum wage has stagnated at $7.25 since 2009 despite inflation and a continued recession."
"Financial insecurity among gig and self-employed workers is a significant source of stress, anxiety and depression."
While a Canadian study reported that nearly three out of ten millennials are depressed or anxious as a result of their employment situation.
The report highlights the need for more precise employment definitions to avoid workers being falsely categorized and excluded from benefit schemes.
"Always use a contract, specifying the scope, time frame, and payment schedule."
Don't let the gig economy sink you before you can swim.
It's this experience and expertise combined with Jonathan's technology background that was the genesis for EstateSpace.
"These positions and organizations include Co-Chairman, Fisher House Foundation, Board Member, Children's Voice International and Board Member,"
Figuring out where to start this particular venture was by far the hardest challenge.
"The vision is enormous, the market is endless, and staying focused seemed impossible at first."
Where did you get the drive to continue even though things were so hard?We exist to help people.
Some of these people even included our own family members and personal family asset management.
Our hardest moments were met with great people who came into our lives.
"We also got great advice, at the right time, and we listened."
Those are the things that make it easy for us to never give up.
"Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?Prior to starting my first company, I wanted to present well."
"I had business cards made and shirts, hats, and other apparel designed."
"Then I decided the name was wrong, my title was incorrect, and that I didn't like the logo."
"So that business became known as a t-shirt company, one of two in my career."
"Simon Sinek has been a great inspiration in this aspect of the company, which has led to an amazing culture at EstateSpace."
We believe in building relationships and that by leading with the why you surround yourself with likeminded people.
Slow Down to Speed Up is something I learned only a couple of years ago.
"By slowing down, you can take a breath, be methodical, and really think through the path ahead."
Then you can execute a well thought out plan the first time.
I believe that everything is 70% preparation and 30% execution.
I have a couple of great mentors to thank for this great lesson in business and life.
"Most recently, Mark Wallace and Barry Libert came into my life at the exact right time."
The company was not where I wanted it to or intended it to be.
This was one of the hardest times in business I have had in almost 20 years.
"I lost focus, exaggerated the situation, and lost the vision in the clutter."
"He said, You're a smart guy, with a great idea and most importantly you're a good person."
"These two men helped me get back to clarity, turn the business around, and find success."
It took 20 months to clutter it up and every bit of that time to get back in focus.
I've had service in my heart for as long as I can remember.
We've helped raise over $35M in that time and have touched so many lives.
This is the legacy that I want to outlive any of my professional accomplishments.
What are your 5 things I wish someone told me before I started leading my company and why.
"First, find a mentor who can help you personally and professionally."
"Second, take care of yourself first, then take care of your family, then go to work."
The work is hard enough but even harder when you're sick or preoccupied.
"Third, keep a flat model and work with people at all levels."
"Stay active, work with everyone in the company, set the ethical standard with your effort, and listen to your team."
"A good team will tell you what they think, so you better listen and apply feedback."
Your partners become thought-partners and your vision will change for the better.
Never could we have imagined at EstateSpace some of the things we've developed and some of the innovations we're working on.
This is a result of working as a team and listening to good advice.
Focus is important and challenging but maintaining your agility is equally tough.
"The more active you are, the more agility you will have."
Be a real member of the amazing team you created and work every day to keep your spot.
This will serve you well and allow you to never get complacent.
And you just may find it to be far more rewarding winning together than alone.
We have a long road ahead but a passionate board of really smart people who believe.
"Of course, we start with the why and the rest will come together with time and determination."
One of the promising technologies for the implementation of a useful quantum computer is trapped ions.
A young physicist named Frans Michel Penning had been conducting his doctoral research on the thermodynamics properties of gases.
He was fascinated by the behaviour of different gases and discharge at very low temperatures and under specific conditions.
The main application for his studies at the time was the development of new lamps!
"He named the device the Penning Trap, honouring the first efforts in studying the effects of magnetic fields on discharge by Penning."
"Meanwhile, back in Germany, another physicist was curious about techniques to confine charged particles."
"Wolfgang Paul 6, while at the university of Bonn, proposed in 1953 a New mass spectrometer without a magnetic field ."
"The Radio-frequency ion trap, also called the Paul Trap, was born."
Opportunities to study the properties and spectrums of atoms are improved if individual atoms can be isolated under constant conditions for longer periods.
We already know there are two main kinds: the Penning trap and the Paul trap.
"If the ions are not trapped in all directions, they can easily escape in the direction which is not confining."
"To ensure that the ions are trapped, one extra field is required."
The Paul ring trap had a static electric field applied to the endcaps and an oscillating electric field applied to the ring.
"Similarly to the Paul version, the magnetic field had the role to create confinement in the radial plane."
"In both cases, the ions would be trapped in the very middle of the ring."
Their proposal ignited a whole new research direction: quantum computation with trapped ions.
"These traps were still macroscopic, with dimensions in the order of centimeters in size."
"As trapped ions showed better and better performance as qubits, or quantum bits,"
It became necessary to be able to shrink down the devices and work on making them more scalable.
The ions were now trapped tens to hundreds of micrometers away from the electrodes.
Microfabricated 3D traps are made by stacking a number of individual wafers on top of each other.
"The wafers are either made of conductive materials, or insulating materials that are subsequently coated in metal to create electrodes."
"However, their fabrication and assembly is fairly troublesome and the reproducibility is low."
"On the other hand, surface traps are made of a single wafer which is patterned using commercial technologies and lithography techniques."
Decaroli is a physicist working towards her PhD in the field of trapped-ion quantum information processing.
She is also a freelance scientific illustrator and loves all things sci comm.

"We're just trying to follow a system, but that doesn't matter all that much."
"If you're brand new to influencing, here's a few content writing tips for beginners."
"That's about 1,200 views per month right there from 15 minutes of work every day."
"An hour?You see, you can be a content writer on Quora as well."
"In fact, that's how famous writer Nicolas Cole built his following online."
Use all of these places to your advantage as a content writer.
Make sure to insert 3-4 links to recent blog posts in every new article you write.
Some visitors genuinely want to read all the stuff you got on a certain topic.
My first two content writing tips for beginners have revolved around strategy.
"In essence, we want to know how to maximize our potential while avoiding our greatest weaknesses."
Basically we want to know where life's land mines are and also where life's gold mines are buried.
We want to know what we're doing wrong just as much as what we need to do right.
The best of my content writing tips for beginners is this one.
You can then decide to like them when appropriate or even share them to your own audience.
My biggest pet peeve with content writers is that they're essentially just robots.
"They stuff a bunch of keywords into a post, follow a structure, then post and leave it."
There's no way for the audience to access who these people are to build trust.
"And they need that, because without this, ain't nobody coming back to read you."
"I promise, this content always seems to do the best in the long run."
"When I look at the money I make from writing, I can hardly believe my eyes."
There's a reason the stereotypical image of the starving writer exists.
"If you want to make money, go into finance or tech."
"But if you're a blockhead and you want to go into business, then all you can do is count it."
"First off, there's a simple way to calculate direct earnings."
"For me, pitching and writing a piece for a publication can easily take 10 hours by my count."
That's the simple count of how a freelance writer makes money.
"I was always reluctant to track my time input, but I found it really useful."
My time tracking app is a piece of paper and a pen.
"Like Ryan Leslie says, you also need to count it while it multiplies."
"To gauge my hourly rate from direct income is simple, but it leaves out a lot of the other bread."
"There Is No Right Way to Do This from each piece, then it's worth $30 plus."
"I've neglected to calculate the value of credibility, links, etc."
"The more indirect income you can make from your direct efforts, the higher your real adjusted rate will go."
"There are a lot of other quantitative possibilities, which I'll save for another blog post."
"I didn't love the tone of William Deresiewicz's book, but I loved the subject matter."
Systems and incentives have turned artists into producers now - and I think that's super true.
I build a reputation as a writer by freelance writing and blogging.
"After all, I have 40 hours worth of work per week."
"So yes, writing is the same, but not all writing is the same."
"And that's what the next blog post will cover, which I'll link to from this."
"If you don't want to miss it, I can send it right to your inbox."
"I read a ton of books for my work, and I recommend the best three each month."
"Sign up for the Best of Books reading newsletter, where I send three great books to your inbox."
Everybody that starts a company does so because they want to make a living on that.
They want to make money so they can pay for the things they want.
"To make a company grow, they will probably have to hire employees."
"And to hire employees, they will need to pay for them."
We are used to seeing employees complaining about money when the boss is driving a fancy car.
He was shocked that I was paying more to my employees than myself.
He wanted to make a lot of money for himself but wasn't willing to invest in other people.
"For many, capitalism is the land of greedy entrepreneurs and exploiters."
"This conclusion is false, which also creates confusion about the source of the profit."
I did an 18-months internship in a gaming startup while I was doing college.
"I barely was experienced, and all of a sudden, I had a lot of responsibilities."
"For me, it was an excellent experience as I had the opportunity to learn many different things."
"When I started my own startup, I didn't want to hire interns."
I have been working with experienced professionals and getting a lot done.
"As I was starting, I didn't want to hire people with no experience."
"When we start a company, we usually don't have money to pay for expensive employees."
"However, when we begin to make some money, we should invest in our company instead of giving ourselves better salaries."
An excellent way to make more money is by hiring experienced professionals.
It always amazes me when I see other entrepreneurs trying to save money by hiring less experienced professionals.
"Experienced professionals are expensive, but they get much more done, and by getting work done, you will make more money."
"When I moved to Chile in 2014 to join the Startup Chile program, I still didn't have a profitable company."
"At that time, I had three senior employees working with me."
"I was by myself living in Chile, and they were working in their homes in Brazil."
I needed great professionals to help me to transform my company into a profitable one.
"By the end of the program, in June 2015, we achieved the goal of being a profitable company."
I wouldn't have achieved that if I haven't had experience employees working with me.
"You may think that I was paying too little for myself, but that wasn't the case."
I made the same amount that the employee with the lower salary.
The difference between the lowest and the highest was small at that time.
I had my second experience with accelerator programs in the second semester of 2015.
"During this time, my company grew a lot, and I increased everybody's salary."
The three experienced employees that I had working with me made more money where they were working before.
My goal was for them to have their highest salary in their lives.
"For that, I needed to keep reinvesting money in the company and themselves."
Imagine if I increased my salary much higher than theirs and start spending on fancy stuff.
They would notice that and would get disappointed with me acting like that.
"They like challenges, and they like to see their work generating results."
"During 2016 we kept growing, and in 2017 we raised US$1 million, which helped us to grow even more."
I was making good money but still had some employees making a little bit more than me.
Paying more to my employees than myself allowed me to do that.
I wouldn't have the same money to invest if I started to pay more to myself and my partners earlier.
We knew that we needed to hire great professionals to keep growing.
"As Zig Ziglar said:When I started the company in 2012, it was tough to pay for great professionals."
"I talked to many people, and most of them didn't want to make less money than they were making."
I am very grateful for the three employees that believed in me.
I am sure they are happy with their decision as they ended up making much more money than they were making before.
"In 2017, I was in a completely different situation than in 2012."
It was much easier to hire great professionals by having the means for that.
"Salary, contract payments, some benefits, a few perks are called baseline rewards."
"After hiring, I had to keep them happy working with me, so they don't leave."
I am proud to say that nobody at my company asked to leave as they did enjoy their work.
"By paying more to my employees than myself, I was able to grow my gaming company."
"When we started to pay salaries above the market average, we decided it was time for the partners to make more money."
Many people believe that capitalists and entrepreneurs can't profit without exploiting their employees.
"They understand that, in doing so, they benefit many others they don't even know."
"Their contribution to society is not a collateral benefit of the business, it is their modus operandi."
You must know what you want for your personal and professional life.
Don't sacrifice your long-term by paying you more in the short-term.
"But before then, it is a nerve-wracking spectacle that reflects the newfound tension rife in international batteries and electric cars."
"The draconian ruling favors LG Chem, SKI's blood enemy in the ruthless South Korean battery business."
"On Twitter and elsewhere, the case has captured the attention of the battery and EV communities."
It has also highlighted the fierce contest among the automakers to be dominant in EVs.
"A primary reason for my own interest, though, has been the high stakes and naked ambition of the multiple parties."
But LG cried foul - it accused SKI of relying on its trade secrets to make the battery.
"It said SKI had poached some 100 of its workers, some of whom it said had taken with them important data."
SKI admitted that documents were destroyed but said it was a normal culling of unnecessary matter and that everything germane had been preserved.
"In Wednesday's decision, the ITC upheld a default judgement rendered previously against SKI."
"All along, SKI has said it would seek help from the White House."
"In an appeal yesterday over Twitter, Ford CEO Jim Farley asked SKI and LG to find a settlement between themselves."
"It will say it cares only about its flagship vehicle, the F-150, and the shift to electric."
"LG, highly unlikely to be compassionate, will seek to exact a high price."
No one outside the companies themselves has any idea what that settlement will look like.
"But it would save SKI, along with the string of parties attached to the drama."
The Big Short of course is Hollywood's docu-satire of the mass delusion we now know as the housing bubble.
The specific action that put ants in Burry's pants was Tesla's disclosure of a $1.5 billion bet on Bitcoin.
Bitcoin value is not anchored to any physical assets like gold or pork bellies.
Bitcoin's value is not tied to future cash flows the way most investments are.
This is what Tesla has bet $1.5 billion of its cash on.
"Burry is famously short Tesla stock, meaning he thinks Tesla stock is likely to go down significantly in the near future."
"Remember, shorts are opposite - they make money when prices go down."
"But instead of going down, Tesla's stock price has been going up."
The enormity of the risk taken on by short sellers is worth emphasizing here.
"If you are long Tesla, you are hoping the price increases."
"Your worst-case loss is 100%, but your possible upside in unlimited."
Your loss is 7 times higher than your investment of $100.
"The best-case scenario is if Tesla goes bankrupt, and you gain at most $100."
"At the end of 2020, Tesla had $19.384 billion in cash and cash equivalents."
A little less than 10% of that has now gone into Bitcoin.
I am further imagining the research team using asset-price prediction as a test-bed for checking new ML algorithms.
One of the younger engineers decides to use Bitcoin prices as their testbed.
"This kid discovers that their program seems to do a great job in predicting Bitcoin prices a day, week, month ahead."
"Elon has been vocal in his support of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and Dogecoin, over the past year."
"Musk hauls the kid in front of the CFO, the board."
"Shortly after, Musk invests a good chunk of the company's cash in Bitcoin."
"Short term, I believe Tesla and Bitcoin will ride a Musk-hyped positive feedback loop higher and higher."
"This is the scenario that Michael Burry, the investor who has shorted Tesla, is fearful of."
He sees Tesla and Bitcoin amplifying each other - and the pain of that increase will hurt him.
"As long as no more than 10% of Tesla's cash and cash equivalents is Bitcoin, then I see little downside."
But I believe the rapid increase in Bitcoin price will embolden even the smartest engineers at Tesla including Musk.
"The amount of cash in Bitcoin will naturally rise, and the risks with it."
"Standalone decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will gradually, country by country, be banned."
"Bitcoin and their ilk will always have a place for illegal transactions, just as they do today."
AI has been a passion of mine since I was first introduced to it in 2018 when I saw Google's Duplex technology.
"When I first saw Duplex at Google's IO event, I was lost for words and became instantly hooked."
"Mainly, this blog is about something else: clevrML's mission."
"As I said in the title, It's time to chase the impossible."
"I had one goal in mind when I started clevr, which was to make AI easier for everyone to get started in."
The new focus is to research new AI methods that have the potential to lead us closer to Artificial General Intelligence.
"This does not mean clevr will only focus on General Intelligence and nothing else, but general-purpose AI algorithms."
The AI industry is going into a transition period where the AI we know is going to start looking very different than before.
AI algorithms and methods are going from Narrow to General in nature.
What do I mean by this?Let's use an intuitive example of AI and images.
"Right now however, you need to train separate AI models for doing different types of image tasks."
Now let's use our scenario of understanding animal pictures but with our general-purpose model.
"With our general-purpose model, you would have to train it on recognizing images of animals."
The key difference would be seen if you wanted to apply this model to do object detection of the animals.
"In theory, our general-purpose model would be able to do this with minimal change or possibly without any change."
This is the fundamental difference between the future AI models and what we have today.
I strongly believe these general-purpose models will be a catalyst in moving towards General Intelligence.
"Now, clevr will be focused on researching new AI methods and technologies that pursue Artificial General Intelligence."
"However, every breakthrough will be published on our public API for developers to use."
"When I started in AI, I was super passionate and wanted to try out the latest technology companies were deploying."
This is exactly what I want to keep doing with clevr going forward: Cutting edge APIs for developers at an affordable price.
"As I mentioned earlier, I have already gotten the ball rolling towards this mission."
"The most transformative technology of our lifetime will be Artificial General Intelligence, but it will also be one of the hardest."
"As I said earlier, I want all the cutting edge technology to be in the hands of many, not a few."
"If you are interested in following along with clevr's progress, head over to www.clevrml.com to keep up with the updates."
"Along with this, check out the APIs and give them a try."
"Nature shapes itself to fit the conditions it creates, as automatically as a river winding its way towards the sea."
"This is just what rivers do, because this is just what rivers are."
To call anything in this universe unnatural is to miss the point.
"Everything around you has come from nature, is made by nature, is made for nature."
"All of it evolved along with you, being conditioned by you or conditioning you, as nature irrevocably does to itself."
"This can be said of the forests and the ocean, your dog or your iPhone or your false eyelashes."
"There is nothing unnatural about any of it, because you, too, are nature."
"In each new way we shape our surroundings, we are contributing to evolution, actively."
"Evolution created self-aware sentience, consciousness in a being that is aware of itself as itself."
"Even if you are a theist, you can't argue that nature evolves itself."
"If God exists, God is a part of existence, and is therefore natural."
"Like rivers flowing to the sea, nature simply evolves - its pattern is written into what it is."
Everything we create - from technology to art to relationships to experiences - evolves us.
"Just as we are consciousness becoming aware of itself, we are evolutioneers becoming aware that they are evolving and are catalyzing evolution."
"Naturally, we are reckoning with having that power, and with learning how to wield it."
Of course our early attempts at self-aware and conscious evolution are sloppy and lurching and rough.
"Of course we are playing God, or, playing Mother Nature."
"We know that because it happened, through no influence by anything but nature."
Does that mean we should keep polluting the planet until we have to #OccupyMars?
"Just as we are nature learning that we have the power to shape itself, we are learning what shapes actually fit us."
"We are learning what is healthy for us, and what is harmful."
We are learning what we like and what we don't like.
"We are learning what we feel and what we think, as a collective."
"In becoming aware of each other, we are learning that what we call other is still us, because we are nature."
"Only nature, aggregated together into an inseparable whole, knows what's truly best for it."
"But I am but one part of consciousness, and I cannot choose our best direction on my own."
"I need you, all of you, as you all need me too."
"In the late nineteenth century, John D. Rockefeller faced an insurmountable problem."
"Being a shrewd fellow, he decided to retire at the top of his game."
"By all accounts, John D. Rockefeller was not a good man."
"John D. Rockefeller wasn't a particularly brilliant businessman, and his products weren't light years better than their competitors."
"By all accounts, without his shady tactics, he never would've been more than a mildly successful Cleveland oil refiner."
It's a model that many tech companies like Uber and Lyft now use to devastating effect.
But no one has done it better in our day than Jeff Bezos.
It's quite disturbing to think of how voracious this one man's appetite has been.
"Nor entertainment, groceries, health, cloud computing, the space race, or invasive surveillance."
"As Amazon evades taxation and sets itself above the law, it has become its own de facto virtual nation."
As Steve Levine recently put it:It's a hellish template he's created.
"Rockefeller was 63 when he retired from Standard, handing over the reins to his son John Jr. and VP John D. Archbold."
Let the young Turks fight in court for a decade or more.
"Bezos, just 57, probably doesn't relish the fight against a new generation of creative and hungry pro-democracy activists."
Jeff Bezos will now spend his days becoming the nation's beloved Mars guy.
"He'll whitewash his reputation from all angles - space, philanthropy, the arts."
"He'll become a pater familias, an elder statesman, an éminence grise."
"Rockefeller left behind broken men, bankrupted businesses, and an untold number of suicides."
"America rewarded Rockefeller for corporatizing and monopolizing the country, and the nation still hasn't righted the downward trajectory."
"Jeff Bezos now leaves behind a model of marauding financialization, predatory conglomeration, and exploitation the likes of which Rockefeller only dreamed."
"If America now rewards Bezos for architecting the modern Menace Economy, things will only get worse from here."
"I know there are certain disaster scenarios that can't be ruled out, but I think they are unlikely."
I'm not going to guess when things will return to a semblance of normal.
"The question for now is: what will that economy look like?A few things, I think, are clear."
The economy will not grow back up to its trend line prior to the pandemic.
Recessions cause permanent damage to people who lose their jobs and to recent graduates who can't find jobs.
There will also be a certain amount of psychological scarring that will affect the economy for at least a generation.
People buying safety stocks of dried beans and toilet paper may give the consumer goods sector a one-time boost.
"A large proportion of the population, particularly among the affluent, already reflexively shopped for everything at Amazon."
"More generally, big chains will expand their domination over the economy."
"Tens of thousands of small businesses will vanish, never to return, wiped out by weeks or months of zero revenues."
Large corporations will have the capital to swoop in and steal their customer base.
"Electronics shops, if there are any left, will be replaced by Best Buy."
The other winners will be private equity funds with the nerve to buy assets on the cheap.
"This time, the bargains will be found in small businesses desperate for capital and commercial real estate hammered by defaulting tenants."
The fundamental trends that have reshaped the American economy over my lifetime will accelerate.
The survival of capitalism depends on a large enough proportion of the population having a stake in its survival.
"I was suddenly immersed in developing and teaching the Global STEM Challenges Program in Fairfax, Virginia."
"The integrated portion means we are not just math teachers but science, engineering, and technology teachers too."
"Instead, we needed to be driven by student thinking: striving to find out what it is and how to improve it."
"As collaborators, we've discussed the many ways that teaching integrated math has shifted my thinking about how students learn."
"However, it doesn't take a research base to tell us that PD often receives lukewarm reception from teachers."
"For instance, say you go to a professional development training on student learning through multiple modalities."
"In my experience, three things might happen after training like the one I've described."
"Three, you leave the PD determined to use one new approach for leveraging multiple modalities in your instruction."
"However, since you used it to repackage old unit material, the application of what you learned is merely superficial."
"PD in this sense is a form of filling in the gaps or adding new practices, so-called additive PD."
"Eventually, we might also experience feelings of defeat because our learning was so superficial that our implementation lacked staying power."
Teaching integrated math has been a transformative professional learning experience for me.
The choices that the students make create connected contexts for math applications as they work without me having to contrive the connections.
"Because the students are able to choose the application they will explore, they pick something with meaning to them."
"By observing their choices and the artifacts we produce, we are able to learn more about how students are processing and learning."
Our STEM classes also capitalize on multiple modalities by using common science representations in math and technology applications across the program.
We strive to express quantities and relationships with graphs and algebraic expressions in addition to numbers.
These modalities are automatic in STEM and flatten the notion that graphs or equations only belong to one discipline.
I was surprised by how naturally this all developed out of integrated math instruction.
I've found that integrated STEM goes well beyond the expectation that I should differentiate the learning experience for my students.
"Instead, I'm learning that student choice in modalities and application allows the students to tailor the math learning for themselves!"
"They are more inclined to share their thoughts through their perspectives, in their own chosen modality, and using their own terminology."
"By listening and responding to student mathematical needs, the math I'm teaching is immediately relevant."
I can use the context of the challenge to learn more about student confusions regarding the underlying math.
"Okay, I thought, the students are confusing acceleration with velocity, and speed, which I can address."
"But to me, even more exciting than identifying their confusion was finding it through their conversation!"
"For one, teachers might be afraid that they don't have enough knowledge in the other STEM fields to pull this off."
I've not seen any lack of rigor when the instruction is responsive instead of following a traditional sequence.
ConclusionTeachers of integrated STEM can learn so much about how students learn and how to support them from teaching this way.
Students are required to express the mathematical reasoning for their decisions and how math is used in various contexts.
"As a result, I have been able to access a more authentic representation of students' productive reasoning along with their misconceptions."

"As a result, I feared two things: food and being fat."
"Under those umbrellas, I also feared hunger, as normal as it is, as well as weight gain and junk food."
I feared being judged for what I was eating or how I looked.
"And frankly, I don't remember a time when I didn't dislike my thighs or have anxiety over food."
"When I was 8 years old, I told people I was on a diet."
"When I was home alone, I would stock up on food, eating for as long as I could."
"I also flirted a good bit with restriction, skipping meals and limiting how much I ate."
"While my eating disorder truly had all the control, I thought I did."
"I can say I'm mostly recovered now, thanks to loved ones, therapy, and educational books."
"However, this took time and work, especially from where I was at my lowest."
"I have one question, I remember texting my dad quite dramatically one night after having those realizations."
"After looking through Psychology Today's mental health professionals database, I found a therapist nearby who specialized in eating disorders."
"While I felt hopeful about getting better, I didn't realize just how much therapy with her would help me."
"I loved doing therapeutic worksheets and talking things out, so we engaged in both."
"Below is an example:As mentioned previously, cognitive restructuring is a tool in CBT."
CBT believes that someone's perception of a situation can affect their reaction more than the situation itself.
Below are personal examples that explain what those can look like for someone with an eating disorder.
Cognitive restructuring helps people realize the false logic behind those anxieties and disordered thoughts.
"Through its process, you find facts that back up why those distortions are, well, distorted."
"I feel guilty about eating so much fried food, I remember saying to her."
"Having never heard this before - which is a wild thought, because I now preach it all the time -"
One of the most helpful assignments was writing my thoughts and then my arguments for and against them.
This helped me figure out the actual truth and how it could help me in my recovery journey.
I later learned this practice is the cognitive restructuring skill I've been talking about.
What thoughts are you having that are giving you distress or triggering you to engage in an eating disorder behavior?
"My advice here is to write what you can, regardless of whether you truly believe it's a distorted thought,"
Write down truths you know that support or back up your original anxious thoughts.
What experiences of yours make you believe those anxious thoughts could be true?
"For this step, you're essentially pretending you're a prosecutor, arguing why your anxious thoughts are factual."
"Eating disorders are difficult mental illnesses that often stem from serious, hard-to-fix situations."
You're allowed to feel sad for yourself and for the world.
"Next, either below or beside those arguments, list some facts that negate your distorted thoughts."
What do you know to be true that proves those anxieties wrong?
"For example, you may continue to gain weight, and your friends will still want to hang out with you."
"In other words, continue practicing this tool as patiently as you can, and you will see results in time."
"Recovery isn't linear, but it gets better as you get stronger."
"The goal is to write truths that are honest and lead to healthy, helpful choices."
"You don't have to believe your verdicts fully yet, but write them down anyway."
You also don't have to write something down for every single anxiety; just write as much as you can.
"While I wish we could remind ourselves of those helpful truths just once and be recovered, it doesn't work that way."
"Eating disorders are sneaky, insidious, and convincing; they creep in when we're already feeling vulnerable from other stressors."
"Repetition is an integral part of this experience, both in CBT's reliance on it and in what I know helped me."
"The more we hear something, the more we believe it, and I've seen this in my own life."
"When my therapist first told me food doesn't have moral value, for example, the concept was new."
"I mostly believed it because I trusted her knowledge, but I still felt heavy guilt when I ate bad or unhealthy foods."
"Additionally, engaging in further research that backs up those above helpful truths played a crucial role in my recovery."
"Your Time, Money, Well-Being, and Happiness Through Intuitive Eating by dietitian Christy Harrison next."
Repetition can't come from only ourselves or others; it's best when we can experience it both internally and externally.
"Six years have passed since I started recovery the first time, and I still struggle."
"But when these thoughts arise, I can quickly change them to be more helpful."
I'm also less tired from doing the work because it requires less from me now.
"For example, I don't have to write my thoughts down anymore - I just think about them."
They come to me naturally; I don't have to try so hard.
I also reach out to loved ones and other resources to support me in this endeavor.
I want to be clear that I have a lot of privileges that many don't have.
"With my family's help, I could afford therapy and educational books."
"While cognitive restructuring probably saved my life, it may not work for everyone."
"Don't feel guilty or shameful, just respect yourself and know you're not weird or hopeless."
"It was random, but I believe there is no subject we did not touch."
"You see, it was like a rule-no-talking period."
"I would eventually sleep off, and when it got dark, he would pick me up and go inside."
"I almost always woke up about 30 minutes later, very hungry."
"When I was done peeing, I would come back to the living room and tap him."
"Don't let them take me, Inem, he would mutter."
I never understood what he said; I was only interested in sleeping.
"Nnamdi barely responded with a flick of his hand, indicating she continued."
I stared at him dumbly - unable to say a word - till he smiled and asked me where my father was.
I promptly left to fetch my father and told him someone was looking for him.
"Father stepped into the parlour, and his expression looked as if he had seen a ghost."
"The giant had made himself comfortable in our living room and now stood to greet my father, who just moped at him."
"Who opened the door?''Now, now Ebuzor, nwanem, relax, ehn?"
"What is it now?'The giant collapsed back into the sofa, grinning. '"
"I was done in a few seconds and returned to stand at the kitchen door, peeping."
"I'm done with the army,ị ghọtara m?Okonkwo sighed and scratched an ear. '"
"We said our solemn goodbyes, and when it was my turn to hug him, the tears spilled."
They had sent a messenger on Sunday to say he would return before the next market day.
"We were in the parlour every day, hoping, waiting, crying."
And looking at the door like someone would walk in any moment.
I tapped my sleeping mother and led her by the hand to the gate.
"We chased him, teary and blurry-eyed, confused, till he turned the corner."
"The first battalion went down, and then they riddled us with bullets."
"My head was pounding, and bright flashes of light momentarily blinded my vision."
"Blood gushed out around him, and about ten people gathered around him immediately."
"I was still shaking, looking at my mother and back to Okonkwo dying in our front."
Someone lifted me from her while others crowded her and covered her from my view.
I turned for a couple of seconds and held my head to make it stop.
Nobody paid attention to me: two dead people were sucking it up.
I reached into the boxes and grappled with the lid of the first one.
"It didn't budge, and then I saw there was a name labelled on it."
"I allowed my legs to carry me to it, and I lifted the lid."
"One side of my father's head was open, with maggot-infested squished brain falling out of it."
"His free hand ran over my hair, and he said nothing."
Image: Drawing of the Human Brain showing cerebellum and pons.| By Henry Vandyke Carter •
"In humans, the cerebellum plays an important role in motor control."
"Cerebellar damage produces disorders in fine movement, equilibrium, posture, and motor learning in humans."
"Each part of the cortex consists of the same small set of neuronal elements, laid out in a highly stereotyped geometry."
"Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex."
The strongest clues to the function of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it.
"They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements."
"In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children."
"Thus the cerebellum has been implicated in the regulation of many different functional traits such as affection, emotion, and behavior."
Public domainThere is considerable evidence that the cerebellum plays an essential role in some types of motor learning.
Marr assumed that climbing fiber input would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened.
"Experimental data did not support the original form of the theory, but Braitenberg continued to argue for modified versions."
Theories in the learning category almost all derive from publications by Marr and Albus.
"Albus proposed in 1971 that the cerebellar Purkinje cell functions as a perceptron, a neurally inspired abstract learning device."
And there are many other possibilities for those who dare to explore them.
"The ox's young companion pulled herself closer to an upright ear, a beacon of distress, and gently hummed."
"Slowly, caressed by the tuneful murmur, the animal was lulled into a state of increasing sedation."
"Marcel was struck by the familiar hum, I recognise that song."
"The girl replied, not turning away from the ox's ear."
"Well, Marcel reached into the nearby medical kit and began to pull on two latex gloves, Spin this cow around."
The gloves snapped with delicious tautness and Marcel took in a deep breath in an attempt to still his stomach.
"Either way, if you're not spinning it around I'll sort it myself, shall I?"
"The young girl said, finally breaking the soothing song and turning towards Marcel."
"But as he returned to his duties a small hand touched him on his arm, halting him."
"Mr Zarapastra wants Luckbringer delivered safe and sound, no funny business."
She held out a confident hand and waited keenly for it to be shook.
"He removed the gloves and reluctantly shook her hand, his enclosed hers completely like an oyster within its shell."
"Under their feet, the plane quivered and the engine's blare increased."
"The pilot in the front turned in his seat and called back, Hey, Marcel, we good to go?"
Marcel helped Lottie to strap the shuffling Luckbringer in place and then calmed it to a seated position.
"Marcel sitting, sentinel-like and with arms folded, was suddenly struck by the song."
He's had an unfortunate life; he doesn't enjoy ABBA apparently.
"ABBA.Marcel sighed again, but this time there was truth laced within his exhale."
Marcel spat whilst rubbing his face with his hands in an attempt to dry it.
"Luckbringer, stretched his neck once more, tendons flexing beneath his dark skin, and Marcel brushed him away."
Can't say I'm overjoyed to be doused in ox's saliva.
His voice was groggy and he winced as he shuffled in his seat.
"As you can tell by his name, this is no normal ox, Luckbringer brings luck to those around him."
"Marcel turned his head towards the land that lay flat far below, he traced the sandy roads that connected small towns."
Could one possibly have a worse soundtrack to a journey that involved ferrying an ox and babysitting a young girl?
"An empty half-built apartment, where your daughter's bed used to be?"
The land was charred and all life around lay waste but Luckbringer stood solemnly in the smoke.
"I would hear word of fields that Luckbringer had graced, once more coming back to life."
What's to say that that same luck didn't burn down your farm?
"Lottie merely nodded and turned her face away, a tremble of a lip?"
"Once more, he turned his face to the Mexican sands outside of his window."
The two became silent and no more words were said between them.
"Abruptly standing, Marcel felt the pulsating of anger in his head, Turn this god damn shit off."
"Marcel turned to the pilot, If I hear one more harmony, I will throw this ox out of the plane."
"Immediately a tension, almost palpable, filled the innards of the cabin."
"Marcel was shocked when Luckbringer rose onto his legs, ears pricked up, tail dancing anxiously."
"The ox's breathing had grown heavy and saliva dripped from the sides of his mouth, in streams, to the floor."
"Felix sounded shaken, he turned to look back momentarily, his brow turned in worry."
"Lottie continued to sit serenely considering the chaos, Marcel fumbled his large frame around franticly looking for another object to grab."
We're going to die; this ox is going to crash to plane.
"The plane was started to topple downwards and pick up speed, Felix continued to attempt to spin the controls."
"Gradually, the plane began to flatten its course and calm permeated throughout the plane."
The young girl had appeared to become increasingly subdued and her swinging legs now lay still.
"Lottie must have sensed it for she spoke solemnly, So, you see Luckbringer isn't just any ox."
"No, Lottie said, a small tear ran down her nose."
"Suppressing the memory, he unbuckled himself and sat next to Lottie, putting his arm around her."
"He wondered where this compassion had disappeared to over the years, somewhere into the dry well inside."
But Luckbringer brought bad luck that day and my parents were caught in the fire.
"Lottie chewed her lip and held her unwavering gaze on the dark ox, And the flames burnt down Mr Zarapastra's factory."
The next moment Marcel found ABBA's Greatest Hits landing on his lap and heard the slamming of the pilot door.
"He stood, legs buckling slightly beneath him, and opened the hangar doors."
"There was a moment, something that seemed like reluctance, that emanated from Luckbringer, who couldn't turn away from Lottie."
"Lottie, her face turned down, pulled Luckbringer at her side, feet trailing as if resisting the journey."
"At this rate you'll always be unlucky, asshole, Marcel thought."
"I mean, maybe this ox could bring us some luck, wherever we go."
"Marcel turned to Luckbringer, shuffling on the cement, and gave him a gentle tap on the rump."
"Knowing Me, Knowing You and all that, hey, Luckbringer?"
"The ox turned away, shunning the large man and Marcel's smile faded."
"The whole thing took 18 minutes, for an average of 3.6 minutes per video, including the research time."
You can watch the whole livestream to see exactly how I did it.
"The faster you can shoot videos, the more content you can produce."
"Overall, more content tends to lead to more engagement, more subscribers, more views, and more revenue."
Here are some of my top strategies for shooting YouTube product videos quickly.
"I then search for the product, and pull up the exact item that I'm reviewing."
I then pull up the camera on my phone and start shooting.
"It's easy enough to remember how you use a product, and what you like about it."
"If I get something really cool on Kickstarter, I try to review it right away, before it goes mainstream."
"I sometimes make unboxing videos, too, or videos sharing my initial impressions of a product I just received."
"In many cases, though, I wait at least a month to review a product, and sometimes up to five years."
Because I actually use all the stuff that I review on my channel.
"If I just got it, I couldn't say that credibly."
"If you use a product for a longer time, you have more time to develop opinions about it."
Maybe you have a great experience using it - or a really negative one - that's memorable and stands out.
Or maybe you just develop a better understanding of what features are important and which features aren't.
All of that is valuable to share with your audience when you shoot your video.
And all of it is an easy addition to the content you're creating.
"You can just dive in and talk about what you've liked in using it, or any issues you've discovered."
"Many YouTubers assume that they need to produce professionally-crafted, carefully researched, comprehensive overviews of all the products they cover."
"Audiences are totally capable of learning about a product's basic specs by Googling it, or reading its Amazon page."
Videos based on your own experiences are also a lot faster and easier to shoot.
"Again, I like to remind myself of basic specs and brand names."
But otherwise I mostly shoot videos sharing my own opinions and experiences.
"I use it along with Open Broadcast Studio to do pro-quality videos, livestreams, presentations, interviews, etc."
"When I did a long livesteam about my Leica Q, for example, I used this setup."
"Again, when it comes to seeing products in use, people on YouTube want to see content shot in the real world."
"You're bringing them into your space, and helping them see how a product looks in real life."
"For that, professional production values aren't only unnecessary - they're a liability."
"Again, there's value in some slick, brand-produced product videos."
Many big brands pay tens of thousands of dollars to produce video content that looks like it was shot on someone's cellphone.
"But if you take this advice, you can almost certainly produce valuable product videos faster and more efficiently."
Kate DuffyTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Tuesday explained why the platform and its users would benefit from decentralized social media network systems.
"Dorsey was referring to the company's project, Bluesky, which has been in the works for more than a year."
"In turn, the company can surface more relevant content to users, he said."
"These sites are closed platforms, meaning users on one aren't able to connect with other users on another."
"Instead of being controlled by the company in charge, the network will put the power into the hands of the user."
"This means Twitter would only be able to control its own app on Bluesky, not other applications."
"Ultimately, it would allow people to create more social media sites."
"The light touched the bare arms and legs of the dancers seated on the floor, listening."
Most of them worked as waitresses or in factories to make a living.
"Martha struggled to pay them ten dollars a performance, but they rehearsed on their own time."
She'd spent half the night staring at the revolving images in her head - moonlight shining on the policeman's blond crewcut.
Her brother's face framed in the squad car window as it crunched away.
"The Paint Rock, Alabama, moon shrinking in the sky, retreating, out of reach."
"Ghosts that had spurred her to Harlem, to this Greenwich Village dance studio."
"Martha Graham, sturdy and supple, with the dark, deep-set eyes of a tragic heroine, posed in front."
A faint piano note chirped - Housley shifting his weight on his elbow.
Tessa focused on the lacquer chopsticks skewering Martha's slick bun and straightened her spine to prove she was listening.
"Now picture a wire fence around that sapling, a cage meant to keep it safe."
"She could see the cage, all right-made of barbed wire, fanged and dangerous."
"Martha said, Imagine that sapling growing, its trunk thickening layer by layer, getting stronger."
"The tree trunk in her mind's eye was golden brown, her own skin color."
"It is part of the tree's story, part of its being."
"Tessa swallowed again, but the lump in her throat wouldn't budge."
Martha lifted her hands above her head and stared at her students with widened eyes.
Holding within itself the piercing remnants of its own struggle to grow.
Lana put Tessa in mind of an old friend whose name she had forgotten and wanted to learn again.
"So you see, from those who have much, much is expected."
"Clutching sweaters and dance bags, they exited, sashaying or sauntering in twos or threes."
"But Tessa, her breaths coming short and tight, didn't feel inclined to leave just yet."
"She saw herself in the mirrored wall, slender and scowling, feet planted in second position."
"She muttered it under her breath, but Martha turned toward her."
Tessa frowned at Martha's red-painted mouth and said nothing.
"From someplace deep inside, the truth tore from Tessa's throat."
"Ma'am, with respect, you don't know how strong I am."
"Tessa whirled and stalked away, yanking off her headscarf and flinging it into a corner."
"She struggled with the changing room door, desperate to slam it behind her."
But the metal arm at the top of the jamb wouldn't let her.
"She clawed at her leotard, stretching it out of shape as she peeled it off."
She grabbed her street clothes from her locker and shoved herself into them.
"She heard Housley and Martha leave together, chatting about Fats Waller."
For once Martha hadn't gone to her apartment above the studio to dance for hours.
"Well, if Martha wasn't practicing, she must be headed to the corner store for a bottle."
"Tessa savored the spitefulness of this thought, enjoying it all the more because it was probably true."
"Though she knew she'd regret it later, her back-talk to Martha had lifted her spirits."
The only thing that gnawed at her at the moment was Housley seeing her disrespect Martha.
"She glanced toward the corner of the room for her headscarf, but it wasn't there."
"She'd find it later, but right now her hair was a mess."
"Smoothing it, she flashed back to Paint Rock days, marking steps in the church basement in a red bandana."
"She saw a pitch-black stage, lit by one lone spotlight."
"In the silence between dark and light, a woman inside Tessa's head noiselessly bucked and kicked, one arm thrown back."
"Under her cheap chintz dress, she felt droplets trickle down her sides."
"Then, amazingly, the piano sang out with a driving jazz beat."
"She stretched like a bowstring, shot across the floor, landed with two stamps of her foot."
"Look out!She leaped again, and the air split open to let her fly."
"Tessa replied with a kick and a spin, finishing up in a low crouch that nearly snapped her garters."
"She exploded up and out, arms and legs splayed, hovering airborne for a wild second."
"She landed with another stomp, stomp, so hard her bones shook."
"She stood tall and still, one arm raised above her head."
"Got your headscarf, he said, as if nothing strange and wonderful had just happened."
He had a dimple in his cheek and his thick-lashed eyes were soft and deep.
"Something beyond telling shuttled back and forth between them, warm and solid."
That invisible good thing twitched like a live creature as she brushed past him.
"Housley squinted at her and tipped his head, but he didn't say anything else about it."
"As if following the rules of a game, they rode in silence."
Jeff Bezos is not one of the wealthiest people in the world because he sells books and baking trays.
"Ease of browsing, ease of purchase, ease of payment, ease of delivery."
"Quality is important, so is price, but increasingly speed and ease are king and queen."
"If your new laptop can be delivered within 24 hours, does it really matter if it's a few dollars more?"
"Pretty much everything that Amazon sells can be found elsewhere, sometimes for a better price."
"High street shops and supermarkets still exist, and there's no delivery time when you buy directly from them."
"There are loads of other streaming platforms available, with more appearing almost every day."
"Almost nothing that Amazon offers is, in fact, completely unique."
"How, then, have they taken over the world in the way that they have?Ease."
"Why not just get everything done at once, from the comfort of your sofa?"
"Why not take the simple, easy route and then get on with your day?It's a good point."
There is a reason why Amazon Prime is arguably one of the greatest products developed in recent years.
Are high street shops dying because their products are university more expensive than Amazon's alternatives?
I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that everyone is going to be the next Bezos.
But every single one of you can make your business easier and more accessible.
"In the world of the internet, most things are just a few clicks away."
"The fewer clicks your customers need to make, the better your business will thrive."
"Again, Amazon leads the way on this with their one-click purchase option for customers with established accounts."
Every second they spend navigating through a booking or purchasing process is a second in which they could change their mind.
So let them get what they want in as few seconds as possible.
"If you sell products online, you should aim for as few clicks as possible."
"If you can, save customers information so that, after the first visit, one-click purchasing might be an option."
Make it a matter of 30 seconds for them to reach out.
"You can worry about reeling them in afterwards, once they have made that first move."
"If you're not selling anything, the philosophy of ease still applies to you."
"Every single site has a purpose and, whatever that purpose is, it can be made easier to achieve."
"If you're looking for email contacts, only ask them for their email."
"If you want your content read because you have a message to share, put it in front of them ASAP."
Don't hide your world-changing manifesto behind three clickthrough links.
"It might help to keep the website looking orderly, but every click is reducing your readership."
"In a world that is moving at breakneck speed, businesses have to keep up."
"That's what Amazon do, and look where it got them."
Flippant discussions of quality and price in relation to ease can be difficult.
Fair pricing will always win out against inflated prices in the end.
"People are not blind consumers, they can and do make active decisions towards these things, and that's good."
"However, we cannot deny the fact that ease is a big market."
"We are making their purchasing decisions easier, but we're not making them for them."
"Knowing that, and playing to it, will place us and our businesses in a better position for the future."
I am going to show you exactly how you can start building your list.
This is the exact same process that I will be using to start building my list.
"They offer several different domains, email, and web hosting packages."
You can see the details for each package below based on one user.
You get one free domain name as well as free private registration for one year.
The domain name will cost $15 per year after the first 12 months.
"Yes, these come with a higher price tag but many more tools and features vs. their standard webmail account."
With the MS365 Business basic and Business Standard accounts you get one free domain as well as free private registration for one year.
The below pricing shows the current price deals they have in place.
The pricing is lower than the MS365 option but still a bit higher than the IONOS webmail option.
Again when compared to their webmail you have access to many more tools and features.
Again you get one free domain name as well as free private registration for one year.
The below pricing shows the current price deal they have in place.
"Just to make sure you know all of the options you have, let's look at their web hosting option."
They offer many more features with these packages that you can see here.
Again the biggest thing to note is that you won't have access to the MS365 or GSuite tools with this option.
"Email marketing and building your list doesn't need to be super complicated, nor super expensive."
Even if you go with the Cadillac MS365 Business Standard plan your average monthly cost is less than $15.
Here is another freemium option for anyone that actually made it all the way to the end.
As I noted in my article A Guide to Getting Started With EmailOctopus their current landing page offerings are very limited.
If you go just with a domain and email hosting package then you need another option for your landing page.
Carrd is just that option and they are easily integrated with EmailOctopus.
Each level comes with a variety of different features which you can see here.
The free plan allows you to build three sites using standard images and their own URLs.
You also cannot integrate your sign-up form with EmailOctopus.
"At $1.58 per month, I am sure you can justify it!"
"And like all artworks, this one has themes and motifs worth exploring."
"The hapless attorney, Rod Ponton, claims he's been contacted by news outlets around the world."
"I always wanted to be famous for being a great lawyer, he reflected,"
"Kelly was criticised for how he handled his daughter during his ordeal, while journalists have dredged up old harassment allegations against Ponton."
"But there are other reasons why, in the great collective fiction of internet life, cat-lawyer is an interesting character."
"As I've previously written at greater length, online culture carries a strong strain of the grotesque."
"Of course it's probably safe to assume that Ponton's children, and not Ponton himself, normally use the kitten filter."
But childhood and adolescence are where we see the implications of the grotesque most clearly.
"Incidentally, I remember having this response to a particularly cheesy series of pulp novels for teens called Animorphs."
"The cat-lawyer pushes these buttons too: his wonderful, mesmerising weirdness is a familiar expression of the grotesque."
And this gels perfectly with the comedy of interrupted formality and humiliation.
"It is darkly absurd, but unsettling too: it awakens anxieties about the aspects of ourselves that we conceal from public view."
Part of its appeal is that it lets us appreciate these strange resonances by cloaking them in humour.
Upon visiting many other cities - I am grateful for being blessed to have experienced Prague.
"My favorited place where I love to head out to work, write or just daydream is - Cafe Louvre."
The original building was built 1902 but the interior underwent several design and decor changes.
"It used to be visited by some prominent figures such as Franz Kafka, Albert Einstein or Nikola Tesla."
Wherever I find myself in this cafe - I feel like I time-travel back to the 1920s.
If you find yourself in Prague - be sure to visit this magnificent grand cafe.
I love the fact that when in Prague I am surrounded with parks.
But only lately have I discovered Prague greatest treasure - historic gardens.
It is quite difficult to find as it's hidden behind an unnoticeable gate.
But when you find it - you can bet you will be in awe by the beauty it shelters.
The Vrtba Garden offers an amazing view of the St Nicholas Cathedral - on of the biggest attractions in Prague.
Vrtba Garden in Prague is beautiful in every season and is often sought after by couples to be married there.
"The garden hosts a lot of events such as garden parties, theatre performances and art exhibitions."
"When looking to escape the city rush I always choose Vrtba garden, which serves as an ideal place of solitude and peace."
I have realized that the most important thing about a place - is how it makes you feel.
"I love to go out and just wander the streets, wherever I am."
There are not many places that I have visited that had evoked in me the sense of safety - like Prague.
It's a place where you can let you children go out and play on their own and not be worried.
There is not just one thing that makes Prague special its just a lot of little things that grow on you with time.
"We all have narcissistic tendencies, which isn't necessarily a bad thing."
Some narcissistic traits - such as having a clear vision or the ability to attract others - may make you a better leader.
But there are plenty of similar characteristics that can make you unbearable.
"In his documentary, DICKS: Do you need to be one to be a successful leader?"
"Usually, they:However, narcissists often have unproductive traits too."
"So, if you have a gut feeling that therapy won't work for you . . ."
"Narcissists are the change-makers, the visionaries, the disruptors."
They want to make a better world - in their own image.
"Like them or loathe them, we need them if we want things to improve."
"The last few years have taught me to wrap myself in love, warmth, and patience."
That I am worth loving because of everything I am and everything I am not.
Those times of solace and solitude should not be artificially interrupted because of Valentine's Day.
It should not be the time to seek out romantic love when the timing isn't quite right.
Find comfort in knowing that holidays and other special occasions will not always align with the universe's plans for our romantic relationships.
"When you're working from home, you don't have to stare at the same four walls all day."
"Instead, you have the opportunity to get out and explore the world, when it's safe to do so."
"If you aren't ready to ditch your residence on a permanent basis, that's OK."
There are so many different options when you aren't tied to a location.
"If sailboat life isn't for you, don't dismiss live-aboard boating altogether."
A houseboat could serve as an affordable way to live in expensive parts of the world.
It might be like living in a floating apartment as opposed to an ocean-going vessel.
There are plenty of world cruises that will take you all over the globe.
"If you're not into buying a big commercial RV, consider a camper van."
"There are plenty of people who explore the world on a tight budget via Volkswagen bus, for example."
Read more: A 29-year-old 'California girl' moved to Nova Scotia with her husband last year.
"She says it's been a culture shock, but living in Canada meant they could finally afford the American dream."
Some countries are working hard to attract work-from-home Americans for extended periods of time.
Have you ever wondered what it's like to live in Hawaii but don't want to move that far from family?
"If you own a home, consider swapping houses with other people."
This also gives you the chance to explore different places without spending much money.
"For some people working from home, it makes sense to stay with friends and family for an extended period."
Moving in with an elderly parent might mean you're able to offer more assistance around your work schedule.
"For others, it may make sense financially to move in with a relative on a temporary basis to save money."
It may take your brain a while to fully grasp the idea that you have the freedom to do more things.
A freelancer who makes their own schedule can get more creative than someone who needs to attend regular Zoom meetings in business attire.
"But, there are plenty of people who have figured those things out, so know it's possible."
"Instead, we get a peek at just the beginnings of many sad workplace stories."
Are we really all deeply suffering at the hands of managers?Probably not.
We're more inclined to use Google as a painkiller than a vitamin.
Google's predictions are heavily weighted towards those with a want to solve problems rather than a will to seek affirmation.
"Nevertheless, the predictions only pop up if there's been enough actual historical search volume to warrant it."
"If you're honest, you can probably remember a time you had a dud manager."
"If you're brutally honest, maybe you can even admit to having been one."
"If you're having a moment of absolute soul-cleansing honesty, perhaps you even know you are one."
How can we save a direct report from typing something horrible about us into a Google search?
"It starts with some simple behaviours, wrapped in the principles of servant leadership."
Individual jobs are usually accountable for tasks which contribute to some bigger end result.
"In fact, studies have shown it's a significant predictor of depression."
"Googling my manager makes me depressed, make an effort to help them understand how they contribute to the bigger picture."
Find reasons to talk about answers to these types of questions: What steps happen before staff do their part of the job?
Who's life is made easier when a task is nailed perfectly?Look for opportunities to combine tasks performed by different individuals.
Sometimes we assume a staff member's great work equates to their love for the job.
"Here's another option: The work's become so damn easy, they can do it without thinking."
It's been proven that boredom in the workplace is mostly bad news.
"Monotony is detrimental to worker health, well-being and performance, says one study."
"It increases the risks of aggressive behaviour, anxiety, depression and alcohol addiction."
Making sure staff are challenged and stimulated by their work is a matter of just asking them.
"Regularly check-in and literally ask, Is this interesting enough for you?"
"By endorsing your support for trying new things, you empower staff with the autonomy to make decisions that impact their own work."
This small change can have a big impact over a my way or the high way management approach.
"If you feel even just a pang of responsibility for some of those Google searches, try out those simple tips this week."
Adopting the mindset of serving your staff first will be a catalyst for achieving your own success.
"Plus, you might just improve the health and wellbeing of those who look up to you every day."
"Hey, artificial intelligence seems to be all over today's world."
"These fake, silicon brains have been replacing our 'feeling brain' slowly but surely."
That's the point where I decided that I'm going to run an experiment.
The purpose was to find how good modern machine learning really is.
"So, I decided to try to get an article written exclusively by a computer."
"One option was to try and build the A.I. on my own, and the other was to find a service online."
I finally decided to go with a ready-made alternative that I found on Google.
"That's when I started realizing just how much time I had saved, had I worked on coding my own."
"It was so easy, that I was almost surprised when I first used it."
"You just supplied the topic or niche that you want your article to be about, and that's it."
"So, I wrote a quick paragraph about productivity and mindfulness, and the journey began."
I tried reading the first paragraph and it didn't really make sense.
"I continued on reading and, to be honest, nothing made sense."
"The article was worthless, nothing made sense, the paragraphs were all messed up, and I was disappointed."
"But, that's not all, I was determined to make this work."
I started fiddling around with all the options that the service had to offer.
"I tried writing business articles, health articles, and even spirituality articles."
"Somehow, they all turned out moderately good, a miracle compared to the first one."
"Now, you're probably wondering, why didn't you post the better ones?"
"As if A.I. writing articles wasn't interesting enough, I wanted more."
"I wanted to learn how machine learning operated, how its internals worked, and why it was so inconsistent."
"Whenever I entered a paragraph to be used as a platform to build on, the algorithm went crazy."
"When I let it do its thing, however, it wrote articles that were at the very least readable."
"Now, you're probably wondering to yourself, what was so important about this experiment."
"The answer is very simple, testing the limits of brand-new technology is always useful."
This experience helped me understand that machine learning has a lot more to learn and accomplish.
It's still in its early phases of development and we should be expecting much more from it.
"A.I. seems to be everywhere, from your fridge to IBM's supercomputers."
"In the next few years, the scene of Machine Learning will probably change drastically."
Something important is that we now see articles titled The AI-Enabled Future .
"Most likely, we will not see a Terminator-like dystopian world where AI takes over and the human species goes extinct."
"One of them would be, if the A.I. infringes some kind of copyright, should we blame the author or the system?"
"Also, if the computer makes an offensive statement, like using racial slurs, is the author to blame here?"
"Today we are better at calling out bullying, but no better at leaving stars alone."
"Those paparazzi photos, burned into my head forever, portrayed the opposite."
"Last week, when the New York Times and Hulu released the documentary Framing Britney Spears, it clicked."
"If Spears rose to fame today, we'd have language to identify the bullying that put her mental health at risk."
But that doesn't mean we're better at shutting down harassment and treating celebrities as real people.
Celebrities today have as fraught a relationship with their social media followers as the stars of 2007 had with paparazzi and magazines.
"And yet every photo, video, and caption is the subject of scrutiny."
"There's even a weekly podcast analyzing her posts, seen by 27.7 million followers."
It wasn't until recently that Americans had the vocabulary to discuss mental health.
The report concluded the United States deserved a D-rating for its lack of mental-health infrastructure and information access.
The New York Times later reported Lanza had a history of untreated mental health issues.
"Moments after the news broke, Twitter and Instagram were flooded with images of Williams."
"Why, This Is Us, and The Real Housewives of Potomac."
"But more conversations and positive portrayals haven't led to actionable change, as rates of anxiety and depression continue to rise."
"But, as the documentary lays out, her tearful request wasn't enough."
"It was a great kind of a relationship, Ramos said in the film."
"There were times when she was like, 'Can you leave me alone for the day?'"
"But it wasn't like, 'Leave me alone forever.'"
"America's fixation on celebrities as quasi-royals is a double-edged sword, Sat Nam said."
"They choose, gather around them, support them, and buy their records or whatever."
"Not saying they're not talented and great, but we make them."
"That's a lot for anybody to go through, being under scrutiny all the time."
It used to be where we could separate ourselves from any kind of bad situation.
We go home versus being at work where something bad is happening.
Spears remains under her conservatorship with her father keeping partial control over her $60 million net worth.
"On Monday, Spears shared a selfie on Instagram with a simple caption of three mango emojis and no words."
"Another thought mango could really mean Man, go, a reference to Britney's father and his power over her."
"Despite Spears' disappearance from the public eye, we're still scrapping for anything she does."
It is a soft skill that amplifies all other skills like leadership and listening.
"Empathy is a key aspect of leadership effectiveness and emotional intelligence that improves interactions, communications and outcomes."
"It also influences the job performance of a manager who performs better, as rated by supervisors."
"With empathy, we can set our beliefs aside and put ourselves in someone else's shoes."
But how can we cultivate it at work?Listen to what the other person is saying .
This means not just listening for the sake of hearing that person out.
"Through active listening, you can understand the entire message behind that person's words."
"In the process of listening, you must withhold your judgment and make room for the feelings of the other person."
"By being empathetic, you can determine the reasons behind what the other person believes in."
You can also show respect even if you don't necessarily agree with what they're saying.
Role playing is critical to feeling the pain of the other person.
This process could also make it easier for this person to share stories with you.
"Especially in these challenging times, people are feeling stressed and having a hard time balancing work and life at home."
"At work, look for signs of stress in your employees before it becomes an issue, including employee disengagement."
Check with team members weekly and ask how they're dealing with their current situation and handling their workload.
"To be an empathetic leader, acknowledge and understand the unique goals and needs of your team, including delegating work assignments properly."
Understand that it's your role to support team members who are in need.
Doing so will also lead to an open communication line that promotes transparency at work.
They can admit they're imperfect humans who are also capable of making mistakes.
They take action to make things right and allow their employees do the same.
Another example of this shines through on the topic of empathetic leadership with leaders.
"For example, seek to understand perspectives and feelings when interacting with employees."
This sets the tone at work and encourages employees to do the same as they feel more comfortable.
"They are the binding force that glues people together, even if they're not always visible among colleagues."
Support and empower these leaders and see ways they're cultivating empathy in the workplace.
"They can recognize and understand individual beliefs and perspectives, even when they differ from their own personal views."
"By consistently practicing empathy, you and the rest of your team can create a happier, healthier company culture."
Little Nightmares II applies the same strategy and gives it a slightly unique twist.
It's like each level has been ripped out of an anthology series.
Little Nightmares II without a doubt overshadows its predecessor in every way possible.
"It manages to keep what made the original so fantastic, whilst also being different enough to stand by its own merits."
It is certainly much more morbid and tackles far more problematic issues than its predecessor.
"For example, there's a section of the game that takes place within a school."
"Whenever I got split away from Six, I felt more helpless than I did before."
Little Nightmares II is a masterclass in visual storytelling thanks to its extremely clever and talented level design.
Fans of the first game will notice that Six is still hiding something truly evil.
You'll come across pictures and symbols that foreshadow upcoming events and hidden rooms that establish secret connections to the first game.
Little Nightmares II is not just an incredible horror title but a fantastic sequel to its predecessor.
What it lacks in combat it makes up for with smartly crafted scares and spine-chilling monster design.
"The team over at Tarsier Studios should be extremely proud, and hopefully, this sets the standard for future games to come."
"Little Nightmares II is available to purchase now on PS4, Xbox One, Steam, and Nintendo Switch."
"Carl could hardly keep his social distance as he gazed adoringly across the restaurant table at the love of his life, Emily."
She took a rubber glove from the table's dispenser and donned it.
"The plastic bio-barrier that surrounded his head steamed up, sending them both into paroxysms of laughter."
They sat back and shoved respective soiled gloves into the table's disposal chute.
Neither of them would wash that hand for at least 10 minutes.
"Now, it was time to take the plunge, he decided."
He used his smartphone to dim the lights above their table and change the music to their favorite song.
"You know that I am madly, utterly in love with you."
"I can't imagine life without you, continued Carl, barely able to key in the message."
"I don't want to even think about losing you, replied Emily."
Carl took out a small velvet box and opened it to reveal a diamond ring.
He included a man-kneeling emoji at the end of the message.
"Emily couldn't hold back her tears, which were quickly dried by her personal bio-barrier's air jets."
She used the table's disinfectant nozzle to spray the ring before carefully putting it on her finger.
"Before he could order, the waiter droid arrived smartly with a bottle of champagne."
"We hope you don't mind, sir, but our guest sensors detected the intense emotion of a marriage proposal."
"Please accept this token and our hearty congratulations, said the droid and proffered the bottle."
Emily and Carl laughed their acceptance and texted confetti emojis to each other.
The ecstatic couple gazed at each other as they sipped champagne through the drinking tubes in their bio-shields.
"Yes, said Carl, and gleefully tapped the keys of his smartphone."
"K. B. Cottrill writes fiction, non-fiction, and things in-between."
"Only two days before a bomb had fallen near the store, dropped by a Zeppelin on its seemingly haphazard tour over London."
"A building was destroyed, several others damaged and a number of people died while the Zeppelin continued its journey."
"There was a bus stop just outside the department store and they, along with a few others, alighted."
"Several policemen were standing outside, trying to look alert and purposeful when they really had nothing to do and were bored."
Before she could say anything he pulled his hand away from hers and ran off down the street as fast as he could.
"Maybe it was a mistake to bring him here, she thought."
He had shown no fear at the sound of the bombs in the night.
He was about twenty yards ahead of her and ran round a corner into a side street.
As she turned the corner she saw that he had fallen and was lying on the pavement motionless.
Had he hit his head on the pavement and knocked himself out?
But as she walked briskly up to him he saw her skirts out of the corner of his eye and started yelling.
"There is nobody here she said, almost as alarmed as Thomas himself."
"She knew that people had died, died horribly and painfully, in that building."
"They went straight home, the birthday, the department store, the present, completely forgotten."
"Sometimes people's thoughts, people's feelings stay around after they have died."
It's like still being able to taste bread and jam after you have eaten it.
It was a silly comparison but it was all she could think of to explain to a small child.
"But she was trying to explain something she didn't understand herself, and tried to decide who she could turn to."
Her husband was a scientist and had no time for anything his profession could not explain.
"Superstition, religion, spiritualism, they were just nonsense to him, a relic of a less enlightened age."
"He looked at her for a long time, then stared at the floor for a few moments."
"He had a very concise manner of speech, words pared down to the minimum."
He tried to apply a solution from his own area of expertise.
The idea suddenly came to her that her own fate might be to suffer the pains of death for eternity.
"Thomas seemed calm that morning, with no sign of the previous day's ordeal."
"Thomas didn't really like the music but sat patiently, indulging his Father."
"The point is this chap's dead, dead in his grave."
The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
"His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked."
"His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls."
Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
"Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad."
"However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was."
"Oh, God , he thought, what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen!"
"Getting up early all the time , he thought, it makes you stupid."
I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot.
"But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me."
"First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five."
"And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers."
"Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?"
"True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that."
"The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding."
But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill.
"And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case?"
"Gregor , somebody called - it was his mother - it's quarter to seven."
"Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before."
And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: Gregor! Gregor!
"His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: Gregor, open the door, I beg of you."
"But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad."
And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.
"His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet."
Two strong people - he had his father and the maid in mind -
"Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked?"
"Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought."
"They're not opening the door , Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope."
"But then of course, the maid's firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it."
Gregor only needed to hear the visitor's first words of greeting and he knew who it was - the chief clerk himself.
"There was a loud thump, but it wasn't really a loud noise."
"Something's fallen down in there , said the chief clerk in the room on the left."
I'm sure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.
"He isn't well , said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through the door."
He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables.
"Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then? , asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door again."
In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.
She had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.
Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family.
"But the others didn't know what was happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour."
"The chief clerk now raised his voice, Mr. Samsa , he called to him, what is wrong?"
"I'm speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation."
"This morning, your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it's true -"
But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf.
"I'm slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven't been able to get up."
I don't know why I didn't let you know at work!
But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home.
"I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given me strength."
If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor's responsibility and he could rest.
"By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying."
"They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help."
"The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel better."
Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair.
"Listen , said the chief clerk in the next room, he's turning the key."
Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely.
"Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he could be seen."
"Gregor's mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, looked at his father."
"His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room."
"Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook."
They think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it.
"But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact,"
"He moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room."
She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back.
"But his sister was not there, Gregor would have to do the job himself."
He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor.
"Mother, mother , said Gregor gently, looking up at her."
"The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor's father into a panic as well."
"Nothing would stop Gregor's father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man."
Gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly.
He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible.
Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.
"The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all was quiet."
It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep.
By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it.
"Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room."
"It was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat."
"But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end?"
"Hardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch."
"Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her."
"She immediately picked it up - using a rag, not her bare hands - and carried it out."
"In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper."
"What's more, his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving."
"He was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he hurried back under the couch."
"She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out."
She had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself.
Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted.
"It was not a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated."
"Behind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution."
"His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence."
Would Gregor's elderly mother now have to go and earn money?
"He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end."
"It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room."
"Even if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while."
"For the first fourteen days, Gregor's parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him."
His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it.
Very soon his sister noticed Gregor's new way of entertaining himself -
"As she approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent."
"You can come in, he can't be seen , said his sister, obviously leading her in by the hand."
"Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can."
Grete would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls by himself.
"The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay."
"In his startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little."
"She stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to Grete."
"This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by no-one."
He turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back.
"What shall we take now, then? , said Grete and looked around."
"Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile."
That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation.
"The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it."
Gregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father.
"He really ought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?"
"He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high."
"Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with that -"
"He became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable."
"These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors."
An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor's back and slid off without doing any harm.
"Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility - probably permanently."
Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor's mother you're doing so much sewing again today!
"Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary?"
And the injury in Gregor's back began to hurt as much as when it was new.
"She still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any quicker about it."
"Gregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected."
From then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him.
"Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate, especially if it was dirty."
They had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them.
"He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it."
"The food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell."
"The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards."
"Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence."
"I'd like to eat something , said Gregor anxiously, but not anything like they're eating."
"Oh yes, we'd love to , called back Gregor's father as if he had been the violin player himself."
"Gregor's father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister with the violin."
"Drawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room."
"And despite this condition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room."
"It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses."
"Her face was leant to one side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression."
It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for.
Meanwhile Gregor's sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted.
Gregor's father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants.
He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something.
"With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door."
"Throughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him."
"He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited."
Gregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.
Her words seemed to give Gregor's father some more definite ideas.
"My child , said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding, what are we to do?"
You've got to get rid of the idea that that's Gregor.
"Father, look, just look , she suddenly screamed, he's starting again!"
"But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister."
They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly.
"Maybe now they'll let me turn round , thought Gregor and went back to work."
He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest.
"No-one was making him rush any more, everything was left up to him."
As soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead.
He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway.
With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep.
"He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked."
The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him.
It was his sister who had been in so much of a rush.
"What now, then? , Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness."
He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all.
"If it was possible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister."
He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning.
He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too.
"Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils."
"She thought he was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding to him."
"She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway."
"Come and 'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!"
"But then, each from his own side, they hurried out of bed."
"Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it."
"Now then , said Mr. Samsa, let's give thanks to God for that ."
"Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: Just look how thin he was."
The food came out again just the same as when it went in .
Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it.
The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about.
"They did so, and stood around Gregor's corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats."
All of them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face against her father's arm.
"Now! , said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without letting the women from him."
Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times.
As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later;
"The cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going, she'd finished her work for that morning."
"What is it you want then? , asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most respect for."
They got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other.
Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while.
"They had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves."
