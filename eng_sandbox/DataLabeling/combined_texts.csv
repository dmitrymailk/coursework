Say it can do 99% but not 100% - then people are not ready for the 1%.,news
However Brauer said it was time for Musk to shift his messaging to clearly acknowledge the limitations of the cars.,news
Honda and Toyota have been really clear about that from day one .,news
Brauer said Musk's colorful remarks about the technology often present an exaggerated and dangerous image of the vehicles' capabilities.,news
"I get to fly a fighter jet, because I'm highly trained, she said.",news

It's hard to imagine any president implementing such an ambitious agenda by 2018.,news
Trump proposes to lower taxes and to reduce business regulation and foreign competition for American businesses and jobs.,news

"Should the economy face a major recession, cutbacks in these social insurance programs will further compound the economic downturn.",news
Gerald Friedman is a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.,news

Jesse Lingard and Theo Walcott did little to disprove the theory they were fortunate to be in the team.,news
Southgate talked about inheriting a mess and the performance left the impression little had changed.,news
At least Rooney can still consider himself a favourite of England's followers.,news
"If the hardcore fans want Southgate to take charge permanently, this was not an occasion when it became evident.",news

Trump was more explicit about his view on the importance of unity during a campaign rally in North Carolina last week.,news

Probably I do better without the support I'm talking about because that's why I'm here in the first place.,news
One of Trump's most famous surrogates doesn't seem particularly interested in helping unite the party either.,news
"Indeed, a poll released last Wednesday had Trump winning just 70% of the Republican vote in a race against Hillary Clinton.",news
A Raba Research poll released this week was even worse with Trump garnering just 66% of Republicans.,news

"A site is a snapshot in time, it's not like we can pick it up and move it somewhere else.",news

"LÃ³pez Rivera is one of the US's, and the world's, political prisoners.",news
"Aged 73, he has spent more than half his life behind bars.",news
"He is convicted of killing no one, of hurting no one.",news
His crime was seditious conspiracy - plotting against the US state in the furtherance of Puerto Rican independence.,news

The last year in which the militant group to which he belonged committed a violent act was 1983.,news

He threw himself into community work among the Puerto Ricans of Chicago.,news

Targets were chosen for being symbols of Yankee imperialism such as oil companies with offshore rigs in Puerto Rican waters.,news

We called it 'armed propaganda' - using targets to draw attention to our struggle.,news
"That may have been the case, but the results were, to put it politely, inconsistent.",news
Two years later an employee at the Mobil building in New York was killed by another FALN device.,news

"I use it to my own advantage, for my own goals.",news
"From the moment I get up to the moment I go to bed, I keep active.",news
"That means rising at 4am to an exercise regime of 40 minutes of stretching, and sidewinders and upper body routines.",news
He also likes to paint as a way of taking myself out of prison into the outside world .,news
He would spend all but two hours a week in his concrete cell with no sight of the sky.,news
You see less colour everything blurs into the of the cell walls.,news
So he turned to painting as a way to bring colour back into his life.,news
"That's when he rediscovered his passion for the monarch butterfly, reproducing pictures of the insects as a reflection on their migration.",news
"I always thought they were not going to destroy me, that was not going to happen.",news
Though he is now out of solitary he has still had to deal with social deprivation.,news
"At its peak, he was one of two dozen independistas in federal prisons now he is the last one.",news
To have no regret about his predicament is all the more extraordinary in that he could have been released in 2009.,news
"That's not my practice, I couldn't do it, he says.",news
"For me, the decision was the one I had to make.",news
So what now is the likelihood that Obama will follow in Clinton's footsteps and finally fling open the cell doors?,news

"The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining.",ted
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it.,ted
Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics?,ted
"It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat.",ted
"This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is.",ted
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions - global warming pollution - and trading it.,ted
"Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system.",ted
The market will work to solve this problem - if we can accomplish this.,ted
"Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done.",ted
"It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads.",ted
"Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested.",ted
"I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue.",ted
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do.,ted
"Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them.",ted
"In terms of invention, I'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects.",ted
"I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest.",ted
It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world.,ted
"It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet, the number one cause of death in children under five.",ted
It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires - acute respiratory infections caused by this.,ted
How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year?,ted
It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation.,ted
So the rains come - they go down the rivers and the flooding happens.,ted
"Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared.",ted
"So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels.",ted
"About four years ago, I took a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there.",ted
This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked.,ted
And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them.,ted
And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn.,ted
"And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see it says, US Peace Corps.",ted
"As it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village.",ted
And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel.,ted
What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level.,ted
And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called bagasse.,ted
"It has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals.",ted
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it.,ted
"So over the next couple of years, students and I worked to develop a process.",ted
It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking.,ted
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes.,ted
"These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute.",ted
So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT.,ted
This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India.,ted
"Kids and women are especially affected by it, because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires.",ted
So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there.,ted
"Well, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us.",ted
What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass.,ted
And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area.,ted
"And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel.",ted
"And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung.",ted
And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel.,ted
"And in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly.",ted
And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking.,ted
"In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees are cut down every year.",ted
There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those.,ted
"In addition, the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars.",ted
So this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project.,ted
And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal.,ted
"And he's found that worldwide, you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel.",ted
"That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees.",ted
But now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel.,ted
And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes - it comes ready made.,ted
"They're fully functional, field-tested, ready to roll out.",ted
"And I think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology, is that the technology transfer is so easy.",ted
"And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now, which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life.",ted
"But once you see it, like you guys in the front row -",ted
"So not only do you have health benefits, you have environmental benefits.",ted
But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits.,ted
"It's really rare that you don't have trade-offs between health and economics, or environment and economics.",ted
"And now, I don't actually mean the world that we live in.",ted
I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat.,ted
I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water.,ted
That's as if the entire workforce of the state of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water.,ted
"If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet.",ted
"If this were Zambia - 300 of you would be farmers, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV.",ted
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day.,ted
These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for.,ted
I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address.,ted
But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale.,ted
The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops.,ted
And we need to think about how we can do that effectively.,ted
"So we need to create this future, and we need to start doing it now.",ted
We're also looking at low-cost water-treatment systems.,ted
One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that.,ted
CA: What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale?,ted
It's a difficult thing - it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income.,ted
So you can't use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward.,ted
"So, you know, I do what I can with the students.",ted
We have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward.,ted
"But I think with the vision to do that, we can move forward.",ted
"A public, Dewey long ago observed, is constituted through discussion and debate.",ted
"To put the assumptions very clearly: capitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable, and so has democracy.",ted
"The question now, however, is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation.",ted
But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions.,ted
"And that provides the ground for a type of action, because consensus of each moment allows us to act.",ted
But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems.,ted
"And in terms of experience of capitalism, there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences.",ted
"Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds, timber, that is cut right from under the poorest.",ted
But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in.,ted
"We have three critical terms: economy, civil society and the state.",ted
Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context.,ted
But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning.,ted
Now in order to do this - and this brings this group -,ted
"The least important form of capital, in this project, is financial capital - money.",ted
"Because it lacks the institutional, organizational, managerial forms to turn it into capital.",ted
"The first challenge is to rethink, fundamentally, the issue of the time.",ted
"What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re-engage in a project, that capital formation is rapid?",ted
"The absolute majority of the world's population are below 20, and they are growing larger and faster.",ted
"They need different ways of being approached, different ways of being enfranchised, different ways of being skilled.",ted
"Second is, you're problem solvers, but you're not engaging your global responsibility.",ted
"But if you don't think through the problems of corruption, who will?",ted
"Ashraf Ghani: What scares me most is - is you, lack of your engagement.",ted
"But seriously, the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as, at least, a 10- to 20-year perspective.",ted
"But in my world - you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years, space had expanded.",ted
I rode - traveled - travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took 12.,ted
"But the modality of attention, or what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow.",ted
The sky: every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear.,ted
"Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism - from all sides.",ted
"So, when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan, it's because of that legacy.",ted
"I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here, standing in front of you, speaking.",ted
"I think we can make it, and the reason we can make it is because of the people.",ted
"You see, because, I mean - I give you one statistic.",ted
"And I told them - my people, with the Americans here - separate.",ted
"They see engagement, global engagement, as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people.",ted
And that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table.,ted
"What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future, where her children could really have a different life.",ted
CA: How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade?,ted
Cotton does not compete with opium; a t-shirt does.,ted
"Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit.",ted
"It is important, but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want is global access.",ted
"So I think economically, the critical issue really is to now think through.",ted
And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work.,ted
"The aid system does not have the knowledge, the vision, the ability.",ted
"I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it.",ted
"It depends on what form it comes, what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it.",ted
And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy.,ted
"Unless that kind of compact is entered into, you will not be able to sustain the consensus.",ted
"I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.",ted
We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space.,ted
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization; they need to look forward to breakthroughs.,ted
"We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future.",ted
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened.,ted
There's only a few people that have flown in early 1908.,ted
"In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, thousand of pilots.",ted
The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition.,ted
"And that's why they're so safe, as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.",ted
There's only been two concepts tried - two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.,ted
"Well, what happened when I was a little kid was - some pretty heavy stuff too.",ted
Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars - and this was before Sputnik.,ted
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now.,ted
"We thought there'd be animals there; we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?",ted
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.,ted
"I founded another company in '82, which is my company now.",ted
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.,ted
And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.,ted
"The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet.",ted
"Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.",ted
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56.,ted
"The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander.",ted
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.,ted
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.,ted
"You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.",ted
"But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it.",ted
I put down innovation - I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.,ted
"In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.",ted
"In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station.",ted
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.,ted
"Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?",ted
"The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.",ted
That's - You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.,ted
"It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.",ted
"I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.",ted
"My critics say, Hey, Rutan's just spending a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.",ted
This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun.,ted
"And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, well, wait a minute.",ted
"Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer, but the home computer was for games.",ted
For a whole decade it was for fun - we didn't even know what it was for.,ted
And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.,ted
The military fighters had a - highest-performance military airplane was the SR71.,ted
"It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly, and was taken out of service.",ted
"It went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of service.",ted
"And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, or if you've got a 10-year-old now.",ted
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.,ted
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.,ted
"OK, I look forward to a new capitalist's space race, let's call it.",ted
"You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones.",ted
"Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.",ted
"America - the world saw America as not being the leader in technology, and that was a very strong thing.",ted
"And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever.",ted
"And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.",ted
"Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.",ted
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America - can't do it.,ted
"They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.",ted
"Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.",ted
"I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry.",ted
"And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.",ted
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered.,ted
"OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.",ted
This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020.,ted
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15.,ted
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff - and we've done it for a long time.,ted
"The NACA, before NASA, never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.",ted
"But NASA is developing the space liner, always has, and runs the only space line, OK.",ted
And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it.,ted
"What I want to talk about is, as background, is the idea that cars are art.",ted
Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.,ted
"Automobiles may be what you use, but cars are what we are, in many ways.",ted
Cars are not a suit of clothes; cars are an avatar.,ted
"And if you're full of road rage, you've got a Chevy: Like a Rock, right?",ted
"Many people think, Well, it's computers, and it's done by machines and stuff like that.",ted
"Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.",ted
It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.,ted
"Real quickly - Michelangelo once said he's there to discover the figure within, OK?",ted
"Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality you have to touch about it?",ted
"And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.",ted
"Do this, do this, do this, until this thing comes alive.",ted
And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.,ted
"It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.",ted
"Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.",ted
Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.,ted
We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.,ted
"However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian, instead of this quantum approach.",ted
And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing.,ted
Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.,ted
"And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars, is very applicable.",ted
"You know a car when you've seen it, with soul.",ted
"Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me, are interchangeable.",ted
I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.,ted
"I think this one here, there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know,",ted
It really only gets serious when you look at something like this.,ted
"This is one substitution that I believe all of us, in design management, are guilty of.",ted
"But right now it's in dealing with our own people, our own teams who are doing the creating.",ted
There's good times; there's interesting times; and there's some stress times too.,ted
"You want to do cars, you've got to go outside.",ted
You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.,ted
"That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.",ted
"Now one thing about art is, art is discovery, and art is discovering yourself through your art.",ted
"This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.",ted
We have a shared center; we have a shared focus - that car stays at the middle of all our relationships.,ted
"And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.",ted
I heard today about Joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction.,ted
"They've got that gene infected in them as well, and they want that to live, more than anything else.",ted
We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.,ted
"And so we sent them off with this team name, Deep Blue.",ted
"And we took a team of designers, and we sent them off to America.",ted
"Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.",ted
"Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart, where the customer is, live with them in America.",ted
"They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.",ted
"But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.",ted
"The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub - it's quite fascinating.",ted
"On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this.",ted
So my concept of what a design studio was probably - I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.,ted
"And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.",ted
"The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them, and they put their presentation together.",ted
"Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.",ted
"So I didn't know any of this, and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.",ted
We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers.,ted
"You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.",ted
"After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.",ted
"I screamed at them, I yelled at them, What the hell are you doing?",ted
"And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know, did she fly out with me or something?",ted
"I said, No, and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.",ted
"And I thought about this, and I thought, You know, I'm not showing love here.",ted
"I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.",ted
"I said, Guys, I'm thinking about something here, this isn't right.",ted
I can't have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one.,ted
"Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'",ted
"And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you, was this one here.",ted
I'm also going to steal a little quote out of Little Prince.,ted
"There's a lot to be said about trust and love, if you know that those two words are synonymous for design.",ted
"I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day, and it's stayed that way ever since.",ted
"It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.",ted
"At the break, I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate.",ted
That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months.,ted
We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours.,ted
"But as we look, what's out there, we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet.",ted
"Less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago, and so we decided to do something about it.",ted
"From one site, from one barrel of seawater, we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species.",ted
We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.,ted
And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time.,ted
"Some of these make logical sense, in terms of different temperature gradients.",ted
"Maybe not surprisingly, in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue, the photoreceptors tend to see blue light.",ted
"When there's a lot of chlorophyll around, they see a lot of green light.",ted
"But they vary even more, possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes.",ted
"So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes, components and life on this planet.",ted
"Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome.",ted
I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution.,ted
"Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995, and that from mycoplasma genitalium.",ted
"And we have really nice T-shirts that say, you know, I heart my genitalium.",ted
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code.,ted
"And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.",ted
So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those non-essential genes.,ted
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult.,ted
"This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware, and that's the notions that we have with biology.",ted
"And I think it's important to keep reality in mind, versus what happens with people's imaginations.",ted
"Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today - that genome can be made.",ted
"And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox, but the DNA from this organism is not infective.",ted
"So even if somebody made the smallpox genome, that DNA itself would not cause infections.",ted
"And possibly eukaryotic cells, those that we have, are possible within a decade.",ted
"The key is, how do you put all of the others?",ted
"We start with these fragments, and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome.",ted
"This is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans, that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.",ted
"It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours, after its chromosomes are literally blown apart.",ted
"This organism is ubiquitous on the planet, and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there.",ted
This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation.,ted
"The glass started to burn and crack, while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier.",ted
Here's an actual picture of what happens: the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million rads of radiation.,ted
"After these genomes are synthesized, the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome.",ted
"Also, there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane.",ted
To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach.,ted
We're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.,ted
"Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen, and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process.",ted
The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce.,ted
"Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold.",ted
"I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold.",ted
"It's not enough your software crashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs - it erased my ROMs!",ted
"With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD.",ted
"So, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it.",ted
"And what I've noticed is - first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.",ted
And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration.,ted
"Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen.",ted
"They're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast.",ted
"It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure.",ted
There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use.,ted
"And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will -",ted
"And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use.",ted
"This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS.",ted
And the entire operating system - this is the good part - the entire operating system fit in 211,ted
You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!,ted
I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day.,ted
"And the calls that - you know how they say, Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?",ted
Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD.,ted
"So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable.",ted
"And the technician said, Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?",ted
"She says, All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen.",ted
"And the technician's like, Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?",ted
"She goes, Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'",ted
"Well, if you like that one - how much time have we got?",ted
"He said, The message says, 'Error Type 11.'",ted
"So, we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users.",ted
"But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now?",ted
"In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller.",ted
"So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier, but our fingers are essentially staying the same size.",ted
Software is subject to another primal force: the mandate to release more and more versions.,ted
"I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years.",ted
And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades.,ted
"I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration.",ted
"And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died.",ted
"They don't need the database and the website, but they're like,",ted
"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday.",ted
"So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go?",ted
"You can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.",ted
"But if you're not careful about how you choose, you wind up with this.",ted
You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically.,ted
"Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface, is knowing when to use which one of these features.",ted
"So, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000.",ted
"There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu?",ted
It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices.,ted
"Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design.",ted
Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps.,ted
"And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall.",ted
"If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.",ted
Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.,ted
"From the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type.",ted
So there is a limit that we don't want to cross.,ted
"How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way?",ted
"I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.",ted
"It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan.",ted
"Now, it would be inconsistent to put United States first, but it would be intelligent.",ted
Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer.,ted
"Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document, in page order, on that printer.",ted
So why in God's name do you see this every time you print?,ted
"And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not Print.",ted
"Now, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity.",ted
"Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this.",ted
"So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter.",ted
"Ok, when you want to create a new blank document in Word - it could happen.",ted
I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS.,ted
I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss.,ted
"They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't.",ted

This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance.,ted
"When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer?",ted
"Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around.",ted

Jim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.,ted
There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest - Ground Zero.,ted
Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis.,ted
This was - out of all the tourist sites in New York City -,ted
Tourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened.,ted
"So many, in fact, that seeing has become a bit of a problem.",ted
Tourist: I think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on.,ted
"JA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America.",ted
"Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument, people come here to see what's no longer there.",ted
"Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.",ted
In the face of America's worst destruction people are building again.,ted
"In fact we're finishing a book which is called Pleasure, which is about sensual pleasure in spaces.",ted
But I've got to tell you - it became impossible to do that.,ted
And I found myself the Friday after September 11th - two days afterwards - literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything.,ted
"So we tried to come up with a way, as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team.",ted
KA: Were you conscious of suddenly - as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants - suddenly fulfilling needs?,ted
"Well what I was aware of was, there was this overwhelming need to act now.",ted
And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this.,ted
"There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.",ted
"Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us.",ted
"And that was done, effectively, by October 8 or something?",ted
"We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group.",ted
I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild.,ted
And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.,ted
"It was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group that was not representative of the city.",ted
So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea.,ted
The families - the victims of the families - were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.,ted
"And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there.",ted
And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV.,ted
There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience.,ted
"So seeing this in a very simple, dignified way was a very powerful experience.",ted
And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site.,ted
There was a way - there had to be a way - to get people to move around the site.,ted
"It looks like a fairly simple thing, but this was a half a million dollar project?",ted
"Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen.",ted
"This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this, and they sensed that this needed to happen.",ted
"And there was therefore this ticking clock, because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that.",ted
"His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center, if that helps anyone - volunteered to help.",ted
"And Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country, volunteered to do it at cost.",ted
"So this developer said, You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense.",ted
"And I think this was the 21st, and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th.",ted
"In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.",ted
"And I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need.",ted
We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this.,ted
And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed.,ted
The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding.,ted
"So we didn't know what to do, but we decided to cast a very wide net.",ted
We knew that one way or another this was going to happen.,ted
KA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation.,ted
"It seems to me with this, that it was the opposite of that.",ted
"That this was a place for people to reflect, to remember - a kind of quiet place.",ted
"But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible.",ted
One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable.,ted
"You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here.",ted
"Did that require, as an architect, a new way of thinking about what you were doing?",ted
So the notion of collaboration - I think this reinforces how important that is.,ted
"Which was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people.",ted
"So that, very much, is in the realm of things I've been interested in before.",ted
"KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.",ted
"Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate -",ted
I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan.,ted
"The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings, which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings.",ted
DR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities.,ted
And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day?,ted
"So yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities.",ted
"And in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven.",ted
"Whether it's arts, whether it's housing, whether it's what amount of shopping?",ted
This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help.,ted
One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was.,ted
"We certainly did as much research as we could, and we were conscious of other memorials.",ted
And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do.,ted
The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable.,ted
KA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done.,ted
"As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.",ted
"That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?",ted
"Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.",ted
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community.,ted
"The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation.",ted
"You never know what strikes the fancy of whom, but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.",ted
"And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.",ted
What I don't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied.,ted
"For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns.",ted
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.,ted
"It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.",ted
We've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.,ted
"But during that entire process, more and more people have been born, and more and more people are moving to cities.",ted
China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half.,ted
"And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane, or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.",ted
"The fact is, the last mile is the problem, and half the world now lives in dense cities.",ted
"And people spend, depending on who they are, between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.",ted
"And again, I say that not to attack any industry, I think -",ted
"If - in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles; 1.7 million people used cars.",ted
"We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?",ted
"So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile, and it was dumb luck.",ted
"It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.",ted
"And every one of those industries, by the way - just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.",ted
"In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.",ted
"So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities?",ted
"What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean, environmentally friendly?",ted
Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels - I'm a motor vehicle.,ted
"I took this down to Ground Zero, and knocked my way through crowds for an hour.",ted
"We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter, and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.",ted
Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.,ted
"And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously.",ted
And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.,ted
"One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.",ted
"Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says,",ted
"And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore.",ted
"I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things.",ted
"But she looks up and says this, and it occurs to me,",ted
The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.,ted
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking - three times - a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.,ted
"We could change the way people allocate their resources, the way this planet uses its energy, make it more fun.",ted
And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.,ted
This is a Stirling cycle engine; this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.,ted
"This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.",ted
"But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say, you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.",ted
"That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way.",ted
The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.,ted
"Depending on whose numbers you believe, it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.",ted
"And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it, or watching their kids die.",ted
"And in Africa, cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries.",ted
Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids.,ted
"Well, you know, the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet.",ted
So I've been working with a lot of the big food companies.,ted
The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work - they're going to have an Asian salad.,ted
"At Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods.",ted
"First of all, it's been fantastic being here over these past few days.",ted
"I feel that I've fitted in, in many ways, to some of the things that I've heard.",ted
"The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries, they were able to store a lot of electricity.",ted
"And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer.",ted
We want to know about what other people do - we're interested in it.,ted
"We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese, and we're good at languages.",ted
"Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film, but these beings have voices that mean something.",ted
"During that time, there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work.",ted
"And we use GSI - geographic whatever it is, GSI - to determine the range of the chimps.",ted
"So in many, many ways, we can do things today that we couldn't do when I began in 1960.",ted
"So that we know today, they're capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began.",ted
"She loves her computer - she'll leave her big group, and her running water, and her trees and everything.",ted
"When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.",ted
"We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.",ted
"They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity, so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far.",ted
"Sometimes they hunt - not that often, but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation, and they share the prey.",ted
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors - self as opposed to other.,ted
"They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.",ted
They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well.,ted
"The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land.",ted
They're disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear-cutting.,ted
They're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money.,ted
"Their culture is being destroyed, along with the animals upon whom they depend.",ted
"So, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left.",ted
"We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity, and I've seen it happening with my own eyes.",ted
"And the grim picture in Africa - I love Africa, and what do we see in Africa?",ted
"And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards, and we're destroying the world.",ted
"Do you know, we're bringing little babies into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them?",ted
"And the air is harming them, and the food that's grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them.",ted
And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere.,ted
Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago?,ted
"As I was traveling around the world, you know, I had to leave the forest -",ted
"And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope.",ted
"Well, it doesn't matter what we do; eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.",ted
Everything is hopeless - we're always being told so by the media.,ted
"Shoots seem tiny, but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls.",ted
See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet.,ted
"Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through, and can make this a better world.",ted
And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference.,ted
"So, the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects.",ted
And these are projects to make the world around them a better place.,ted
One project to show care and concern for your own human community.,ted
And the third kind of project: something for the local environment.,ted
It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural.,ted
"It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in.",ted
"We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York.",ted
"Because they're buying into it, and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do.",ted
"It isn't something that their parents tell them, or their teachers tell them.",ted
We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden.,ted
We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories.,ted
"You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me.",ted
"As I travel around the world 300 days a year, everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages.",ted
"Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture.",ted
Hard work and persistence -don't give up - and love and compassion leading to respect for all life.,ted
"Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two.",ted
"Anyway - so basically, Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people's lives.",ted
And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place.,ted
"Firstly, the human brain - I don't need to say anything about that.",ted
"Now that we know what the problems are around the world, human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems.",ted
"We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life.",ted
"And thirdly, the last speaker talked about - or the speaker before last, talked about the indomitable human spirit.",ted
We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible.,ted
"And just after that a woman brought me this little bell, and I want to end on this note.",ted
"She said, If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this.",ted
"So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?",ted
It's in your hands and my hands and those of our children.,ted
It's really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager.,ted
"My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp.",ted
"And she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split.",ted
"And when my mother was two years old, the Hungarian revolution was raging, and they decided to escape Hungary.",ted
"They got on a boat, and yet another divergence - the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia.",ted
"They got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada.",ted
"So, to make a long story short, they came to Canada.",ted
"She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto, and at 44 she died of stomach cancer.",ted
"I found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old.",ted
My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon.,ted
And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called The Hot Zone.,ted
"There was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover, and I just wanted to read it.",ted
"I was 14, and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab.",ted
"But I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway?",ted
"And I got to go talk to one professor, Dr. Jacobs, who accepted me into the lab.",ted
"And from then I wanted to look not at impairment, but at prevention of impairment.",ted
"And being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought,",ted
"And so I thought, Maybe if it can promote cell growth, it can inhibit cell death, too.",ted
"So I presented those results at the International Science Fair, which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life.",ted
"And from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world, I wanted to explore it all.",ted
"I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that.",ted
And this is really what I want to talk to you about today - about cancer.,ted
"At first when I heard of cancer stem cells, I didn't really know how to put the two together.",ted
"Last summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells.",ted
"The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it.",ted
"If you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises.",ted
"If you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs.",ted
"And it was really interesting - there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises.",ted
Because what stem cells are - they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue.,ted
"And the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged, we need to repair the lung.",ted
"But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response, but can't quite control it.",ted
It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated.,ted
It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point.,ted
"We're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix.",ted
"And skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body, or over 50 percent of our body.",ted
"Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer - at least not that I know of.",ted
"If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it, or somehow - you know, it's contained.",ted
"But once it starts moving throughout the body, that's when it becomes deadly.",ted
"So these articles were saying, you know, Skeletal - metastasis to skeletal muscle - is very rare.",ted
And a lot of the replies I got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue.,ted
"But then again, this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely.",ted
"And furthermore, that nervous tissue - brain - gets cancer, and brain cells are also terminally differentiated.",ted
"I guess, my hypotheses that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami.",ted
And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers.,ted
"But I know that in science, once you get the answers, inevitably you're going to have more questions.",ted
So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life.,ted
And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells.,ted
"So first of all I thought, you know, Wouldn't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle?",ted
"Without angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful.",ted
So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer.,ted
It's the one portion of our body - our heart's always beating.,ted
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply?,ted
"It needs to be constantly contracting, so therefore it's almost selfish.",ted
"Therefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue, it can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.",ted
"And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants, and they're the stop and go signals for cancer.",ted
Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules?,ted
"I mean, there are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle.",ted
"And what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells.",ted
"Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells, and this is why it seems as if it is so rare.",ted
It's different when a bacteria comes into the body - that's a foreign object - we want that out.,ted
A tumor - put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells?,ted
"That's a very far-fetched idea, but I really believe that it may be possible.",ted
"These cells are so versatile, these cancer cells are so versatile - we just have to manipulate them in the right way.",ted
"Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments, and I realized that I almost became a scientist.",ted
FG: People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay.,ted
"The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous, Frank Gehry.",ted
"And Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.",ted
"And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs, whatever they were, were very big.",ted
You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent on working for somebody.,ted
A lot of us work for people; we're in the hands of other people.,ted
"And you've achieved that and that makes your win doubly big, triply big.",ted
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.,ted
"Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife.",ted
"I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer, out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.",ted
"Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money, so the stuff was a little more permanent.",ted
"But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long, this guy was telling us the other day.",ted
"When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.",ted
"Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence that it's going to be OK.",ted
And like the playwright said the other day - I could relate to him: you're not sure.,ted
They weren't mistakes; I saw everything that I would have changed and I was embarrassed by it.,ted
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?,ted
"Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me, and I thought he was nuts.",ted
"I didn't think he knew what he was doing, and he pulled it off.",ted
"So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.",ted
"September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero, and I'm totally against that.",ted
"How much further along is it than that, and when will that be finished?",ted
"Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.",ted
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me.,ted
There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients.,ted
"If you think about the world, and even just in this audience, most of us are involved with buildings.",ted
"And so to find one, a guy like that, you hang on to him.",ted
"He's become the head of Art Center, and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.",ted
Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.,ted
"I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it, but it didn't feel good to me.",ted
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building.,ted
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.,ted
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you.,ted
"I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra, who doesn't think architecture is art.",ted
"And I think for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city.",ted
"No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos, right?",ted
"Like the Rockefeller Center model, which is kind of from another era.",ted
"My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building, you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.",ted
"I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.",ted
"If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.",ted
The MIT project - they were interviewing me for MIT and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.,ted
"There wasn't a bloody leak in the place, it was just fantastic.",ted
"And I think that's what I've always been interested in, is that - which is a personal kind of expression.",ted
"Just before going to lunch with the mayor, we went to the harbor commissioner.",ted
"We sat down, and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet.",ted
"And the guy looked at me and said, Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?",ted
"I said to my team, Let's get out of here.",ted
"They just brought us there to hustle this group, you know, to create a project.",ted
"Luckily, I'm old enough that I can complain I can't travel.",ted
"Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it's been very long.",ted
"Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories, only to find out that you're a performance artist.",ted
"I'm also a software engineer, and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer.",ted
I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project.,ted
I did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths.,ted
And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica; we repeated it in England.,ted
And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen.,ted
We used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were.,ted
"He's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound.",ted
"Well, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it.",ted
"And with that, I think I should give up the stage, so, thank you so much.",ted
"But I want to start with my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work.",ted
"What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner.",ted
"And so I want to tell you about that first, and then go on into where I think love is going.",ted
"The first thing that happens is, a person begins to take on what I call, special meaning.",ted
"As a truck driver once said to me, The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne.",ted
"You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.",ted
Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party.,ted
"And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.",ted
"The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out.",ted
"But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them.",ted
"As one Polynesian said, I felt like jumping in the sky.",ted
You feel intense elation when things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly.,ted
"As one businessman in New York said to me, Anything she liked, I liked.",ted
"But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely sexually possessive of them.",ted
The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team.,ted
"The motor in the brain begins to crank, and you want this person.",ted
"Before I put these people in the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions.",ted
It was: What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?,ted
I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation.,ted
So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state.,ted
"In fact, one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine.",ted
"In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low.",ted
"It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.",ted
"And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive.",ted
"But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it.",ted
"They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.",ted
"In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system.",ted
I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow.,ted
And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction.,ted
"W.H. Auden called it an intolerable neural itch, and indeed, that's what it is.",ted
"The second of these three brain systems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love.",ted
And the third brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.,ted
"And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners.",ted
You can feel it when you're just driving along in your car.,ted
"So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends.",ted
I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations.,ted
"For every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend.",ted
"We all know of them, but nevertheless - the Arabs say, The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on.",ted
"And I say back into the job market, because this is not new.",ted
"For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work to gather their vegetables.",ted
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.,ted
"And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men.",ted
"With the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful.",ted
"In short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.",ted
We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal.,ted
I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community.,ted
"I'll say just a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love.",ted
I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike.,ted
"There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common.",ted
"We are - in the words of Ted Hughes, I think that we are like two feet.",ted
And we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain.,ted
I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.,ted
"But even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.",ted
They've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.,ted
"They held that baby in front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.",ted
"In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, To have a great writer is to have another government.",ted
Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women.,ted
"It's one of many, many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market.",ted
"We now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning.",ted
"They tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers.",ted
"In fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world.",ted
"But in fact, women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life.",ted
"I'm always astonished when people come to me and say, Why is it that men are so adulterous?",ted
"And I say, Who do you think these men are sleeping with?",ted
"This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.",ted
"People around the world, in a study of 37 societies, want to be in love with the person that they marry.",ted
"Indeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life.",ted
I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend.,ted
"The first one being women moving into the job market, the second one being the aging world population.",ted
"They're now saying that in America, that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85.",ted
So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age.,ted
"For one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.",ted
"And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.",ted
"So the divorce rate right now is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline.",ted
"Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable.",ted
"These three brain systems - lust, romantic love and attachment - don't always go together.",ted
"With orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin - those are associated with attachment.",ted
This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them.,ted
"But these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment, aren't always connected to each other.",ted
"In short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time.",ted
It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do.,ted
"And I think, however, we can make good relationships with each other.",ted
"I want to conclude with a worry, and with a wonderful story.",ted
Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States.,ted
"I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants, SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants - since she was 13.",ted
"I've got nothing against people who take them short term, when they're going through something horrible.",ted
But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term.,ted
"And indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin.",ted
"And by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit.",ted
"Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive.",ted
"And when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment.",ted
"And when you tamper with one brain system, you're going to tamper with another.",ted
I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place.,ted
I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years.,ted
I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike.,ted
It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another.,ted
That's my current project; it will be my next book.,ted
There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another.,ted
"And I also think that you gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.",ted
"I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too, the magic of it.",ted
It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one - probably a true story.,ted
"And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student, and she was not in love with him.",ted
And he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him.,ted
"He figured that this would drive up the dopamine, and she'd fall in love with him.",ted
So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time.,ted
They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called this mortal coil.,ted
It is a thrill to be here at a conference that's devoted to Inspired by Nature - you can imagine.,ted
"Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters, which is the Western Grebe.",ted
You haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance.,ted
"And so we were rowing, and one of these Western Grebes came along.",ted
"And so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly.",ted
"It would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start.",ted
Or - and this is the fun part for me - we want you to take us out into the natural world.,ted
"We'll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us.",ted
So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater.,ted
"And some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there.",ted
"What they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry.",ted
"And we said, well, that's not exactly being inspired by nature.",ted
"This is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it.",ted
"Give me a design challenge, sustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable.",ted
"And they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes.",ted
"And then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins, or we have to dig them up.",ted
So if we had some way to stop this scaling - and so I picked up some shells on the beach.,ted
"And I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate.",ted
"So the same sort of a process, without the proteins, is happening on the inside of their pipes.",ted
This is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration.,ted
"From then on, you could not get these engineers back in the boat.",ted
"The first day they would take a hike, and it was, click, click, click, click.",ted
They would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel.,ted
Learning about the natural world is one thing; learning from the natural world - that's the switch.,ted
The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context.,ted
And the context is the Earth - the same context that we're trying to solve our problems in.,ted
"So there's computers that protect themselves, like an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation and biological development.",ted
"And we're learning from neural nets, genetic algorithms, evolutionary computing.",ted
"But what's interesting to me is that we haven't looked at this, as much.",ted
So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success.,ted
"So what can we learn about making - not just computers, but everything?",ted
"The plane you came in, cars, the seats that you're sitting on.",ted
"How do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world?",ted
"More importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years?",ted
And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has.,ted
"It's called heat, beat and treat - that's what material scientists call it.",ted
"And it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product.",ted
You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures; you use chemicals.,ted
And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily.,ted
"By adding information to matter, it gives it a function that's different than without that structure.",ted
Because life doesn't really deal in things; there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems.,ted
"And at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are.",ted
"I'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly.",ted
Back to that shell: the shell is a self-assembling material.,ted
On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater.,ted
"It's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough.",ted
"But what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns, it happens in seawater.",ted
"It happens near, in and near, the organism's body.",ted
A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process.,ted
Here's an interesting one for the IT world: bio-silicon.,ted
It's one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of.,ted
"And there's many of them, all over its entire body.",ted
"What's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles.",ted
"Plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose, right, out of CO2.",ted
"There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU.",ted
"In our fuel cells, we do it with platinum; life does it with a very, very common iron.",ted
And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase.,ted
That's very exciting for fuel cells - to be able to do that without platinum.,ted
We've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them.,ted
"Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings, if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing.",ted
"Light comes through, it bounces back off the layers; it's called thin-film interference.",ted
Imagine being able to self-assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color.,ted
"That's a ball of water, and those are dirt particles.",ted
And that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf.,ted
"There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics -",ted
"Water is going to be our big, grand challenge: quenching thirst.",ted
The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog.,ted
"The one on the right is a pill bug - pulls water out of air, does not drink fresh water.",ted
"What if we were to say, no more hard rock mining?",ted
"What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams, small amounts of metals in water?",ted
That's what microbes do; they chelate metals out of water.,ted
This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider.,ted
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book.,ted
"It's not easy, because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table.",ted
"Timed degradation: packaging that is good until you don't want it to be good anymore, and dissolves on cue.",ted
There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients.,ted
And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken; what's called the cold chain gets broken.,ted
And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring.,ted
"Luckily, there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas.",ted
"Chris Anderson: Talk about foreplay, I - we need to get to 12, but really quickly.",ted
"Just like, you know, like the 10-second version of 10, 11 and 12.",ted
"There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer, and yet they don't collide with one another.",ted
There's a person at Newcastle who has figured out that it's a very large neuron.,ted
And she's actually figuring out how to make a collision-avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust.,ted
Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life.,ted
"In ensemble, that's what whole ecosystems do: they create more and more opportunities for life.",ted
"I mean, it looks simple because the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out.",ted
And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs.,ted
"We have to find a way to meet our needs, while making of this place an Eden.",ted
"I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life.",ted
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.,ted
This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.,ted
It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.,ted
I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.,ted
He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.,ted
So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about.,ted
Danny Hillis actually has an update on that - he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.,ted
"Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.",ted
"And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.",ted
The question that I came up with was this question: what does technology want?,ted
"And by that, I don't mean, does it want chocolate or vanilla?",ted
"By what it wants, I mean, what are its inherent trends and biases?",ted
"One way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.",ted
"So I'm attempting to say, if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?",ted
"And I think once we ask that question we have to go back, actually, to life.",ted
"So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.",ted
"And like you heard from the previous speakers, we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.",ted
Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.,ted
Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth.,ted
This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.,ted
I can't think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.,ted
It's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.,ted
"So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth.",ted
"You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.",ted
But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.,ted
They've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here.,ted
"And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say, what does evolution want?",ted
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we don't find life.,ted
More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life.,ted
We see the movement from a general-purpose cell to the more specific and specialized.,ted
"And actually, we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.",ted
One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability.,ted
And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.,ted
Like those chloroplast cells - they're completely surrounded by other life.,ted
"Now, I took that and said, OK, what are the long-term trends in technology?",ted
"And so, remarkably, I discovered that there's also a drift toward specialization.",ted
"That we see there's a general hammer, and hammers become more and more specific over time.",ted
"And he was the King of England, and that was the entire wealth of England at the time.",ted
So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.,ted
This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out and he sees machines making machines.,ted
"Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.",ted
"Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non-technology, or even life.",ted
"And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche.",ted
So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution.,ted
"The same drives that we see towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization, towards complexity.",ted
"I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.",ted
That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.,ted
"And so it would be sort of approximately up there, coming out of the animal kingdom.",ted
"And if we were to do that, we would find out - we could actually approach technology in this way.",ted
He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium.,ted
He has one of the world's largest collections - about 500 of them.,ted
"When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.",ted
"And it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die.",ted
"In fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.",ted
And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile.,ted
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.,ted
I want to know how many of these things are still in production.,ted
"And in fact, what's important is that this information actually never died out.",ted
"And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.",ted
"Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard.",ted
"And it turns out that the time, the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited, is decreasing over time.",ted
"And that basically, you can delay technology, but you can't kill it.",ted
"So this makes sense, because in a certain sense what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.",ted
"So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically, the evolution of evolvability.",ted
And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.,ted
"And then what we see in the singularity, that prophesized by Kurzweil and others - his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.",ted
"A finite game is play to win, and an infinite game is played to keep playing.",ted
"And at the Big Bang, what it expanded was the potential for difference.",ted
"That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.",ted
"And so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.",ted
And that's why we continue to grab technology - because we want those things.,ted
"And each time we make a new opportunity place, we're allowing a platform to make new ones.",ted
Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented - what a loss to society there would be.,ted
Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints.,ted
"Somewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented.",ted
We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference.,ted
I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.,ted
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies.,ted
Maybe in some ways the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.,ted
All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology.,ted
It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.,ted
"And it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.",ted
And your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is.,ted
And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game.,ted
"And it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.",ted
"And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard, and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains, New York.",ted
"Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer, and that's what Howard thought.",ted
"Because Pepsi told him, We're working with a band between eight and 12 percent.",ted
Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough; anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet.,ted
We want to know: what's the sweet spot between 8 and 12?,ted
"Now, if I gave you this problem to do, you would all say, it's very simple.",ted
"They think, Well, you know, figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy.",ted
"You know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way.",ted
"And this was not good enough for him, and this question bedeviled him for years.",ted
"And he would think it through and say, What was wrong?",ted
Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?,ted
"And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him.",ted
"And that is, that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data, they were asking the wrong question.",ted
"They were looking for the perfect Pepsi, and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis.",ted
This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science.,ted
"And people would look at him blankly and say, What are you talking about?",ted
"Howard loves the Yiddish expression To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish.",ted
"Vlasic Pickles came to him, and they said, Doctor Moskowitz, we want to make the perfect pickle.",ted
"And he said, There is no perfect pickle; there are only perfect pickles.",ted
"In fact, Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation.",ted
"But it was, technically speaking - this is an aside - Prego is a better tomato sauce than RagÐâ.",ted
"In fact, they would do the famous bowl test back in the 70s with RagÐâ and Prego.",ted
"You'd have a plate of spaghetti, and you would pour it on, right?",ted
"And the RagÐâ would all go to the bottom, and the Prego would sit on top.",ted
"So they came to Howard, and they said, fix us.",ted
"And Howard looked at their product line, and he said, what you have is a dead tomato society.",ted
"And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen, and he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce.",ted
"Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce, he varied spaghetti sauce.",ted
"And then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces, and he went on the road.",ted
"He went to New York, to Chicago, he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.",ted
"And he sat them down for two hours, and over the course of that two hours, he gave them ten bowls.",ted
"Ten small bowls of pasta, with a different spaghetti sauce on each one.",ted
"And over the next 10 years, they made 600 million dollars off their line of extra-chunky sauces.",ted
"Everyone else in the industry looked at what Howard had done, and they said, Oh my god!",ted
"And today, if you go to a really good supermarket, do you know how many RagÐâs there are?",ted
What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy.,ted
"Even though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did.",ted
"As Howard loves to say, The mind knows not what the tongue wants.",ted
"Every one of you would say, I want a dark, rich, hearty roast.",ted
"What percentage of you actually like a dark, rich, hearty roast?",ted
"According to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you.",ted
"But you will never, ever say to someone who asks you what you want that I want a milky, weak coffee.",ted
"In particular, they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon.",ted
"Much more volatile brown mustard seed, some white wine, a nose hit, much more delicate aromatics.",ted
"With the guy in the Rolls Royce, eating the Grey Poupon.",ted
"Another pulls up, and says, Do you have any Grey Poupon?",ted
"And the whole thing, after they did that, Grey Poupon takes off!",ted
"Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane.",ted
There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people.,ted
"And for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks.",ted
"Third thing that Howard did, and perhaps the most important, is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish.",ted
Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi.,ted
This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant.,ted
"Which were thin, you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta.",ted
"In other words, people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals.",ted
"Psychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave.",ted
"What is the great revolution in science of the last 10, 15 years?",ted
It is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability.,ted
"What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce.",ted
"And for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks.",ted
"I'll give you one last illustration of variability, and that is -",ted
"Being on the same stage as Al Gore, who was the first person I ever voted for.",ted
"And - So I was getting pretty nervous and, you know,",ted
"I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage, and that's more nerve-racking.",ted
"So, besides this freakish thing, this is my science slide.",ted
"This is math, and this is science, this is genetics.",ted
"This is my grandmother, and this is where I get this mouth.",ted
"So - I'm a blogger, which, probably, to a lot of you, means different things.",ted
"Kryptonite had to adjust the lock, and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns.",ted
"But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media, and these are great examples.",ted
"These people are reaching thousands, if not millions, of readers, and that's incredibly important.",ted
"During the hurricane, you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog, updating it frequently.",ted
"You have my friend, who has a blog on PVRs, personal recorders.",ted
"He makes enough money just by running ads, to support his family up in Oregon.",ted
"That's all he does now, and this is something that blogs have made possible.",ted
It's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it.,ted
"Children with cleft palates get it, and they document their story.",ted
"So, the short story about my blog: it started in 2001, I was 23.",ted
"I wasn't happy with my job, because I was a designer, but I wasn't being really stimulated.",ted
"I didn't have any use for it, but I missed writing.",ted
"And when I started my blog, it was really this one goal -",ted
"I said, I'm going to win an award, because I had never won an award in my entire life.",ted
"And I said, I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award.",ted
"I reached all of these people, and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day.",ted
"I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo - a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money.",ted
And I don't play instruments; I don't know anything about music.,ted
"And I said to my husband, Ben, can I buy a banjo?",ted
"And my husband - this is my husband, who is very hot - he won an award for being hot.",ted
"And those people who know me understood my joke - this is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people.",ted
And if he knew I was showing this right now - I put this in today - he would kill me.,ted
"I've been with him since I was 17, we've never had a separate bank account.",ted
And I realized: I don't want to reach these people.,ted
"I wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today.",ted
"I'm going to get choked up, because this is my first pet, and she passed away two years ago.",ted
"You know, you read the blogs about politics or about media, and gossip and all these things.",ted
"These are out there, but it's more of the personal that interests me, and this is who I am.",ted
"You see Norman Rockwell, and you have art critics say, Norman Rockwell is not art.",ted
"Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms, and this is not something to be considered high art.",ted
And I think this is one of the most important things to us as humans.,ted
These are the blogs that interest me: the people that just tell stories.,ted
"One story is about this baby, and his name is Odin.",ted
"And he was writing his blog one day, and his wife gave birth to her baby at 25 weeks.",ted
"One day, it was normal; the next day, it was hell.",ted
"That's not a huge amount of people reading, but 28 people matter.",ted
"We talked about the WELL, and about all these sorts of things throughout our online history.",ted
"But I think blogs are basically just an evolution, and that's where we are today.",ted
"You have your Google search, where you say, What is Mena Trott?",ted
"But to see something like the $100 computer is amazing, because blogging software is simple.",ted
"We have a successful company because of timing, and because of perseverance, but it's simple stuff -",ted
So - the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important.,ted
But this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my direct line.,ted
"I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before, and this one, I grew up with, looking at constantly.",ted
"I have this record, this 1910 census, of another Grabowski -",ted
"This is all I have, a couple of facts about somebody.",ted
"And it's pretty sad, because I only go back five generations, and that's it.",ted
"And he's basically taking a picture of his family every day for the past, what is '76?",ted
"There was a joke, originally, about my graph that I left out, which is: You see all this math?",ted
"I'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100, because that's my skill set.",ted
"So you have these people aging, and now this is them today, or last year.",ted
"And that's a powerful thing to have, to be able to track this.",ted
"I am a blogger - that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time every day.",ted
I take a picture of myself - I've been doing this since last year - every single day.,ted
"And, you know, it's the same picture; it's basically the same person.",ted
"About four people probably read it, and they tell me, You haven't updated.",ted
I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated.,ted
It's this visual cue that is so important to what we do.,ted
"I put the bad pictures up too, because there are bad pictures.",ted
And I remember instantly: I am in Germany in this - I had to go for a one-day trip.,ted
"I was sick, and I was in a hotel room, and I wanted not to be there.",ted
"And so you see these things, it's not just always smiling.",ted
"I'll probably get choked up, because I tend to when I talk about this.",ted
"So, this woman, her name was Emma, and she was a blogger on our service, TypePad.",ted
"And she was writing one day, and then she disappeared for a little bit.",ted
"And her sister came on, and she said that Emma had passed away.",ted
"And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship, and flattening this sort of world.",ted
"But the big thing that really influenced us was, her sister wrote to me, and she said -",ted
"I'm Michael Shermer, director of the Skeptics Society, publisher of Skeptic magazine.",ted
"And unless you've been on Mars recently, you know there's a lot of that out there.",ted
"Some people call us debunkers, which is kind of a negative term.",ted
"But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk.",ted
"I brought this with me, this was given to us by NBC Dateline to test.",ted
This was being sold to high-school administrators for $900 apiece.,ted
It's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it.,ted
"You could dowse for all sorts of things, but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers.",ted
"So the way it works is you go down the hallway, and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker,",ted
"Well, this is science, so we'll do a controlled experiment.",ted
"Sir, do you want to empty your pockets, please, sir?",ted
"So the question was, can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers?",ted
"And the answer is, if you open enough of them, yes.",ted
"But in science, we have to keep track of the misses, not just the hits.",ted
"We had two opaque boxes: one with government-approved THC marijuana, and one with nothing.",ted
And it got it 50 percent of the time - which is exactly what you'd expect with a coin-flip model.,ted
So that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do.,ted
"With science, don't think of skepticism as a thing, or science as a thing.",ted
It's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena.,ted
Or is it more likely that a reader of Skeptic did this with Photoshop?,ted
"Before we say something is out of this world, we should first make sure that it's not in this world.",ted
The same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon.,ted
"For those of you in the back, it says here: Then a miracle occurs.",ted
I think you need to be more explicit here in step two.,ted
"You can say a miracle occurs, it's just that it doesn't explain anything or offer anything.",ted
"For intelligent design creationists, it's the end of the chain.",ted
"So again, we can ask this: what's more likely?",ted
"Are UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual cognitive mistakes, or even fakes?",ted
"This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena, California, looking down over Pasadena.",ted
"And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap, it's because it is.",ted
"You don't even need Photoshop or high-tech equipment, you don't need computers.",ted
You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go.,ted
"On a more serious note, in all of science we're looking for a balance between data and theory.",ted
"In the case of Galileo, he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn.",ted
"Second of all, his data was grainy and fuzzy, and he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at.",ted
So he wrote that he had seen - I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies.,ted
"So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data, you can't have a good theory.",ted
This is Christiaan Huygens's book that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn.,ted
"And we see the angles of the rings at different angles, there.",ted
The problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive biases.,ted
"And of course, happy faces, faces of all kinds are easy to see.",ted
"If astronomers were frogs, perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.",ted
Here's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo.,ted
"It has that sort of puckered lips, 1940s-era look.",ted
"The faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches, and so on.",ted
"All these candles, thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this.",ted
"So we walked around the backside, to see what was going on.",ted
"It turns out wherever there's a sprinkler head and a palm tree, you get the effect.",ted
"Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside, which they started to wipe off.",ted
"So is it really a miracle of Mary, or is it a miracle of Marge?",ted
"And now I'm going to finish up with another example of this, with auditory illusions.",ted
"There's this film, White Noise, with Michael Keaton, about the dead talking back to us.",ted
"By the way, the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal.",ted
"In this case, supposedly, these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena.",ted
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now.,ted
"All right, here it is backwards, and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there.",ted
You can't miss it when I tell you what's there.,ted
"I'm going to just end with a positive, nice little story.",ted
"One of the top popular singers in England today, Katie Melua.",ted
"It was in the top five in 2005, called, Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing.",ted
"In America it'd be, We're 6,000 light years from the edge.",ted
"And so he wrote an op-ed piece in The Guardian about Katie's song, in which he said,",ted
"You know, it's 13.7 billion light years, and it's not a guess.",ted
"So we can say, although not absolutely true, it's pretty close to being true.",ted
We are 13.7 billion light years from the edge of the observable universe.,ted
"And with the available information, I predict that I will always be with you.",ted
"One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates, and taken in the bushes -",ted
I was stripped; I was attacked; I was abused; and this came out of the blue.,ted
"Now, the reason I say that, because, afterwards, I was thinking -",ted
"And we campaign with activist groups and help them tell their story and,",ted
"A soldier walked onto the road, asking where we'd been.",ted
The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn.,ted
And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also.,ted
The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession.,ted
"No, not at all, no problem, take your time.",ted
"But this, surely, whoever that man is, whatever he's done, this is cruel and unusual punishment.",ted
All the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with WITNESS.,ted
"OK, so these are LP records and they've been replaced, right?",ted
"They've been swept away over the last two decades by these types of world-flattening digitization technologies, right?",ted
And I think it was best witnessed when Thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today.,ted
What I mean by that is that anyone in the world is free and allowed to create new music and musical ideas.,ted
"Anyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical ideas, use them in innovative ways.",ted
"In particular, textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school.",ted
"OK, does anybody realize there's a crisis in our schools, around the world?",ted
The first thing I'd like you to do is a little thought experiment.,ted
"OK, everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages.",ted
"So, liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them and then storing them in a vast, interconnected, global repository.",ted
Think of it as a massive iTunes for book-type content.,ted
"Instead of editions of a book coming out every two years, imagine them coming out every 25 seconds.",ted
"So, imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this.",ted
We're working on the open-source tools and the content.,ted
"So, that's sort of to put it in perspective here.",ted
What are some of the people that are using these kind of tools?,ted
And not only that - it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions.,ted
"And so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open, free content.",ted
A team of volunteers at the University of Texas at El Paso - graduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas.,ted
"We've been working with Teachers Without Borders, who are very interested in mixing our materials.",ted
"TWB is currently in Iraq, training 20,000 teachers supported by USAID.",ted
"OK, other organizations we've been working with, UC Merced - people know about UC Merced.",ted
"It's a new university in California, in the Central Valley, working very closely with community colleges.",ted
They're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system.,ted
And they're also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open-source.,ted
We're going to be providing content to them in a whole range of different languages.,ted
And we've also been working with a number of other organizations.,ted
"OK, burn - I think this is, sort of, quite interesting.",ted
Burn is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation of one of these courses.,ted
Just to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook.,ted
Because it's published on demand and it's developed from this repository of open materials.,ted
"If this book were to be published by a regular publisher, it would cost at least 122 dollars.",ted
And I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing.,ted
"We're not talking about the Harry Potter end, right at the left side.",ted
"Books that might sell 100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year.",ted
"There's tons of technology, and the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about is XML.",ted
And what you can really think of XML in this case is it's the packaging that we're putting around these pages.,ted
"Well, what the XML is going to do is it's going to turn those pages into Lego blocks.",ted
"It lets you reuse the same materials in multiple different ways, and surprising new ways.",ted
"It lets you interconnect ideas, indicating how fields relate to each other.",ted
We came up with this six-and-a-half years ago because I teach the stuff in the red box.,ted
"And my day job, as Chris said - I'm an electrical engineering professor.",ted
We needed a community to do it and we needed new tools to be able to interconnect these ideas.,ted
"The same type of mark-up, like MathML, for chemistry.",ted
Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed.,ted
"Imagine Music XML that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music, play with it, understand it.",ted
"It's no wonder that everybody's getting into it, right?",ted
"OK, the second big enabler, and this is where I told a big lie.",ted
"We can share and rip, mix and burn, but in fact, that's all illegal.",ted
"And we would be accused of piracy for doing that, because this music has been propertized.",ted
"So, really, the key thing here is we can't let this happen.",ted
"So, what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning.",ted
And what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe and makes it easily understandable.,ted
"At the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions and in lots of other projects, you can find their logo.",ted
"Because in academic publishing and much of educational publishing, it's really this idea of sharing knowledge and making impact.",ted
"And Creative Commons is taking off - over 43 million things out there, licensed with a Creative Commons license.",ted
"OK, I'd like to conclude with just the last few points.",ted
"We get over 500,000 unique visitors per month, just to our particular site.",ted
"MIT OpenCourseWare, which is another large open-content site, gets a similar number of hits.",ted
"And the first thing that people are probably thinking is quality control, right?",ted
Because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons.,ted
"Because Chris and his team have ensured that things are very, very high quality, right?",ted
And so we need to be able to do the same thing.,ted
So I'd just like to end by saying: you can really view this as a call to action.,ted
"If I controlled the Internet, you could auction your broken heart on eBay.",ted
"If I were in charge of the Internet, you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings.",ted
"Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan, but I still stretch miles in all directions.",ted
"If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com would be one big website.",ted
"Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people.",ted
They would not email you back - but you'd get an automated reply.,ted
Their name in your inbox - it's all you wanted anyway.,ted
Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy.,ted
Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions.,ted
"So if I were emperor of the Internet, I guess I'd still be mortal, huh?",ted
We can make You've got Hallelujah the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on.,ted
"I only know nine Lovegroves, two of which are my parents.",ted
"So there's a terribly weird freaky side to me, which I'm fighting with all the time.",ted
"So to try and get through today, I've kind of disciplined myself with an 18-minute talk.",ted
"I thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough, that would guide me through the 18 minutes.",ted
I am known as Captain Organic and that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position.,ted
I'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design.,ted
"My world is the world of people like Amory Lovins, Janine Benyus, James Watson.",ted
"I could have been, perhaps, but I work in this world where I trust my instincts.",ted
So I am a 21st-century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with.,ted
"Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, 500 years ago, before photography.",ted
"It shows how observation, curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art.",ted
People like Leonardo - there have not been many - had this amazingly instinctive curiosity.,ted
"Here you see the machining, the milling of a block of acrylic.",ted
"At that point, I don't know if that's possible at all.",ted
"It's a seductor, but I just feel in my bones that that's possible.",ted
These are the invisible things that you never see in your life.,ted
"When I do make some money, I'll have one machined for myself.",ted
"When they sent it to me, I thought I'd failed.",ted
"It's an icon of water itself, and it elevates people's perception of contemporary design.",ted
"Each bottle is different, meaning the water level will give you a different shape.",ted
"Biopolymers, these new ideas for materials, will come into play in probably a decade.",ted
"I have this special interest in things like this, which blow my mind.",ted
"When I look at these things, they look pretty normal to me.",ted
"How the hell do I do that, when you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve?",ted
I'm just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates.,ted
How that flows through me and how that comes out is what I'm trying to understand.,ted
It's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure.,ted
My office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab.,ted
"A meringue is made exactly the same way, in my estimation, as a bone.",ted
"These interrelated forms, they do inspire everything I do, although I might end up making something incredibly simple.",ted
This is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium.,ted
Any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object.,ted
It went into Time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century.,ted
"For somebody growing up in Wales in a little village, that's enough.",ted
"It shows how you make one holistic form, like the car industry, and then you break up what you need.",ted
"It's an absolutely fat-free design, and when you look at it, you see human beings.",ted
"When that moves into polymers, you can change the elasticity, the fluidity of the form.",ted
"This is an idea for a gas-injected, one-piece polymer chair.",ted
Observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day.,ted
"When you see a Henry Moore, still, your hair stands up.",ted
"If he was a car designer, phew, we'd all be driving one.",ted
"When I look into these data images, I see new things.",ted
This is a new chair which should come on the market in September.,ted
It's great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming.,ted
I'm looking at single-surface structures and how they stretch and flow.,ted
"It's based on furniture typologies, but that's not the end motivation.",ted
"It's grown in my mind, and then it's grown in terms of the whole process that I go through.",ted
"This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry, who build parts for Bentleys and so on.",ted
It's being built as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York.,ted
"When I see these animations, oh Jesus, I'm blown away.",ted
So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio.,ted
This kind of effervescent - fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas.,ted
"I said, You don't copy Apple, that's for sure.",ted
"You know, I mean - I'm delivering; they're not taking.",ted
"I've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years, sitting on a hot bed.",ted
"It's got a vacuum-formed, carbon-nylon pan.",ted
There's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels; they're fitted like Formula 1.,ted
"It presents the solar panel to the sun, and at night, it's a street lamp.",ted
"That's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first, and do the car second.",ted
"I can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages, floating around on the ground, driven by AI.",ted
"When I showed this in South Africa, everybody afterwards was going, Hey, car on a stick.",ted
"If you put it next to contemporary architecture, it feels totally natural to me.",ted
"It's a little bit of a dedication to James, James Watson.",ted
"Took about two years, because I'm looking for fat-free design.",ted
You wouldn't want to have a fear of heights coming down it.,ted
"It's in Notting Hill, next to all the crap - the prostitutes and all that stuff.",ted
"If anybody's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me, I'll put it in the studio.",ted
So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video.,ted
It's a new bio-polycarbonate chair I'm doing in Italy.,ted
"As China buys all these crappy cars, we should be riding things like this.",ted
"Like I say, it's a cross between Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory.",ted
"I mean, the rare times when I'm there, I do enjoy it.",ted
I'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers - wankers.,ted
That thing on the top is the world's first solar-powered garden lamp - the first produced.,ted
Giles Revell should be talking here today - amazing photography of things you can't see.,ted
There's a little leaf chair - that golden looking thing is called Leaf.,ted
"On the wall is my book called Supernatural, which allows me to remember what I've done, because I forget.",ted
"There's an aerated brick I did in Limoges last year, in Concepts for New Ceramics in Architecture.",ted
"Gernot Oberfell, working at three o'clock in the morning - and I don't pay overtime.",ted
"Overtime is the passion of design, so join the club or don't.",ted
"Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden, then I'm in Beijing on Friday.",ted
"And when I see Ed's photographs, I think, why the hell am I going to China?",ted
So there's a new X-light system I'm doing in Japan.,ted
"It sounds like some quiz show or something, doesn't it?",ted
"Before I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread, and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.",ted
I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do.,ted
That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion.,ted
"That people who can spread ideas, regardless of what those ideas are, win.",ted
At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV.,ted
TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way.,ted
"The way the TV-industrial complex works, is you buy some ads, interrupt some people, that gets you distribution.",ted
"And it goes around and around and around, the same way that the military-industrial complex worked a long time ago.",ted
"If we did that then everyone would pay attention, and we would win.",ted
"Well, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours.",ted
"And the thing that's happened is, they canceled the TV-industrial complex.",ted
But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child.,ted
I go to the deli; I'm sick; I need to buy some medicine.,ted
The brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year.,ted
And I ignored every message because I don't have a pain reliever problem.,ted
I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have.,ted
"And I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem, because I don't care.",ted
"Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago, with just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek.",ted
It came out four days ago - I circled the important parts so you can see them here.,ted
"Now, this is Copernicus, and he was right, when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea.",ted
I don't want to get email from anybody; I want to get memail.,ted
Consumers don't care about you at all; they just don't care.,ted
"Part of the reason is - they've got way more choices than they used to, and way less time.",ted
But if the cow was purple - isn't that a great special effect?,ted
"If the cow was purple, you'd notice it for a while.",ted
"I mean, if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those, too.",ted
"Every week, the number one best-selling DVD in America changes.",ted
But the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out.,ted
The only thing they have in common is that they're different.,ted
"We're now in the fashion business, no matter what we do for a living, we're in the fashion business.",ted
And people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business - they're used to it.,ted
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way.,ted
"How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads, or insisting on meetings with people.",ted
"But it's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread, and which ones don't.",ted
They sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair.,ted
"This guy, Lionel PoilÐÑne, the most famous baker in the world -",ted
"Last year, he sold 10 million dollars' worth of French bread.",ted
"Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned, by one baker at a time, in a wood-fired oven.",ted
"And when Lionel started his bakery, the French pooh-pooh-ed it.",ted
"Now he's in London, and he ships by FedEx all around the world.",ted
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people.,ted
Smooth out the edges; go for the center; that's the big market.,ted
"They would ignore the geeks, and God forbid, the laggards.",ted
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you.,ted
"And when you talk to them, they'll listen, because they like listening - it's about them.",ted
"And if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve, and it'll spread.",ted
They have something I call otaku - it's a great Japanese word.,ted
"Instead, you have to find a group that really, desperately cares about what it is you have to say.",ted
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends.,ted
"There's a hot sauce otaku, but there's no mustard otaku.",ted
"That's why there's lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces, and not so many kinds of mustard.",ted
"This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars, but it sleeps for 12 minutes.",ted
"They want to talk to the people who do, and maybe it'll spread.",ted
"You can't get in, the car's got bulletproof glass, because it'll blow out the windshield otherwise.",ted
"It's really simple - you sell to the people who are listening, and just maybe, those people tell their friends.",ted
"Those people who buy them have the otaku, and then they tell their friends, and it spreads and it spreads.",ted
"This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company, making them a fortune.",ted
"It costs 35 percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about, because it's remarkable.",ted
They didn't just slap a new ad on the product; they changed what it meant to build a paint product.,ted
"They got this way by being remarkable, sometimes a little too remarkable.",ted
"And this picture frame has a cord going out the back, and you plug it into the wall.",ted
"My father has this on his desk, and he sees his grandchildren everyday, changing constantly.",ted
And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk.,ted
After you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem.,ted
What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them.,ted
The first one is: Design is free when you get to scale.,ted
The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people.,ted
"The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes, be remarkable.",ted
And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do.,ted
"If it's very good, it's not going to work, because no one's going to notice it.",ted
Silk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section.,ted
"Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk - not milk.",ted
"For the people who were there and looking at that section, it was remarkable.",ted
They didn't triple their sales with advertising; they tripled it by doing something remarkable.,ted
"A record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD, this remarkable new format -",ted
So what you need to do is figure out who does care.,ted
"As you can see, if that's nowhere, it's in the middle of it.",ted
And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake.,ted
"So the founding fathers said, We've got some money to spend.",ted
"And like most committees, they were going to build something pretty safe.",ted
"I don't know about you, but if they build it, that's where I'm going to go.",ted
"You'll be happy to know that I'll be talking not about my own tragedy, but other people's tragedy.",ted
"There was money, there was drugs, guns, women, you know, you name it - jewelry,",ted
And that's what I'd like to convince you of today.,ted
"First, I want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence on inner-city gangs.",ted
"So let me start by talking about crack cocaine, and how it transformed the gang.",ted
"Now, you had a lot of power, and you got to beat people up -",ted
"You couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang, because the people in the gang didn't have any money.",ted
"Turns out, petty crime's a terrible way to make a living.",ted
"As a result, as a gang leader, you had, you know, power -",ted
There were limits to how powerful and important you could be if you had to live at home with your mother.,ted
"And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell, crack cocaine was the extra-chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city.",ted
"And for the worse - not for the better, but for the worse.",ted
Not really me - I'm really a bit player in all this.,ted
"My co-author, Sudhir Venkatesh, is the main character.",ted
"Now, the three months before he came to Chicago, he had spent following the Grateful Dead.",ted
He's a South Asian - very dark-skinned South Asian.,ted
"Big man, and he had hair, in his words, down to his ass.",ted
You don't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner.,ted
"The survey was not, in the end, going to be what got Sudhir off the hook.",ted
"There was a lot of gunfire, there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members.",ted
"So Sudhir went home, took a shower, took a nap.",ted
"But ultimately, the story has a happy ending for Sudhir, who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country.",ted
It was one of the most unequal co-authoring relationships ever -,ted
"Well, let me say one thing: We really got access to everybody in the gang.",ted
"We got an inside look at the gang, from the very bottom up to the very top.",ted
So here's what the org chart of the gang looks like.,ted
"It's amazing, but the top level of the gang, they actually call themselves the Board of Directors.",ted
But the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees.,ted
They get the exclusive property rights to control the drug-selling.,ted
"They get the name of the gang behind them, for merchandising and marketing.",ted
"These are the teenagers, typically, who'd be standing out on the street corner, selling the drugs.",ted
"In fact, in these neighborhoods, they'd be the same people.",ted
The hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $3.50 an hour.,ted
It's easy to see by the patterns of consumption they have.,ted
"There was very little money in the gang, especially at the bottom.",ted
"If you managed to rise to the very top, 200,000 or 400,000 dollars a year is what you'd hope to make.",ted
"They weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways, because there were no legitimate channels out.",ted
"And it actually was the right choice, probably, to try to make it out this way.",ted
"You look at this, the relationship to McDonald's breaks down here.",ted
"Well, the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time.",ted
"So, with shooting at you, what are the death rates?",ted
"And so the death rate - not to mention the rate of being arrested, sent to prison, being wounded -",ted
"You're in the gang for four years, you expect to die with about a 25 percent likelihood.",ted
"So for comparison's purposes, let's think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky.",ted
"Let's say that you were a murderer and you were convicted of murder, and you're sent to death row.",ted
"It turns out, the death rates on death row from all causes, including execution: two percent a year.",ted
So it's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street.,ted
"And this is violent death - it's unbelievable, in some sense.",ted
I think the first one is that they got fooled by history.,ted
"There are striking similarities, I think, to the Internet boom.",ted
"The first set of people in Silicon Valley got very, very rich.",ted
"And then all of my friends said, Maybe I should go do that, too.",ted
And they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came.,ted
"In some sense, that's what happened, exactly, to the set of people we were looking at.",ted
"But the rules changed, and they never got to make partner.",ted
The other thing the gang was very good at was marketing and trickery.,ted
"And they didn't really have gold jewelry, they had gold-plated jewelry.",ted
"It goes back to, you know, the real-real versus the fake-real.",ted
"So for instance, they would give a 14-year-old kid a whole roll of bills to hold.",ted
"That 14-year-old kid would say to his friends, Hey, look at all the money I got in the gang.",ted
"This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics, called a compensating differential.",ted
Compensating differential - it's why we think garbagemen might be paid more than people who work in parks.,ted
"The words of one of the members of the gang, I think, make this clear.",ted
"So if I gonna be asked to put my life on the line, then front me the cash, man.",ted
"I think the gang member says it much more articulately than the economist, about what's going on.",ted
"Economists talk about game theory, that every two-person game has a Nash equilibrium.",ted
They're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot -,ted
One thing we observed in the data is that it looked like - the gang leader always got paid.,ted
"No matter how bad it was economically, he always got himself paid.",ted
"We had some theories related to cash flow, and lack of access to capital markets, and things like that.",ted
Why is it you always get paid and your workers don't always get paid?,ted
"His response is, You got all these niggers below you who want your job, you dig?",ted
"If you start taking losses, they see you as weak and shit.",ted
And it never would really occur to an economist that this idea of 'weak and shit' could really be important.,ted
Maybe weak and shit is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis.,ted
"Once upon a time, there was a dread disease that afflicted children.",ted
"And in fact, among all the diseases that existed in this land, it was the worst.",ted
"And along came a brilliant inventor, a scientist, who came up with a partial cure for that disease.",ted
"Many children still died, but it was certainly better than what they had before.",ted
"And the problem with this cure was it was very expensive, and it was very complicated to use.",ted
And they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the two-year-olds and up.,ted
"Until a particular mother, whose child had just turned two, died of this disease.",ted
"And then the child turned two, and I started using the cheap and easy treatment, and I wonder -",ted
It probably is the wrong thing to do to switch and use the cheap and simple solution.,ted
We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children.,ted
"But then along came a lowly economist, who had children himself, and he used the expensive and complicated treatment.",ted
"And he thought about it, and the expensive one didn't seem that great to him.",ted
"And people were very angry, and they called him horrible names.",ted
And then talk about why - what is it that makes that true?,ted
It doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats.,ted
So the United States keeps a data set of every fatal accident that's happened since 1975.,ted
"So in every car crash in which at least one person dies, they have information on all of the people.",ted
"If you put a child in a car seat, 18.2 percent of the children die.",ted
"If they're wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt, in this raw data, 19.4 percent die.",ted
"And interestingly, wearing a lap-only seatbelt, 16.7 percent die.",ted
"And this is all relative to unrestrained - the bigger the bar, the better.",ted
"And so, you can see that the lap-only seatbelts start to look worse once you do that.",ted
And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well.,ted
"And the other thing you might argue is, Well, car seats have got a lot better over time.",ted
"They say, Well, that's impossible, that can't be.",ted
"It's kind of an interesting logic, I think, that people use.",ted
But what's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much.,ted
"So you can only get so far, I think, in telling your story by using these abstract statistics.",ted
"And so I had some friends over to dinner, and I was asking -",ted
I was asking them what advice they might have for me about proving my point.,ted
We can't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats.,ted
"And so, we went to Buffalo, New York, and here is the precursor to it.",ted
"These are the crash test dummies, waiting for their chance to take the center stage.",ted
"So they just have these bench seats, and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it.",ted
And I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think car seats are so great.,ted
"Does he not look content, ready to go, like he could survive anything?",ted
"These are three-year-old dummies, by the way.",ted
And also it turned out these bench seats are the very best way to install car seats.,ted
"And so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat, OK?",ted
"So this car seat was actually an above-average car seat from Consumer Reports, and did quite well.",ted
"Now, this is the kid, same crash, who is in the seatbelt.",ted
"He hardly moves at all, actually, relative to the other child.",ted
"Anyway, it turns out that those two crashes, that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse.",ted
"So, he gets about a 500 out of - you know, on this range - relative to a 400 and something.",ted
"It only got a 500, it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000.",ted
And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat.,ted
"It's just that, fundamentally, the car seats aren't doing much.",ted
"So, I'll show you the six-year-old crashes as well.",ted
Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all.,ted
"So really, for the six-year-old, the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever.",ted
"And then, let's make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain.",ted
"It's just actually - you see, this is folding up - it's behind the seat.",ted
"And I think the answer, perhaps, lies in a story.",ted
And this is a long time ago: you were allowed to do things then you can't do today.,ted
"So, my father would have patients come in who he thought were not really sick.",ted
"OK, and most of them would not come back, but some of them would come back.",ted
"And when they came back, he, still convinced they were not sick, had another jar of pills.",ted
"And these, to me, are the analogy for the car seats.",ted
"People would look at these and say, Man, this thing is so big and so hard to swallow.",ted
"If this doesn't make me feel better, you know, what possibly could?",ted
"And it turned out that most people wouldn't come back, because it worked.",ted
"But every once in a while, there was still a patient convinced that he was sick, and he'd come back.",ted
"It's almost like this thing here, which you can't even see.",ted
"So, my dad always took that as evidence that this little, teeny, powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect.",ted
"And if that's the case, then I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come.",ted
"Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective, or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury?",ted
"So in this data, it's statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lap-and-shoulder belts.",ted
The question is even if - are there enough serious injuries to make these cost-effective?,ted
"Even if they're right, it's not so clear that they're so cost-effective.",ted
"I'm interested - I kind of do the same thing, but I don't move my body.",ted
"And instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space, I work in the mineral world.",ted
"No matter what I've done, what I've tried to do, everybody says it can't be done.",ted
And it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas.,ted
"It's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line, not the straight line.",ted
I'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things.,ted
"But basically, what we do is, we try to give coherence to the world.",ted
"We make physical things, buildings that become a part in an accretional process; they make cities.",ted
"And those things are the reflection of the processes, and the time that they are made.",ted
"I have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain and saying,",ted
"And I've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators, if anybody's involved in cake decorations -",ted
"There's been a continual relationship between inventions, which are private, and reality, which has been important to me.",ted
And then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity of systems.,ted
"And those systems could be identified, and they could be grouped together.",ted
"And what I'm interested in is not the styling of that, but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity.",ted
I was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC.,ted
"We won the competition - what was it, nine months ago?",ted
"Again, a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated, very large-scale organisms.",ted
"And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs, etc.",ted
"Its position, of course, in the middle of Manhattan - it's on Hunter's Point.",ted
Architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place.,ted
"And so I can start this discussion in any number of places, and I've chosen three or four to talk about.",ted
And it has also to do with an interest in the vast kind of territory that architecture touches.,ted
There's just no place that it doesn't somehow have a connective tissue to.,ted
"This is Jim Dine, and it's the absence of presence, etc.",ted
"It's the clothing, the skin, without the presence of the character.",ted
And now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated.,ted
"If you look at most buildings, what you look at is the building, the facade, and it is the building.",ted
And you're looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body.,ted
"And then, again, the building itself, middle of Los Angeles, right across from City Hall.",ted
"And as it moves, it takes pieces of the earth with it.",ted
And that was very much part of the notion of the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles.,ted
"Well, that immediately turned into something much broader, and as a scope.",ted
"And now it turned into something much, much broader as a problem, and it has to do with performance.",ted
"I wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it.",ted
"It's a wrong attitude, actually, because the hybrid is probably more interesting.",ted
"There's some air conditioning left in the base, but the skin now moves on hydraulics.",ted
It forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind.,ted
We could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground.,ted
And it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable.,ted
"So it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth.",ted
There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work.,ted
"And there it is, again, as it's starting to get resolved tectonically, and then there's the school.",ted
"And, of course, we're interested in participating with education.",ted
"I have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates X, Y and Z function.",ted
What I'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people.,ted
It demands some sort of notion of inquiry because it's a system that's developed not sculpturally.,ted
"It has to do with a broad, consistent logic, and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building.",ted
And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles that uses some of the same ideas.,ted
"Then, again, we're doing the headquarters for NOAA - National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency - outside of Washington in Maryland.",ted
"They have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles, and the site's in red.",ted
"There's actually three baseball fields on it right now, and they're going to stay there.",ted
"We put one piece directly north-south, and it holds the dishes at the ears, right?",ted
And what you look at is an aircraft carrier that's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes.,ted
"One enters the building as it lifts off the ground, and it becomes part of the idea.",ted
"And finally, one of the most interesting projects - it's a courthouse.",ted
"Because I'm going, I'm interested in the phenomenon that's taking place in here.",ted
"And then of course, this one, our governor at the moment.",ted
You'll find a stair that's the same length as the Supreme Court.,ted
"Here's a piano nobile, which is a device used in the Renaissance.",ted
"And I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already.",ted
"While creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless, creativity is always meaningful.",ted
"When you think about - you know, creativity has a lot to do with causality too.",ted
"You know, when I was a teenager, I was a creator.",ted
"Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was, and tried to maintain that persona - I became creative.",ted
"If I was born in Monterey, probably would be in Brazil.",ted
You couldn't really say what you wanted to say; you had to invent ways of doing it.,ted
"That led me to another step of why I'm here today, is because I really liked media of all kinds.",ted
"I was a media junkie, and eventually got involved with advertising.",ted
"It was very - actually, it was a very good study, and got me a job in an ad agency.",ted
And they also decided that I had to - to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it.,ted
"On my way out, I had to break a fight apart.",ted
"Luckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see.",ted
"Well, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images.",ted
"You know, I became - I took this very iconoclastic approach.",ted
But I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice.,ted
"It was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising.",ted
Is a remnant of a race of - a very evolved race of entertainers.,ted
"Unfortunately, it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform.",ted
"A Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it.",ted
"The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume, for travel purposes.",ted
"And the half tombstone, for people who are not dead yet.",ted
"I wanted to take that into the realm of images, and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.",ted
"But I was still, you know - this is a kitty cloud.",ted
"But I was still working with sculpture, and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.",ted
"I think it was '94, and I saw Ghiberti's Door of Paradise.",ted
"The idea was to - because everybody overlooks white - like pencil drawings, you know?",ted
Then you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time.,ted
And the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings.,ted
"I started taking that into the realm of landscape, which is something that's almost a picture of nothing.",ted
"These always end up being a photograph at the end, or more like an etching in this case.",ted
"And I don't know how many yards, after John Constable.",ted
"I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts, and I did work and play with them.",ted
"Upon my arrival in New York, I decided - they were children of sugar plantation workers.",ted
"And by manipulating sugar over a black paper, I made portraits of them.",ted
I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection.,ted
"And you render this with the most non-specific material, which is dust itself.",ted
"Like, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor.",ted
"They do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list.",ted
"I bought a computer, and they told me it had millions of colors in it.",ted
"You know an artist's first response to this is, who counted it?",ted
"And I realized that I never worked with color, because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors.",ted
"But once they're applied to numeric structure, then you can feel more comfortable.",ted
So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches.,ted
"They end up being very large pictures, and I photographed with a very large camera - an 8x10 camera.",ted
So you can see the surface of every single swatch - like in this picture of Chuck Close.,ted
And you have to walk very far to be able to see it.,ted
I tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake.,ted
"But then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original.",ted
And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself.,ted
I opt for very simple line drawings - kind of stupid looking.,ted
"And at the same time, I was doing these very large constructions, being 150 meters away.",ted
"I wasn't interested in the very large things, or in the small things.",ted
"I was more interested in the things in between, you know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.",ted
This is like you see - the size of a person over there.,ted
"And I love this work, because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.",ted
"My interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way.",ted
That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that.,ted
I get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical Pentagon long-range strategic planners.,ted
So I tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace.,ted
The material I'm going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas.,ted
It's the one that takes me around the world right now interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit.,ted
I'm going to present a problem and try to give you an answer.,ted
This is gobbledygook for if the United States fights somebody we're going to be huge.,ted
I met the last Air Force General who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat.,ted
That's how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours.,ted
So that overmatched capability creates problems - catastrophic successes the White House calls them.,ted
"And we're trying to figure that out, because it is an amazing capability.",ted
"The question is, what's the good you can do with it?",ted
"So we say, area-denial, anti-access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over.",ted
"They throw up anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies.",ted
Trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our Achilles' heels instantly.,ted
"Prometheus approach, largely a geographic definition, focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict.",ted
We field the first-half team in a league that insists on keeping score until the end of the game.,ted
We did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse.,ted
"Problem is, the Defense Department over here beats the hell out of you.",ted
"The State Department over here says, Come on boy, I know you can make it.",ted
"And that poor country runs off that ledge, does that cartoon thing and then drops.",ted
"This is not about projecting power, but about staying power, which is about legitimacy with the locals.",ted
"I know their senior leadership, they wanted to give it to us.",ted
"We don't think you can pull it off, we're not going to give you our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder.",ted
"And the Chinese said to me, Dr. Barnett, you're absolutely right.",ted
"But it's not a perfect world, and your administration isn't getting us any closer.",ted
"Frankly, we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it.",ted
"Because if we did, that guy would be in front of the Senate, still testifying over Abu Ghraib.",ted
What we need to build is a force for the Everything Else.,ted
"They got out on the far end, we said, Fine, don't worry about it.",ted
A certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non-zero outcome.,ted
"We don't have one for processing politically bankrupt states that, frankly, everybody wants gone.",ted
"Like Saddam, like Mugabe, like Kim Jong-Il - people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions.",ted
I'm going to distinguish between what I call front half and back half.,ted
"And let's call this red line, I don't know, mission accomplished.",ted
"What we have extant right now, at the beginning of this system, is the U.N. Security Council as a grand jury.",ted
That gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the 1990s.,ted
"That gets you 250,000 dead in the Sudan in the last 15 months.",ted
"What we do have is the U.S.-enabled Leviathan Force that says, You want me to take that guy down?",ted
"As soon as I can't find anybody else to air out, I leave the scene immediately.",ted
"A functioning executive that will translate will into action, because we don't have it.",ted
Every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing.,ted
We haven't faced an imminent threat since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.,ted
"And if that doesn't work we scream, He's got a gun!",ted
"And then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say, Jesus, it was dark.",ted
"We should have had 250,000 troops streaming into Iraq on the heels of that Leviathan sweeping towards Baghdad.",ted
Talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months.,ted
"We had six months to feel the lob, to get the job done, and we dicked around for six months.",ted
"They said, You're that powerful, you can resurrect this country.",ted
"What we need is an international reconstruction fund - Sebastian Mallaby, Washington Post, great idea.",ted
They're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the IMF.,ted
You vote according to how much money you put in the kitty.,ted
I'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the Balkans.,ted
"Would you like Kim Jong-Il, who's killed about two million people, would you like him gone?",ted
They've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War.,ted
"I'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire, which I can do because I'm not inside the beltway.",ted
"The problem is you need a big, sexy opponent to fight against.",ted
And if you can't find one you've got to make one up.,ted
"I ask you, who joins the military to do things other than war?",ted
"I maintain this is code inside the Army for, We don't want to do this.",ted
"It's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says, Doctor, it hurts when I do this.",ted
I used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early 1990s.,ted
"I'd say, You're buying one military and you're operating another, and eventually it's going to hurt.",ted
"And they'd say, Dr. Barnett, you are so right.",ted
"Some people put these two things together and they call it empire, which I think is a boneheaded concept.",ted
We enforce the minimal rule sets for maintaining connectivity to the global economy.,ted
How this impacts the way we think about the future of war.,ted
"Going back to the beginning of our country - historically, defenses meant protection of the homeland.",ted
"Written into our constitution, two different forces, two different functions.",ted
"Raise an army when you need it, and maintain a navy for day-to-day connectivity.",ted
In 1947 we merged these two things together in the Defense Department.,ted
"Our long-term rationale becomes, we're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the Soviets.",ted
We connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay.,ted
They can kill three million in Chicago tomorrow and we don't go to the mattresses with nukes.,ted
We talked about this going all the way back to the end of the Cold War.,ted
"Let's have a Department of War, and a Department of Something Else.",ted
It's going to be the Department of Agriculture for the 21st century.,ted
It's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him.,ted
I knew we'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force.,ted
But I know this organization doesn't change until it experiences failure.,ted
This is the military the rest of the world wants us to build.,ted
It's why I travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries.,ted
It means you've got to stop pretending you can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same 19-year-old.,ted
"Switching back, morning, afternoon, evening, morning, afternoon, evening.",ted
"Handing out aid, shooting back, handing out aid, shooting back.",ted
"That force on the left, you can train a 19-year-old to do that.",ted
That force on the right is more like a 40-year-old cop.,ted
"That Sys Admin force is the force that never comes home, does most of your work.",ted
"But here's the promise you make to the American public, to your own people, to the world.",ted
Don't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace.,ted
"Leviathan traditional partners, they all look like the Brits and their former colonies.",ted
"International organizations, non-governmental organizations, private voluntary organizations, contractors.",ted
"Leviathan Force, it's all about joint operations between the military services.",ted
"What we need to do is inter-agency operations, which frankly Condi Rice was in charge of.",ted
And I'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed.,ted
"Gender balanced much more, older, educated, married with children.",ted
The force on the left respects Posse Comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the U.S.,ted
The force on the left is never coming under the purview of the International Criminal Court.,ted
And you've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that.,ted
"I say, Great, I'm going to take the Sys Admin budget out of your hide.",ted
You're going to build the Sys Admin Force inside the U.S. Military first.,ted
"But ultimately you're going to civilianize it, probably two thirds.",ted
"So yes, it begins inside the Pentagon, but over time it's going to cross that river.",ted
"I may not live long enough to get you there, but it's going to happen.",ted
We're going to have a Department of Something Else between war and peace.,ted
This is where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense.,ted
And this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk.,ted
"This is the history of the marines - small wars, small arms.",ted
That's what keeps the Sys Admin Force from being a pussy force.,ted
"I tell young officers, You may command 500 ships in your career.",ted
"Here's the dirty secret of the Air Force, you can win by bombing.",ted
But you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace.,ted
So it's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that.,ted
How are you going to get them to work for this force?,ted
"Last point, intelligence community - the muscle and the defense agencies go this way.",ted
"What should be the CIA, open, analytical, open source should come over here.",ted
"They said, Well, Jesus, they already know this stuff.",ted
"These are the sunglasses that don't scare people, simple stuff.",ted
"So that in one generation, we're going to halve our cultural diversity.",ted
"So an entire philosophy, a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries, goes away.",ted
What I'd like to do right now is share some of those stories with you.,ted
She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country.,ted
"And she crossed in March, and there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March.",ted
"His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising, when the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet.",ted
"And he was beaten, starved, tortured - lost all his teeth while in prison.",ted
"And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man.",ted
"And it just so happened, on the fifth week, there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama.",ted
"That hit me so hard, telling these people that had been through this experience.",ted
"So, two months later, I went into Tibet, and I started interviewing the people there, taking my photographs.",ted
"So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama, and I would hand them out.",ted
I did this 10 years ago - that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left.,ted
"So I was going in, interviewing these people and doing their portraits.",ted
"And they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau, way in the western part of the country.",ted
"And they had just come down from the high pastures, at 18,000 feet.",ted
"Same thing: gave her a picture, she held it up to her forehead.",ted
"At the age of four, he was installed as the 14th Dalai Lama.",ted
"And the young people, young Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work.",ted
"You know, violence as a political tool is all the rage right now.",ted
So this is our icon to non-violence in our world - one of our living icons.,ted
And this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon - oil was discovered in 1972.,ted
"And Moi belongs to the Huaorani tribe, and they're known as very fierce, they're known as auca.",ted
And they've managed to keep out the seismologists and the oil workers with spears and blowguns.,ted
And we spent - I was with a team - two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt.,ted
"This was on a monkey hunt, hunting with curare-tipped darts.",ted
And the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible.,ted
"They could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see.",ted
And I couldn't even see the monkeys that they were getting with these darts.,ted
And her tribe has had to move three times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills.,ted
And these people are the people who take the brunt of it.,ted
"And I was - I usually travel alone when I do my work, but I did this -",ted
"And as it turned out, these guys really taught me a thing or two about blending in with the locals.",ted
"And he brought a soccer ball, and we had soccer every night in this little village.",ted
"By the way, Mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well.",ted
"And this is John Doolikahn, who's the shaman of the Kalash.",ted
"And he's up in the mountains, right on the border with Afghanistan.",ted
"And the shaman - I did a whole series on shamanism, which is an interesting phenomenon.",ted
And they're all praying to the mountain gods as they go into trance.,ted
"You know, getting kids used to different realities, I think, is so important.",ted
I think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place.,ted
So we first hooked up a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle.,ted
"This is Daniel; he's one of our students in Arctic Village, Alaska.",ted
And the way we've done this - we teach digital storytelling to these kids.,ted
And we have them tell stories about issues in their community in their community that they care about.,ted
"And this is in Peru, where the kids told the story about a river that they cleaned up.",ted
"And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in, and this has worked the best.",ted
This is teaching Photoshop in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala.,ted
"We have the website, where the kids all get their homepage.",ted
"We've got about 60 movies that these kids have made, and they're quite incredible.",ted
The other thing: I wanted to give indigenous people a voice.,ted
But the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country.,ted
National Geographic just did a Roper Study of 18 to 26 year olds in our country and in nine other industrialized countries.,ted
And this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago.,ted
And he hadn't seen a computer before we did this movie.,ted
"We taught him Photoshop and - yeah, we can play it.",ted
This is an old Mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather.,ted
"Well, I thought there would be a podium, so I'm a bit scared.",ted
Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA.,ted
"And since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it.",ted
"And then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now.",ted
In back of me is a picture of me when I was 17.,ted
"And, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution.",ted
"Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book called What is Life?",ted
"And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.",ted
"You know, Darwin explained life after it got started, but what was the essence of life?",ted
"And Schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes, and it had to be present on a molecule.",ted
"You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule, and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form.",ted
"So I had, you know, a hero at a distance.",ted
"I got the impression that, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA.",ted
"And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.",ted
"It wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was; it was just nuclear science.",ted
"And there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program, and he talked about DNA.",ted
"But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet, and he showed this x-ray photograph.",ted
"So DNA had a structure, even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions.",ted
"So I went to Cambridge, because it was really the best place in the world then for x-ray crystallography.",ted
"And x-ray crystallography is now a subject in, you know, chemistry departments.",ted
"I mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists.",ted
So the best place for x-ray crystallography was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.,ted
"And within a day, we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA.",ted
But just ask what the molecule - how should it fold up?,ted
"And the reason for doing so, at the center of this photograph, is Linus Pauling.",ted
"About six months before, he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins.",ted
"And in doing so, he banished the man out on the right, Sir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor.",ted
"This is a photograph several years later, when Bragg had cause to smile.",ted
"And certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists, so we tried to build a model.",ted
"X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix.",ted
"Wilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator, Rosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model.",ted
So we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent.,ted
"And so we didn't build any models, and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins.",ted
"You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts.",ted
And we kept telling the people in London that Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA.,ted
"He'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped.",ted
"And boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped.",ted
"And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.",ted
"And I read it, and it was just - it was crap.",ted
"We rushed over to the chemistry department and said, Could Pauling be right?",ted
"Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months, and after she left he would start building models.",ted
"And so I came back with that news to Cambridge, and Bragg said,",ted
"Well, we got the answer on the 28th February '53.",ted
"Never be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't.",ted
"I went in and showed them a pairing I'd done, and Jerry Donohue - he was a chemist - he said,",ted
You've got - the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place.,ted
"So the next day, you know, after I thought, Well, he might be right.",ted
"So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours.",ted
"So in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information.",ted
"They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right.",ted
"But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right.",ted
"The next five years, there were essentially something like five references to our work in Nature - none.",ted
"It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.",ted
"George Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie.",ted
The question was: How do you go from a four-letter code to the 20-letter code of proteins?,ted
"Feynman was a member, and Teller, and friends of Gamow.",ted
"But that's the only - no, we were only photographed twice.",ted
"And on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie.",ted
"There's Francis up on the upper right, and Alex Rich - the M.D.-turned-crystallographer - is next to me.",ted
"And I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think, because the girl I had, boy, she was gone.",ted
"And we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA.",ted
"And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA - synthetic RNA - put it in a system making protein.",ted
"So that's the first cracking of the genetic code, and it was all over by 1966.",ted
"So there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was - so what happened since then?",ted
"When we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk at Cold Spring Harbor.",ted
"The physicist, Leo Szilard, he looked at me and said, Are you going to patent this?",ted
"And - but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it, because you couldn't.",ted
"At least they patented something which, you know, could do useful things.",ted
"And then, they learned how to read the letters for the code.",ted
"And, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry.",ted
"I'm already out of time, but this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician turned physicist.",ted
"And he developed a technique which essentially will let us look at sample DNA and, eventually, a million spots along it.",ted
"Then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in Madison called NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix.",ted
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer.,ted
And you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions.,ted
So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call DNA biopsies.,ted
"So, we started with breast cancer because there's lots of money for it, no government money.",ted
And now I have a sort of vested interest: I want to do it for prostate cancer.,ted
"So, you know, you aren't treated if it's not dangerous.",ted
"But Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells, and made a really sort of surprising observation.",ted
"Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one.",ted
"But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene, maybe we'll feel sick.",ted
And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it.,ted
"Couldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism.",ted
"And you can see here, there are a lot of them.",ted
So a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of DNA.,ted
"We saw one autistic kid, about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes.",ted
"And so, I'll conclude by saying we've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia.",ted
And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture.,ted
"But as you can see, there's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high.",ted
"Now, some people who think they're right-handed are genetically left-handed.",ted
We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar; there's a relationship.,ted
"And if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.",ted
Let me show you some images of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow.,ted
"So, that's Kibera, the largest squatter community in Nairobi.",ted
"This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Bombay, India, what's called Mumbai these days.",ted
"This is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela in Rio de Janeiro.",ted
"And this is Sultanbelyi, which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul.",ted
"They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow, the new urban world.",ted
"To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here, his name is Julius.",ted
And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera.,ted
They're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly.,ted
"And I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi, and he's one of many.",ted
"So, close to 200,000 people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas.",ted
"And if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute.",ted
"Today - a billion squatters, one in six people on the planet.",ted
"And the estimate is that in 2050, there'll be three billion squatters, better than one in three people on earth.",ted
"So, these are the cities of the future, and we have to engage them.",ted
Because I think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is.,ted
"So - The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.",ted
"This was Southland, a small shanty community on the western side of Nairobi, Kenya.",ted
"But it could've been anywhere in the city, because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.",ted
"In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out.",ted
"They called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz.",ted
"After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie, put on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare.",ted
Outside a mound of garbage formed the border between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata.,ted
"It was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide.",ted
"As we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash.",ted
They couldn't have been more than five or six years old.,ted
"They were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile.",ted
"I thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong.",ted
"Once atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts, squatted, and defecated.",ted
"Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.'",ted
"Once you have stayed here,' he said, 'you can stay for the rest of your life.'",ted
"So, he has hope, and this is where these communities start.",ted
"This is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right?",ted
He's got a fence; he scavenged a door; he's got new tile on the roof.,ted
And then you get Rocinha and you can see that it's getting even better.,ted
All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick.,ted
"And then you get Sultanbelyi, in Turkey, where it's even built to a higher level of design.",ted
"The crud in the front is mattress stuffing, and you see that all over Turkey.",ted
People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs.,ted
"And then you finally get squatter homes like this, which is built on the suburban model.",ted
"Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community.",ted
These communities in these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities.,ted
This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a beco - these are how you get around the community.,ted
"This is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market, lots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy.",ted
It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built.,ted
"And what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place.",ted
"People burn trash to get rid of the garbage, and they dig their own sewer channels.",ted
"And they need access to politics, and that can mean two things.",ted
"That can mean community organizing from below, but it can also mean possibilities from above.",ted
"And when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics.",ted
"You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes, provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.",ted
She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai.,ted
That's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median.,ted
"This is Richard Muthama Peter, and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera.",ted
The future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people.,ted
So Wikipedia - you just saw the little demonstration of it - it's a freely licensed encyclopedia.,ted
"It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many, many languages.",ted
And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff.,ted
"So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization, he's exactly describing Wikipedia.",ted
And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside.,ted
"So Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, which I founded, a nonprofit organization.",ted
"And so, if you think about what that means, it means a lot more than just building a cool website.",ted
And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet.,ted
So there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world.,ted
So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was.,ted
And I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is.,ted
"We've got two million total articles across many, many different languages.",ted
"The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French - all the Western-European languages are quite big.",ted
How popular we've gotten to be - we're a top-50 website and we're more popular than the New York Times.,ted
This shows the growth of Wikipedia - we're the blue line there - and this is the New York Times over there.,ted
"We have exactly one employee, and that employee is our lead software developer.",ted
And the way that we're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine.,ted
"People are always asking, Well, who's in charge of this?",ted
You could never afford to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day and do what we're doing at Wikipedia.,ted
"So we're doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly, so it's really gotten to be a huge thing.",ted
"And the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars.",ted
"So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is, why isn't it all rubbish?",ted
"It isn't perfect, but it's much better than you would expect, given our completely chaotic model.",ted
"They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality, and we were very pleased with that result.",ted
So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy.,ted
"And so they quote me as saying, They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia.",ted
And it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions.,ted
This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for - occasionally a little bit here and there.,ted
"Articles on controversial topics are edited a lot, but they don't cause much controversy within the community.",ted
And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality.,ted
And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities.,ted
Sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly.,ted
"So there's a few elements, mostly social policies and some elements of the software.",ted
So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy.,ted
"It's a social concept of cooperation, so we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity.",ted
We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it.,ted
"So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political, religious, cultural backgrounds.",ted
"If you engage in that type of behavior, you'll be asked to leave the community.",ted
Every single change on the site goes to the Recent changes page.,ted
"So as soon as he made his change, it went to the Recent changes page.",ted
And people can get RSS feeds - they can get email notifications of changes.,ted
"So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists, because it is sometimes vandalized.",ted
"And therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly, and then they'll just simply revert the change.",ted
"This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted, you know, ASDFASDF.",ted
"But also, that's some of the most interesting and fun things, some of the new articles.",ted
"So we do have edits by anonymous users, which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia.",ted
But it turns out that only about 18 percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users.,ted
The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality.,ted
"We don't always meet those standards, but that's what we're striving for.",ted
"It's my job to say that, but it's actually true.",ted
The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people.,ted
"This is an example of a page history on flat Earth, and you can see some changes that were made.",ted
"What's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see, OK,",ted
"When somebody goes and looks at - they see that someone, an anonymous IP number, made an edit to my page.",ted
So that's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page.,ted
Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended.,ted
Most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open-ended in the software.,ted
And so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules.,ted
The example I've got up here is the Votes for Deletion page.,ted
"So, I mentioned earlier, people type ASDFASDF - it needs to be deleted.",ted
So we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this.,ted
And so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page.,ted
"It's not a perfect rule, but it's a nice starting point for quick research.",ted
"I found it in a book, 'Film Threat Video Guide: the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'",ted
And what's interesting about this is that the software is - these votes are just text typed into a page.,ted
This is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue.,ted
His voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he's doing.,ted
That doesn't mean that they have the right to delete pages.,ted
They still have to follow all the rules - but they're elected by the community.,ted
"I always laugh at this, because I have no idea how they're elected, actually.",ted
"And that's not exactly what I said, but - the point is my role in the community -",ted
"Within the free software world, there's been a long-standing tradition of the benevolent dictator model.",ted
"They always think they've got 40,000 members when they've got 18.",ted
But they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article.,ted
"Of course, the vote ended up being about 85 to 18, so there was no real danger to our democratic processes.",ted
What if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote?,ted
"Then I said, Well, fuck it, we'll just change the rules.",ted
"And so, as long as people trust me in my role, then that's a valid place for me.",ted
"Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success.",ted
It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased.,ted
Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia changing education?,ted
"Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia.",ted
"There's a media storyline about Wikipedia, which I think is false.",ted
"And the storyline is, there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia, but academics hate it and teachers hate it.",ted
"The last time I got an email from a journalist saying, Why do academics hate Wikipedia?",ted
I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently appointed a fellow there.,ted
"And I said, Well, they don't all hate it.",ted
It's going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition.,ted
But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.,ted
We don't mean we're going to Spam them with AOL-style CDs.,ted
We mean we're going to give them a tool that they can use.,ted
"We've heard a lot about the promise of technology, and the peril.",ted
"We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy, expensive and very inefficient.",ted
Nano-engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it's needed.,ted
"The World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million, which is a reduction of 95 percent.",ted
I did enjoy Bono's comment linking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley.,ted
"That's been a strong interest of mine, and a theme that I've developed for some 30 years.",ted
I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project.,ted
"That invariably, the world was a different place when I would introduce a technology.",ted
"And you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future.",ted
Will WiMax CDMA G3 be the wireless standard three years from now?,ted
"There are remarkably smooth exponential curves that govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth.",ted
"And a lot of people, when they think about the future, think about it linearly.",ted
"And 10 years into the project, the skeptics were still going strong - says,",ted
"But it's the nature of exponential growth that once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes.",ted
Most of the project was done in the last few years of the project.,ted
It took us 15 years to sequence HIV - we sequenced SARS in 31 days.,ted
I'm going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is.,ted
"The actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas, is doubling every decade, according to our models.",ted
"It took us half a century to adopt the telephone, the first virtual-reality technology.",ted
"If you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph, television, radio, telephone were adopted in decades.",ted
"Recent technologies - like the PC, the web, cell phones - were under a decade.",ted
"They work through interaction - they create a capability, and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage.",ted
"So the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals were evolved, took only 10 million years.",ted
"And then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions, and biological evolution kept accelerating.",ted
"And the first step took tens of thousands of years - stone tools, fire, the wheel - kept accelerating.",ted
We always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation.,ted
"Information technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth, every year.",ted
"Every time one paradigm ran out of steam, another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth.",ted
We live in a three-dimensional world; we might as well use the third dimension.,ted
We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam.,ted
"Processor performance on Intel chips, the average price of a transistor - 1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar.",ted
"You would think it would be a very erratic process, and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process.",ted
"Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses, it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor.",ted
"As we make them smaller and less expensive, the electrons have less distance to travel.",ted
"You add other forms of innovation and processor design, you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year.",ted
"In terms of price performance, that's a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate.",ted
But what we're actually seeing is that we actually more than keep up with it.,ted
We've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars in information technology over the last 50 years.,ted
"I mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago.",ted
"As the price performance makes new applications feasible, new applications come to the market.",ted
A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology in these information terms.,ted
These were evolved in very different times - we'd like to actually change those programs.,ted
That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago.,ted
"They tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenously and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim.",ted
"So we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers.",ted
"It cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990, then a penny in 2000.",ted
"The price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways; wired, wireless is growing exponentially.",ted
"The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to, measured many different ways.",ted
"Miniaturization - we're shrinking the size of technology at an exponential rate, both wired and wireless.",ted
"One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait, that's built out of molecules.",ted
The most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions.,ted
There's one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes.,ted
It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials.,ted
"These are 2020-circa scenarios, but they're not as futuristic as it may sound.",ted
There are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices; there are many experiments in animals.,ted
"There's actually one going into human trial, so this is feasible technology.",ted
"It will intersect human intelligence in terms of capacity in the 2020s, but that'll be the hardware side of the equation.",ted
We've already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions out of the several hundred.,ted
We've had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour of labor in the last 50 years.,ted
"You might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust?",ted
"All right, this is a technology that we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in.",ted
"They'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment.",ted
"Images will be written directly to our retina, providing full-immersion virtual reality, augmented real reality.",ted
It'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today.,ted
"But they'll also go inside our brain, interact with our biological neurons.",ted
We've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this.,ted
"You can go there with other people, have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses.",ted
You can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else.,ted
We routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology.,ted
"My main message is that progress in technology is exponential, not linear.",ted
"If you really look at the power of exponential growth, you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand.",ted
So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems.,ted
"I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.",ted
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging.,ted
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?,ted
Hands up: anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?,ted
"That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.",ted
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.,ted
"And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.",ted
"It's a traditional part of the way of life, and we should be allowed to carry on doing it.",ted
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes.,ted
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades.,ted
"So really, this is how I would like to describe it.",ted
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging.,ted
"And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless.",ted
"But these are completely crazy, when you actually remember your sense of proportion.",ted
"You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about.",ted
"Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?",ted
"Now, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.",ted
"And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids, and kids are really important to most people.",ted
"And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question, and give answers like this.",ted
"I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.",ted
"We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate, or a high death rate.",ted
"And, I say that that's fine - the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.",ted
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.,ted
"So the next thing is, now why should we get a little bit more active on this?",ted
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.,ted
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.,ted
"Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all.",ted
"But of course, that only works when we have both of these components.",ted
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.,ted
"Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place, which is to say, metabolism.",ted
This is not a completely tautological statement; it's a reasonable statement.,ted
"So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.",ted
"And there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.",ted
"The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface, because, you know, prevention is better than cure.",ted
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.,ted
"I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it?",ted
"In order to answer that question - you might think it's simple, but it's not simple.",ted
"Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer.",ted
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.,ted
"There are two sorts of technological progress really, for this purpose.",ted
"There are fundamental, major breakthroughs, and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.",ted
"Now, they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames.",ted
Fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough.,ted
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight.,ted
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore.,ted
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.,ted
"Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line, happening of course a bit later.",ted
"I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics - you know, the same sort of time frame.",ted
"So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago, isn't a step at all.",ted
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.,ted
"In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.",ted
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.,ted
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough.,ted
"I decided to give this a little name, which is longevity escape velocity.",ted
"And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.",ted
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.,ted
"Which we can now, as I've explained, equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.",ted
"And thirdly, the question is, what will it do to actually how much people want it?",ted
"And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question, and it's extremely hard to answer.",ted
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.,ted
"They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.",ted
I'm going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology.,ted
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment.,ted
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology.,ted
And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.,ted
"So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.",ted
"We can call it the engineering approach, and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.",ted
"It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related, and it's just an incomplete list.",ted
"They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.",ted
"Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.",ted
"First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.",ted
"Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.",ted
"You may have been dissatisfied with this talk, but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.",ted
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.,ted
"So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework, in order to understand whether this is true.",ted
"But, I mean, look - how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?",ted
Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.,ted
Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.,ted
"That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?",ted
The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade.,ted
"So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.",ted
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.,ted
"If that is indeed true, biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?",ted
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification.,ted
"As a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many.",ted
"It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted, and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out.",ted
And one of those I'd like to share with you today.,ted
"Going down there was like entering a time capsule, and I came out with a different sense of myself in time.",ted
The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today.,ted
I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time.,ted
"It's a story about you and me, nature and science.",ted
"And with that said, I'd like to invite you for a short, brief journey of life through time.",ted
"The fire gave way, Earth emerged - but this was an alien planet.",ted
Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth.,ted
"Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force.",ted
"And where that energy touches water, something new emerges: life.",ted
Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate.,ted
"Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed into more complex forms.",ted
"Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs, among the first to leave the sea.",ted
"They still do what they've done for ages, their enemies long gone.",ted
"Once they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape.",ted
"The fundamental forms of ferns followed, to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds.",ted
"It took time for life to break away from water, and it still beckons all the time.",ted
"Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar, and the center of Brazil, where plants called cycads remain rock hard.",ted
"One early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday.",ted
"In Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree, and in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword.",ted
"Growing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price.",ted
A 'roo hops in Oz; a horse runs in Asia; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil.,ted
"Primates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first, becoming lemurs not much later.",ted
The blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the Earth.,ted
And our brains - our celebrated brains - reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.,ted
"And where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter, Mars is still not very far.",ted
"This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.",ted
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next.,ted
"There's only one other person here, I think, who did that.",ted
"I talked about what the Media Lab was doing, which today has almost 500 people in it.",ted
"And if you read the press, last week it actually said I quit the Media Lab.",ted
And at some point I'll even pass around what the $100 laptop might be like.,ted
"It's amazing when you meet a head of state, and you say, What is your most precious natural resource?",ted
"They will not say children at first, and then when you say, children, they will pretty quickly agree with you.",ted
So with those as the principles - some of you may know Seymour Papert.,ted
"This is back in 1982, when we were working in Senegal.",ted
"It didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries and learning pretty quickly that these kids,",ted
"And these kids, their first English word is Google and they only know Skype.",ted
And they go home at night - they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity.,ted
"The parents love it, because when they open up the laptops, it's the brightest light source in the house.",ted
And talk about where metaphors and reality mix - this is the actual school.,ted
"In parallel with this, Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child in the year 2002.",ted
"And they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries, more schools, whatever.",ted
"And now, three and a half years later, guess what?",ted
So when you see that kind of thing - this is not something that you have to test.,ted
"So, One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago.",ted
"It raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built, and then have it produced afterwards.",ted
"And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price, OK?",ted
"And this particular manufacturer said, We're not interested in that.",ted
"And I said, That's kind of too bad, because we need 100 million units a year.",ted
"And they said, Oh, well, maybe we could become part of your strategic plan.",ted
And that's why we will not launch this without five to 10 million units in the first run.,ted
And we're doing it without a sales-and-marketing team.,ted
"I mean, you're looking at the sales-and-marketing team.",ted
"Now once people start looking at this, they say, Ah, this is a laptop project.",ted
"Now the display on your laptop costs, in rough numbers, 10 dollars a diagonal inch.",ted
It's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy to move their obesity.,ted
"And my laptop runs slower, less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before.",ted
"People clap, sometimes you even get standing ovations, and I say, What the hell's wrong with you?",ted
And somebody - to remain nameless - called our laptop a gadget recently.,ted
"And I said, God, our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell.",ted
"When you open it up, it's going to go 'bing.'",ted
"It'll be just like it was in 1985, when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512.",ted
"And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlighting most of the time, most cell phones.",ted
"Now, what we're doing is, we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit.",ted
And whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software is to be seen.,ted
"And when it's frontlit, it's black and white at three times the resolution.",ted
That's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now.,ted
"And in about 30 days, we'll know for sure whether this works.",ted
"And this is again something that people don't believe, but I really think it's quite true.",ted
So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with.,ted
"The idea was that it would be not only a laptop, but that it could transform into an electronic book.",ted
"This is where when you go outside, it's in black and white.",ted
"The games buttons are missing, but it'll also be a games machine, book machine.",ted
"Set it up this way, and it's a television set.",ted
"I say maybe for Massachusetts, because they actually have to do a bid.",ted
"By law you've got to bid, and so on and so forth.",ted
"In the other cases, they don't have to do bids.",ted
They can decide - it's the federal government in each case.,ted
"Everybody thinks they know about education, a lot of culture is built into it as well.",ted
"If you look at the countries, they're pretty geoculturally distributed.",ted
"Probably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed.",ted
We're purposely not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones.,ted
Everybody says it's a $100 laptop - you can't do it.,ted
"We're coming in probably at 135, to start, then drift down.",ted
"And that's very important, because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up.",ted
"I just learned recently: in South Africa, no white Volvos are stolen.",ted
So we want to make it very much like a white Volvo.,ted
An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present.,ted
"I mean, there are all sorts of things that will happen, and they'll be very, very exciting.",ted
And everybody says - I say - it's an education project.,ted
"The answer is: The system certainly has software, but no, we're not providing the education content.",ted
"But the one thing that people could criticize was, Great idea, but these guys can't do it.",ted
"And that could either mean these guys, professors and so on couldn't do it, or that it's not possible.",ted
So it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen.,ted
"The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.",ted
"I'll talk first as an astronomer, and then as a worried member of the human race.",ted
But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.,ted
"If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last Monday.",ted
"That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.",ted
"This artist's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.",ted
"It is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane - the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade.",ted
"If we go beyond our solar system, we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.",ted
Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.,ted
"And we can see places where stars are forming, like the Eagle Nebula.",ted
"And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion, leaving remnants like that.",ted
"On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.",ted
"And to the cosmologist, these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe.",ted
"Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank, but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.",ted
The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them.,ted
"We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang - a hot, dense state.",ted
So how did that amorphous Big Bang turn into our complex cosmos?,ted
And we'll end up after 13 billion years with something looking rather like our own universe.,ted
We know our universes are united though - links between left and right.,ted
"The everyday world is determined by atoms, how they stick together to make molecules.",ted
Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together.,ted
But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.,ted
"And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small, which we don't yet have.",ted
"There's one challenge symbolized at the top, but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom.",ted
"You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small, but we want to understand the very complex.",ted
"And the most complex things are ourselves, midway between atoms and stars.",ted
We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of.,ted
"We clearly have to be large, compared to atoms, to have layer upon layer of complex structure.",ted
"We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets - otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity.",ted
It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us.,ted
"And more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.",ted
"And I now move on to the second part of my talk, and the book Our Final Century was mentioned.",ted
And in America it was called Our Final Hour because Americans like instant gratification.,ted
"Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence, perhaps even implants into our brains, may change human beings themselves.",ted
"And human beings, their physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years.",ted
"And the human impact on the global environment - greenhouse warming, mass extinctions and so forth - is unprecedented, too.",ted
"Bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects, while, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources.",ted
"Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure - error rather than terror.",ted
And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence.,ted
"In fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc.",ted
"I don't go along with all that, but it's interesting that he had a simple solution.",ted
He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits.,ted
"First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones.",ted
And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.,ted
But he was a moral compass - an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control.,ted
"And perhaps the greatest living person is someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.",ted
"He's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement.",ted
"He persuaded Einstein, as his last act, to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.",ted
"We need not just campaigning physicists, but we need biologists, computer experts and environmentalists as well.",ted
"I wrote my book, Our Final Century, as a scientist, just a general scientist.",ted
"On that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway.",ted
"And it'll be another six billion before that happens, and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.",ted
"The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond.",ted
So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our Earth and beyond.,ted
"When Einstein died in 1955, one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by Herblock in the Washington Post.",ted
"And I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image.",ted
"Over nearly all that immense time, Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually.",ted
The only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions.,ted
Within just 50 years - that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age -,ted
The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves - the total output from all TV and cell phones and radar transmissions.,ted
"Metallic objects - albeit very small ones, a few tons at most - escaped into orbit around the Earth.",ted
A race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years.,ted
But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the Earth's life?,ted
These human-induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed?,ted
"If they continued their vigil, what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years?",ted
"Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth spawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?",ted
"Actually, that's hello in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us.",ted
I call this first chapter - for the Brits in the room - the Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious.,ted
"And rather than talk about it in the theory, I think I'm just going to show you an example.",ted
We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was.,ted
"We showed them the whole cut, and they were all completely, what is this?",ted
"And just putting yourself in the position of the patient - this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.",ted
That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.,ted
"And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.",ted
"It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.",ted
It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.,ted
So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.,ted
"You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror, so it created a tiny human interaction.",ted
"Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action - said, OK, we embrace this.",ted
Which I thought was really - I showed this to my mother recently.,ted
I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.,ted
"It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.",ted
This is my personal space - was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.,ted
"So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.",ted
I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.,ted
"So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision, is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.",ted
This was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.,ted
"And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did, was hold the patient's hand to comfort them.",ted
Human gesture - which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.,ted
"So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy but much more human and practical, was this.",ted
"So, again, going back to this - the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product.",ted
"We use this phrase workarounds a lot, sort of, looking around us.",ted
I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here.,ted
"It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do, which have huge intention and huge opportunity.",ted
"People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.",ted
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?,ted
Because we kind of have to - we're just compelled to.,ted
"Again, we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions.",ted
And we're always saying to our clients: You should look at this stuff.,ted
"So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things.",ted
We co-opt other experiences - we take one item and transfer it to another.,ted
"So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something, that's permission for them to do the same thing.",ted
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.,ted
"And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.",ted
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing.,ted
"Third section is this idea of not knowing, of consciously putting yourself backwards.",ted
"Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh.",ted
This is the Billy bookcase - it's IKEA's biggest selling product.,ted
"Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me, because they're impossible to assemble.",ted
"The reality is when you actually watch children, children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.",ted
"They live around things, and so their spatial awareness relationship, and their thinking around storage is totally different.",ted
"It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.",ted
"So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.",ted
"But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary, and I think that's one of the things.",ted
"I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win.",ted
"So, again, we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.",ted
"The way it's produced, it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials.",ted
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.,ted
"So what seems like a very clunky product is, in fact, incredibly useful.",ted
It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster - you pump up and down on it.,ted
"It's turning these guys - again, one of the themes - it's turning them into entrepreneurs.",ted
"And for us, it's been great because it's won loads of design awards.",ted
So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning.,ted
"We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.",ted
"Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.",ted
"Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers, which is encouraging.",ted
It seems that there's not just one person who thinks that these problems are important.,ted
"If you look at the statistics, the odds are not very favorable to us.",ted
Roughly 90 percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now.,ted
That adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of Canada.,ted
"Sometimes, we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big.",ted
I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem.,ted
"So that would be, roughly, 324 people have died since I've begun speaking.",ted
People like - it's roughly the population in this room has just died.,ted
A person's lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book.,ted
"It's one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember, even today.",ted
"But this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress - burnt down, forever lost - each year.",ted
"Existential risk is a threat to human survival, or to the long-term potential of our species.",ted
"Now, why do I say that this is a big problem?",ted
"But there have been four studies - one by John Lesley, wrote a book on this.",ted
He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century: 50 percent.,ted
"Similarly, the Astronomer Royal, whom we heard speak yesterday, also has a 50 percent probability estimate.",ted
"Another author doesn't give any numerical estimate, but says the probability is significant that it will fail.",ted
I said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have.,ted
Now one percent of six billion people is equivalent to 60 million.,ted
Or an aesthetic experience - a sunset or a great piece of art.,ted
"And you wonder, why can't it be like that all the time?",ted
"And then, of course, it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades.",ted
The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be.,ted
Suppose we fixed these things - we did something about all of these.,ted
"We might end up with something like this, which is - I mean,",ted
Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards?,ted
"If we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change?",ted
"Not just the way we think about the world, but the way we are - our very biology.",ted
But there's a kind of queasiness that these are unnatural in some way.,ted
It's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use.,ted
You're changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along.,ted
"Looking ahead, there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later.",ted
"It's possible to assume, setting aside a possibility of catastrophe, that sooner or later we will develop all of these.",ted
And even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition.,ted
So let's look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement.,ted
We're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it.,ted
"All of these would enable, in principle - be amenable to enhancement.",ted
Some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have.,ted
Imagine a species that just didn't have this neural machinery for processing music.,ted
"So we could think of adding on different, new sensory capacities and mental faculties.",ted
"The ability to - it's another interesting application that would have large social ramification, perhaps.",ted
It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this.,ted
You can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it's naturally polygamous.,ted
"Might be more complicated in humans, but perhaps not that much.",ted
This is the last picture that I want to - now we've got to use the laser pointer.,ted
"There would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for, say, 200 years.",ted
Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are.,ted
"I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design?",ted
"Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that.",ted
The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings.,ted
"Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length, and that changes the frequency of the sound wave.",ted
"OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it a 16th-century technology.",ted
"I remember when I was little, my mom asked me, Would you like to play the violin or the piano?",ted
I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day!,ted
"A few years later, I heard a joke about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz.",ted
"I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school.",ted
"Like the speaker before me - I am a TED virgin, I guess.",ted
I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone.,ted
I have another piece that I'd like to play for you.,ted
"It's called Abegg Variations, by Robert Schumann, a German 19th-century composer.",ted
That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.,ted
"So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.",ted
"It's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.",ted
"So, I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start.",ted
I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose.,ted
"So for inspiration, I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers.",ted
"Next, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers.",ted
"And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas, because then you have to think.",ted
"Drawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art.",ted
And then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character?,ted
Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book?,ted
You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.,ted
"I'm not going to play my own composition today because, although I did finish it, it's way too long.",ted
"I have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet.",ted
And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five - anyone to come up here and choose five -,ted
Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?,ted
"OK - C, G, B, A and E. JL: Thank you very much!",ted
"Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E.",ted
I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.,ted
"So, I'm going to have a moment to think, and I'll try to make something out of it.",ted
"The next song, or the encore that I'm going to play is called Bumble Boogie, by Jack Fina.",ted
We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.,ted
"So I'll try and do that, but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.",ted
And the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.,ted
"And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe, is nowhere near any galaxies.",ted
"And at this point, we've come 100,000 light-years from here.",ted
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.,ted
"To get to a typical place, you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that, into intergalactic space.",ted
"Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space.",ted
"Can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?",ted
It's also very cold out there - less than three degrees above absolute zero.,ted
The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create.,ted
So that's how different a typical place is from this place.,ted
"Well, the Earth - our environment, in the form of us - is creating knowledge.",ted
"Quasars originally meant quasi-stellar object, which means things that look a bit like stars.",ted
"Now, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet.",ted
Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets.,ted
"The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model of the other, the quasar.",ted
"And if that weren't amazing enough, the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time.",ted
"Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision, the structure of everything.",ted
It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.,ted
"One of them is matter, because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing.",ted
"Information processing is computation, computation requires a computer, and there's no known way of making a computer without matter.",ted
"We happened to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's law of gravity, about 300 years ago.",ted
Our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy.,ted
"Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space, the same size as our home, the solar system.",ted
"In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.",ted
"If we could do that, we'd automatically have an energy supply, because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor.",ted
"And locally there, you could build particle accelerators and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry, and so on.",ted
"So, in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge.",ted
"Now, this cosmic knowledge-based view may - and, I think, ought to - make us feel very special.",ted
"All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light-years away, and we'll all be dead!",ted
And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century.,ted
I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.,ted
"But it depends, not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.",ted
The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history.,ted
"Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist.",ted
And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory.,ted
"And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem, merely to postpone it by a little.",ted
"Now, the lesson of that seems clear to me, and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate.",ted
But no precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.,ted
"Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance.",ted
"If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only, then it would achieve very little of either.",ted
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs.,ted
"I usually say to people, when they say, What do you do?",ted
"I say, I do hardware, because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do.",ted
"And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some Valley event, to which he replied, How quaint.",ted
"This doesn't mean we should ignore software, or information, or computation.",ted
And that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about.,ted
"And George Homsey, a great guy, said, Oh, the future is amazing.",ted
"We're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut, and we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint.",ted
"So, this isn't my work, but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT.",ted
"This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight and a few other very, very bright individuals.",ted
"Basically, what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system.",ted
"Literally, think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program.",ted
And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich for a design competition in biology.,ted
"So this is interesting in the sense that you can now do if-then-for statements in materials, in structure.",ted
"In this case, he's done self-replication of a complex 3D structure.",ted
"And that's what I thought about for a long time, because this is how we currently make things.",ted
"The feature side is - you know, people will say, unclear down around about 65 nanometers now.",ted
"And that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers, and it's a complex 3D structure.",ted
We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way.,ted
"The secret to biology is, it builds computation into the way it makes things.",ted
"So this little thing here, polymerase, is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA.",ted
And the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins.,ted
"I thought about this in the sense that it's great to build in biological materials, but can we do similar things?",ted
"Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems, like higher speed semiconductors, etc.",ted
"So, this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system.",ted
"Now, if I make a string of these, a bit string, they will be able to replicate.",ted
"It was work actually by Lionel Penrose, father of Roger Penrose, the tiles guy.",ted
"So now I'm going to show you the hands-free, autonomous self-replication.",ted
"So we've tracked in the video the input string, which was green, green, yellow, yellow, green.",ted
Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing?,ted
So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process.,ted
"So, Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday, I believe, but I'll show you again.",ted
"Each different color has a different magnetic polarity, and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out.",ted
And now I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits.,ted
"So, you know, it's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently.",ted
"And so I'm thinking about, you know, what are the programs for programming the physical universe?",ted
"And how do we think about materials and structure, sort of as an information and computation problem?",ted
"Having totally absorbed this philosophy, I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently.",ted
"With the universe as a computer, you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations.",ted
"You set a couple of boundary conditions, like gravity, the surface tension, density, etc.,",ted
So can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site?,ted
And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you've cooked it.,ted
"Now you've finished the lens, you literally pop it out.",ted
"That's next year's Yves Klein, you know, eyeglasses shape.",ted
And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters.,ted
"So, this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things, like this.",ted
"This is something that my people at SQUID Labs are working on at the moment, called electronic rope.",ted
And you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor.,ted
So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope.,ted
"Just by thinking about the physics of the world, materials as the computer, you can start to do things like this.",ted
I guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that I think about with this.,ted
"And I think this applies across a very broad - sort of, a lot of concepts.",ted
"You know, Cameron Sinclair yesterday said, How do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity?",ted
"And if you've seen Amy Smith, she talks about how you get students at MIT to work with communities in Haiti.",ted
"I don't know exactly how to do this yet, but, you know, it's something being actively thought about.",ted
"So, you know, that leads to questions like, is this a compiler?",ted
"They're starting to invest in materials science, but these are the new things in materials science.",ted
"How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas, and see the world in a different way?",ted
"I've probably got a couple of minutes of questions, or I can show -",ted
"I think they also said that I do extreme stuff in the introduction, so I may have to explain that.",ted
"So this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite, which also happens to be a minimal energy surface.",ted
"So returning to the droplet, again, thinking about the universe in a new way.",ted
"So I've been working on this a little, also, with a couple of other guys.",ted
And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that.,ted
And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation.,ted
The first is what I like to call a hyper-rational process.,ted
"And it concludes in something that you see here, that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality.",ted
The second - the second is that this process does not have a signature.,ted
"High modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic, almost anything can happen within them.",ted
I call it sort of shotgun flexibility - turn your head this way; shoot; and you're bound to kill something.,ted
"So, this is the promise of high modernism: within a single space, actually, any kind of activity can happen.",ted
"But as we're seeing, operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters.",ted
"And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility, something that we call compartmentalized flexibility.",ted
"And the idea is that you, within that continuum, identify a series of points, and you design specifically to them.",ted
I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see.,ted
"With the library staff and the library board, we settled on two core positions.",ted
The second premise - and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first -,ted
So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building.,ted
The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility.,ted
"And in this case, what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book.",ted
What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left.,ted
That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory.,ted
"Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say, You know what?",ted
"We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books.",ted
"So once we had presented that back to them, they agreed that this sort of core concept could work.",ted
We got the right to go back to first principles - that's the third diagram.,ted
"What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library, specifically in terms of square footage.",ted
"They signed it, and to their chagrin, we came back a week later, and we presented them this.",ted
"And as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right.",ted
"The things on the left-hand side of the diagram, those are the boxes.",ted
We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships.,ted
"The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code, and so forth.",ted
"So, you see the five platforms, those are the boxes.",ted
"To give you some sense of the power of this idea, the biggest block is what we call the book spiral.",ted
It's literally built in a very inexpensive way - it is a parking garage for books.,ted
"One, it is the lateral stability for the entire building; it's a structural element.",ted
"But its dimensions were designed not only for structure, but also for holding on every piece of glass.",ted
So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building.,ted
"And it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians.",ted
"So, it's an unusual building for a public library, obviously.",ted
So now we're going into what we call the living room.,ted
It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space.,ted
Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber.,ted
You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you.,ted
"This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife, right there.",ted
"So, it's very indiscernible, but it's actually a continuous stair-stepping.",ted
"It allows you to, on one city block, go up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum.",ted
"Ok, now I'm going to go back, and I'm going to hit a second project.",ted
"Theater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle, with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company.",ted
"So they in the morning will do something in arena, then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth.",ted
"The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure, so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop.",ted
"The balconies all move to go between those configurations, but they also disappear.",ted
"And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma, so they worked in reverse.",ted
"So this is Louisville's skyline, and I'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project.",ted
"We actually had to operate on three discrete sites, all of them well smaller than the size of the building.",ted
"We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it.",ted
"Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor, a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites.",ted
So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub.,ted
In fact - and you know this - this is called the Time Warner Building.,ted
"So that's the basic concept, and now I'm going to show you what it leads to.",ted
"Ok, it seems a very formal, willful gesture, but something derived entirely out of the constraints.",ted
"Now, within that center zone, as I said, we have the ability to mix a series of things.",ted
"So here, this is sort of an x-ray - the towers are totally developer-driven.",ted
"It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen, or to see the art, and so forth.",ted
"As we're building the cores, we build the contemporary art museum at grade.",ted
"This is how they build really large aircraft hangars, for instance, the ones that they did for the A380.",ted
"Finish the cores, finish the meat and you get something that looks like this.",ted
"Now I only have about 30 seconds, so I want to start an animation, and we'll conclude with that.",ted
"About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.",ted
"And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed.",ted
So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.,ted
And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there.,ted
"And it turned out that - I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.",ted
"Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up, I'm going to have a good time working here.",ted
"But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful.",ted
"On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.",ted
"However, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life - of, you know,",ted
I think what the conference brochure refers to as moments that take your breath away.,ted
"And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.",ted
I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.,ted
"And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.",ted
There's one from a consumer's point of view - where I was happy while experiencing design.,ted
My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely.,ted
And The Police's Synchronicity cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.,ted
So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.,ted
"Now, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint - if you're happy while actually doing it.",ted
"So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy.",ted
"And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because - well, also, with an eye on this conference.",ted
"Under Arcadia, they showed things like this, from the Edo period - a hundred ways to write happiness in different forms.",ted
This is a blue field - it's actually an Yves Klein painting.,ted
"Then, under Desire, they showed these Shunsho paintings - also from the Edo period - ink on silk.",ted
"And, lastly, under Harmony, they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet.",ted
"And I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization - that's a really easy thing to do.",ted
"And, you know, my studio - we've done it all the time.",ted
Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.,ted
"This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself True.",ted
Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be familiar with these signs?,ted
Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.,ted
They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.,ted
"Now, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.",ted
"So you're you're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.",ted
"I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.",ted
"He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested, so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.",ted
"This is at P.S. 1 - a sculpture that's basically a square room by James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling.",ted
"You're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.",ted
"And, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there.",ted
"There are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.",ted
"But my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.",ted
"And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles - empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.",ted
"And he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.",ted
I think that was - the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.,ted
"Which brought me back to my list making - you know, just to see what I actually like about my job.",ted
"Or, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it.",ted
Try not to get stuck doing the same thing - or try not get stuck behind the computer all day.,ted
"This is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.",ted
"Then, of course, trying to, you know, work on things where the content is actually important for me.",ted
"So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned - in this case,",ted
Everything I do always comes back to me - and we made these spreads right out of this.,ted
So it was: Everything I do always comes back to me.,ted
"A couple of weeks ago, a French company asked us to design five billboards for them.",ted
"We flew to Arizona - the designer who works with me, and myself - and photographed this one.",ted
"This is: Having - this is the same thing; it's just, you know, photographed from the side.",ted
"The old story about climate protection is that it's costly, or it would have been done already.",ted
So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it.,ted
"The new story about climate protection is that it's not costly, but profitable.",ted
"If, of course, that were true, there would be no innovation, and nobody could make any money.",ted
"This process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict, particularly over oil.",ted
"Now, a bit of economic history, I think, may be helpful here.",ted
"So, very unexpectedly, they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales.",ted
The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit-maximizing capitalists.,ted
And it's funny - it feels a bit like this now for oil.,ted
"Now, there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil.",ted
"On the competitiveness front, we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together.",ted
China has an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leap-frog technology.,ted
"The point here is, these cars are going to be made super efficient.",ted
"Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing, but nothing is not the right number.",ted
"It could well be enough to double the oil price, for example.",ted
"Now, in order to avoid these problems, whatever you think they're worth, it's actually not that complicated.",ted
"We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently, at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel.",ted
And then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas.,ted
"In the process, we will gain about a million good jobs, mainly rural.",ted
"And protect another million jobs now at risk, mainly in auto-making.",ted
And we'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year.,ted
"For example, this Opel two-seater does 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon.",ted
"Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon.",ted
So you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return.,ted
"Then you can go even further, almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements, double the big haulers' margins.",ted
"And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull, and flip the market.",ted
"And only this little bit, only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop.",ted
This is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort.,ted
"Moreover, three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car.",ted
So there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter.,ted
"For example, we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods.",ted
Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf.,ted
And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight.,ted
"We could make cars bigger, which is protective, but make them light.",ted
"Whereas if we made them heavy, they'd be both hostile and inefficient.",ted
"And when you make them light in the right way, that can be simpler and cheaper to make.",ted
"You can end up saving money, and lives, and oil, all at the same time.",ted
And the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely.,ted
"Because the auto body has only, say, 14 parts, instead of 100, 150.",ted
"Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set, instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel.",ted
"And if you want, you can lay color in the mold, and get rid of the paint shop.",ted
Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car.,ted
"There is a huge amount of gas to be saved, about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price.",ted
"And here are some no-brainer substitutions of it, with lots left over.",ted
Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12.,ted
"Now, to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence, there is a few ways government could help.",ted
"This expands choice rapidly in the market, and actually makes more money for automakers as well.",ted
"And for each car so financed, scrap almost one clunker, preferably the dirtiest ones.",ted
There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster.,ted
And we could even do an X Prize-style golden carrot that's worth stretching further for.,ted
Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive.,ted
"We ought to take them out back and shoot them, and put bounty hunters after them.",ted
"Just turn it over to the private sector, and we have an Internet.",ted
"And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there, we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the 2040s.",ted
And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before.,ted
They would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year.,ted
And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC.,ted
We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil.,ted
She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.,ted
The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.,ted
"Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.",ted
"I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.",ted
And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.,ted
"And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined.",ted
"We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times, into a $3 million park.",ted
"And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved.",ted
"That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.",ted
But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine.,ted
"We feel the problems right now, and have for some time.",ted
"I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do.",ted
"These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma.",ted
Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?,ted
"Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it.",ted
Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average.,ted
Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed.,ted
Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care.,ted
This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits.,ted
"Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy.",ted
"None of us want that, and we all have that in common.",ted
"Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking.",ted
"But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways.",ted
I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down.,ted
"My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home.",ted
"At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood.",ted
"Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to.",ted
"In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign.",ted
One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.,ted
"The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance.",ted
Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed.,ted
The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.,ted
"So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home, and all we had.",ted
"Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation.",ted
The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come.,ted
Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood.,ted
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided?,ted
This was planning - in quotes - that did not have our best interests in mind.,ted
"Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning.",ted
I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx.,ted
"They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development.",ted
This is Lafayette Avenue - and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.,ted
"And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park.",ted
"Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.",ted
"As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more.",ted
The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway.,ted
We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices.,ted
"Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere.",ted
"Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common.",ted
"Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz.",ted
Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another.,ted
"In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common.",ted
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable.,ted
But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out.,ted
"Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did?",ted
This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through.,ted
"But I'll tell you later, if you want to know.",ted
"But - I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end.",ted
I'm interested in what I like to call the triple bottom line that sustainable development can produce.,ted
My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues.,ted
Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development.,ted
"You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to.",ted
"There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune.",ted
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit.,ted
"That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create.",ted
"But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries in other cities.",ted
"Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx.",ted
"However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique PeÐÂ±alosa.",ted
"Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them.",ted
"If you're a mayor, you can do something about that.",ted
"His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that.",ted
That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S.,ted
That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange.,ted
"This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal.",ted
"Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere.",ted
I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding.,ted
What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around.,ted
But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process.,ted
"But when I went to architecture school, it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family.",ted
"And in 1999, we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo.",ted
That led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas.,ted
"We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran, in Bam, also following up on our work in Africa.",ted
Working within the United States - most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner.,ted
"So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere; and also, I will go into some more projects.",ted
I think we can pretty much assume that 2005 was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters.,ted
"So we began to get involved in projects there, and I'll talk about some others.",ted
"And then of course, this year we've been responding to Katrina, as well as following up on our reconstruction work.",ted
"So that means, you know, somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do.",ted
"The fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it, we did it.",ted
"So seven years later, we've developed so that we've got advocacy, instigation and implementation.",ted
"Instigation, developing ideas with communities and NGOs, doing open-source design competitions.",ted
"So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change, we build that change.",ted
"We had from the sublime to the ridiculous, but they worked.",ted
"So we've engaged not just designers, but also a whole variety of technology-based professionals.",ted
And it wasn't doctors telling us this; it was actual villagers that we were staying with.,ted
"And the medical community there said, We've said this for the last decade.",ted
"So in a way, we had taken pre-existing needs and shown solutions.",ted
"And so again, we had a whole variety of ideas that came in.",ted
"This one I personally love, because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions, but about raising awareness.",ted
"You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land, and it grows 14 feet in a month.",ted
"The idea is it's not just a clinic, it's a community center.",ted
"This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community, so it can be a self-sustaining project.",ted
That's not because I'm a tree-hugging green person.,ted
"It's because when you live on four dollars a day, you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable.",ted
"So this is about getting an economic engine, and then at night, it turns into a movie theater.",ted
"And these ideas developed into prototypes, and they were eventually built.",ted
"And currently, as of this year, there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya.",ted
"The community came to us and said, The problem is that the girls don't have education.",ted
"And that's not because they're promiscuous, it's because there's no knowledge.",ted
So that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care.,ted
"And then, of course, we actually go and work with the community and the clients.",ted
"He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba.",ted
"I work at the Africa Centre, I'm an IT user consultant.",ted
"I'm also the national football player for South Africa, Banyana Banyana.",ted
"And I also play in the Vodacom League, for the team called Tembisa, which has now changed to Siyathemba.",ted
Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time.,ted
"This was a connection, just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center, in Tanzania.",ted
"And we start construction in June, and it will be opened by TEDGlobal.",ted
"So when you come to TEDGlobal, you can check it out.",ted
"And what that means is we actually live and work with the community, and they're part of the design process.",ted
The kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be.,ted
"And then eventually, the community, through skills training, end up building the building with us.",ted
This is what the UN gave these guys for six months - 12 plastic tarps.,ted
This was the replacement; that's supposed to last for two years.,ted
"So we said, if the rain's coming down, let's get fresh water.",ted
"The kids are out there on-site, building the buildings.",ted
"And it opened a couple of weeks ago, and there's 600 kids that are now using the schools.",ted
"We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that, but we don't see the good stories.",ted
"Here is a community that got together, and they said no to waiting.",ted
"Figuring out what FEMA regulations are, not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild.",ted
"Working with residents, getting them out of their homes, so they don't get ill.",ted
This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker.,ted
They're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years.,ted
"That was their home, and these are the photographs they took.",ted
"And we're helping, working with them to create a new building.",ted
It took 20 years to design this and get it implemented in the field.,ted
"More hemp houses - it's a theme in Japan, apparently.",ted
"I'm going to whip through this quickly, because I know I've got only a couple of minutes.",ted
And this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years.,ted
"From Brazil to India, Mexico, Alabama, China, Israel, Palestine, Vietnam.",ted
The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is 32 -,ted
"If you're ever, ever in India, go use this toilet.",ted
I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party.,ted
"But the future is not going to be the sky-scraping cities of New York, but this.",ted
"Look left, look right: one of you will be there.",ted
So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone.,ted
My role is not as a designer; it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world.,ted
"And what we need is something that replicates me globally, because I haven't slept in seven years.",ted
The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it.,ted
"So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this, but still protect their rights here?",ted
The reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works.,ted
So doing that globally - and I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually.,ted
"When you look at the face of an architect, most people think a gray-haired white guy.",ted
I don't see that; I see the face of the world.,ted
So I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development.,ted
"The idea of needs-based competitions - XPRIZE for the other 98 percent, if you want to call it that.",ted
When I hear about the $100 laptop and it's going to educate every child - educate every designer in the world.,ted
"So let's take those ideas, adapt them, and we can use them.",ted
"I don't have time to read this, because I'm going to be yanked off.",ted
"I just should note: I have two laptops and one of them is there, and that has 3000 designs on it.",ted
"So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there, easy to use, easy to get ahold of.",ted
"My mom once said, There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers.",ted
We've changed FEMA guidelines; we've changed public policy; we've changed international response - based on building things.,ted
"So for me, it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation, and that it's free innovation.",ted
"Well, I'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for.",ted
"So let's get to what I would like, which is world peace.",ted
And I think that the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other.,ted
"If you've seen the film Control Room that was sent out, you'd understand a little bit why.",ted
"And a long time ago - well, about 40 years ago - my mom had an exchange student.",ted
And I'm going to show you slides of the exchange student.,ted
This is my mother and aunt teaching Donna how to ride a bike.,ted
And this is Donna teaching my aunt how to do a Filipino dance.,ted
And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today.,ted
I'm the daughter of an American mother and an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father.,ted
"She's somebody who believes strongly in community service, and decided that this was something that I needed to do.",ted
I got drawn into this community and I began to take pictures there.,ted
I took pictures of weddings and older family members - things that they wanted memories of.,ted
But I was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out of people just seeing these photographs.,ted
"And I saw the power of the image, and it was incredible.",ted
"Did a stint at MTV, made a film called Startup.com, and I've done a couple of music films.",ted
"And I knew that there was a completely other story that was taking place in the Middle East, where my parents were.",ted
How are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future?,ted
"So I was thinking, this station that's hated by so many people has to be doing something right.",ted
"And I also wanted to go see Central Command, which was 10 minutes away.",ted
"But between us, if I'm offered a job with Fox, I'll take it.",ted
"Maybe I will never be able to do it, but I have plans for my children.",ted
"When they finish high school, I will send them to America to study there.",ted
"Al Jazeera showed them - it was powerful, because America doesn't show those kinds of images.",ted
"And they were equally, if not more, horrifying - the images were.",ted
"And I remember having seen it in the Al Jazeera office, and thought to myself, Wow, that's gross.",ted
But it doesn't make me believe that we're in a world that can live without war yet.,ted
Jehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed by the response of the film.,ted
We didn't know whether it would be able to get out there.,ted
"And when we showed the film in both the United States and the Arab world, we had such incredible reactions.",ted
It was amazing to see how people were moved by this film.,ted
"In the Arab world - and it's not really by the film, it's by the characters -",ted
"I mean, Josh Rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things.",ted
"And when I showed the film in the Middle East, people wanted to meet Josh.",ted
"This woman came up to me after the screening and said, You know, I know this is crazy.",ted
"Now, I don't know whether a film can change the world.",ted
And these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts that we're faced with today.,ted
"Now Man: As long as there is injustice, someone must make a sacrifice!",ted
"If you kill, there's no difference between victim and occupier.",ted
"Man: If we had airplanes, we wouldn't need martyrs, that's the difference.",ted
"Anyway, I'd rather have Paradise in my head than live in this hell!",ted
"My wife Ayelet called me and said, There was a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.",ted
"Ayelet: One is wounded here, but we haven't heard from the other three.",ted
"On that day, at around 6:30 I was driving with my wife and daughters to the supermarket.",ted
And my 12-year-old daughter Christine was killed in the shooting.,ted
Man: Song is something that we communicated with people who otherwise would not have understood where we're coming from.,ted
"You could give them a long political speech, they would still not understand.",ted
"But I tell you, when you finish that song, people will be like,",ted
"It's about those children who took to the streets - fighting, screaming, Free Nelson Mandela!",ted
It's about those unions who put down their tools and demanded freedom.,ted
And what I'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film?,ted
"It's about connecting people through film, getting these independent voices out there.",ted
"Now, Josh Rushing actually ended up leaving the military and taking a job with Al Jazeera.",ted
And there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already.,ted
Imagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world.,ted
"So if you imagine this day when all around the world, you have theaters and places where we project films.",ted
"Now, we've thought about a name for this day, and I'd like to share this with you.",ted
"There was a time, many, many years ago, when all of the continents were stuck together.",ted
So what we'd like to call this day of film is Pangea Cinema Day.,ted
And I know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there that can really make this happen.,ted
"I guess I'm supposed to give you my one-sentence wish, but we're way out of time.",ted
"JN: It's more tangible than world peace, and it's certainly more immediate.",ted
"But it would be the day that the world comes together through film, the power of film.",ted
"Walk around for four months with three wishes, and all the ideas will start to percolate up.",ted
"And I think, quite frankly, that's where I started.",ted
"And there was a pretty small population, and my father was an avid outdoorsman.",ted
"And I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me.",ted
"And I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring, along a roadside.",ted
And then I went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape.,ted
"So I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape?",ted
I decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we've transformed.,ted
"I got out of the car, and I stood up, and it was a coal-mining town.",ted
"I did a 360 turnaround, and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen.",ted
"So in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation.",ted
"I work with them, and I feel that we all need them and they're important.",ted
So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions.,ted
"And I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here, but it is a slow progression.",ted
These things that I photographed - this tire pile here had 45 million tires in it.,ted
"That in the recycling work that I was doing, I'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.",ted
"Of course, listening at the conference, there's many, many things that are coming.",ted
These images of Bangladesh came out of a radio program I was listening to.,ted
"And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned, and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.",ted
"And I thought, My God, wouldn't that be something?",ted
"To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand, literally, in third-world countries.",ted
"Here you're looking at some oil fields in California, some of the biggest oil fields.",ted
"And that, to me, was again something that I started building on, and I continued to build on.",ted
I was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work.,ted
"But you know, to see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something.",ted
"Most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said, It's just too big.",ted
"So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long, one of the largest reservoirs ever created.",ted
"I think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite, everything else was by hand.",ted
"So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam, looking at that massive transformation of a landscape.",ted
"And it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.",ted
"What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one.",ted
There hasn't been one built in North America for 20 years because of the NIMBY problem -,ted
"But in China they're saying, No, we're putting in 27 in the next 10 years.",ted
And coal-burning furnaces are going in there for hydroelectric power literally weekly.,ted
"And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated, depending on whose statistics you're looking at.",ted
"This is Wushan, one of the largest cities that was relocated.",ted
"And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up, but somehow were not connecting with them.",ted
"Here is a sign that, translated, says, Obey the birth control law.",ted
"Build our science, civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth.",ted
"So here, if you look at this poster, it has all the trappings of Western culture.",ted
"But what's really, to me, frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background.",ted
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.,ted
"This is one of the biggest shoe factories, the Yuyuan shoe factory near Shenzhen.",ted
"This is one with 45,000, so every lunch, there's about 12,000 coming through for lunch.",ted
"What's also happening in Shanghai is - China is changing because this wouldn't have happened five years ago, for instance.",ted
They're called dengzahoos - they're like pin tacks to the ground.,ted
"They're not getting enough, so they're not going to move.",ted
And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them.,ted
And they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal.,ted
But these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai.,ted
"Probably the largest urban-renewal project, I think, ever attempted on the planet.",ted
"I never ended up going there, was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house.",ted
"The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something, and these are called the villas.",ted
Shanghai was a very intriguing city - it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced.,ted
And this isn't even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market.,ted
"And what we would see here as a suburban development - a similar thing, but they're all high-rises.",ted
"It's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.",ted
"Most recently I went in, and I started looking at some of the biggest industries in China.",ted
This is the coal supply for the steel factory - 18 square kilometers.,ted
"It's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers, five cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here.",ted
So they're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in China.,ted
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.,ted
"And again, looking at these images, there's this constant, like, haze that you're seeing.",ted
"This is going to show you, real time, an assembler.",ted
"In that one, there were 400 people that worked on the floor.",ted
And it was just lightning fast; the way she was working was almost unbelievable.,ted
In this particular case - this is the assembly line that you saw; this is a shot of it.,ted
I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.,ted
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot.,ted
"It wasn't too bad, but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.",ted
"This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk, an oil byproduct.",ted
"And what you're seeing here is, again, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills.",ted
"There are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each.",ted
"So you have about 12 people running this, and they're just inspecting it - and they're just walking the lines.",ted
"The machines are all running, absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.",ted
I do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places.,ted
"This is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together, pre-going into the textile mills.",ted
"Here's something that's far more labor-intensive, which is the making of shoes.",ted
"The company itself had about 10,000 employees, and they're doing domestic shoes.",ted
It was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.,ted
"Bird mobile phone, one of the largest mobile makers in China.",ted
"This is a textile where they're doing shirts - Youngor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.",ted
"While setting up this shot, people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch.",ted
"They make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers - they make 20 million of them in the world.",ted
So it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places.,ted
The other aspect of what's happening in China is that there's a real need for materials there.,ted
So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to China by ships.,ted
Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled.,ted
They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components.,ted
"It's all cottage industries, so it's not big places -",ted
This is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling.,ted
They've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking.,ted
"One's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.",ted
I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.,ted
And it is through communications today that I believe that that is not an unreal idea.,ted
"I wanted to put what I had in mind, hitch it onto something.",ted
And the beauty of what's going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like.,ted
And this is still in preliminary stages; these aren't the finals.,ted
"But these images, with Worldchanging.com, can be placed into any kind of media.",ted
"What was unusual, according to Stephen, is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image.",ted
"Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?",ted
"This one is one that will spoke out, and will go out, and to start reaching.",ted
"I think there's a chance to have a dialogue, a conversation about sustainability at Worldchanging.com.",ted
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.,ted
"Wish two is more of the bottom-up, ground-up one that I'm trying to work with.",ted
"And one of the things that came out - Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on in a brainstorming.",ted
She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.,ted
So it's this great window where they actually are - you can influence them.,ted
So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas.,ted
"Let them understand what sustainability is, and that they have a vested interest in it to happen.",ted
But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic was to create these - call them prize targets.,ted
And I also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for In My World.,ted
"And the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it's not about just ideas.",ted
"In that way, what's happening is that we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking.",ted
"And they're going to push that up, from the bottom - up into, I believe, into the households.",ted
"And parents will be reacting to it, and trying to help them with the projects.",ted
"And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way, and starts to teach them.",ted
I want to help it; I want to do something with it.,ted
And these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some promotion for In My World.,ted
"So I was told I should do one for myself, and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.",ted
And I think there's a real possibility to reach new audiences if I had a chance.,ted
"So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday.",ted
And I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions that will change the lives of many people.,ted
"Thus 900,000 people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle.",ted
"Symptoms are often denied by the patient, particularly us men, because we are very brave.",ted
"We are very brave, and we don't want to admit that I'm having a hell of a chest pain.",ted
"Then, approximately 25 percent of all patients never have any symptoms.",ted
"Well, what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack?",ted
A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery.,ted
"But what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart, to the electrogram?",ted
"There was the baseline - first of all, a much bigger and more reliable signal.",ted
"It doesn't take much - every layperson could see that difference, and computers can be programmed to easily detect it.",ted
And it's not hard to see that - the baseline is the first picture on the upper left.,ted
We have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five years without needing replacement.,ted
And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table.,ted
"We're putting in a copper stent, and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks.",ted
"That's not very nice, but, after all, we had to find out what the answer is.",ted
But look what happened at 10:06 after we removed this pig's medication that kept him from having a heart attack.,ted
Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS - you see ST elevation?,ted
"Your rhythm becomes irregular, and that's what happened 45 minutes later.",ted
But we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life.,ted
"But when it comes to the sake of a human, we can save their life.",ted
We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack.,ted
"What is the response to acute myocardial infarction, a heart attack, today?",ted
It's not all that bad; you decide not to do anything.,ted
"Several hours pass and it gets worse, and even the man won't ignore it.",ted
"So we developed the AngelMed Guardian System and we have a device inside this patient, called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian.",ted
"It'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it.",ted
"And when it hits the mid-brain, that's when the headache begins.",ted
"There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura, and this visual aura, by the way -",ted
And what we tried was this; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10.,ted
"Weighs about 70 pounds, has a wire about an inch in diameter.",ted
"And here's one of the patients who has an aura and always has a headache, bad one, after the aura.",ted
"It's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side.",ted
"And that's a fully developed visual aura, as we see on top.",ted
That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current that's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain.,ted
For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches - and there are 30 million Americans who do - tonight: a possible answer.,ted
"Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight, with a small and portable machine that literally zaps your migraines away.",ted
"Well, my first reaction was that it was - looked awfully gun-like, and it was very strange.",ted
"But for Christina Sidebottom, almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migraine.",ted
Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer.,ted
"And auras can be erased and the migraine, then, does not occur.",ted
And that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on.,ted
"Now, why do we use - add on, nearly, an epileptic focus?",ted
"Now, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono, have to get into all these technical words.",ted
We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.,ted
Here we have our device in which we put in a frame.,ted
"And tonight, you'll be able to see the device in the tent.",ted
"And then with four screws, we put in a frame, then we snap in the device and we run with wires -",ted
"In the blue wire, we see what's called a deep brain electrode.",ted
"If that's the source of the epilepsy, we can attack that as well.",ted
"That concludes my discussion of epilepsy, which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon.",ted
"The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator, called RNS, for Responsive NeuroStimulator -",ted
"Well, if we're going to do it for epilepsy, why the hell not try it for something else?",ted
"Then you saw what that device looked like, that the woman was using to fix her migraines?",ted
And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations.,ted
And by reducing malpractice litigation - malpractice litigation is not an African problem; it's an American problem.,ted
"So, to get quickly to my first wish - the brain operates by electrical signals.",ted
"If the electrical signals create a brain disorder, electro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons.",ted
"The present portable device is far from optimally designed, both as to human factors as appearance.",ted
"Well, the third and final wish is somewhat - unfortunately, it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers.",ted
The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs.,ted
"For example, I asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent.",ted
What do you think someone has at the end of reading 12 single-spaced pages?,ted
The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs.,ted
"Now, in America, in fact, you cannot give up your right to trial by jury.",ted
"And, so there, that's the end of all my wishes.",ted
I got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world.,ted
"I was in India this past year, and I may have seen the last cases of polio in the world.",ted
"But first, I'm going to tell you a little bit about my own journey.",ted
My background is not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect.,ted
"I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived on the island for several weeks.",ted
I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called Medicine Ball Caravan.,ted
"Our bus ride took us from San Francisco to London, then we switched buses at the big pond.",ted
"This is us at the Khyber Pass, and that's our bus.",ted
"And then, like everyone else in our generation, we went to live in a Himalayan monastery.",ted
"This is just like a residency program, for those of you that are in medical school.",ted
"This little girl is Rahima Banu, and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world.",ted
"And this document is the certificate that the global commission signed, certifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history.",ted
"I'm going to ask you to repeat that: early detection, early response.",ted
"This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health,",ted
But to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective.,ted
"You should see it from the perspective of a mother, watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly.",ted
"Day one, day two, day three, day four, day five, day six.",ted
"We didn't have Google, we didn't have web crawlers, we didn't have computers.",ted
"And by day 20, while he will be scarred for life, he will live.",ted
"Flat smallpox, which killed 100 percent of people who got it.",ted
"And hemorrhagic smallpox, the most cruel of all, which had a predilection for pregnant women.",ted
I've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant woman.,ted
"In 1967, the WHO embarked on what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease.",ted
"There are 21 linguistic states in India, which is like saying 21 different countries.",ted
It wasn't just India that had smallpox deities; smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world.,ted
"So, how we eradicated smallpox was - mass vaccination wouldn't work.",ted
"Every time we did a house-to-house search, we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox.",ted
"When we didn't search, we had the illusion that there was no disease.",ted
"When we did search, we had the illusion that there was more disease.",ted
"A surveillance system was necessary, because what we needed was early detection, early response.",ted
"So we searched and we searched, and we found every case of smallpox in India.",ted
"And as we did that, the number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero.",ted
"It was the largest campaign in United Nations history, until the Iraq war.",ted
"But the key to eradicating polio is early detection, early response.",ted
"And David Heymann, who's watching this on the webcast - David, keep on going.",ted
Let's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about.,ted
The polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door.,ted
You can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there.,ted
"In your TED packages there's a DVD, Infinite Vision, about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital.",ted
"Aravind, which started as a Seva project, is now the world's largest and best eye hospital.",ted
"This year, that one hospital will give back sight to more than 300,000 people in Tamil Nadu, India.",ted
I stand here as a representative of all terrible things - this might be the worst.,ted
The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response.,ted
The moment WHO says we've moved to category four - this will not be like Katrina.,ted
I did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in October.,ted
What do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic?,ted
"If it happens, how bad do you think it will be?",ted
Fifteen percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within three years.,ted
"And they thought that if there was a pandemic, a billion people would get sick.",ted
"And it's getting worse, because travel is getting so much better.",ted
Let me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like.,ted
"Let's assume, for example, that the first case occurs in South Asia.",ted
"This is an epidemic curve, and everyone in medicine, I think, ultimately gets to know what it is.",ted
"But the joke is, an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve.",ted
"What we really want is to arrive right here, so we can stop the epidemic.",ted
And that simulation that I showed you that you thought was bird flu - that was SARS.,ted
We need an early-warning system to protect us against the things that are humanity's worst nightmare.,ted
And so my TED wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences.,ted
"So instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu, we find it and immediately contain it.",ted
"Instead of industrial accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in Bhopal, we find them, and we respond to them.",ted
"Instead of famine, hidden until it is too late, we detect it, and we respond.",ted
"Let's increase the websites that they crawl from 20,000 to 20 million.",ted
"Let's increase the languages they crawl from seven to 70, or more.",ted
And we'll add Gapminder's amazing graphics to the front end.,ted
"Well, as Ron St. John - I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him.",ted
"When he started GPHIN - In 1997, there was an outbreak of bird flu - H5N1.",ted
"Then a number of years went by, and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu.",ted
"And now, their reporting percentage is down to 50 percent, because other nations have started to report.",ted
These bad viruses really don't have any intention of showing up first in English or Spanish or French.,ted
I want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can.,ted
"Well, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said on his first successful telephone call, Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?",ted
"As another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said, What a strange, long trip.",ted
"And he should have said, What a strange, long trip it's about to become.",ted
My lower half is appearing at a different conference in a different country.,ted
"You can, it turns out, be in two places at once.",ted
"But still, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person.",ted
But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players.,ted
"If you wanted to make a film, you needed a mass of equipment and a Hollywood budget.",ted
"Now, you need a camera that fits in your palm, and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD.",ted
I'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large.,ted
What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints.,ted
The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world.,ted
From the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged.,ted
And that's actually what I'd like to talk about today.,ted
"First, though, I should probably explain why, and how, I got to this place.",ted
"You may remember that song, We Are the World, or,",ted
"Another very tall, grizzled rock star, my friend Sir Bob Geldof, issued a challenge to feed the world.",ted
"It was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life.",ted
"That summer, my wife, Ali, and myself went to Ethiopia.",ted
We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on.,ted
"We lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage.",ted
Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back.,ted
Ethiopia didn't just blow my mind; it opened my mind.,ted
"He knew, in Ireland, that his son would live, and that in Ethiopia, his son would die.",ted
"And it was a funny kind of sick feeling, but I turned him down.",ted
"In that moment, I became the worst thing of all: I became a rock star with a cause.",ted
"Today, every day, 9,000 more Africans will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education.",ted
And what we're facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality.,ted
"The next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is, and what this problem isn't.",ted
"And that's too bad, because we're very good at charity.",ted
"You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice.",ted
"As you heard in the film, anywhere else, not here.",ted
"In fact, a head of state that you're all familiar with admitted this to me.",ted
There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa.,ted
"We're standing around with watering cans, when what we really need is the fire brigade.",ted
Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain?,ted
"The slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough, it would appear.",ted
Catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones we could avert.,ted
"Anyway, I believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room.",ted
"I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror, it could be soon.",ted
The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty.,ted
The problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re-describe ourselves to the world.,ted
"We will not only transform other people's lives, but we will also transform the way those other lives see us.",ted
"In certain quarters of the world, brand EU, brand USA, is not at its shiniest.",ted
"But that's just the easy part, or ought to be.",ted
"But equality for Africa - that's a big, expensive idea.",ted
"You see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference.",ted
"We can't fix every problem, but the ones we can, I want to argue, we must.",ted
A whole continent written off - we do not have to stand for this.,ted
And let me say this without a trace of irony - before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies.,ted
"I can't; you can't, as individuals; but we can change the world.",ted
But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for.,ted
"It is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier, headier days.",ted
"This room was born for this moment, is really what I want to say to you tonight.",ted
"Most of you started out wanting to change the world, didn't you?",ted
"Well, now, actually because of you, it is possible to change the physical world.",ted
"Economists confirm it, and they know much more than I do.",ted
"So why, then, are we not pumping our fists into the air?",ted
"Probably because when we admit we can do something about it, we've got to do something about it.",ted
"I hope this is obvious, but I'm not a hippie.",ted
"And I'm not really one for the warm, fuzzy feeling.",ted
"But idealism allied with pragmatism, with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit, is very exciting.",ted
"Well, we feel that now is the time to prove we're right.",ted
This could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth.,ted
"I have been, of late, disappointed with the Bush Administration.",ted
"They made some really great promises, and actually have fulfilled a lot of them.",ted
"They don't feel the push from the ground, is the truth.",ted
"But there's much more push from the ground than you'd think, if we got organized.",ted
"Putting it in the crassest possible terms, the investment reaps huge returns.",ted
"Not only in lives saved, but in goodwill, stability and security that we'll gain.",ted
"Because we also need your intellectual capital: your ideas, your skills, your ingenuity.",ted
"And you, at this conference, are in a unique position.",ted
"Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital, and pushed the boundaries.",ted
"As I say, there're two things on the line here.",ted
"Artists, politicians, pop stars, priests, CEOs, NGOs, mothers' unions, student unions.",ted
"A lot of people are getting together, and working under this umbrella I told you about earlier, the ONE Campaign.",ted
"When the history books get written, I think our age will be remembered for three things.",ted
"Really, it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for.",ted
And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa.,ted
I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes.,ted
"Most of them impossible, some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral.",ted
"This business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean, when somebody else is picking up the tab.",ted
I wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million American activists for Africa.,ted
"A few minutes ago, I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up.",ted
We know there's more than enough energy to power this movement.,ted
We can't afford to be cool and sit this one out.,ted
"I do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong, we're not going to be denied.",ted
"We'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book, and right into the Oval Office.",ted
"Anyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up.",ted
I would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day.,ted
"Steve Case, Larry, Sergey - they've done a lot already.",ted
"We have a film, produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media.",ted
"But you know, we want, we need some airtime for our ideas.",ted
We need to get the math; we need to get the statistics out to the American people.,ted
"And, the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers.",ted
"This has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.",ted
"One by one they step forward, a nurse, a teacher, a homemaker, and lives are saved.",ted
"One more person, letter, voice will mean the difference between life and death for millions of people.",ted
"I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia, every health clinic, every hospital - we can connect to the Internet.",ted
I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that.,ted
And that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true.,ted
The first long-distance line from Boston to New York was used in 1885 on the phone.,ted
"It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa was connected by phone to Harare, which is 500 kilometers away.",ted
The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years.,ted
"Anyway, I'm Irish, and as you can see, I know how important talking is.",ted
"Nurses getting better training, pharmacists being able to order supplies, doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine.",ted
"It's a very, very good idea to get them wired.",ted
And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference.,ted
"So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl, If you say a word often enough, it becomes you.",ted
"I was also inspired by Walt Whitman, who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.",ted
"Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?",ted
So I thought he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.,ted
"You know, he was born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank, greatest ship every built.",ted
"Hits the tip of an iceberg, and bam, it went down.",ted
So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.,ted
"Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit.",ted
"The Atlanta airport is a modern airport, and they should leave the gate there.",ted
These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.,ted
"And these trains are smooth, and they're quiet and they're efficient.",ted
"You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans.",ted
"And that voice, without losing a beat, says, 'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.'",ted
"Everybody laughs when I say that, but not on this train.",ted
"Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother.",ted
I know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion.,ted
"I say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.'",ted
"But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.",ted
"You know, you see, you've got to question the official truth.",ted
"We read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course.",ted
"Remember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did?",ted
"And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see.",ted
"Ooh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal; he's going to do a terrible thing.'",ted
"Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim. '",ted
So you ask about a defining moment - ain't no defining moment in American history for me.,ted
"It's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now, where trivia becomes news.",ted
"And more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other.",ted
"Okay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist.",ted
"And I'm doing her because I think we think of risk, at a conference like this, as a good thing.",ted
"But there are certain other connotations to the word risk, and the same thing about the word nature.",ted
"And then intellectually, I don't know enough about the negative imagination.",ted
And September 11th certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate.,ted
"It raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is, and about what a risk can be.",ted
"And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems, and this is called A Mirror to Her Mouth.",ted
I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises.,ted
But that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare.,ted
"And I failed them dramatically, because I allowed it to go on and on and on.",ted
"And so he put her in the bathtub, and I was in the bedroom with the baby.",ted
"And four months before this happened, four months before Myesha died, I thought I could really fix this man.",ted
"And when she got up, she says she couldn't see.",ted
All around her head was just swollen; her head was about two sizes of its own size.,ted
"He went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited.",ted
"We told a security guard that she was missing, though she wasn't missing.",ted
"And then we got the baby and my other child, and we drove out to, like,",ted
"I was so petrified and so numb, all I could look was in the rear-view mirror.",ted
And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway.,ted
"And so I went to both - two race riots, one of which was the Los Angeles riot.",ted
"Because this is what I would say I've learned the most about race relations, from this piece.",ted
"It's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.",ted
Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King.,ted
It was captured on videotape - technology - and it was played all over the world.,ted
"And what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial, ordered by George Bush,",ted
"And I mean, the people just danced in the streets because they were afraid there was going to be another riot.",ted
"So there was a community that didn't - the Korean-Americans, whose stores had been burned to the ground.",ted
"And she asks also a question that Studs talks about: this notion of the official truth, to question the official truth.",ted
"So what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society.",ted
"We didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR, no welfare, anything.",ted
Many African-Americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive.,ted
We didn't get any because we have a car and a house.,ted
Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial.,ted
"And they say, 'Well, finally justice has been done in this society.'",ted
"They have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King.",ted
He is the only model for black community; I don't care Jesse Jackson.,ted
"He is the model of non-violence, non-violence - and they would all like to be in his spirit.",ted
"And I wonder if that is really justice for them, to get their rights in that way.",ted
"I was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them.",ted
Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims who were destroyed by them.,ted
That's why I understand; that's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.,ted
"But I wish that, I wish that, I wish that I could be part of the enjoyment.",ted
"And I told you that in - you know, I didn't give you the year, but in '79",ted
"Finally, I did find a bull rider, two years ago.",ted
"And I've been going to the rodeos with him, and we've bonded.",ted
"I mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene,",ted
"It seems like he has so much bad luck, you know.",ted
"I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan, and there was a Reader's Digest, October 2002.",ted
"And it says if you want to get lucky, you know, you've got to be around positive people.",ted
She's just talking; she's just being nice to you.,ted
You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.',ted
"I said, 'Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours.",ted
"Well, I think I ride more out of determination than confidence.",ted
"I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way.",ted
"But determination, you know, it's like just, you know, '",ted
"That's Tuff Hedeman, in the movie '8 Seconds.'",ted
"Determination is, like, you're going to hang on that bull, even if you're riding upside down.",ted
"Determination's like, you're going to ride till your head hits the back of the dirt.",ted
"Well, you know, I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too.",ted
"I mean, look how we are, the roughy family, palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me.",ted
"It's like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas.",ted
"We ride together, we, you know, we, we eat together and we sleep together.",ted
"I mean, I have my ranch and everything, but I actually don't even want to think the day that comes.",ted
And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out.,ted
"I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia, or whatever you call it.",ted
"So, sorry - it just feels like I should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting.",ted
But it was also the largest city that had ever been built.,ted
"And it was in many ways, at this point in the mid-1850s, a complete disaster.",ted
They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an Elizabethan public infrastructure.,ted
"So people, for instance, just to gross you out for a second, had cesspools of human waste in their basement.",ted
"Not just because of the cesspools, but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people.",ted
"So, you would just walk around London at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench.",ted
And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem.,ted
"It's a waterborne disease, not something that's in the air.",ted
It's not something you smell or inhale; it's something you ingest.,ted
The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say.,ted
"And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies, but nothing had really stuck.",ted
And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored.,ted
He suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source.,ted
One single thing that everybody was going to because it didn't have the traditional slower path of infections that you might expect.,ted
"He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure, who's kind of the other protagonist of the book -",ted
He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick.,ted
People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick.,ted
Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood.,ted
"As you get further and further away from the pump, the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent.",ted
And so you can see this something poisonous emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance.,ted
And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since.,ted
And what it ended up doing is making the idea of large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one.,ted
And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map.,ted
What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world.,ted
I'm not going to talk about The Skeptical Environmentalist - probably that's also a good choice.,ted
But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world?,ted
"Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world.",ted
There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change - so on.,ted
"In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't.",ted
We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world.,ted
"The obvious question would be to ask, what do you think are the biggest things?",ted
That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January.,ted
"But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems.",ted
Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die.,ted
"But we don't have a technology to solve that, right?",ted
"So the point is not to prioritize problems, but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems.",ted
And that would be - of course that gets a little more complicated.,ted
"To communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets.",ted
"To conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on.",ted
"I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process, and that's actually what we did.",ted
"Of course, you have to ask yourself, why on Earth was such a list never done before?",ted
"Of course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list.",ted
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list.,ted
"There are many, many things we can do out there, but we've not had the prices, nor the sizes.",ted
"Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card, but you have no idea what the price is.",ted
"You know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is.",ted
"It could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars.",ted
"It could be a family-size pizza; it could be a very individual-size pizza, right?",ted
And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do - to try to put prices on these issues.,ted
"And so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process.",ted
"We got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area.",ted
So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change.,ted
What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that?,ted
"Three of the world's top experts saying, what can we do?",ted
"What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome?",ted
The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics.,ted
"That works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here.",ted
And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list.,ted
"The point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria, you ask a malaria expert.",ted
"If you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist.",ted
"So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you.",ted
"Of course, you can also see it on the website, and we'll also talk about it more,",ted
"Then there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects.",ted
"And of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing.",ted
I'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects.,ted
As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change.,ted
"And I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious.",ted
"But it's saying that what we can do about it is very little, at a very high cost.",ted
That's two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year.,ted
All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100.,ted
So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106.,ted
"We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet.",ted
"So we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good?",ted
"It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it.",ted
"It would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly.",ted
"Again, what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation.",ted
"If you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in.",ted
"Again, sanitation and water is incredibly important, but it also costs a lot of infrastructure.",ted
The incidence of malaria is about a couple of million people get infected every year.,ted
It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations.,ted
"If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years, we could bring that incidence down to half.",ted
"Basically, about half of the world's population is lacking in iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A.",ted
"If we invest about 12 billion dollars, we could make a severe inroad into that problem.",ted
"And again, in an ideal world, we would do both.",ted
"So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more by investing in prevention.",ted
"So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment, at first rate.",ted
What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities.,ted
"I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say, did you get it right?",ted
Or did you get close to what we came up with here?,ted
"Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again.",ted
"I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.",ted
"We should also do climate change, if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem.",ted
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good.,ted
"Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are.",ted
So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight.,ted
Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem.,ted
"Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures.",ted
"So in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems.",ted
To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good.,ted
"Of course, we should do all things, in an ideal world - I would certainly agree.",ted
"I think we should do all things, but we don't.",ted
So it doesn't look like we're actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems.,ted
"Likewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war?",ted
"If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine.",ted
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities.,ted
"I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out?",ted
"You know, when you ask the world's best economists, you inevitably end up asking old, white American men.",ted
"And they're not necessarily, you know, great ways of looking at the entire world.",ted
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem.,ted
"The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university, and they spoke English.",ted
"There's been many other seminars and university students, and different things.",ted
"Of course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything.",ted
"But if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start?",ted
"We did it in 2004, and we hope to assemble many more people, getting much better information for 2008, 2012.",ted
Map out the right path for the world - but also to start thinking about political triage.,ted
"If we worry too much about some things, we end by not worrying about other things.",ted
"So I hope this will help us make better priorities, and think about how we better work for the world.",ted
"And they were just made in a community of bikers, mainly in Northern California.",ted
"Thirty years later, mountain bike sales and mountain bike equipment account for 65 percent of bike sales in America.",ted
So this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about.,ted
"The traditional view, still enshrined in much of the way that we think about creativity - in organizations, in government -",ted
"What's the policy recommendation out of that if you're in government, or you're running a large company?",ted
"Build creative clusters in cities; create more R&amp;D parks, so on and so forth.",ted
"The ideas are coming back from the consumers, and they're often ahead of the producers.",ted
"And when you get a radical innovation, it's often very uncertain how it can be applied.",ted
The whole history of telephony is a story of dealing with that uncertainty.,ted
"More and more, the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance.",ted
"It will be worked out in use, in collaboration with users.",ted
"The truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative; like Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time.",ted
"The second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations.",ted
And just look inside large organizations and you'll see why that is so.,ted
Big corporations have an in-built tendency to reinforce past success.,ted
They've got so much sunk in it that it's very difficult for them to spot emerging new markets.,ted
"Emerging new markets, then, are the breeding grounds for passionate users.",ted
That sounds like a winner; we'll go with it. .,ted
"They do it on their own tapes, with their own recording equipment; they distribute it themselves.",ted
Had to start - this is the third point - with these pro-ams.,ted
"Largely through globalization, a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper.",ted
"More knowledgeable consumers, more educated, more able to connect with one another, more able to do things together.",ted
"Consumption, in that sense, is an expression of their productive potential.",ted
"Why, we found, people were interested in this, is that at work they don't feel very expressed.",ted
"Twenty years ago, 30 years ago, only big professional astronomers with very big telescopes could see far into space.",ted
"So here in astronomy, you have this vast explosion of new productive resources.",ted
"Well, just imagine a world, for the moment, divided into two camps.",ted
"Over here, let's imagine we've got Wikipedia, Linux, and beyond - open source.",ted
"These people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding, because they're threatened by them.",ted
What we're seeing is a complete corruption of the idea of patents and copyright.,ted
"The first is: imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying, I've got a fantastic idea.",ted
"I've invented this brilliant new program that is much, much better than Microsoft Outlook.",ted
And you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube to see if they were reading your article.,ted
"Shock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers.",ted
That's not their role; they're supposed to read what we write.,ted
"They want to, as Jimmy said, they want to have a dialogue, a conversation.",ted
What's happening there is that the whole domain of creativity is expanding.,ted
"But, also, there's going to be tremendous movement from the open to the closed.",ted
"If this is so critical, do we not need it funded, organized, supported in much more structured ways?",ted
What kind of changes do we need in public policy and funding to make that possible?,ted
"What's the role of the BBC, for instance, in that world?",ted
"And finally, what I think you will see is the intelligent, closed organizations moving increasingly in the open direction.",ted
"New organizational models coming about, mixing closed and open in tricky ways.",ted
Let me just give you one final example of what that means.,ted
"Didn't go into the Internet, kept his money, decided to go into computer games.",ted
"He runs a company called Shanda, which is the largest computer games company in China.",ted
"At any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games.",ted
"Well, how can he service 250 million people from 500 employees?",ted
"But actually, a lot of the content is created by the users themselves.",ted
"And it creates a kind of stickiness between the community and the company which is really, really powerful.",ted
"If, for some reason, your credit card bounces, or there's some other problem, you lose your character.",ted
"One option: you can create a new character, right from scratch, but with none of the history of your player.",ted
"Every morning, there are 600 people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters.",ted
"So this is about companies built on communities, that provide communities with tools, resources, platforms in which they can share.",ted
"He's not open source, but it's very, very powerful.",ted
"Imagine you could take all the children in education in Britain, and one percent of them were co-developers of education.",ted
What would that do to the resources available to the education system?,ted
"And one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers, consumers into designers.",ted
I was worried what we think about vaginas and even more worried that we don't think about them.,ted
"It needed a context, a culture, a community of other vaginas.",ted
"In the first place, it's not so easy to even find your vagina.",ted
"Women go days, weeks, months, without looking at it.",ted
I interviewed a high-powered businesswoman; she told me she didn't have time.,ted
"Looking at your vagina, she said, is a full day's work.",ted
"You've got to get down there on your back, in front of a mirror, full-length preferred.",ted
"You're twisting your head up, arching your back, it's exhausting.",ted
"They began as casual vagina interviews, and they turned into vagina monologues.",ted
"I talked to older women, younger women, married women, lesbians, single women.",ted
"I talked to corporate professionals, college professors, actors, sex workers.",ted
"I talked to African-American women, Asian-American women, Native-American women, Caucasian women, Jewish women.",ted
"OK, at first women were a little shy, a little reluctant to talk.",ted
"Let's just start with the word vagina - vagina, vagina.",ted
"It doesn't matter how many times you say the word, it never sounds like a word you want to say.",ted
I'm worried what we call them and don't call them.,ted
"In Great Neck, New York, they call it a Pussycat.",ted
"A woman told me there her mother used to tell her, Don't wear panties, dear, underneath your pajamas.",ted
"In Westchester, they call it a Pooki, in New Jersey, a twat.",ted
And she said things that really shocked me about her vagina - that it was dried-up and finished and dead -,ted
"So I said to a friend casually, Well, what do you think about your vagina?",ted
I don't know that that would have been my life ambition.,ted
"I think before I did the Vagina Monologues, I didn't really believe in happiness.",ted
"I mistook happiness for a lot of other things, like numbness or decadence or selfishness.",ted
"One is seeing what's right in front of you, and talking about it, and stating it.",ted
"And then I wrote those stories down, and I put them out in front of other people.",ted
"Oh great, I'll hear about wonderful orgasms, and great sex lives, and how women love their vaginas.",ted
"But in fact, that's not what women lined up to tell me.",ted
"And I wanted to stop doing the Vagina Monologues, because it felt too daunting.",ted
"I felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events, but doesn't intervene on their behalf.",ted
"And so in 1997, I said, Let's get women together.",ted
What could we do with this information that all these women are being violated?,ted
"That's essentially a gender; that's essentially the resource of the planet, which is women.",ted
"And in one year, it went to 50 colleges, and then it expanded.",ted
"For those of you who don't know, it was illegal to eat ice cream under the Taliban.",ted
And I actually saw and met women who had been flogged for being caught eating vanilla ice cream.,ted
"It has taken me, this journey, to Islamabad, where I have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off.",ted
"It has taken me to universities all over this country, where girls are date-raped and drugged.",ted
What has also happened is in the course of these travels - and it's been an extraordinary thing -,ted
And I really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea.,ted
"It's a body world, and the species really exists in the body.",ted
And the connection between body and head often brings those things into union.,ted
"She was 14 years old, and she was in a marriage and her husband was beating her on a regular basis.",ted
"And she couldn't get out, because she was addicted to the relationship, and she had no money.",ted
She did become a finalist; she brought Marsha to New York.,ted
I went to Guatemala and she had sold out the National Theater of Guatemala.,ted
"There's a woman named Esther ChÐÐvez who I met in Juarez, Mexico.",ted
"There has been no response to the disappearance, and not one person has been held accountable.",ted
"We were there a week ago, when there were 7,000 people in the street, and it was truly a miracle.",ted
"And Agnes, for me, epitomizes what a vagina warrior is.",ted
"And in that time, she created an alternative ritual, which involved girls coming of age without the cut.",ted
"When we met her three years ago, we said, What could V-Day do for you?",ted
"And she said, Well, if you got me a jeep, I could get around a lot faster.",ted
"And in the year that she had the jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.",ted
"So we said to her, What else could we do for you?",ted
"And I want to tell this little story about my own beginnings, because it's very interrelated to happiness and Agnes.",ted
"And everyone was supposed to be happy in that community, and, in fact, my life was hell.",ted
"I lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me, and it was all inside that.",ted
And always as a child I had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me.,ted
And I actually made up a little character whose name was Mr. Alligator.,ted
"I would call him up when things got really bad, and say it was time to come and pick me up.",ted
And I would pack a little bag and wait for Mr. Alligator to come.,ted
"And Agnes hadn't let me come to the house for days, because they were preparing this whole ritual.",ted
"But being a vagina warrior, she kept going, and she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness.",ted
"And in the Maasai community, goats and cows are the most valued possession.",ted
"And it hit me in that moment that it had taken 47 years, but that Mr. Alligator had finally shown up.",ted
This thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time.,ted
People like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s.,ted
"So, for instance, we have a lava lamp application here.",ted
"Now, you can see, I can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze and put the blobs together.",ted
"I can inject heat into the system here, or I can pull it apart with two of my fingers.",ted
"This started out as a screensaver app that one of the Ph.D. students in our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made.",ted
"Chris could be interacting with another part of Lava, while I play around with it here.",ted
"I'll show you a little more of a concrete example here, as this thing loads.",ted
"Again, I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around.",ted
"If I grab the canvas, I can do the same thing - stretch it out.",ted
"I can do it simultaneously, holding this down, and gripping on another one, stretching this out.",ted
"This is exactly what you expect, especially if you haven't interacted with a computer before.",ted
This is something that I think is really the way we should be interacting with machines from now on.,ted
"Obviously, this is a standard keyboard, but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands.",ted
We have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces should start conforming to us.,ted
There's so little applied now to actually improving the way we interact with interfaces from this point on.,ted
Jeff Han: I'm a research scientist at NYU in New York.,ted
"What's neat about that is, I showed that two-finger gesture that zooms in really quickly.",ted
This is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization.,ted
"We have all this great data, but for some reason, it's just sitting there.",ted
We've all seen Google Earth; this is an open-source version of that.,ted
There are plug-ins to be able to load in different data sets that NASA's collected over the years.,ted
"As you can see, I can use the same two-fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly.",ted
"It really allows anybody to kind of go in - and it just does what you'd expect, you know?",ted
These hyper-spectral images are false-colored so you can - it's really good for determining vegetative use.,ted
"So, again, with a multi-point interface, you can do a gesture like this -",ted
It's not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D panning and motion.,ted
"It's just so much fun playing around with it, too.",ted
I'm more interested in the creative applications we can do with this.,ted
"Now, here's a simple application here - I can draw out a curve.",ted
But the neat thing about it is I can add control points.,ted
And then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time.,ted
"It's kind of a puppeteering thing, where I can use as many fingers as I have to draw and make -",ted
"This technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here, with multiple control points, is actually state of the art.",ted
"So, multi-touch interaction research is a very active field right now in HCI.",ted
"I'm not the only one doing it, a lot of other people are getting into it.",ted
"There have been three themes running through the conference, which are relevant to what I want to talk about.",ted
"Actually, what I find is, everybody has an interest in education.",ted
"But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, What do you do?",ted
"So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do.",ted
"If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065.",ted
"And yet, we're meant to be educating them for it.",ted
"I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she?",ted
"And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood.",ted
What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent.,ted
"And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.",ted
"So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity.",ted
"My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.",ted
I heard a great story recently - I love telling it - of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson.,ted
"She went over to her, and she said, What are you drawing?",ted
"And the girl said, I'm drawing a picture of God.",ted
"When my son was four in England - actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.",ted
"If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year.",ted
"But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about.",ted
"He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in?",ted
"The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads.",ted
"They put these boxes down, and the first boy said, I bring you gold.",ted
What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance.,ted
I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative.,ted
"And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity.",ted
And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make.,ted
And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.,ted
"Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists.",ted
"I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it.",ted
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago.,ted
"Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born.",ted
"You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you?",ted
"Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you?",ted
"Being sent to bed by his dad, to Shakespeare, Go to bed, now!",ted
"Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition.",ted
"I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.",ted
"Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16.",ted
"And we were rather pleased about that, frankly - because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.",ted
"You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't.",ted
"And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts.",ted
Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance.,ted
There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics.,ted
"Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do.",ted
"Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up.",ted
"If you were to visit education as an alien and say What's it for, public education?",ted
And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious about professors.,ted
"In my experience - not all of them, but typically - they live in their heads.",ted
"They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way.",ted
They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.,ted
"Waiting until it ends, so they can go home and write a paper about it.",ted
"Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century.",ted
"Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top.",ted
"If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance.",ted
And I think we can't afford to go on that way.,ted
"When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job.",ted
"If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one.",ted
And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet.,ted
We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it.,ted
"We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically.",ted
"By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum.",ted
"Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multitasking.",ted
"There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life.",ted
"I say, Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here.",ted
"I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see.",ted
"And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, We think Gillian has a learning disorder.",ted
"But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point.",ted
"We won't be very long, and they went and left her.",ted
"But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk.",ted
"And when they got out of the room, he said to her mother, Just stand and watch her.",ted
"And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music.",ted
She became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.,ted
"She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber.",ted
Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down.,ted
Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson.,ted
Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth for a particular commodity.,ted
We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children.,ted
"If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years, all forms of life would flourish.",ted
"And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future.",ted
"By the way - we may not see this future, but they will.",ted
Or even the challenges of nation-states in the modern global economy.,ted
And that's - - that's rather more challenging than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me.,ted
"To which the answer is, The extroverted statistician's the one who looks at the other person's shoes.",ted
"But I want to tell you something useful - and here it is, so concentrate now.",ted
"This evening, there's a reception in the University's Museum of Natural History.",ted
"Well, except they've been pre-warned now, and they'll know you're making it up.",ted
They'll either discover their long-lost cousin in the other corner of the room and run over and talk to them.,ted
And you'll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to.,ted
It's one of the challenges in our profession to try and explain what we do.,ted
We're not top on people's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on.,ted
And it's something I've never really found a good way of doing.,ted
But my wife - who was then my girlfriend - managed it much better than I've ever been able to.,ted
"She told this to one of her colleagues, who said, Well, what does your boyfriend do?",ted
"Sarah thought quite hard about the things I'd explained - and she concentrated, in those days, on listening.",ted
And she was thinking about the work I did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern genetics.,ted
"Well, Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said, Genes.",ted
"That is my first love, and that's what I'll tell you a little bit about.",ted
"You've got to think, and I'm going to ask you some questions.",ted
So here's the scene for the first question I'm going to ask you.,ted
And for some reason - which shall remain rather vague - we're interested in a particular pattern.,ted
"Here's one - a head, followed by a tail, followed by a tail.",ted
"Then the pattern, head-tail-tail, that we've suddenly become fixated with happens here.",ted
"So you might think there are more interesting things to do, but humor me for the moment.",ted
"The first time they do it, maybe it happens after the 10th toss, as here.",ted
"So you do that lots and lots of times, and you average those numbers.",ted
"So, on this side, you get out your coins, and you toss and toss and toss.",ted
And you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-head appears and you average them.,ted
"On this side, you've got a number - the average number of tosses until head-tail-head.",ted
"So here's a deep mathematical fact - if you've got two numbers, one of three things must be true.",ted
"Either they're the same, or this one's bigger than this one, or this one's bigger than that one.",ted
"So you've all got to think about this, and you've all got to vote -",ted
"Who thinks that B is true - that on average, they're the same?",ted
The champagne's on ice just next to you; you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate.,ted
"If it's a tail - well, rather disappointedly, you put the glasses away and put the champagne back.",ted
"And you keep tossing, to wait for the next head, to get excited.",ted
It's the same for the first two parts of the sequence.,ted
You're a little bit excited with the first head - you get rather more excited with the next tail.,ted
"If it's a head you're disappointed, but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again.",ted
"This is my little diversion into my real passion, which is genetics.",ted
"When you toss a coin, you get a sequence of heads and tails.",ted
"When you look at DNA, there's a sequence of not two things - heads and tails - but four letters -",ted
"And there are little chemical scissors, called restriction enzymes which cut DNA whenever they see particular patterns.",ted
And we'll hear some talks later in the conference specifically about that.,ted
That was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome.,ted
To try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases.,ted
"So that's, as I said, the little diversion on my main love.",ted
Back to some of the more mundane issues of thinking about uncertainty.,ted
"Well, you're right to be a bit skeptical, because that's not the answer.",ted
"It's not the answer, and it's not because it's only part of the story.",ted
It actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is.,ted
"So let's think about a disease that affects - it's pretty rare, it affects one person in 10,000.",ted
"Amongst these million individuals, most of them are healthy and some of them will have the disease.",ted
"Amongst all these other people who don't have the disease, the test will get it right 99 percent of the time.",ted
But there are so many of them that there'll be an enormous number of false positives.,ted
"Put that another way - of all of them who test positive - so here they are,",ted
Each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit.,ted
"To cut a long story short, she was convicted at the time.",ted
"Later, and fairly recently, acquitted on appeal - in fact, on the second appeal.",ted
"And it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics horribly wrong, in two different ways.",ted
"So he said, Here, I'll assume that these events are independent.",ted
"When you multiply 8,500 together twice, you get about 73 million.",ted
And none of this was stated to the court as an assumption or presented to the jury that way.,ted
There are lots and lots of things that we don't know about sudden infant deaths.,ted
"So if a family suffers from one cot death, you'd put them in a high-risk group.",ted
"Nonetheless, that's how it was presented, and at trial nobody even argued it.",ted
"The second problem is, what does the number of one in 73 million mean?",ted
"And the other one was the chance, a priori, that the person had the disease or not.",ted
"We want to know how likely, or relatively how likely, two different explanations are.",ted
And the second part of the explanation is that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event.,ted
"Not as unlikely as one in 73 million, but nonetheless rather unlikely.",ted
"And we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that's unlikely, because of the presumption of innocence.",ted
"And then if she were trying to kill the children, she succeeded.",ted
So the chance that she's innocent isn't one in 73 million.,ted
It has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence.,ted
"What matters is how likely or unlikely, relative to each other, the two explanations are.",ted
There's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences.,ted
And it's particularly topical because he's currently facing a disrepute charge at Britain's General Medical Council.,ted
So just to conclude - what are the take-home messages from this?,ted
"Well, we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life.",ted
We can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly - and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here.,ted
"All of quality control, which has had a major impact on industrial processing, is underpinned by statistics.",ted
"At the very least, we should recognize that, and we tend not to.",ted
"To go back to the legal context, at the Sally Clark trial all of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said.",ted
"So if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury, I know how to build bridges.",ted
"Please drive your car home over it, they would have said, Well, pediatricians don't know how to build bridges.",ted
"On the other hand, he came out and effectively said, or implied, I know how to reason with uncertainty.",ted
So we need to understand where our competence is and isn't.,ted
"Forensic scientists said, The chance that this guy's innocent is one in three million.",ted
"Even if you believe the number, just like the 73 million to one, that's not what it meant.",ted
And there have been celebrated appeal cases in Britain and elsewhere because of that.,ted
"It's all very well to say, Let's do our best to present the evidence.",ted
We sort of expect it of politicians and don't hope for much more.,ted
"It was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election, eliciting various counter-measures by Israel.",ted
"Now, in one sense, the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial.",ted
"Because what happened in the beginning, this stuff encases itself in a cell, then cells start hanging out together in societies.",ted
"Eventually they get so close, they form multicellular organisms, then you get complex multicellular organisms; they form societies.",ted
"And amazingly, that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity.",ted
"So, what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse is the collapse of global social organization.",ted
"Originally, you had the most complex societies, the hunter-gatherer village.",ted
"I want to stress, you know, social organization can transcend political bounds.",ted
This is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire.,ted
"So you had social complexity spanning the whole continent, even if no polity did similarly.",ted
Point is: there's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds.,ted
Does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system.,ted
"Now, I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called non-zero sumness.",ted
"Non-zero-sum games in which correlations can be positive, OK.",ted
"So like in tennis, usually it's win-lose; it always adds up to zero-zero-sum.",ted
"It's either for the better or for the worse, OK.",ted
"The argument I make is basically that, well, non-zero-sum games have always been part of life.",ted
Those are people in effect you're playing a non-zero-sum game with.,ted
"Well, there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat.",ted
"First of all, it can accommodate; it doesn't deny the existence of inequality exploitation war.",ted
"So, in a way, the question is: on what grounds am I upbeat at all about history?",ted
"On balance, I think history is a net positive in the non-zero-sum game department.",ted
"And then this moral revolution arrived, and they decided that actually, no, Greeks are human beings.",ted
It's just the Persians who aren't fully human and don't deserve to be treated very nicely.,ted
"And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been, OK.",ted
"I think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities, ethnicities, religions as there is today.",ted
I kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality.,ted
"As it has moved global, moved us toward a global level of social organization, it has driven us toward moral truth.",ted
"Well, first of all, I would emphasize that it fits into the non-zero-sum framework, OK.",ted
"If they get more happy, it'll be good for the West.",ted
It's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible.,ted
And one reason is because of something I call the growing lethality of hatred.,ted
"More and more, it's possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil.",ted
What I have in mind is: terrorism happens here; we overreact to it.,ted
"That, you know, we're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation leads to more hatred abroad, more terrorism.",ted
"We overreact because being human, we feel like retaliating, and it gets worse and worse and worse.",ted
"I assure you if it happens, at the end, both the West and the Muslim world will have suffered.",ted
"Well, first of all, we can do a lot more with arms control, the international regulation of dangerous technologies.",ted
I think we're going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world.,ted
"I feel like Rodney King, you know, saying, why can't we all just get along?",ted
"But hey, I don't really see any alternative, given the way I read the situation.",ted
"In my defense, I'd say, as naive as this may sound, it's ultimately grounded in cynicism.",ted
"That is to say, remember: my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self-interest.",ted
"It's when your welfare conduces to mine, that I decide,",ted
We will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality.,ted
"Now, launching a moral revolution has got to be hard, right?",ted
And I think the answer is a lot of different people are going to have to do a lot of different things.,ted
I also like it because it's an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise.,ted
And I think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that.,ted
"I mean, you want to hear the reason, but you don't want to be able to relate to it.",ted
I can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country I live in.,ted
"The reason you're trying to understand why they hate us, is to get them to quit hating us.",ted
"It was kind of along these lines, and the allegation was that I have, quote, affection for terrorists.",ted
"Now, the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter.",ted
"I mean, if you've got to have an enemy, do make it Ann Coulter.",ted
"And a kind of saving higher moral level, something that kind of literally saves the world.",ted
The original meaning of the word salvation in the Bible is about saving the social system.,ted
I say we give it a shot anyway because we've just come too far to screw it up now.,ted
"But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song, the rhythm of the dance in every culture.",ted
"And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only fill you with hope.",ted
It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.,ted
"And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.",ted
"When each of you in this room were born, there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.",ted
"Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules.",ted
It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world.,ted
"Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind, a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.",ted
"They're no longer being taught to babies, which means, effectively, unless something changes, they're already dead.",ted
"And I say, Great, let's make that language Yoruba.",ted
And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language.,ted
They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called linguistic exogamy: you must marry someone who speaks a different language.,ted
"In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake.",ted
But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing.,ted
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind.,ted
"In order to make sense out of sensation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun.",ted
"If I asked you to name the great religions of the world, what would you say?",ted
"There's always one continent left out, the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs.",ted
"But, what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead.",ted
That's why the Voodooists like to say that You white people go to church and speak about God.,ted
"And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit - how can you be harmed?",ted
"In a bloodstained continent, these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.",ted
"To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.",ted
Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.,ted
What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world.,ted
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut.,ted
It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.,ted
"This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about, the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman's repertoire.",ted
"What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of it.",ted
"This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines, very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine, 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.",ted
It doesn't create the distortion of reality; it creates the dissolution of reality.,ted
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.,ted
"Well, we use that great euphemism, trial and error, which is exposed to be meaningless.",ted
"But you ask the Indians, and they say, The plants talk to us.",ted
All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life.,ted
It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere.,ted
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level.,ted
This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.,ted
That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion.,ted
His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal.,ted
The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp.,ted
"The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.",ted
"And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps, been around for 150,000 years.",ted
The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old.,ted
"When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different voices.",ted
"The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons, all of his tools.",ted
"Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold; they took advantage of it.",ted
The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide.,ted
"So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing.",ted
"He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand.",ted
"And as the feces began to freeze, he shaped it into the form of a blade.",ted
An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people.,ted
They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time.,ted
"This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students, cut down to three minutes.",ted
"And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago.",ted
"And she wanted to make something of her life, and she asked me a simple little question.",ted
"And I felt really badly, because I couldn't give her a good answer.",ted
"So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.",ted
"And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people!",ted
"So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed, and pass it on to kids?",ted
TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money.,ted
"Carol Coletta says, I would pay someone to do what I do.",ted
"And the interesting thing is: if you do it for love, the money comes anyway.",ted
"Alex Garden says, To be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it.",ted
"There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice.",ted
"Norman Jewison said to me, I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing.",ted
"Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push.",ted
"Now it's not always easy to push yourself, and that's why they invented mothers.",ted
"Sherwin Nuland says, It was a privilege to serve as a doctor.",ted
And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas - it's just doing some very simple things.,ted
"Joe Kraus says, Persistence is the number one reason for our success.",ted
"So, the answer to this question is simple: Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.",ted
"Or failing that, do the eight things - and trust me, these are the big eight things that lead to success.",ted
Not in my wildest dreams did I think - I don't even consider myself to be an author.,ted
"And I'm often asked, Why do you think so many people have read this?",ted
And I think it's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease.,ted
I do believe what Chris said; I believe that you're not an accident.,ted
"Your parents may not have planned you, but I believe God did.",ted
I think there are accidental parents; there's no doubt about that.,ted
I think you matter to God; I think you matter to history; I think you matter to this universe.,ted
"I meet a lot of people who are very smart, and say,",ted
"And I meet a lot of people who are very successful, who say, Why don't I feel more fulfilled?",ted
Why do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am?,ted
"I think that comes down to this issue of meaning, of significance, of purpose.",ted
I think it comes down to this issue of: Why am I here?,ted
And I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life.,ted
"Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that, but there are plenty of religious kooks.",ted
"There are secular kooks; there are smart kooks, dumb kooks.",ted
"There are people - a lady came up to me the other day, and she had a white piece of paper -",ted
"Michael, you'll like this one - and she said, What do you see in it?",ted
"When you write the best-selling book in the world, it's tons and tons of money.",ted
"And it brought in a lot of attention, neither of which I wanted.",ted
"And I decided that I was never going to go on TV, because I didn't want to be a celebrity.",ted
"I didn't want to be a, quote, evangelist, televangelist - that's not my thing.",ted
"And all of the sudden, it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention.",ted
"I don't think - now, this is a worldview, and I will tell you, everybody's got a worldview.",ted
"You're betting your life on something, you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on.",ted
"And when I, you know, made a bet, I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was.",ted
"And I believe in a pluralistic society, everybody's betting on something.",ted
"And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now.",ted
"Because as I started to say, I don't think you're given money or fame for your own ego, ever.",ted
And I began to think about what I call the stewardship of affluence and the stewardship of influence.,ted
"For instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment.",ted
"I was debating the other day on a talk show, and the guy was challenging me and he'd go,",ted
"Well, do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation?",ted
"Do you think we have a stewardship here, to take the environment seriously?",ted
"When he said the word species, he was revealing his worldview.",ted
"And he was saying, I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is.",ted
"Well now, I know a lot of times we act like ducks, but you're not a duck.",ted
"So all of this money started pouring in, and all of this fame started pouring in.",ted
My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money.,ted
"We said, First, we're not going to use it on ourselves.",ted
I still drive the same four year-old Ford that I've driven.,ted
"We just said, we're not going to use it on us.",ted
And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money -,ted
"In fact, personally, I've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money.",ted
I know that's the stereotype; I've never met one of them.,ted
"Believe me, there's a whole lot easier ways to make money.",ted
"Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call, they're like doctors.",ted
"You know, the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times.",ted
The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral.,ted
"And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals, it makes a difference.",ted
The last thing we did is we became what I call reverse tithers.,ted
"And that is, when my wife and I got married 30 years ago, we started tithing.",ted
"So, we started doing that, and each year we would raise our tithe one percent.",ted
"Because every time I give, it breaks the grip of materialism in my life.",ted
"I meet people all the time who have those, and they're not necessarily happy.",ted
"If money actually made you happy, then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest.",ted
"And that I know, personally, I know, is not true.",ted
"Significance in life doesn't come from status, because you can always find somebody who's got more than you.",ted
"It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning, we find significance.",ted
"That's the way we were wired, I believe, by God.",ted
"The hard part is, what do I do with all this attention?",ted
"And I'm going, what do I do with this notoriety that the book has brought?",ted
"There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72, and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence.",ted
"When you read this prayer, it sounds incredibly selfish, self-centered.",ted
"He says, God, I want you to make me famous.",ted
"I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land, I want you to give me power.",ted
"And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make, if you were going to pray.",ted
"And, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth.",ted
And so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence.,ted
And I had to admit: I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans.,ted
I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America - a bunch of gated communities.,ted
"And I could go five years and never, ever see a homeless person.",ted
"Now, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana.",ted
I've got to help those who don't have either of those.,ted
"You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses,",ted
"And if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake.",ted
"And he picks it back up again, and it becomes a staff again.",ted
"Now, I'm reading this thing, and I'm going, what is that all about?",ted
"And, by the way, my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread.",ted
"You know, if God's going to show up, he's not going to show up on cheese bread.",ted
But God - my God - doesn't show up on sprinkler images.,ted
He's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do.,ted
"Second thing is, if God ever asks you a question, he already knows the answer.",ted
It's the symbol of his own occupation: I am a shepherd.,ted
"It's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job.",ted
"In those days, nobody had bank accounts, or American Express cards, or hedge funds.",ted
"So it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income.",ted
And the third thing: it's a symbol of his influence.,ted
"Well, you know, you move sheep from point A to point B with it, by hook or by crook.",ted
"So, he's saying, You're going to lay down your identity.",ted
"You've got identity, you've got income, you've got influence.",ted
"And he's saying, If you lay it down, I'll make it come alive.",ted
"Last year, I was invited to speak at the NBA All-Stars game.",ted
"And I asked them, I said, What's in your hand?",ted
"And that basketball represents your identity, who you are: you're an NBA player.",ted
It represents your income: you're making a lot of money off that little ball.,ted
"So, what are you going to do with what you've been given?",ted
"Talent, background, education, freedom, networks, opportunities, wealth, ideas, creativity.",ted
"That, to me, is what being purpose-driven is all about.",ted
"If you're wired to be an anthropologist, you'll be an anthropologist.",ted
"If you're wired to be an undersea explorer, you'll be an undersea explorer.",ted
"When my little kids - when my kids were little - they're all grown now, I have grandkids -",ted
"I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed, and I used to watch my kids sleep.",ted
"And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower, rise and lower.",ted
And I would look at them: This is not an accident.,ted
"The bottom line is, God gets pleasure watching you be you.",ted
"And when you do what you were made to do, he goes,",ted
"Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about.",ted
But also it's part of being any monthly magazine - you live in the future.,ted
"We also, like a lot of companies, create a product that's based on technology trends.",ted
"In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky, some entertainment.",ted
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.,ted
But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations is obviously extreme.,ted
"This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.",ted
And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.,ted
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important; we'll typically do it twice.,ted
"You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.",ted
"And sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.",ted
And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.,ted
The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price.,ted
"Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology, and that's another important point.",ted
Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it; it's an opportunity for the technology to change.,ted
"The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive.",ted
"But you can see that by 1998, it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.",ted
"And you can see that the units started to trend up, the hidden inflection point - it was taking off.",ted
"The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass.",ted
"In this case, 20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.",ted
And what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.,ted
"And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them, and bring the rest of your entertainment in.",ted
"He clearly saw that that was a moment, that was an inflection point that he could do something with.",ted
You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.,ted
"And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.",ted
Netflix was right - the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.,ted
That gave an advantage; that was an implication of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.,ted
You're aware of the perhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede over the 30-dollar DVD.,ted
"But they're getting very, very cheap, and look at the interesting implication of it.",ted
"They're being commodified, and that's what happens when things go to zero.",ted
"Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology, these four stages of technology's life.",ted
"I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there, just technologies on our radar -",ted
"But I think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.",ted
"You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer.",ted
"What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes that we're discovering is rising very quickly.",ted
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.,ted
"In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.",ted
"The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere, and the effect was just dramatic on pricing.",ted
And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.,ted
"If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.",ted
"Interestingly, it's done a crossover before, but not the crossovers that matter.",ted
The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.,ted
"That is, I imagine, what people in Redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about.",ted
Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.,ted
"I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.",ted
"At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.",ted
It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.,ted
"Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere; it's a little hard to use right now.",ted
They launched it in August of last year; they already have nearly four million registered users -,ted
You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards.,ted
"Free is something that comes with digital, because the reproduction costs are essentially free.",ted
"It comes with IP, because it's such an efficient protocol.",ted
"It comes with fiber optics, because there's so much bandwidth.",ted
"Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.",ted
And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive.,ted
"It takes that entire element, the physical element, of songs off the table.",ted
"And their response is draconian, and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this.",ted
"And finally, I'll give you one last example of free - perhaps the most powerful of all.",ted
I mentioned fiber optics - their abundance tends to make things free.,ted
This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.,ted
And what's interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute.,ted
"India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.",ted
And I think that's probably one of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.,ted
"Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down, but they want to know how to slow down really quickly.",ted
"And I think that - that's not really surprising though, is it?",ted
"Because that's kind of the world that we live in now, a world stuck in fast-forward.",ted
"A world obsessed with speed, with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more into less and less time.",ted
Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock.,ted
"And if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do?",ted
And even things that are by their very nature slow - we try and speed them up too.,ted
"I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples, and they're amusing and good to laugh at.",ted
"And I think for many people, that wake-up call takes the form of an illness.",ted
"And this went on for some time, until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people.",ted
And one of them made reference to a series of books called The One-Minute Bedtime Story.,ted
"And I wince saying those words now, but my first reaction at the time was very different.",ted
"My first reflex was to say, Hallelujah - what a great idea!",ted
This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more.,ted
And I put away the newspaper - and I was getting on a plane -,ted
"And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it.",ted
"I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture, and what it was doing to me and to everyone else.",ted
"And the second is, is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down?",ted
"Now, if you think about how our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads.",ted
"You think of, you know, urbanization, consumerism, the workplace, technology.",ted
And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation.,ted
We try and do more and more with less and less time.,ted
"And I guess that the question is, is it possible to break free from that mindset?",ted
They eat better; they make love better; they exercise better; they work better; they live better.,ted
"If you think of food, many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement.",ted
"Started in Italy, but has spread across the world, and now has 100,000 members in 50 countries.",ted
"So they might curb traffic, or put in a park bench, or some green space.",ted
"But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation, clearly have some kind of benefit.",ted
"There's an awful lot of fast sex around, isn't there?",ted
"So, you know, even sex is on a stopwatch these days.",ted
"You can get more bang for your buck, let's say.",ted
Right across much of the world - North America being a notable exception - working hours have been coming down.,ted
"Now, clearly there are problems with the 35-hour workweek in France - too much, too soon, too rigid.",ted
"It's not just, though, these days, adults who overwork, though, is it?",ted
"These kids have wonderful marks; they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars, to the point that would make your eyes water.",ted
But they lack spark; they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside - they don't know how to dream.,ted
"But that said, of course, it's not that easy to slow down, is it?",ted
I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time.,ted
"And if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy.",ted
"One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy.",ted
"It's a byword for lazy, slacker, for being somebody who gives up.",ted
Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work.,ted
Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life.,ted
"Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying,",ted
"Well, we like that aspect of what you've got, but we're not so sure about that.",ted
"So all of that said, is it, I guess, is it possible?",ted
"And I present myself as Exhibit A, a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed-aholic.",ted
"I play squash and ice hockey, two very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world.",ted
"But I've also, over the last year or so, got in touch with my inner tortoise.",ted
And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously.,ted
My default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic.,ted
"I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near, or at least not as much as I did before.",ted
"I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.",ted
I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it.,ted
"You know, at the end of the day, I go into my son's room.",ted
"It's become my reward at the end of the day, something I really cherish.",ted
"Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work.",ted
"And, you know, built the society that we now live in.",ted
It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable.,ted
"How much stuff goes through your life, how much waste is left behind you.",ted
"And we, at the moment, in our society, have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this.",ted
"Again, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet, 10 planets, one planet.",ted
The second problem is that the planet that we have is being used in wildly unfair ways.,ted
"This is producing all sorts of tensions, all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing.",ted
"So, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years.",ted
"It's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people.",ted
"So to make matters even more difficult, it's a very young planet.",ted
"And those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did, no matter where they live.",ted
"They've been exposed to this idea of our society, of our prosperity.",ted
And all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet.,ted
"And I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable.",ted
"You know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable; on the other hand we have the unimaginable.",ted
"Well, Worldchanging you might think of as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future.",ted
"I'm sure has already heard of, but most people haven't.",ted
"And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick.",ted
We're already an urban planet; that's especially true in the developed world.,ted
"And people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff.",ted
"Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there, you ought to go for a visit.",ted
"And they are doing density, new density, better than probably anybody else on the planet right now.",ted
"They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars, which is a pretty great thing.",ted
"Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments.",ted
"This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London, which is one of the greenest buildings in the world.",ted
"Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much.",ted
"When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them.",ted
"If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week, do you really need your own car?",ted
"But, you know, there may even be a simpler approach.",ted
"This light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods, and on the other hand, off.",ted
"Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful, and also much more effective.",ted
"This is an example of bio-mimicry, which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for.",ted
There's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable.,ted
I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it.,ted
"But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in.",ted
So what do we need in order to make developing nation megacities into Bright Green megacities?,ted
"Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging.",ted
And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere.,ted
One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones.,ted
"All throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones, skipping the whole landline stage.",ted
"I particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone.",ted
"So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society.",ted
"The second thing is tools for collaboration, be they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration.",ted
"When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate, you get different kinds of solutions.",ted
And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital.,ted
"So, you know, we have open source software, we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions.",ted
And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo.,ted
And those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo.,ted
So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion.,ted
"So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood.",ted
"You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels.",ted
"Like, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie City of God?",ted
"Yeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it.",ted
"And it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way.",ted
You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out.,ted
These are people who have just been visited by the Internet bookmobile in Uganda.,ted
"And who are waving their first books in the air, which, I just think that's a pretty cool picture.",ted
And sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement.,ted
We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here.,ted
"We need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil.",ted
"OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that.",ted
Another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call serious play.,ted
"This is from a game called Food Force, which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp.",ted
"And, you know, we don't hear those stories enough.",ted
"But it's happening all over the place, and these tools are part of what's making it possible.",ted
"Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world.",ted
"You get, for example, green power spread throughout the world.",ted
"You get grassroots solutions, things that work for people who have no capital or limited access.",ted
You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains.,ted
These are refrigerators that require no electricity; they're pot within a pot design.,ted
Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap and available to people in the developing world.,ted
Basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips.,ted
"So, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this.",ted
"This is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout, which pumps water as kids play.",ted
And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis.,ted
We're expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020 because of climate change and political instability.,ted
"Well, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet.",ted
"Some of those designs include models for acting, such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps.",ted
We've got to make something better than what we've got.,ted
"Just to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells, I think that better things are on the way.",ted
"I think that, in fact, that all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning.",ted
All that the human mind has accomplished is but the dream before the awakening.,ted
The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will.,ted

He told my mother it was just a really bad cold and that she should be put on antibiotics.,reddit
"A few weeks later it hadn't gotten any better and my mother went back, same diagnosis, more antibiotics.",reddit
My dad told my mother do go see his really good doctor and my mother agreed.,reddit
That night she had to pack her bags and go to the hospital.,reddit
To this day I still feel a lot of hate towards that doctor we first went to.,reddit
She was determined to keep taking care of me and continued going to work for a solid 6 months.,reddit
"Hair loss, worse health, the shit just started piling up.",reddit
It wasn't until 3 days before her death she went to the hospital again because the pain was getting too much.,reddit
It paints me a lot just thinking about it right now as I write this down.,reddit
During her sickness my dad decided to give up the place that he rented and moved in with my and my mother.,reddit
I did horrible at school and my teachers wanted me to change courses and go do something easier.,reddit
"During this time my dad's health also got really, and I mean REALLY bad.",reddit

"The mantis lunged with speed but not precision, punching her target but failing to secure grip.",reddit
"The spider, despite its fierce reputation and dangerous venom was no match for the sheer strength of the mantis.",reddit
What happened next was the single most horrifying but amazing thing I ever witnessed as a child.,reddit
"I could almost hear the screams of the widow, which was remarkably still alive at this point.",reddit
That was until its head was bitten clean off and dropped to the floor of the enclosure.,reddit
Mantis then proceeded to consume the abdomen and be on her merry fucking way like nothing had ever happened.,reddit
Looking back a viking's funeral would probably have been more appropriate.,reddit
I often did this on my own and wanted to show Daniel the thrill.,reddit
It took some convincing but I convinced Daniel to hold the cup for me while I ran inside.,reddit
With the jets gone as quickly as the came it was time to refocus my attention back on the task at hand.,reddit
But when Daniel and I looked back down at the clear plastic cup in the dirt it was fucking EMPTY.,reddit
"Daniel did not take this fact lightly, in fact he completely lost it.",reddit
Panic and fear swept over that child unlike anything else I have ever witnessed since.,reddit
He immediately jumped to his feet furiously brushing off his arms and body.,reddit
The disappointment of losing such a fine specimen is something I remember quite clearly even almost 10 years later.,reddit
I blew my smoke at it and kind of stunned it then threw it into the spider web nearby.,reddit
The spider crawled out and I got to watch a 15 minute battle between the two.,reddit
I could tell the wasp was tiring by its wings slowing down but he hasn't given up.,reddit
The spider circled around to the other side and crept up behind waspinator and bit him right near the head.,reddit
I saw the spider a little later and he only had 7 legs and one fang.,reddit
A fellow I work with has an extremely large and prominent port wine stain birthmark on his face.,reddit
Apparently his skin had broken and was bleeding all over him for the duration of the conversation.,reddit

It's NOT polite to just let me keep walking around with jam on my face.,reddit
"Unless they're doing it so they can laugh at me - that's fine, since it's at least logically consistent.",reddit

"I thank him again, and we continue having a great conversation.",reddit
"As I finish my beer, and am about to order another, he grabs my hand and asks me to dance.",reddit
"I don't want to lead him on, but he's really nice.",reddit
"I said, as I danced with a good looking Asian man.",reddit
"He laughs it off, says I'm a good guy, and leaves my gf to bring my drunk ass home.",reddit

I had no idea why a total stranger would be so mean to me.,reddit
"One of my managers was formerly homeless, but had gotten off the street and eventually worked his way to that position.",reddit
"Typically the work would take 2 hours to complete, but with team homeless it took about half an hour.",reddit
I think it's far too easy to further dehumanize an already marginalized population.,reddit
The store employees would handle the food and behind the counter stuff.,reddit
"And for everyone calling bullshit on 2 hour closes, that might be slightly exaggerated, but not by much.",reddit
Bar rush Jimmy Johns in an already high-trafficked area can be a pain to close down.,reddit
From some of the responses it sounds like the corporate chokehold has gotten even worse.,reddit
I promise we got away with it as long as I was there.,reddit

"I don't think anyone still works for JJ, but I can't be sure.",reddit

"Excuse me sir, but why do you have all those penguins in the back of your truck?",reddit
"I could bake your cake, jump out of it, and play for you as you walk down the aisle.",reddit
"In fairness, the front-page content in that sub reads like Jayden Smith's twitter stream.",reddit
"Actually, my relationship with Electro may have contributed to my present size.",reddit
"Anyway, you can imagine this was a pretty loud thing to do.",reddit
Eventually I made it home and from everyone's expression I could tell that they had been lectured to never mention it again.,reddit
"That didn't happen but luckily, we all went to different schools and no one could believe such a crazy story.",reddit
"At family dinners though, when awkward experiences comes up, you know who's story is the topper?",reddit
An entire class coming with watermelon lollipops covered in delicious spicy lucas?,reddit
Anywhere from 10% to 40% of my classes had some sort of special accommodation.,reddit
There's a document for each kid in the special ed system.,reddit
"There are about 40 different ways we can accommodate kids with special needs, and each kid has a plan.",reddit
So I might have 6 class periods x 5 kids per class = 30 different plans.,reddit
I had a good reputation in the special ed department as being one of the teachers who cared.,reddit
So I had been in touch with his Mom off and on via e-mail.,reddit
It was standard practice for me to contact parents via e-mail and stay in touch.,reddit
One of the special education instructors took me aside in order to 'do me a favor' and give me some counsel.,reddit
"Ms. Jones, Dave is lazy and won't submit any assignments.",reddit
"Because if this parent comes after you with a lawyer, your butt is going to be in a sling.",reddit
The implication here being that my failing this kid was going to get me into trouble.,reddit
I'm failing this kid because I feel that he lacks the understanding necessary to function as an adult in our society.,reddit
So I'll be sending him out in the world unprepared with no way to recover.,reddit
"I don't have the money to handle a protracted legal battle, and I can't risk my livelihood over one child.",reddit
And you tell me what grade you want on that kid's report card.,reddit
I'll give this kid a 110 average in my class if it'll save my neck.,reddit
"I'll cut his throat, and I'll send him out into the world ignorant and incapable.",reddit
"She stood there with her mouth agape for a few seconds, then told me to have a good day.",reddit
"I walked out, and started meticulously documenting everything having to do with this kid.",reddit
"I went through is accommodation sheet, and made sure that each one was being met.",reddit
"I e-mailed proof to his mother, weekly, of what I was doing to meet his accommodations.",reddit
"I printed out every e-mail I sent to the mother and highlighted it, color coding the highlighting to certain accommodations.",reddit
"Another teacher who has this same student comes to my classroom, shaking in his boots.",reddit
"Mr. Deradius, I heard Dave's mother is going to mop the floor with us.",reddit
"She works for the special ed department at her school, and she knows all the ins and outs.",reddit
"Within a couple of days, I was called to a meeting.",reddit
My position is that he's got his mother and the district wrapped around his finger.,reddit
He's learned he can manipulate the system so he doesn't have to do any work but passes anyway.,reddit
Your mom isn't going to set up a meeting with your boss about your accommodations.,reddit
You're just going to get fired for being lazy and ignorant.,reddit
"They asked his first teacher, Mr. Smith, Dave is failing your class.",reddit
I'm sitting in the middle of the table with a stack of paperwork a foot high.,reddit
"Proof that this kid is lazy, isn't doing his work, isn't doing what he needs to do.",reddit
"I haven't been given the opportunity to speak, but I'm going to weigh in here.",reddit
He's failing because he's figured out how to work the system.,reddit
"And if you have any question of that, I have record of every accommodation I've provided him going back for months.",reddit
I have given him every tool for success - and he has chosen failure at every turn.,reddit
Dave's grade in the other teacher's classes mysteriously improved after that meeting.,reddit
My guess is they had to bump his grade because they 'failed to meet his needs'.,reddit
A few days later an office runner showed up at my classroom door with a transfer paper for Dave.,reddit
"I needed to sign it, because Dave was being transferred out of my class.",reddit
"I went to the assistant principal, who had been in the meeting and knew of my frustration.",reddit
The goal is to get kids out - not to get them educated.,reddit
I guess I'll relate a few stories here that played into my decision to leave the profession.,reddit
I need to pull her out in the hallway for a conference.,reddit
Derpette: I'm not supposed to be alone in the hallway with a guy.,reddit
"If I dragged her out in the hall, the implication was she could accuse me of inappropriate conduct.",reddit
"I called her parents as well, and luckily, they were good folks who knew their daughter, so I was safe.",reddit
This can happen at any time and for no reason at all.,reddit
I have some friends in their 30s who think behaving means being haved.,reddit
This is honestly one of the weirdest things I've read on this website.,reddit

Casual school littering is something that is much much rarer in a Japanese school.,reddit
"Dozens and dozens of tables, none of which are cleaned by a cleaner.",reddit
"Plus, they wiped it regardless of if they made a mess.",reddit
"Perhaps they aren't all like this, but just the one example was quite a big deal for me.",reddit
There WAS too many bins in Tokyo a couple years ago and it caused a rat problem.,reddit
So the mayor just got rid of 90% of them and now you usually have to take your garbage home with you.,reddit
I did not know that men cannot always fully control the stream when they pee.,reddit
I had no idea about the funny positions they have to get into to pee with a hard-on.,reddit
I was delighted to know that most penises are not 8 or longer and as big around as my wrist.,reddit
I had no idea they could fart so much or take such pleasure in doing so.,reddit
I did not realize how much of a difference being male makes in upper body strength.,reddit
Not to mention lifting me up and pinning me to the wall.,reddit
I had no idea I was getting a human furnace when I started dating my SO.,reddit
I know when he gets up in the night to pee because I wake up cold.,reddit
I did not realize a person could be so completely fascinated by boobs.,reddit

"She is a great mom, and never tried to scare me away from men in any way.",reddit

"The guy pulled out, and she shit EVERYWHERE in the chapel.",reddit
"So yeah, I'd imagine he now gets bullied for other reasons.",reddit
"I wouldn't know, I've been in college for a few years now.",reddit
"It's a shoebox, or at least once was, and whenever I masturbate I cum into it.",reddit
"But, it just kind of happened, bought new shoes and needed someplace to cum, used the box.",reddit
"It just escalated from there, kept using it each time, telling myself I would throw it out soon.",reddit
"Never did, two or three years later, I still have it.",reddit
"So I might as well update this post, if anyone even gets linked here anymore.",reddit
Mold has begun to grow in the box and has taken over a fair amount.,reddit

I interviewed for a Semi-conductor company in Silicon Valley in a 3 Tier Interview Process.,reddit
The interview was about an hour long and each manager took turns asking me questions about my experience and skills.,reddit
I waited about 25 minutes before he finally showed up and walked into the room closing the door behind him.,reddit
It was an older guy with dirt and sweat on his face and visibly frustrated from having to change his tire out.,reddit
I was really taken back by the raw emotion this man was expressing to me.,reddit
He was quite the manager to work for as you guys can imagine.,reddit
"Context, the guy that got knocked out was drunk as fuck and starting fights with people.",reddit

He needed to tripple check that the name for the person they were picking up was correct.,reddit
"The terp went completely pale as we explained this, but could tell immediately that we weren't joking.",reddit
I helped him up into the truck and tried not to notice how badly he was shaking.,reddit
His hands covered his mouth as my hands moved to reveal his son's face.,reddit
It's not uncommon for every pallbearer to be crying and screaming as they take the casket and load it into their car.,reddit

When did we go back in time to the point where insulting people gets them to like you?,reddit
He's going to grow up then get in an accident and go to the ICU.,reddit
Eventually the family approves the doctor to pull the plug and not let him suffer anymore.,reddit
"They wait in the hospital lobby, the doctor walks out looking gloomy.",reddit
He looks at the family and quietly whispers Ethernet has been disconnected.,reddit
"Seriously the things we do to cheese, I just don't think we deserve it.",reddit
In this state the cheese will keep longer and stay healthier than when portioned off into little chunks.,reddit
"Cheese is only bad when it spoils, as soon as the cheese tastes like spoiled milk kick it in the bin.",reddit
However if you have a problem with cheese going wrong here's some tips for their upkeep.,reddit
"Don't mind the mold, just cut it off as soon as you see it.",reddit
"If you do get a part of the cheese that goes hard and dry though, just cut it off.",reddit
While best kept in a cool or cold environment most cheeses taste best at room temperature.,reddit
Let it sit out on the counter for a while before serving it.,reddit
Don't be afraid to throw in some Goat and Sheep's milk if you get some.,reddit
"Your local cheesemonger will be able to give you some good recommendations on both variety, serving suggestions and pairings.",reddit
"Some go better with Wine, some go better with Beer, some go great with Coffee.",reddit
There's no hard and fast rules for paring cheese so take your time to research it.,reddit
Some Blue cheeses are even wrapped in grape leaves; you should eat those.,reddit
On the application is a check box question: Have you ever been convicted of a crime?,reddit
So I'm confident there are quite a few convicted felons walking around our campus right now.,reddit
After what I think were the first 15 days I realized this was not possible.,reddit
What I forgot was that I constantly have an electrode measuring my heart rate.,reddit
"So yea, I fapped in the bathroom, I wasn't caught but they knew.",reddit
I rarely get to see my dad due to him being in jail.,reddit
My mum had many issues as far as her mental and physical health goes.,reddit
"I am 20 years old and lost my dad in November, my mother in 2008.",reddit
They owned a couple of bars before my birth and in one of them my mother met another guy etc.,reddit
In early 2008 my mother started getting these weird blue marks on her chest above her breasts.,reddit
He told my mother it was just a really bad cold and that she should be put on antibiotics.,reddit
"A few weeks later it hadn't gotten any better and my mother went back, same diagnosis, more antibiotics.",reddit
My dad told my mother do go see his really good doctor and my mother agreed.,reddit
That night she had to pack her bags and go to the hospital.,reddit
To this day I still feel a lot of hate towards that doctor we first went to.,reddit
She was determined to keep taking care of me and continued going to work for a solid 6 months.,reddit
"Hair loss, worse health, the shit just started piling up.",reddit
It wasn't until 3 days before her death she went to the hospital again because the pain was getting too much.,reddit
It paints me a lot just thinking about it right now as I write this down.,reddit
During her sickness my dad decided to give up the place that he rented and moved in with my and my mother.,reddit
I did horrible at school and my teachers wanted me to change courses and go do something easier.,reddit
"During this time my dad's health also got really, and I mean REALLY bad.",reddit
"I had to wake up with him at around 5:45 in the mornings, get him out of bed and in his wheelchair.",reddit
"Because of him being bed located because his body simply couldn't anymore, he ended up losing most of his muscles.",reddit
"After that I'd get him his medication, drinks, food.",reddit
In September I then decided to pick up Japanese evening classes which I love doing.,reddit
I have to say this came as a total surprise as he requested it himself.,reddit
"I didn't want to lose my last parent, I'd be on my own.",reddit
I have had very suicidal thoughts not too long ago despite having reached for help from a psychologist.,reddit
If anyone has any more questions please do feel free to ask them.,reddit
"Since you asked, here's the story: We had become friends in college.",reddit
She was a tomboy in oversized overalls &amp; a silly bobbed haircut.,reddit
She knew everything about me &amp; was the only girl I never tried to impress.,reddit
"For several years, we didn't see each other face to face.",reddit
"It didn't faze me, since I was about to move to California to chase my own dreams.",reddit
"But seeing we were friends, I decided to surprise her and go.",reddit
So her mom takes my hand and leads me to the bridal room.,reddit
"As soon as I entered the back room, my heart completely stopped.",reddit
Standing in front of me wasn't the frumpy girl I remembered.,reddit
"Instead, it was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.",reddit
"Long gone were the silly haircut and bib overalls - replaced by an elegant, sexy, and stunning woman.",reddit
"Standing there in her bridal gown, she took my breath away.",reddit
"All the smiles, the laughs, the late night walks around campus.",reddit
All the pieces of our relationship suddenly lined up made perfect sense.,reddit
"And in the ultimate clarity of that moment, I had the most awful realization of my entire life.",reddit
"I stood there, dumbfounded - trying to fight back the tidal wave of nausea washing over me.",reddit
But I can still feel her silk gloves on my cheeks as she did it.,reddit
So we stood there &amp; chatted pleasantly for a few minutes.,reddit
"Then, without fanfare, I took my seat and watched the ceremony start.",reddit
Do I ruin this girl's marriage because I suddenly have a feeling?,reddit
"So, I sat there quietly and watched her marry the wrong man.",reddit
But I wanted to punch myself in the face for not seeing the perfection that was in front of me for so long.,reddit
"When I left that afternoon, I made myself a solemn promise.",reddit
I promised that if I ever got the chance to be with her - I would marry her and be fearless about it.,reddit
I wouldn't doubt or second guess myself - because I knew in my heart that we were meant to be.,reddit
"For several years, I'd fly home &amp; visit her.",reddit
"Every time, I wanted to tell her my feelings for her.",reddit
"For years, she was too proud and ashamed to tell anybody.",reddit
"One day, she reached over and kissed me for the second time in my life.",reddit
"And in that glorious moment, I knew I'd finally make good on my promise to marry her.",reddit
"Every day, I'm thankful that I got a second chance to make things right.",reddit
Went to her wedding &amp; realized I was in love with her.,reddit
A lot of people are saying I'm shallow for falling in love with her because she was suddenly hot .,reddit
"For the sake of keeping our story as short as possible, I oversimplified &amp; left out details.",reddit
For example: I spent all of college pining over my high school girlfriend.,reddit
"That blinded me to all potential partners, including my future wife.",reddit
"In addition, we never seemed to be single at the same time.",reddit
"I did this for my recently car, had 3 dealerships outbidding each other.",reddit
Literally all you have to do is start a bidding war between two dealerships.,reddit
"Submit inquiries online to both of them, and explicitly tell them that you're shopping.",reddit
"Any time one of them comes at you with a deal, just present that number to the other one.",reddit
The ability to rip people off isn't nearly as bad as it used to be before the internet.,reddit
"But they won't have my brand, I have special eyes.",reddit
Actually this is an obvious question but it's not what you might think.,reddit
"Let me explain it to you, I've been an opiate addict for a long time and tried many drugs.",reddit
Drugs that are 'uppers' have the most 'obvious' euphoria.,reddit
"However, you owe these drugs back what they delivered to you.",reddit
"After a meth binge, or lots of MDMA use, or staying up all night on coke you will feel like shit.",reddit
"They just feel good, chill, happy, but they feel like this spooky drug 'heroin' hasn't delivered.",reddit
It doesn't make you do stupid shit or stay up all day and hallucinate like amphetamines or coke.,reddit
It doesn't empty your serotonin like MDMA or give you a hangover like alcohol.,reddit
No headache or shitty feeling-just a slight afterglow of that nice feeling.,reddit
It only cost $10 for a whole night of being high!,reddit
"It didn't 'fuck me up,' I could still think clearly.",reddit
"He knows he can't go into work drunk, or on MDMA, or high.",reddit
Well the user might actually find they do better work on heroin.,reddit
The rain drops are just falling and in each one I see the reflection of every persons life around me.,reddit
In this still frame shot of traffic on this crowded bus I just found love and peace.,reddit
That guy that let me try a few lines the first time doesn't actually deal.,reddit
Luckily I was able to pull up and get help right before I entered the deadly downward spiral.,reddit
Then I pretend I'm making a phone call and VERY LOUDLY use their number in my fake conversation.,reddit
It's even more fun to do it with people you know and don't really like.,reddit
A few years back I was having lunch with some friends at a new Thai restaurant.,reddit
The waitress asked me the level of hotness I'd like for my curry.,reddit
"She looked at me for a couple of seconds and said, You will have a two.",reddit
Worked in a Thai restaurant for a while and for some of them it was like a contest of who could eat the spiciest-,reddit
"Not current SO, but my ex used to be on a dating website for Alternative People .",reddit
"After an hour or so of fake conversation, i started making a move.",reddit
"To this day, she never knew i found out about it, or saw it.",reddit
"Lastly, i do not condone what i did, or my general trust issue behavior in a relationship.",reddit
"But what i am saying, something good and loving came out of this situation and for that, i am grateful.",reddit
"If you like Pina Colada's Reference, that would be swell.",reddit
"Go fuck yourself , to which his response was I'd rather fuck your mum .",reddit
"I got gold and only one upvote, simply for reminding someone it was Saturday and not Sunday.",reddit
"We had a bunch of dogs in the back area, mainly german shepard mutts.",reddit
I watched the dogs mount each other and was interested in what they were doing.,reddit
I went over to feed the dog and that she was in the back lot helping her mom hang some clothes.,reddit
I wanted her to get mounted by one of the bigger dogs and she agreed to it.,reddit
She stripped down and walked over to one of the bigger dogs and kneeled down on all fours in front of the dog.,reddit
I don't know if it was because of my idea or if there were any other causes to leading to her suicide.,reddit
To this day I still think that my juvenile mind could have caused the death of another person.,reddit
Assertion of dominance Why is your GF watching you wipe your ass?,reddit
"Ugh people do this on the Macs at school all the time, sensitivity all the way up or down.",reddit
I think the admin actually locked those settings because people kept changing the language and shit.,reddit
I've been slowly increasing the mouse sensitivity on both of my roommates computers.,reddit
In 2 weeks I'm going to put them back to the default and pretend like mine is slow too.,reddit
I'm interested to see the conclusion that they will come to.,reddit
Edit: now I'm just tempted to show him the thread.,reddit
"Seriously, when I heard of people being hit by crytpowall and crptolocker attacks.",reddit

"You found his decoy porn stash, what he REALLY wants is tentacles.",reddit
He's also accidentally left open some naughty photos on his computer that were of me.,reddit
It's also acceptable to wear jeans with holes all in them.,reddit
Am I a dirty bum who can't afford jeans without holes?,reddit
"No, it's a fucking fashion statement and I look fabulous.",reddit
I think it's written somewhere that jeans are exempt from the usual washing expectations.,reddit
A good Onion headline from a few years ago: Dozens of murders in Chicago delayed due to snow.,reddit
Also when I buy a property and make myself change I will typically refund myself a good portion of the purchase.,reddit

The safer way would be to do all that without putting the pill in her drink.,reddit
His daughter started the fire while she was high when her parents were out shopping in the morning.,reddit
I think your neighbor took his april fools joke a bit too far.,reddit
"I agree with this, it just makes me paranoid and overanalyze things.",reddit
And we all descended from the small fraction of humans that survived on the surface and was reduced to stone age tech level.,reddit
Edit: I don't read fiction much and this idea was invented in just a minute.,reddit
"I get this reaction too, but usually the whole bus gasps.",reddit
"Hopefully they never spell their name wrong, wait a minute, are you that guy?",reddit
Can't wait for middle school students to read this and start a new trend.,reddit
"While this is true, it still might sour the relationship with an unprofessional boss.",reddit
There is absolutely nothing wrong with going to an interview while you have a job.,reddit
But having that translate to a global understanding and acceptance is unfathomable.,reddit
Their living room full of crap they probably bought at garage sales.,reddit
"That's one of the reasons I liked Malcolm in the Middle, their house always had the look of poverty.",reddit
"It was dirty, messed up, poor yard, and appliances constantly breaking down.",reddit
"And in the last 12 years that we were making it, there have been many ups and downs in my career.",reddit
I just had to be patient and wait for people to see it.,reddit
What was the most difficult thing about the 12 years of filming Boyhood?,reddit
The biggest thing the public doesn't understand when they read stories with headlines State X Lawmaker wants to blow up the moon!,reddit
"Whether it's something you want or don't want, here's a guide to just how many fucks you should give.",reddit
You have no idea how few votes it takes to elect a member of the House in a state legislature.,reddit
"Every one has plenty of village idiot kings elected by 1,200 people or so.",reddit
"If lawmaker is a state senator, add anywhere from 1 to 1.5 on the give-a-fuck scale.",reddit
At the very least this means that there are ~6 other lawmakers who hate the moon.,reddit
Whether that means that is a commonly held moon opinion is yet to be determined.,reddit
"Many bills are passed by a committee that never see the floor, and again this can be all about posturing.",reddit
In general you should worry way more when things get to the senate.,reddit
"Senators are elected by more people, which means it's harder to get total nut jobs elected.",reddit
The senate will never or rarely pass something unless they think there is a good chance to get it through the House.,reddit
However some states do have a governor of a different party than the majority in the legislature.,reddit
"Because even at this point, the moon could be safe and this could all be a bluff.",reddit
Surely you might have wondered why does State X think the moon is under its jurisdiction?,reddit
"Birds wiggle around when they want to escape, notice how chill she is and how she doesn't move her feet around.",reddit
Why the fuck can't you people jizz into tissues and throw them away like normal people?,reddit
When I was a teenager a girl left her pillow at my place.,reddit
I haven't worked since I've graduated almost a year ago.,reddit
"The parents don't want me there, and I'm having a hard time looking for a specific line of work.",reddit
"Usually, when I tell someone, they give me a blank stare, then ask What is Reddit?",reddit
I figure it's the best way for someone to get to know me.,reddit
"In fact, it's helps out that they get to see me at my worst.",reddit
"Make sure you get a rabies shot or something, those things can carry diseases.",reddit

I like how most of the replies to this comment are people arguing about the validity of a joke made by a comedian.,reddit
"Basically, occasionally my brain like to lie to my imaginary butthole about needing to poop.",reddit
Calling your partner Piggly Wiggly while you're behind them is Mistake #2.,reddit
I was 16 and my friend set me up with her cousin from a town over.,reddit
"We got dinner, went to a record store, drove around, and finally ended up behind the Piggly Wiggly store.",reddit
"When I got home that night, my mom was waiting up.",reddit
"After several awkward seconds of silence, I said I'm fine.",reddit
"At school on Monday morning, everyone in my class already knew what happened.",reddit
I am temporarily removing the other comment responses to this comment so that people can actually see the real answer.,reddit
We've asked the admins to investigate claims like this a few times and the answer is always the same.,reddit
IAmA is one of the main ways that new users are brought to Reddit.,reddit
They make an account to ask a question and then stick around for a while.,reddit
This is why: Women have always been the primary victims of war.,reddit
"Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat.",reddit
Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known.,reddit
"Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes, more frequently in today's warfare, victims.",reddit
"Women are often left with the responsibility, alone, of raising the children.",reddit
So the last thing I want is a president who is as delusional as Hillary Clinton shows herself to be.,reddit
Women are just a smart and of course should have all the same opportunities as men.,reddit
There WERE plenty of people that voted for Obama simply because he was black.,reddit
There WILL be people that vote for a female for the same reason.,reddit
"The thought that It's never happened before, it needs to happen NOW takes over.",reddit
We can't surrender the presidency just to make a group of people feel better about themselves.,reddit
No candidate should ever be chosen based on their gender or race.,reddit
I have this cool test I do where I sleep with a woman on the first date.,reddit

I'd try from across the room sometimes being completely unaware that you can avoid the splash by just easing the meat in.,reddit
The meat hit the pan handle and the whole thing flipped over.,reddit

It will constantly take you place you never thought you could go.,reddit
I always remember I won't do things right on the first try.,reddit

"I am not even Muslim, and I have no idea how I ever heard about this, but there you go.",reddit
I have a weird question that I've always been too embarrassed to ask any of my friends.,reddit
I noticed that it took me way longer to get my penis to stop dripping after I pee.,reddit
"Not like a flow of pee, but just little drops still left over.",reddit
It's still 20 minutes more than the ones I'm not paying.,reddit
I've never seen the appeal of paying a girl to pretend to like me for 20 mins.,reddit
You shut your mouth Even if its a drawing of a spoiler of Game of throne?,reddit
"I had never been told what 50 Shades of Grey was about, so I assumed it was about the holocaust.",reddit
"It just sounded like it was about the holocaust to me, don't really know why.",reddit
"It's from Game of Thrones, silly, that's Tyrone Lanistar!",reddit
"Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck, or a hundred duck-sized horses?",reddit
I lost my virginity to a girl with down syndrome - because I wanted my first time to be with someone special.,reddit

"Is it just me, or does she have some feelings to work out?",reddit
"Post your own reply in the comments, not in the title if you have one also.",reddit
The price to see a movie keeps going up and drives away movie goers.,reddit
Go sit in a corner for 35 years and think about what you've done.,reddit
He also complained that I had the reserved spot because he had children.,reddit
He called the police on me for taking pics of his son.,reddit
He's probably one of those people who thinks you should work longer because you have no kids to take care of.,reddit

"So I grew up loving him, appreciating him, and seeing him as a role model.",reddit
"I would just shrug it off, move on with my life, and maybe even have a giggle about it.",reddit
"And I would believe what I want to believe because, I, too, would have freedom; freedom of belief.",reddit
I will attempt to reply to a few points that kept coming up here as an edit so everybody can see them.,reddit

"I teach math and have a second grade son learning this new math, and I side with the teacher.",reddit
It should have read: How can you use the Make 10 Strategy when you are adding 8 + 5?,reddit
"I have a second grader who is also learning this, and it is a useful strategy.",reddit
The problem is that most people who learned math only know how to think of things one way.,reddit
They can only replicate the processes of math in the way they were taught.,reddit
This leads to an unintelligent general population that is locked into copying the math that they previously learned.,reddit
"When math learning is reduced to easily copied computations, students end up poorer for it.",reddit
We do not want to teach students how to be good computers.,reddit
I love he said As easy as throwing a ball and Lars looks insanely uncoordinated doing so.,reddit

"So, for the ancient church, â§ was the one-character symbol for Jesus Christ.",reddit
"Over time, the last 'S' and the space were dropped, and it came to be known as simply â§mas.",reddit
It thus carried through that the name for the celebration of Jesus' birth came to be known as Xmas.,reddit
It wasn't until several years after that development that the entire word started to be spelled phonetically.,reddit
"When I was 7, I was at a crowded McDonalds near Disneyland.",reddit
I tried to squeeze through the really long line waiting to order food and accidentally bumped into this woman with her two kids.,reddit
She turned to me and said in her most sarcastic and accusing voice ',reddit

She did not look pleased to be told off by a 7 year old.,reddit

Third-best bit of advice I got from a friend was to give a girl context.,reddit
"It doesn't have to be filthy talk, just stuff that's going to get her going.",reddit
Tell her you're going to finger her when your hand is inside her panties.,reddit
"If at this point you take the time to tie her up, or blindfold her, even better.",reddit
The absolute best piece of advice I got about girls was to keep them guessing in the bedroom.,reddit
I'm not talking about mixing shit up when she's about to cum.,reddit
"Sometimes girls love a tender love-making session with arms around necks, hands on face, eye contact and sensual touching.",reddit
Sometimes they like to be pinned to a wall and fucked like they're the most desirable thing on the planet.,reddit
Obviously respond to her body language but surprise her as much as you can.,reddit
When she opened the door I pinned her to the wall and kept my promises.,reddit
There is nothing sexier than a girl gagging for you to fuck her.,reddit
"That, my friends, is the kind of bliss that even poets can't properly describe.",reddit
"Similarly, I once bought my first condom, tried it on, and then thrust between two mattresses.",reddit
"He can't control these urges, obviously, and needs some constructive advice on how to handle himself.",reddit

"Now, when you are shopping for glasses, look on the frame for the frame size .",reddit
This keeps your lenses from having to be thicker on one outside edge than on the inner edge.,reddit
I intend to get new glasses soon so I'll show your post to the optician.,reddit
Every last one is made using Pilsbury cake mix I buy for $1 a box at Walmart.,reddit
Every time I've ever tried to make a cake from scratch it sucked.,reddit
"For $1, they too can make a cake just as delicious.",reddit
I base my prices mostly on the decoration of the cakes and not of the cake itself of that makes sense.,reddit
Even my best friends think I fucking slave over the oven mixing and baking these damn cakes.,reddit
If anyone knew my business and reputation would be in the toilet for sure.,reddit
I feel better about it thanks to a lot of these comments!,reddit
I forget to check this account most of the time and rarely see this stuff until weeks later.,reddit
"I know I can order cake mix online, but I don't make enough cakes for it to be economical.",reddit
"Honestly, I'm not incredibly worried about people seeing me anymore.",reddit
If I ran into someone I would tell them that I was helping my niece with a bake sale or something.,reddit
"I have, since this thread, made some cakes from scratch.",reddit
And that people from all over the world have a friend who makes cakes and they all think I am their friend.,reddit
I was a waitress at a Japanese restaurant and this young high school couple comes in.,reddit
The boy had been there many times before he and his family were fairly regular at the place.,reddit
He I think was trying to be smooth and said he would handle the ordering.,reddit
He told her to have some of that to cleanse the pallet.,reddit
She bites into it and nearly turns fire truck red in the face from the burn.,reddit

"I'm trying to teach, and the noise level in her classroom suddenly goes out of control.",reddit
"A loud banging sound, and a voice that hits that perfect pitch.",reddit
There's a 98 pound female next door who is about to get her head bashed in.,reddit
I swore yesterday not to involve myself in anything that could be called a 'situation'.,reddit
"By that rationale I ought to call the office, notify them, and go about my day.",reddit
"Adam, call the office and tell them there is an emergency in Ms. Thomas' room.",reddit
"So I sprint out of my classroom, around the corner, and to Ms. Thomas's room.",reddit
"Ms. Thomas' room has a doorway, a ten foot long hallway, and then it opens up into the classroom.",reddit
"Between Ms. Thomas and me, there is a young woman who is facing Ms. Thomas.",reddit
"Remember the crack boom in the 90s, and all the crack babies who were born?",reddit
Serena is trying to get past Ms. Thomas into the classroom - I can only assume to hurt a student or students.,reddit
"I don't know if she is armed with a pencil, scissors, a knife, or is just bare handed.",reddit
"Ms. Thomas is looking at me with this hopeless, deer-in-the-headlights face.",reddit
"I am now alone, with no information, trying to keep Serena away from the classroom.",reddit
"Michael, a student in the classroom behind me, is a 6'5'' muscled athelete.",reddit
He's very powerfully built - and he's angry - but the balance of my attention is one Serena.,reddit
"She's eyeing me, looking for weaknesses or a way to get by me.",reddit
"He starts yelling t. Michael: You can't do that to her, man!",reddit
I have no idea how long I'm going to be here.,reddit
The closest thing I can grab on her is her right iliac crest - her hip bone.,reddit
"My hand locks onto that hip, and her momentum swings me around.",reddit
"My other arm comes in, and my left hand locks in on her left hipbone.",reddit
She's still trying to get into the classroom - so she bends over at the waist.,reddit
She could be trying to kill one of the other kids for all I know.,reddit
I figure I can rush him and get my thumbs into his eyes before he can do much.,reddit
"He'll probably knock me out before I even get close, but it's my only shot.",reddit
"While I'm working this out in my mind, the door opens behind me.",reddit
"It's Mr. Whittaker - a tale, lanky, African American male teacher from down the hall.",reddit
"He and I have broken up fights before, and we have an unspoken agreement forged over long experience together.",reddit
"Michael sits down, Mr. Whittaker bear-hugs Serena and removes her.",reddit
"Serena never said anything about the way I grabbed her, or if she did, it didn't matter.",reddit
But the administration got involved anyway - I made sure of that.,reddit
I wouldn't have changed a single thing I did that day.,reddit
"I had to go back to that classroom, and I had to stop Serena.",reddit
The administration would never back me up if it came down to it.,reddit
Or I could make the same money going back to graduate school to get a PhD. Grad school's pretty nice.,reddit
One of my commitments when I signed on as a teacher was to enforce the code of conduct.,reddit
"The district had implemented these rules and asked us to enforce them,",reddit
"In order to keep things consistent, it was my opinion that every teacher ought to enforce the whole code of conduct.",reddit
Students were not to hold hands or walk arm-in-arm down the hallway.,reddit
We can debate the legitimacy of that rule some other time - but I felt I needed to enforce it.,reddit
I was one of the few teachers that actually did hall duty.,reddit
Other teachers always seemed to find a reason to be in their rooms during class change.,reddit
"Tell the teacher Go fuck yourself, and look hard in front of his girlfriend and people in the hallway.",reddit
I would simply express a need to pass between two students who were too close.,reddit
One time I had a couple who didn't get it - they reconnected right after I walked through.,reddit
And everyone is happy and no one has to go to the office.,reddit
So there was a football player coming down the hallway with his girlfriend up under his arm.,reddit
"He starts bowing his chest up, stepping up to me, screaming at the top of his lungs.",reddit
"This creates such a commotion that two of my coworkers, other science department faculty members, come out in the hallway.",reddit
"So, next class period, I'm teaching, and another teacher comes and knocks on my door.",reddit
Spend the next several minutes with my heart up in my throat.,reddit
"Mr. Taylor: Mr. Deradius, I need you to step out in the hall and speak with me.",reddit
"I stood there staring at the administrator for a second, processing what he has said.",reddit
I want to ask you if you're in the right frame of mind to conduct this investigation.,reddit
"When you can ask the right question, I'll tell you what you need to know.",reddit
"Mr. Taylor: Mr. Deradius, what in the district policies gives you a basis for dealing with students in this way?",reddit
I find it usually results in fewer referrals than the other way.,reddit
"Nothing in the district policy says I should tell the students to separate verbally, either.",reddit
"Him: Well, our policy doesn't support what you chose to do here.",reddit
"He's saying you shoved him into a wall, and I'm not sure what's going to happen.",reddit
"It was a lie, but if he had pressed with it, it could have gotten ugly.",reddit
"Once he understood everything I'd told him, he said, I think that's fair.",reddit
I also swore from that day on not to ever put my hands on another kid for any reason.,reddit
"After this, I vowed, I would never touch another kid again - because doing so could get me fired.",reddit
"And the next day, as it turned out, I was given no choice.",reddit
"So we all gathered in one of the motel rooms, stripped naked, and ran out the door yelling.",reddit
"Well, not really, because the upper classmen didn't actually leave the room.",reddit

"These people are doing productive labor in a majorly profitable industry, yet are paid starvation wages.",reddit

"If we raise wages to a livable level, however, they won't take it out of their profits and dividends.",reddit
"That's partially the greed of the executives, but largely the greed of the stockholders.",reddit
Why park your capital in a company making 2% growth when you can move it to one making 6%?,reddit
"That's just self-interest, and it's the motivating factor for companies to squeeze costs, including labor.",reddit
"Just like environmental regulations as well, government needs to be the one to set the ground rules.",reddit
I bet that made it really awkward for everyone else who still had presents to open.,reddit
"At first I agreed with you, but by the end of your post you were just complaining about your friend.",reddit
The worst is this friend we have that complains nonstop about her job during every get together.,reddit

"The district had implemented these rules and asked us to enforce them,",reddit
"In order to keep things consistent, it was my opinion that every teacher ought to enforce the whole code of conduct.",reddit
Students were not to hold hands or walk arm-in-arm down the hallway.,reddit
We can debate the legitimacy of that rule some other time - but I felt I needed to enforce it.,reddit
I was one of the few teachers that actually did hall duty.,reddit
Other teachers always seemed to find a reason to be in their rooms during class change.,reddit
"Tell the teacher Go fuck yourself, and look hard in front of his girlfriend and people in the hallway.",reddit
I would simply express a need to pass between two students who were too close.,reddit

"Mr. Taylor: Mr. Deradius, what in the district policies gives you a basis for dealing with students in this way?",reddit
I find it usually results in fewer referrals than the other way.,reddit
"Nothing in the district policy says I should tell the students to separate verbally, either.",reddit
"Him: Well, our policy doesn't support what you chose to do here.",reddit
"He's saying you shoved him into a wall, and I'm not sure what's going to happen.",reddit
"It was a lie, but if he had pressed with it, it could have gotten ugly.",reddit
"Once he understood everything I'd told him, he said, I think that's fair.",reddit
I also swore from that day on not to ever put my hands on another kid for any reason.,reddit
"After this, I vowed, I would never touch another kid again - because doing so could get me fired.",reddit

I guess I'll relate a few stories here that played into my decision to leave the profession.,reddit

"Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.",harry
"He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache.",harry
The Dursley s had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.,harry
They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.,harry
The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street.,harry
"The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.",harry
This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.,harry
"None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.",harry
He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.,harry
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar - a cat reading a map.,harry
"For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen - then he jerked his head around to look again.",harry
"There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight.",harry
"As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror.",harry
Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind.,harry
As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.,harry
"But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else.",harry
Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes - the getups you saw on young people!,harry
He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.,harry
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor.,harry
"If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.",harry
"Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning.",harry
He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's.,harry
"This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin.",harry
"He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.",harry
He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.,harry
"Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry.",harry
There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.,harry
"Sorry, he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.",harry
It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak.,harry
He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground.,harry
"On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare,",harry
"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!",harry
"Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!",harry
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.,harry
"He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was.",harry
He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.,harry
"Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house.",harry
"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today.",harry
Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.,harry
"Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early - it's not until next week, folks!",harry
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea.,harry
"Er - Petunia, dear - you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?",harry
"After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.",harry
Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name Potter.,harry
"Oh, yes, said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly.",harry
He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.,harry
"While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.",harry
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.,harry
"Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.",harry
"It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive.",harry
"It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead.",harry
"In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.",harry
"He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.",harry
"For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him.",harry
"He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.",harry
"He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.",harry
"He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone.",harry
"She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one.",harry
"My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.",harry
"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day, said Professor McGonagall.",harry
I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.,harry
"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no - even the Muggles have noticed something's going on.",harry
She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window.,harry
Shooting stars down in Kent - I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle.,harry
"People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.",harry
"No, thank you, said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops.",harry
"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -",harry
"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name?",harry
"Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.",harry
It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-Know-Who.',harry
I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.,harry
"I know you haven't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.",harry
Only because you're too - well - noble to use them.,harry
I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.,harry
"Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.",harry
"It was plain that whatever everyone was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.",harry
"Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.",harry
"What they're saying, she pressed on, is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow.",harry
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are - are - that they're - dead.,harry
"They're saying he tried to kill the Potters' son, Harry.",harry
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.,harry
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it.,harry
"It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge.",harry
"I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?",harry
"And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?",harry
You don't mean - you can't mean the people who live here?,harry
"And they've got this son - I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.",harry
His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older.,harry
"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?",harry
"Exactly, said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.",harry
She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.,harry
You think it - wise - to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?,harry
"If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.",harry
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide.,harry
"In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.",harry
"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir, said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke.",harry
"No, sir - house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around.",harry
"Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.",harry
"Well - give him here, Hagrid - we'd better get this over with.",harry
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.,harry
"Could I - could I say good-bye to him, sir?",harry
"He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss.",harry
"Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.",harry
"Yeah, said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, I'd best get this bike away.",harry
"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall, said Dumbledore, nodding to her.",harry
On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put- Outer.,harry
He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.,harry
"He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.",harry
Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.,harry
"The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.",harry
"Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.",harry
His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.,harry
Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove.,harry
He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having.,harry
He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before.,harry
"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon.",harry
"And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.",harry
"He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on.",harry
"Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.",harry
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen.,harry
"It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike.",harry
"Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him.",harry
"Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes.",harry
"In the car crash when your parents died, she had said.",harry
Don't ask questions - that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.,harry
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.,harry
"About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut.",harry
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother.,harry
"Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room.",harry
"Thirty-six, he said, looking up at his mother and father.",harry
"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. '",harry
He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.,harry
"Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap.",harry
"Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away.",harry
The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.,harry
"What about what's-her-name, your friend - Yvonne?",harry
"I won't blow up the house, said Harry, but they weren't listening.",harry
"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!",harry
He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms.,harry
He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them.,harry
"Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.",harry
"On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens.",harry
The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.,harry
Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.,harry
"I had a dream about a motorcycle, said Harry, remembering suddenly.",harry
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families.,harry
Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time.,harry
"Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.",harry
"It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls.",harry
"Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone.",harry
"Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.",harry
"Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.",harry
"Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge.",harry
"Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.",harry
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake.,harry
"Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.",harry
"The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling.",harry
It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: I get that all the time.,harry
"I know, Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him.",harry
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass.,harry
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo.,harry
"As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.",harry
"Out of the way, you, he said, punching Harry in the ribs.",harry
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished.,harry
"The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor.",harry
People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.,harry
"But the glass, he kept saying, where did the glass go?",harry
"The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again.",harry
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry.,harry
"Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch.",harry
He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.,harry
"Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.",harry
He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died.,harry
"This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from.",harry
"His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions.",harry
A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley.,harry
"After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.",harry
A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.,harry
The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.,harry
The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment.,harry
"Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day.",harry
The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.,harry
"Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings.",harry
"Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school.",harry
"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall, he told Harry.",harry
The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it - it might be sick.,harry
"Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said.",harry
"One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's.",harry
"That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform.",harry
"Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters.",harry
"They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking.",harry
"As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life.",harry
He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.,harry
There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast.,harry
It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink.,harry
The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.,harry
Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.,harry
"Oh, he said, I didn't realize it had to be so wet.",harry
I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you.,harry
It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished.,harry
"Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue.",harry
"High - like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.",harry
"Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform.",harry
"Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.",harry
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.,harry
"Get the mail, Dudley, said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.",harry
"Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band.",harry
"No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him.",harry
"The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald- green ink.",harry
"Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter.",harry
"He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.",harry
"Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.",harry
His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights.,harry
"Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach.",harry
"They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room.",harry
He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.,harry
"I want to read it, said Harry furiously, as it's mine.",harry
"Get out, both of you, croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.",harry
"Watching - spying - might be following us, muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.",harry
Tell them we don't want - Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.,harry
"But - I'm not having one in the house, Petunia!",harry
Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?,harry
"It was addressed to you by mistake, said Uncle Vernon shortly.",harry
"It was not a mistake, said Harry angrily, it had my cupboard on it.",harry
"He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.",harry
It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room.,harry
They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched.,harry
Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.,harry
Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall.,harry
They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall.,harry
"Go to your cupboard - I mean, your bedroom, he wheezed at Harry.",harry
Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter.,harry
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first.,harry
His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door - AAAAARRRGH !,harry
He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea.,harry
"I want - he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.",harry
"Rowling Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.",harry
"He hummed Tiptoe Through the Tulips as he worked, and jumped at small noises.",harry
"Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets.",harry
"The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one - Out!",harry
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.,harry
"When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.",harry
"They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.",harry
I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave.,harry
He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue.,harry
Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.,harry
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city.,harry
"Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets.",harry
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day.,harry
They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. ',harry
Only I got about an 'undred of these at the front desk.,harry
"I'll take them, said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.",harry
"Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.",harry
"Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.",harry
"He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought.",harry
Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.,harry
Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine.,harry
"I've already got us some rations, said Uncle Vernon, so all aboard!",harry
Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces.,harry
Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas.,harry
He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.,harry
Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail.,harry
"Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.",harry
Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows.,harry
The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on.,harry
"He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger.",harry
Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight.,harry
"He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.",harry
"Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that?",harry
"The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door.",harry
There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room.,harry
"The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling.",harry
"He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame.",harry
He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.,harry
"Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.",harry
"Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.",harry
"Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh've got yer mom's eyes.",harry
"Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.",harry
"Anyway - Harry, said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, a very happy birthday to yeh.",harry
"Got summat fer yeh here - I mighta sat on it at some point, but it'll taste all right.",harry
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box.,harry
"Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.",harry
He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm.,harry
"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind.",harry
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted.,harry
Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage.,harry
"Uncle Vernon said sharply, Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley.",harry
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.,harry
"Do you mean ter tell me, he growled at the Dursleys,",harry
"He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad.",harry
"But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, About our world, I mean.",harry
"Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like Mimblewimble.",harry
"But yeh must know about yer mom and dad, he said.",harry
"My - my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?",harry
"Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.",harry
Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him?,harry
"Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh, said Hagrid.",harry
"With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be?",harry
"Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.",harry
"After a few minutes he stammered, What does it mean, they await my owl?",harry
Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.,harry
"I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him, he said.",harry
"A Muggle, said Hagrid, it's what we call nonmagic folk like them.",harry
"How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was?",harry
I was the only one who saw her for what she was - a freak!,harry
She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on.,harry
It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.,harry
"As soon as he found his voice he said, Blown up?",harry
Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!,harry
"I never expected this, he said, in a low, worried voice.",harry
"I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin'",harry
Well - I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it.,harry
"Anyway, this - this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers.",harry
"Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches . . .",harry
"Course, some stood up to him - an' he killed 'em.",harry
Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of.,harry
"Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway.",harry
"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew.",harry
Who never tried to get 'em on his side before . . .,harry
"All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago.",harry
"An' then - an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing - he tried to kill you, too.",harry
"Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then.",harry
"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders.",harry
Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there.,harry
"But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat.",harry
"Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.",harry
"Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it.",harry
Don' reckon they could've done if he was cornin' back.,harry
Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers.,harry
"Hagrid, he said quietly, I think you must have made a mistake.",harry
"Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.",harry
"Harry Potter, not a wizard - you wait, you'll be right famous at Hogwarts.",harry
But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight.,harry
He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world.,harry
"When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers.",harry
"Shouldn'ta lost me temper, he said ruefully, but it didn't work anyway.",harry
"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts, he said.",harry
"Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that.",harry
He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.,harry
"Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.",harry
I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards.,harry
When I open my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard.,harry
"Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him.",harry
"The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up.",harry
The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid 's coat.,harry
"There's an owl - Pay him, Hagrid grunted into the sofa.",harry
He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.,harry
"Don't worry about that, said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head.",harry
"But if their house was destroyed - They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy!",harry
"As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore.",harry
"Fetchin' you - gettin' things from Gringotts - knows he can trust me, see.",harry
The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight.,harry
"The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.",harry
"They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.",harry
"Seems a shame ter row, though, said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks.",harry
"If I was ter - er - speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?",harry
"Of course not, said Harry, eager to see more magic.",harry
"Spells - enchantments, said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke.",harry
They say there's dragons guardin' the high-security vaults.,harry
"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual, Hagrid muttered, turning the page.",harry
"So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice.",harry
"Blimey, Harry, everyone 'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems.",harry
"Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.",harry
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station.,harry
Wanted one ever since I was a kid - here we go.,harry
Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.,harry
"Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way.",harry
Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them?,harry
Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up?,harry
"This is it, said Hagrid, coming to a halt, the Leaky Cauldron.",harry
"If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there.",harry
"In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.",harry
"A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry.",harry
"Good Lord, said the bartender, peering at Harry, is this - can this be - ?",harry
"He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.",harry
The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.,harry
"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last.",harry
Always wanted to shake your hand - I'm all of a flutter.,harry
"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle.",harry
Harry shook hands again and again - Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.,harry
"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.",harry
"Against the D-D-Dark Arts, muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it.",harry
"You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose?",harry
But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself.,harry
"At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.",harry
"Scared of the students, scared of his own subject - now, where's me umbrella?",harry
"Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.",harry
He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.,harry
"The brick he had touched quivered - it wriggled - in the middle, a small hole appeared -",harry
Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.,harry
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.,harry
"Yeah, you'll be needin' one, said Hagrid, but we gotta get yer money first.",harry
"A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, Dragon liver,",harry
Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it.,harry
"Look, Harry heard one of them say, the new Nimbus Two Thousand - fastest ever -",harry
They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops.,harry
"Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was -",harry
"Yeah, that's a goblin, said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him.",harry
"He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet.",harry
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall.,harry
Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.,harry
"Got it, said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.",harry
"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore, said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest.",harry
It's about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.,harry
"Very well, he said, handing it back to Hagrid, I will have someone take you down to both vaults.",harry
What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?,harry
It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor.,harry
Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them.,harry
They climbed in - Hagrid with some difficulty - and were off.,harry
"The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering.",harry
"Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open.",harry
"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it, said Hagrid.",harry
"A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped.",harry
The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking.,harry
How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep?,harry
"And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.",harry
"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?",harry
The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners.,harry
He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.,harry
"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there, said Griphook.",harry
"About once every ten years, said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.",harry
Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor.,harry
"Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.",harry
Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money.,harry
"Might as well get yer uniform, said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions.",harry
"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron?",harry
"He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.",harry
"Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.",harry
"Got the lot here - another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.",harry
"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands, said the boy.",harry
Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms.,harry
I don't see why first years can't have their own.,harry
"No, Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.",harry
"Mmm, said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.",harry
"Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.",harry
"That's Hagrid, said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.",harry
He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy.,harry
"Oh, sorry, said the other, not sounding sorry at all.",harry
"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean.",harry
"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you?",harry
"They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways.",harry
"Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine.",harry
"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose, said the drawling boy.",harry
Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.,harry
"When they had left the shop, he said, Hagrid, what's Quidditch?",harry
"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know - not knowin' about Quidditch!",harry
If he'd known who yeh were - he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk.,harry
You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh.,harry
"Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but - I bet I'm in Hufflepuff, said Harry gloomily.",harry
There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.,harry
"Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these.",harry
You don't have to - I know I don't have to.,harry
"Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing.",harry
"He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.",harry
Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys.,harry
Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382b.,harry
A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.,harry
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside.,harry
"It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait.",harry
The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.,harry
"Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.",harry
"An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.",harry
"It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand.",harry
"Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow.",harry
"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand.",harry
"Well, I say your father favored it - it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.",harry
Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose.,harry
"Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger.",harry
"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it, he said softly.",harry
"He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.",harry
But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?,harry
"Er - yes, they did, yes, said Hagrid, shuffling his feet.",harry
"I've still got the pieces, though, he added brightly.",harry
Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.,harry
He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket.,harry
"Er - well, I'm right-handed, said Harry.",harry
"As he measured, he said, Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter.",harry
"We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons.",harry
"No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same.",harry
"And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand.",harry
"Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own.",harry
"That will do, he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor.",harry
"Try - Harry tried - but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.",harry
"No, no - here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.",harry
"Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, Oh, bravo!",harry
"He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, Curious . . .",harry
"It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather - just one other.",harry
"I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.",harry
"Must-Not-Be-Named did great things - terrible, yes, but great.",harry
"He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.",harry
"Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.",harry
"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves, he said.",harry
He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them.,harry
I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for.,harry
Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.,harry
"Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine.",harry
"But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts - I did - still do, 'smatter of fact.",harry
"Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.",harry
First o' September - King's Cross - it's all on yer ticket.,harry
THREE-QUARTERS Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun.,harry
"Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty.",harry
"Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.",harry
"Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company.",harry
"He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic.",harry
"He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased.",harry
"It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice.",harry
"He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.",harry
Er - I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to - to go to Hogwarts.,harry
He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.,harry
"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train.",harry
"I don't know, said Harry, realizing this for the first time.",harry
He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.,harry
"I just take the train from platform nine and three- quarters at eleven o'clock, he read.",harry
"Barking, said Uncle Vernon, howling mad, the lot of them.",harry
"We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother.",harry
Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.,harry
Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep.,harry
Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him.,harry
"Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.",harry
"Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they?",harry
"Have a good term, said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile.",harry
"He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig.",harry
"He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters.",harry
"Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one.",harry
"In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters.",harry
He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.,harry
At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.,harry
"The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair.",harry
Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him - and they had an owl.,harry
"They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.",harry
"Nine and three-quarters! piped a small girl, also red-",harry
What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.,harry
"I'm not Fred, I'm George, said the boy.",harry
"Only joking, I am Fred, said the boy, and off he went.",harry
"He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.",harry
I don't know how to - How to get onto the platform?,harry
All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten.,harry
"Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important.",harry
Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.,harry
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people.,harry
Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.,harry
Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.,harry
"He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, Gran, I've lost my toad again.",harry
Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train.,harry
He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door.,harry
He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.,harry
It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier.,harry
"With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.",harry
"Thanks, said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.",harry
"The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red.",harry
"Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.",harry
"With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.",harry
"The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.",harry
"I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves -",harry
If I get one more owl telling me you've - you've blown up a toilet or - Blown up a toilet?,harry
You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station?,harry
"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom,",harry
"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo.",harry
He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.,harry
"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?",harry
As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.,harry
"They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry.",harry
"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls.",harry
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner.,harry
He didn't know what he was going to - but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.,harry
The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.,harry
"He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked.",harry
"Oh - well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes, said Ron.",harry
"Well - I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.",harry
"I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him.",harry
The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.,harry
You could say I've got a lot to live up to.,harry
"Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny.",harry
"I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.",harry
"Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.",harry
"He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.",harry
Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl.,harry
"You said You-Know-Who's name\ said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed.",harry
There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.,harry
"While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.",harry
"They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.",harry
"Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.",harry
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.,harry
"Starving, said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.",harry
"He pulled one of them apart and said, She always forgets I don't like corned beef.",harry
"Swap you for one of these, said Harry, holding up a pasty.",harry
"Go on - You don't want this, it's all dry, said Ron.",harry
"She hasn't got much time, he added quickly, you know, with five of us.",harry
"Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect - famous witches and wizards.",harry
"I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy.",harry
"He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache.",harry
"Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore 's face had disappeared.",harry
"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, said Ron.",harry
Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.,harry
"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.",harry
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile.,harry
"Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.",harry
"Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.",harry
"Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.",harry
"Sorry, he said, but have you seen a toad at all?",harry
"When they shook their heads, he wailed, I've lost him!",harry
If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could.,harry
"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference, said Ron in disgust.",harry
"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work.",harry
He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand.,harry
It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.,harry
Anyway - He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again.,harry
"The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him.",harry
"She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.",harry
"Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.",harry
I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me.,harry
"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me, said Hermione.",harry
"Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad.",harry
I don't know what they'll say if I'm not.,harry
"I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.",harry
"So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?",harry
Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school.,harry
"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing something for Gringotts, said Ron.",harry
He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.,harry
They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment.,harry
"Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.",harry
"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle, said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking.",harry
"Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.",harry
"My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.",harry
"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter.",harry
You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort.,harry
"He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.",harry
"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks, he said coolly.",harry
"Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.",harry
"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter, he said slowly.",harry
Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents.,harry
"You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you.",harry
"Say that again, Ron said, his face as red as his hair.",harry
"But we don't feel like leaving, do we, boys?",harry
We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.,harry
"I think he's been knocked out, Ron said to Harry.",harry
No - I don't believe it - he's gone back to sleep.,harry
They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-,harry
He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.,harry
"Scabbers has been fighting, not us, said Ron, scowling at her.",harry
"And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?",harry
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.,harry
"Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.",harry
A voice echoed through the train: We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes' time.,harry
"Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.",harry
"Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles.",harry
They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.,harry
"People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform.",harry
"Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: Firs' years!",harry
"Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path.",harry
It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there.,harry
"Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.",harry
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake.,harry
"Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore.",harry
Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.,harry
"And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass.",harry
It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.,harry
"They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.",harry
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.,harry
"A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there.",harry
She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.,harry
The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it.,harry
"Rowling standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.",harry
"The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.",harry
Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards.,harry
"While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- breaking will lose House points.",harry
"At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor.",harry
I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.,harry
The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school.,harry
I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.,harry
"I shall return when we are ready for you, said Professor McGonagall.",harry
"Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.",harry
But he didn't know any magic yet - what on earth would he have to do?,harry
"He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too.",harry
"Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.",harry
Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air - several people behind him screamed.,harry
"Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years.",harry
"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves?",harry
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.,harry
"One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.",harry
"Now, form a line, Professor McGonagall told the first years, and follow me.",harry
At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.,harry
The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight.,harry
"Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver.",harry
"Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.",harry
"He heard Hermione whisper, It's bewitched to look like the sky outside.",harry
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.,harry
On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat.,harry
"You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall,",harry
"The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.",harry
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song.,harry
It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.,harry
"I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.",harry
"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted, she said.",harry
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table.,harry
Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.,harry
The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.,harry
He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.,harry
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.,harry
"A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous.",harry
"Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.",harry
"As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.",harry
Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat.,harry
"Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.",harry
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall.,harry
He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table.,harry
"Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, We got Potter!",harry
Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier.,harry
"At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up.",harry
"And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore.",harry
Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train.,harry
Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.,harry
"Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron.",harry
"Thomas, Dean, a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.",harry
"Turpin, Lisa, became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn.",harry
"Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, GRYFFINDOR!",harry
Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.,harry
"Well done, Ron, excellent, said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as Zabini, Blaise, was made a Slytherin.",harry
Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.,harry
"Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words.",harry
"The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.",harry
"Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick.",harry
Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.,harry
"That does look good, said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.",harry
"I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years, said the ghost.",harry
"I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it.",harry
My brothers told me about you - you're Nearly Headless Nick!,harry
"Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted.",harry
His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.,harry
"Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly.",harry
I hope you're going to help us win the House Championship this year?,harry
The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable - he's the Slytherin ghost.,harry
"He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.",harry
"As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.",harry
Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married.,harry
But I bounced - all the way down the garden and into the road.,harry
"Rowling really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy.",harry
"Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again.",harry
"No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape.",harry
"He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to - everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job.",harry
"Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.",harry
"At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again.",harry
Ahem - just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered.,harry
I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.,harry
First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils.,harry
And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.,harry
Dumbledore 's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.,harry
Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term.,harry
Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.,harry
"Rowling Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.",harry
"I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.",harry
"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!",harry
Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.,harry
"Everyone pick their favorite tune, said Dumbledore, and off we go!",harry
"Rowling So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we've forgot,",harry
"Just do your best, we'll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.",harry
"At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.",harry
"Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.",harry
"The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase.",harry
"Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food.",harry
"A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.",harry
"Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head.",harry
"They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.",harry
"You want to watch out for Peeves, said Percy, as they set off again.",harry
"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects.",harry
At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.,harry
"Caput Draconis, said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall.",harry
Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another.,harry
At the top of Page | 145 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.,harry
"Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.",harry
"Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.",harry
"Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream.",harry
"He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.",harry
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day.,harry
"Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.",harry
Rowling with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump.,harry
"It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot.",harry
"The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.",harry
It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open.,harry
"Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch.",harry
Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning.,harry
"The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.",harry
"And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves.",harry
"Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost.",harry
Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross.,harry
"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts, she said.",harry
Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.,harry
"After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle.",harry
Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else.,harry
There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.,harry
They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.,harry
They say he always favors them - we'll be able to see if it's true.,harry
"This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate.",harry
"Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.",harry
"At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him.",harry
"By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong.",harry
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands.,harry
"His eyes were black like Hagrid 's, but they had none of Hagrid 's warmth.",harry
They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.,harry
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making, he began.",harry
Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.,harry
What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?,harry
"Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione 's hand had shot into the air.",harry
"Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?",harry
"He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.",harry
"Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?",harry
"At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.",harry
"I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?",harry
"A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked.",harry
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.,harry
"As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.",harry
"Over the noise, Snape said, And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.",harry
Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.,harry
Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils.,harry
I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?,harry
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.,harry
"Take him up to the hospital wing, Snape spat at Seamus.",harry
"Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.",harry
You - Potter - why didn't you tell him not to add the quills?,harry
"Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you?",harry
"This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.",harry
"Don't push it, he muttered, I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.",harry
"As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low.",harry
He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week - why did Snape hate him so much?,harry
"Cheer up, said Ron, Snape's always taking points off Fred and George.",harry
At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds.,harry
Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest.,harry
A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.,harry
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks.,harry
"Hagrid 's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.",harry
"He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.",harry
"Make yerselves at home, said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears.",harry
"Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.",harry
"Another Weasley, eh? said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles.",harry
I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.,harry
Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.,harry
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch that old git.,harry
"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.",harry
"D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere?",harry
Can't get rid of her - Filch puts her up to it.,harry
"Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.",harry
Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.,harry
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.,harry
"Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.",harry
"There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time.",harry
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.,harry
"Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package.",harry
And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?,harry
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday - and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.,harry
To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.,harry
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.,harry
"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself, said Ron reasonably.",harry
Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom.,harry
"Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.",harry
Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly.,harry
"Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.",harry
"Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one.",harry
This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book - not that she hadn't tried.,harry
"Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.",harry
"Malfoy 's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.",harry
Gran knows I forget things - this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do.,harry
"Just looking, he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.",harry
"The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground.",harry
"She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.",harry
It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.,harry
"Stick out your right hand over your broom, called Madam Hooch at the front, and say 'Up!'",harry
"Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did.",harry
"Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all.",harry
Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.,harry
"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard, said Madam Hooch.",harry
"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly.",harry
"His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.",harry
"Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.",harry
"Come on, boy - it's all right, up you get.",harry
None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing!,harry
You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.',harry
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.,harry
"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom? said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl.",harry
I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find - how about - up a tree?,harry
"Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off.",harry
"Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, Come and get it, Potter!",harry
Madam Hooch told us not to move - you'll get us all into trouble.,harry
"Give it here, Harry called, or I'll knock you off that broom!",harry
"He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin.",harry
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- face and held the broom steady.,harry
"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy, Harry called.",harry
"Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall.",harry
"He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice.",harry
Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up.,harry
What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?,harry
"Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him.",harry
She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her.,harry
"He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper.",harry
"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?",harry
"Follow me, you two, said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.",harry
"Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.",harry
"Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing.",harry
Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.,harry
"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive, Professor McGonagall told Wood.",harry
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.,harry
"He's just the build for a Seeker, too, said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him.",harry
I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule.,harry
"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.",harry
Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.,harry
"Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it.",harry
"Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.",harry
"Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.",harry
"Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.",harry
"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year, said Fred.",harry
"We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant.",harry
"You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.",harry
"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school.",harry
"Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.",harry
"I'd take you on anytime on my own, said Malfoy.",harry
Well meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked.,harry
"When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.",harry
The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other.,harry
"Throw it away and punch him on the nose, Ron suggested.",harry
"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying - Bet you could, Ron muttered.",harry
"Half-past eleven, Ron muttered at last, we'd better go.",harry
"A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows.",harry
"It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.",harry
He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.,harry
"She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.",harry
Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting.,harry
The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.,harry
"We've got to go, we're going to be late.",harry
They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.,harry
D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?,harry
"I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.",harry
"He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.",harry
"I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed.",harry
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.,harry
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows.,harry
"At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky.",harry
They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.,harry
"Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness.",harry
"They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room.",harry
Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once.,harry
"He's late, maybe he's chickened out, Ron whispered.",harry
Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak - and it wasn't Malfoy.,harry
"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.",harry
Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.,harry
"They're in here somewhere, they heard him mutter, probably hiding.",harry
"Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.",harry
"I think we've lost him, Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead.",harry
"Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, I - told - you.",harry
"We've got to get back to Gryffindor Tower, said Ron, quickly as possible.",harry
"Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that.",harry
"Shut up, Peeves - please - you'll get us thrown out.",harry
"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please.",harry
"Should tell Filch, I should, said Peeves in a sanity voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly.",harry
"Get out of the way, snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves -",harry
"Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, We're done for!",harry
"They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves 's shouts.",harry
"She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered,",harry
"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?",harry
"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please, said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.",harry
Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please!,harry
And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.,harry
For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute.,harry
"For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -",harry
"They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor.",harry
"Harry groped for the doorknob - between Filch and death, he'd take Filch.",harry
"They fell backward - Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor.",harry
They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.,harry
"Never mind that - pig snout, pig snout, panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward.",harry
"They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.",harry
"Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.",harry
"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?",harry
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.,harry
"You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?",harry
"I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.",harry
"Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.",harry
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed.,harry
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide - except perhaps Hogwarts.,harry
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.,harry
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.,harry
They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.,harry
"Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.",harry
Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.,harry
Professor M. McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.,harry
"That's a broomstick, he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.",harry
"You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren't allowed them.",harry
"It's not any old broomstick, he said, it's a Nimbus Two Thousand.",harry
"What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?",harry
"Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the Nimbus.",harry
"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle, Malfoy snapped back.",harry
I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.,harry
"Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.",harry
"Yes, yes, that's right, said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.",harry
"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir, said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy's face.",harry
"Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion.",harry
So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?,harry
"Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.",harry
"Yes, don't stop now, said Ron, it's doing us so much good.",harry
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day.,harry
"Wow, Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.",harry
"Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful.",harry
"As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field.",harry
Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on.,harry
At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end.,harry
"They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.",harry
"Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground.",harry
What a feeling - he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field.,harry
The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.,harry
"I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.",harry
"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play.",harry
"Three Chasers, Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.",harry
The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal.,harry
Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops.,harry
"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score, Harry recited.",harry
"So - that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?",harry
"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper - I'm Keeper for Gryffindor.",harry
I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.,harry
"Three Chasers, one Keeper, said Harry, who was determined to remember it all.",harry
"He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.",harry
"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do, Wood said.",harry
"He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle.",harry
Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.,harry
"At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face.",harry
"Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely.",harry
"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms.",harry
We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that.,harry
And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers - - unless they crack my head open.,harry
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.,harry
"Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut.",harry
"This, said Wood, is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot.",harry
It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see.,harry
"A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -",harry
"I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.",harry
"He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.",harry
"Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted.",harry
"After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.",harry
"That Quidditch Cup'll have our name on it this year, said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle.",harry
"His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.",harry
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors.,harry
It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this.,harry
She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.,harry
"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!",harry
"Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.",harry
"Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.",harry
"Wingardium Leviosal he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.",harry
"It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.",harry
"You do it, then, if you're so clever, Ron snarled.",harry
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.,harry
Harry caught a glimpse of her face - and was startled to see that she was in tears.,harry
Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon.,harry
"The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.",harry
"Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, Troll - in the dungeons -",harry
It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.,harry
"Prefects, he rumbled, lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!",harry
"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid, said Ron.",harry
"As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.",harry
They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.,harry
"Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape.",harry
Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?,harry
"Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape 's fading footsteps.",harry
"He's heading for the third floor, Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.",harry
"And then they heard it - a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet.",harry
"Ron pointed - at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them.",harry
They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.,harry
"It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet.",harry
"It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.",harry
"It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.",harry
"They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it.",harry
"With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.",harry
"Oh, no, said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.",harry
"It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?",harry
"Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic.",harry
"Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint.",harry
"The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.",harry
"Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.",harry
"It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise.",harry
"It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.",harry
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk.,harry
"It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.",harry
"The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.",harry
"Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.",harry
"I don't think so, said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out.",harry
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose.,harry
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.,harry
Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.,harry
"Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air.",harry
"If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now.",harry
Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club.,harry
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.,harry
"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this, said Professor McGonagall.",harry
"If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor Tower.",harry
They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up.,harry
"It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.",harry
"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her, Harry reminded him.",harry
"Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them.",harry
"Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said Thanks, and hurried off to get plates.",harry
The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel.,harry
"On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.",harry
"If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the House Championship.",harry
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend.,harry
"She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.",harry
"They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard.",harry
"He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.",harry
"Library books are not to be taken outside the school, said Snape.",harry
"He's just made that rule up, Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away.",harry
"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him, said Ron bitterly.",harry
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window.",harry
"He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow.",harry
"Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.",harry
He pushed the door ajar and peered inside - and a horrible scene met his eyes.,harry
How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?,harry
Snape 's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg.,harry
"Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor.",harry
"In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen.",harry
He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween!,harry
That's where he was going when we saw him - he's after whatever it's guarding!,harry
"And I'd bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!",harry
"I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.",harry
"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something, snapped Ron.",harry
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question.,harry
In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.,harry
Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.,harry
"Thanks, Seamus, said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.",harry
By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch.,harry
"The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.",harry
"Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row.",harry
"As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined.",harry
"It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath.",harry
Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.,harry
"We know Oliver's speech by heart, Fred told Harry, we were on the team last year.",harry
"He glared at them all as if to say, Or else.",harry
"She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.",harry
"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you, she said, once they were all gathered around her.",harry
"Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year.",harry
Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him.,harry
"Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.",harry
"The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.",harry
"Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.",harry
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.,harry
"Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch.",harry
"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch, Wood had said.",harry
"When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings.",harry
In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold.,harry
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor.,harry
"But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.",harry
"Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, Send him off, ref!",harry
In soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!,harry
So - after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating - Jordan!,harry
"I mean, after that open and revolting foul - Jordan, I'm warning you -",harry
"It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened.",harry
"For a split second, he thought he was going to fall.",harry
It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off.,harry
But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off.,harry
"It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.",harry
"Spinnet - passes Bell - hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose - only joking,",harry
"Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands.",harry
"His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on.",harry
Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it.,harry
"He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.",harry
Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic - no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.,harry
He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.,harry
"His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer.",harry
"They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell.",harry
Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.,harry
"Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words.",harry
Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape 's robes.,harry
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire.,harry
"Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.",harry
Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.,harry
"He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.",harry
"It was Snape, Ron was explaining, Hermione and I saw him.",harry
"He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.",harry
"Rubbish, said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands.",harry
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him.",harry
He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween.,harry
"Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort.",harry
The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.,harry
"I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them!",harry
"I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student!",harry
"Now, listen to me, all three of yeh - yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh.",harry
"One morning in mid- December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow.",harry
"Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them.",harry
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match.,harry
"So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.",harry
It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.,harry
He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had.,harry
"Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.",harry
"When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.",harry
Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.,harry
"He was provoked, Professor Snape, said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree.",harry
"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid, said Snape silkily.",harry
"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.",harry
"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas, said Hagrid.",harry
"Tell yeh what, come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat.",harry
"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree - put it in the far corner, would you?",harry
Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is.,harry
"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all, said Hermione.",harry
Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?,harry
We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere - just give us a hint -,harry
He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there.,harry
"Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library.",harry
"He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel.",harry
"They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to.",harry
"Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful.",harry
What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.,harry
"Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.",harry
"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?",harry
"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is, said Ron.",harry
"Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.",harry
"This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle.",harry
"Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family - in this case, his grandfather.",harry
"Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all.",harry
"He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing.",harry
"Don't send me there, can't you see his knight?",harry
"Merry Christmas, said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.",harry
"It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid.",harry
"You can keep it, said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.",harry
"I told her you didn't expect any presents and - oh, no,",harry
"Every year she makes us a sweater, said Ron, unwrapping his own, and mine's always maroon.",harry
"That's really nice of her, said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.",harry
His next present also contained candy - a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.,harry
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds.,harry
"If that's what I think it is - they're really rare, and really valuable.",harry
"It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.",harry
"It's an Invisibility Cloak, said Ron, a look of awe on his face.",harry
Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.,harry
"Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible.",harry
He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.,harry
"Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in.",harry
"Hey, look - Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!",harry
She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.,harry
"Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm.",harry
"I hate maroon, Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.",harry
"Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one.",harry
"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either, said George.",harry
"They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.",harry
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner.,harry
Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice.,harry
The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.,harry
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds.,harry
He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.,harry
Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day.,harry
Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.,harry
"He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air.",harry
"Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.",harry
Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence.,harry
"He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.",harry
"He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.",harry
"He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.",harry
"He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked.",harry
Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books.,harry
One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood.,harry
"Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book.",harry
"A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence - the book was screaming!",harry
"Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note.",harry
"He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once.",harry
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor.,harry
"He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going.",harry
"Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all.",harry
"There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.",harry
"Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them.",harry
Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.,harry
"They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away.",harry
It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.,harry
"It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.",harry
There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.,harry
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming.,harry
"Harry looked over his shoulder - but still, no one was there.",harry
A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving.,harry
"The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her.",harry
"It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.",harry
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.,harry
"He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.",harry
The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.,harry
"He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed.",harry
"He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, I'll come back, and hurried from the room.",harry
"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.",harry
"I'd like to see your mom and dad, Ron said eagerly.",harry
"Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?",harry
He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight.,harry
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again.,harry
"With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night.",harry
"They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.",harry
"They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else.",harry
"Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.",harry
Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.,harry
"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.",harry
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.,harry
"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.",harry
Don't push me - A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.,harry
Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door.,harry
"Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -",harry
"This isn't safe - she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.",harry
"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror.",harry
"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -",harry
"And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily.",harry
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror.,harry
There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family.,harry
Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore.,harry
"Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.",harry
"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you, said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.",harry
"I don't need a cloak to become invisible, said Dumbledore gently.",harry
"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?",harry
"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.",harry
"You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you.",harry
"Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them.",harry
"If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared.",harry
"It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.",harry
"Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?",harry
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful.,harry
"But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.",harry
"Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't.",harry
"Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.",harry
"Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks.",harry
"Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.",harry
Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits.,harry
"The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side.",harry
"Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.",harry
"Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news.",harry
That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match!,harry
"Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!",harry
He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.,harry
"The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.",harry
"Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.",harry
He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.,harry
"Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse.",harry
"Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.",harry
"Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.",harry
He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on.,harry
"He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.",harry
Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.,harry
"D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?",harry
"As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.",harry
She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.,harry
"Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.",harry
I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.,harry
"It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.",harry
"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry, said Ron.",harry
"He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?",harry
It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.,harry
"If I don't, all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape.",harry
"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field, said Hermione.",harry
"As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione.",harry
"Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went.",harry
"At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own.",harry
"Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry.",harry
Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the Sorcerer's Stone?,harry
Harry didn't see how he could - yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.,harry
Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.,harry
"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis, Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.",harry
"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it's now.",harry
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.,harry
"Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.",harry
Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time?,harry
Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him.,harry
You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?,harry
Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.,harry
"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something.",harry
Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.,harry
"Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd.",harry
"Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.",harry
"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!",harry
"Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground.",harry
"Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.",harry
"The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.",harry
"Well done, said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.",harry
Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror . .,harry
"Jc Jc Jc Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed.",harry
He'd really done something to be proud of now - no one could say he was just a famous name any more.,harry
"He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.",harry
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.,harry
"Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest.",harry
"Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner - what was going on?",harry
Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run.,harry
The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone.,harry
"He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices.",harry
He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.,harry
"He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.",harry
"Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone.",harry
"Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever.",harry
"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private, said Snape, his voice icy.",harry
"Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after all.",harry
Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?,harry
"An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree.",harry
"He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, - your little bit of hocus-pocus.",harry
"Well have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.",harry
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing.,harry
"It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.",harry
"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-",harry
He's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he'll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin!,harry
He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus-pocus' -,harry
So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?,harry
"THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought.",harry
"Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe.",harry
"Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone.",harry
She had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all her notes.,harry
"Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.",harry
"That's not ages, that's like a second to Nicolas Flamel.",harry
"But we're not six hundred years old, Ron reminded her.",harry
"Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it all.",harry
You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year?,harry
"They're very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten into me.",harry
"Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione.",harry
They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones.,harry
It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements.,harry
It was the first really fine day they'd had in months.,harry
"Jus' lookin', he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once.",harry
"Oh, we found out who he is ages ago, said Ron impressively.",harry
"They'll think I've told yeh - See you later, then, said Harry.",harry
"I'm going to see what section he was in, said Ron, who'd had enough of working.",harry
He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.,harry
"Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide.",harry
"Hagrid 's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, said Harry.",harry
"Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that.",harry
You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania.,harry
"The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you.",harry
"Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget.",harry
"Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate.",harry
"Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.",harry
We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone apart from Fluffy.,harry
"We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.",harry
"Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it.",harry
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was.,harry
"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren't you, Hagrid?",harry
"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore, said Hagrid proudly.",harry
"In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.",harry
"Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.",harry
But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?,harry
"Well, I've bin doin' some readin', said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow.",harry
"Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too.",harry
"Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.",harry
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut.,harry
"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?",harry
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen.,harry
Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.,harry
Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.,harry
They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.,harry
All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open.,harry
"It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella.",harry
"Hagrid, said Hermione, how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?",harry
Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains - it's a kid -,harry
"Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous.",harry
"They spent most of their free time in Hagrid 's darkened hut, trying to reason with him.",harry
Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy.,harry
There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.,harry
"I've decided to call him Norbert, said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes.",harry
"He's lost his marbles, Ron muttered in Harry's ear.",harry
"Hagrid, said Harry loudly, give it two weeks and Norbert's going to be as long as your house.",harry
Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!,harry
"And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him.",harry
"Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.",harry
The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open.,harry
Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's Invisibility Cloak.,harry
"He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.",harry
I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week.,harry
The three of them put their heads together to read the note.,harry
"Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon.",harry
Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday?,harry
They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark.,harry
It shouldn't be too difficult - I think the cloak's big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.,harry
It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him.,harry
"By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size.",harry
He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey - would she recognize a dragon bite?,harry
"It's not just my hand, he whispered, although that feels like it's about to fall off.",harry
Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me.,harry
"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday, said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all.",harry
"On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.",harry
"Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert.",harry
"Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.",harry
"It's too late to change the plan now, Harry told Hermione.",harry
"We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert.",harry
"And we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that.",harry
Norbert's at a tricky stage - nothin' I can't handle.,harry
"The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle.",harry
Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.,harry
An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.,harry
From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.,harry
"Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.",harry
"How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew.",harry
Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.,harry
"Up another staircase, then another - even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier.",harry
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.,harry
"Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.",harry
"Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you -",harry
"Come on - I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!",harry
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that.,harry
"Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate.",harry
"About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.",harry
"They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.",harry
"They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them.",harry
No more dragon - Malfoy in detention - what could spoil their happiness?,harry
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs.,harry
"As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.",harry
"Well, well, well, he whispered, we are in trouble.",harry
He couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time.,harry
How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak?,harry
"Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.",harry
She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.,harry
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question.,harry
"She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.",harry
"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on, said Professor McGonagall.",harry
"I suppose you think it's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?",harry
"As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this.",harry
"Harry gasped - they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in the last Quidditch match.",harry
"Fifty points each, said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.",harry
"Professor - please - You can't- Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter.",harry
"In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the House Cup.",harry
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.,harry
He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours.,harry
What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done?,harry
How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday?,harry
"From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated.",harry
"Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup.",harry
"Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him.",harry
"Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like them.",harry
"They've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?",harry
He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.,harry
How are we going to get any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?,harry
"Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.",harry
All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery.,harry
"Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead.",harry
"No - no - not again, please - It sounded as though someone was threatening him.",harry
"Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban.",harry
He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry.,harry
He strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him.,harry
"He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom.",harry
"It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.",harry
Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling.,harry
"Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy.",harry
If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell -,harry
I bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog.,harry
"The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.",harry
If we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure.,harry
"It's not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore 'll think we made it up to get him sacked.",harry
"And don't forget, we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy.",harry
"If we just do a bit of poking around - No, said Harry flatly, we've done enough poking around.",harry
He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.,harry
"The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table.",harry
They were all the same: Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight.,harry
Professor M. McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost.,harry
"He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word.",harry
"Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.",harry
"Follow me, said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.",harry
"I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again,",harry
It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out . .,harry
"It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.",harry
"The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness.",harry
"Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut.",harry
Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn't be so bad.,harry
"At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.",harry
"We can't go in there at night - there's all sorts of things in there - werewolves, I heard.",harry
Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise.,harry
"Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?",harry
"Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel.",harry
"He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.",harry
"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts, said Hagrid fiercely.",harry
Yeh've done wrong an' now yeh've got ter pay fer it.,harry
"But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do.",harry
"If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack.",harry
"Right then, said Hagrid, now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight,",harry
"Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees.",harry
A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.,harry
"Look there, said Hagrid, see that stuff shinin' on the ground?",harry
"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang, said Hagrid.",harry
"Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions.",harry
"There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least.",harry
"I want Fang, said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang's long teeth.",harry
"Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right?",harry
"It's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures.",harry
Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by.,harry
There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.,harry
Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak.,harry
"He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire.",harry
Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground.,harry
"Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.",harry
"Oh, it's you, Ronan, said Hagrid in relief.",harry
"Can't be too careful, Ronan, said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.",harry
"So it has been for ages past, so it is now.",harry
"Yeah, said Hagrid, but have yeh seen anythin', Ronan?",harry
"Mars is bright tonight, Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently.",harry
There's a unicorn bin injured - would yeh know anythin' about it?,harry
"Well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh?",harry
"Never, said Hagrid irritably, try an' get a straight answer out of a centaur.",harry
He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.,harry
They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid 's arm.,harry
"Harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.",harry
"Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke.",harry
"Well be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'.",harry
So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang.,harry
"There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.",harry
"Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.",harry
"Look - he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.",harry
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood.,harry
"Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast.",harry
Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted - so did Fang.,harry
The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry - unicorn blood was dribbling down its front.,harry
It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry - he couldn't move for fear.,harry
Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire.,harry
"He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.",harry
The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees.,harry
"He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.",harry
The forest is not safe at this time - especially for you.,harry
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing.,harry
"Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.",harry
"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens.",harry
Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?,harry
"I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, he said in his gloomy voice.",harry
It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!,harry
"Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.",harry
"I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.",harry
"They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.",harry
"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?",harry
"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn, said Firenze.",harry
"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime.",harry
"Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.",harry
"If you're going to be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?",harry
"Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?",harry
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart.,harry
"Do you mean, Harry croaked, that was VoZ - Harry!",harry
"Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.",harry
"I'm fine, said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying.",harry
"The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there.",harry
"This is where I leave you, Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn.",harry
"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs.",harry
"He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.",harry
"Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.",harry
He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake.,harry
"Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.",harry
"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of.",harry
"With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you.",harry
"It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic.",harry
"When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them.",harry
"Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.",harry
"It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers.",harry
"They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell.",harry
"Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.",harry
I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.,harry
"The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.",harry
"No more studying, Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass.",harry
"My scar keeps hurting - it's happened before, but never as often as this.",harry
"Harry, relax, Hermione 's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around.",harry
"Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy.",harry
"He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry.",harry
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.,harry
"When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, That's just the exams.",harry
I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one.,harry
"Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though.",harry
"He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth.",harry
Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy . . .,harry
How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law?,harry
"Yes, please, said Ron, but Harry cut him off.",harry
"Dunno said Hagrid casually, he wouldn' take his cloak off.",harry
He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.,harry
"Mighta come up, said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.",harry
"They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction.",harry
"They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.",harry
"Well just have to - Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.",harry
"We want to see Professor Dumbledore, said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.",harry
"Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do.",harry
He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.,harry
"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time -",harry
"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?",harry
"The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up.",harry
"Professor, I think - I know - that Sn - that someone's going to try and steal the Stone.",harry
"But Professor - Potter, I know what I'm talking about, she said shortly.",harry
"It's tonight, said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot.",harry
"He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way.",harry
"He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.",harry
"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this, he said, with an odd, twisted smile.",harry
"We were - Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.",harry
"Hanging around like this, people will think you're up to something.",harry
"And Gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?",harry
"Be warned, Potter - any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled.",harry
"Right, here's what we've got to do, he whispered urgently.",harry
One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape - wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it.,harry
"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.",harry
"He put on a high voice, 'Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried,",harry
I think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . ',harry
"Oh, shut up, said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.",harry
"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor, Harry told Ron.",harry
I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!,harry
"If I hear you've come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor!",harry
"If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back!",harry
Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over?,harry
"He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts!",harry
D'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup?,harry
I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me!,harry
"You're right, Harry, said Hermione in a small voice.",harry
"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?",harry
How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us?,harry
"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.",harry
Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam.,harry
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.,harry
"Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all.",harry
This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it.,harry
"Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break.",harry
Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.,harry
"Better get the cloak, Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning.",harry
He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas.,harry
He pocketed it to use on Fluffy - he didn't feel much like singing.,harry
"Nothing, Neville, nothing, said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.",harry
"They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.",harry
"You can't go out, said Neville, you'll be caught again.",harry
"I won't let you do it, he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole.",harry
"Neville, Ron exploded, get away from that hole and don't be an idiot -",harry
And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!,harry
"He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.",harry
"Neville, she said, I'm really, really sorry about this.",harry
"His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.",harry
"We had to, Neville, no time to explain, said Harry.",harry
"You'll understand later, Neville, said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.",harry
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen.,harry
"At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.",harry
"As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.",harry
They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor.,harry
"Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.",harry
"Know you're there, even if I can't see you.",harry
"He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.",harry
"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen.",harry
"Peeves, he said, in a hoarse whisper, the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.",harry
He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.,harry
"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir, he said greasily.",harry
"I will, sir, I most certainly will, said Peeves, rising up in the air again.",harry
"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you.",harry
"A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor - and the door was already ajar.",harry
"Well, there you are, Harry said quietly, Snape's already got past Fluffy.",harry
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them.,harry
"If you want to go back, I won't blame you, he said.",harry
"You can take the cloak, I won't need it now.",harry
"As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears.",harry
"All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them.",harry
"It must wake up the moment you stop playing, said Harry.",harry
"It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop.",harry
"Keep playing, Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor.",harry
"They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads.",harry
"I think we'll be able to pull the door open, said Ron, peering over the dog's back.",harry
Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs.,harry
"He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.",harry
"Nothing - just black - there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop.",harry
"Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.",harry
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips.,harry
"Then he looked up at Ron and said, If anything happens to me, don't follow.",harry
"Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?",harry
"Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and - FLUMP.",harry
"With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft.",harry
"He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom.",harry
It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.,harry
"There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped.",harry
"She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles.",harry
"As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.",harry
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her.,harry
"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!",harry
"Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.",harry
"In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.",harry
"Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.",harry
"Yeah, said Ron, and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis -",harry
"This way, said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.",harry
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls.,harry
"With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank.",harry
A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.,harry
"They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them.",harry
"It was full of small, jewel- bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room.",harry
On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.,harry
Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?,harry
"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . .",harry
"He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room.",harry
"He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened.",harry
"They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm.",harry
"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one - probably silver, like the handle.",harry
"They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys.",harry
"They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.",harry
"Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century.",harry
"That big one - there - no, there - with bright blue wings - the feathers are all crumpled on one side.",harry
"Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.",harry
"Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing.",harry
"Ron, you come at it from above - Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down -",harry
"They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand.",harry
"Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle.",harry
The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all.,harry
"But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.",harry
"Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces.",harry
"Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly - the towering white chessmen had no faces.",harry
"I think, said Ron, we're going to have to be chessmen.",harry
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse.,harry
The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.,harry
Do we - er - have to join you to get across?,harry
I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces.,harry
"Finally he said, Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess -",harry
"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.",harry
"White always plays first in chess, said Ron, peering across the board.",harry
"The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.",harry
"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.",harry
"Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.",harry
Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.,harry
"Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger.",harry
"He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.",harry
"Ron - Look, if you don't hurry up, hell already have the Stone!",harry
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet.,harry
"With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.",harry
"He'll be all right, said Harry, trying to convince himself.",harry
"A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses.",harry
"They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway.",harry
"At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.",harry
"Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, whichever you would find,",harry
"A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever.",harry
"Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them.",harry
The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire - toward the Stone.,harry
"There's only enough there for one of us, he said.",harry
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.,harry
"I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really.",harry
"Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.",harry
"I'm not as good as you, said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.",harry
"She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.",harry
"Here I come, he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.",harry
"Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.",harry
"Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-",harry
Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match.,harry
"I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.",harry
He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again.,harry
"All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular . . .",harry
Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.,harry
I have a special gift with trolls - you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there?,harry
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.,harry
"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone, Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame.",harry
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.,harry
I saw you and Snape in the forest - he blurted out.,harry
"Yes, said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.",harry
"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got.",harry
Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.,harry
"Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give.",harry
He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.,harry
"Oh, he does, said Quirrell casually, heavens, yes.",harry
"He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know?",harry
"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing - I thought Snape was threatening you.",harry
"For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.",harry
"A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil.",harry
"Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times.",harry
"When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased.",harry
Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley - how could he have been so stupid?,harry
"He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.",harry
But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to?,harry
"And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.",harry
"He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off.",harry
"I must look and lie about what I see, that's all.",harry
Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban.,harry
"He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.",harry
"He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first.",harry
It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood- red stone.,harry
"As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer's Stone against his leg.",harry
"But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn't moving his lips.",harry
Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot.,harry
"Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban.",harry
"Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound.",harry
"It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.",harry
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move.,harry
I have form only when I can share another's body . . .,harry
"Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him.",harry
"I killed your father first, and he put up a courageous fight . . .",harry
"Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.",harry
"Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed SEIZE HIM!",harry
"Master, I cannot hold him - my hands - my hands!",harry
"Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could.",harry
"He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.",harry
"Sir, I - Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.",harry
I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat.,harry
"Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.",harry
"Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.",harry
"But sir, the Stone - I see you are not to be distracted.",harry
"I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.",harry
"But your friend - Nicolas Flamel - Oh, you know about Nicolas? said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.",harry
"Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best.",harry
"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?",harry
"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.",harry
"You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing.",harry
"Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he?",harry
He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.,harry
"Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt.",harry
"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.",harry
Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me.,harry
But why would he want to kill me in the first place?,harry
"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you.",harry
"If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love.",harry
He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark.,harry
It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.,harry
"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.",harry
"Yes, him - Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father.",harry
"Funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it?",harry
I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even.,harry
"Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.",harry
"It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something.",harry
He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth.,harry
"Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.",harry
"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different.",harry
"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to - Dumbledore was so worried -",harry
It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors.,harry
"I always said he was off his rocker, said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.",harry
I mean to say - that's terrible - you could have been killed.,harry
"I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know.",harry
I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked.,harry
"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right, said Ron proudly.",harry
"Listen, you've got to be up for the end- of-year feast tomorrow.",harry
"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT, she said firmly.",harry
"After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.",harry
"I want to go to the feast, he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes.",harry
"As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed.",harry
"He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.",harry
"It was the only thing he didn't know, an' I told him!",harry
I should be chucked out an' made ter live as a Muggle!,harry
"Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying.",harry
I've met him and I'm calling him by his name.,harry
"Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it.",harry
"Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, That reminds me.",harry
Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.,harry
Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night.,harry
A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.,harry
"When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once.",harry
And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast.,harry
Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were . . .,harry
A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.,harry
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.,harry
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears.,harry
Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves - they were a hundred points up.,harry
They had tied for the House Cup - if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.,harry
He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.,harry
"Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile.",harry
He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape 's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot.,harry
"It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.",harry
"Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did.",harry
"Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one.",harry
"It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.",harry
It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform.,harry
"You must come and stay this summer, said Ron, both of you - I'll send you an owl.",harry
"Thanks, said Harry, I'll need something to look forward to.",harry
People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.,harry
"Not where I'm going, I promise you, said Harry.",harry
"It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron.",harry
"I can see Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point.",harry
"Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.",harry
"Oh, I will, said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face.",harry
They don't know we're not allowed to use magic at home.,harry
"His hollow eyes, the size of a vulture's balls, penetrate me.",medium
"Franz, I say, what are you doing at an hour like this?",medium
"Franz winks and smiles wide, revealing what remains of his two teeth.",medium
They are the color of ointment extracted from a baby's behind three days after its deposit.,medium
"I've been talking all my life, he says, but no one listened.",medium
"If you'd let me marry you, he continues with my rhyme, I wouldn't be so blue.",medium
Now it resembles a blob of chewing gum that expands as you add one more blob to the mixture.,medium
"We keep chewing, chewing, chewing, until some nasty fink comes along and rips it out of our mouth.",medium
"I lean against him to make him smell the beer on my tongue, the froth still fresh on my lips.",medium
"Franz keeps me up, in the middle of night, refusing me sleep.",medium
"I tell him that I deserve sleep, having worked all my life.",medium
This is the first time that I have interrupted him in the middle of a speech.,medium
The books we need are the kind that act upon us like a misfortune.,medium
They make us suffer like the death of someone we love more than ourselves.,medium
They make us feel as though we were on the verge of suicide -,medium
"Franz, I interrupt again, worried, why do you say that?",medium
A book should serve as an ax for the frozen sea within us.,medium

Almost every person I've met has thought about changing some aspect of their life.,medium
Undoubtedly the most popular form of self-improvement is setting goals.,medium
"Living by goals has a yo-yo effect, bouncing between accomplishing goals and the time in between these accomplishments.",medium
"Once a goal is reached, it is easy to revert back to old habits.",medium
"This is because in order to accomplish a goal, many people will take steps that don't align with their normal behavior.",medium
"For example, a recent goal of mine was to lose weight until I hit a certain number on the scale.",medium
"After about two months of consistent effort, I was able to reach my goal.",medium
"However, after hitting that goal, it became increasingly difficult to maintain progress.",medium
This is a classic example of the yo-yo effect in action.,medium
It was difficult for me to continue making progress after accomplishing the goal because I no longer had my source of motivation.,medium
"When actions are dependent on accomplishing a goal, results become everything.",medium
Prioritizing the goal over the system makes it more difficult to continue on a healthy trajectory after accomplishing the goal.,medium
Two opposing teams in a sports game both have the same goal - to win.,medium
Thus the goal does not make the difference between winners and losers.,medium
"Similarly, focusing on the goal is an important step in the process, but it's not sufficient without consistency and practice.",medium
"Instead of trying to accomplish a goal, seek to optimize the habits that you live by.",medium
These little changes to how you live your everyday life will deliver results on a much grander scheme than focusing on accomplishing goals.,medium
"By setting goals and accomplishing them, we use the gratification of these small wins as motivation to accomplish the next goal.",medium
"To change your behavior, you first have to define an image of the type of person you want to be.",medium
Expecting yourself to stick to behaviors that are unnatural or difficult is unreasonable.,medium
Notice that this subtle difference in language demonstrates two completely different responses.,medium
"By saying I'm trying to quit, Person 1 is insinuating that they are still a smoker.",medium
"In other words, they are still living the identity as a smoker.",medium
"Unhealthy behaviors will start to feel incongruent with this new version of yourself, and many old habits will fall away with time.",medium
The region described in this article is the traditional territory of the Northeastern Yavapai and Northern Tonto Apache.,medium
The dwellings at Walnut Canyon were created by people that archaeologists call the Sinagua.,medium
"I think of people who, under a younger sun, planned for the day ahead or smiled at a memory.",medium
"Ten miles east of Flagstaff on I-40, Walnut Canyon - Wupatupqa, in Hopi - slices 400 feet into Permian Kaibab Limestone.",medium
"This reveals the dark vein of the Toroweap Formation and, below it, moon-white Coconino Sandstone.",medium
"It was carved by Walnut Creek, which advances to meet the Little Colorado River on its journey toward the Grand Canyon.",medium
"On south-facing slopes, drier and more exposed, juniper and piÃ±on mingle with prickly pear and yucca.",medium
The deep stillness here is punctuated by the continuous climb and fall of hawks.,medium
"They're hunting jays, tracing weightless arcs through the air with their pursuit.",medium
"The first time I reach a pueblo, it's almost jarring.",medium
The miles of woodland between here and the nearest city lend the feeling that this is a nature preserve.,medium
"But beyond its natural beauty, this national monument is, in fact, an archaeological site.",medium
"But it is a site of archaeological significance, evincing as it does the lifeways of past humans.",medium
"What strikes me most are the smoke stains on the rock, 800-year-old relics of heat and light.",medium
"On the other side of this chasm is a steep, tiered expanse of canyon wall.",medium
"It's just a plane of pathless rock, laden with stubborn pines.",medium
"I imagine standing here as dusk settles, the smell of woodsmoke drifting on the wind.",medium
"It's an uncommon thing, to have this kind of opportunity to connect with the history of the landscape.",medium
I want to share my journey and share my key learnings from living as a digital nomad so far.,medium
"The idea of living in a sailboat sailing around the world, propelled by the wind, sounds like music in my ears.",medium
Living on a boat is a lot of joy but is also frustrating at times.,medium
What made me swap the safe life on land with a rough life at sea playing by the rules of mother earth?,medium
But why?It all started with me feeling that something was missing in life.,medium
I wanted a life with more contrasts - you need to feel the ups and the downs to appreciate the peaks!,medium
"In the summer of 2018, we chartered a sailboat in Croatia and I immediately fell in love with sailing!",medium
My boyfriend thought it just was a short time of inspiration after the holiday in Croatia.,medium
We have had some minor issues with the apartment we lived in and the situation changed in April 2019.,medium
The marked looked good and it was time to sell the apartment.,medium
Buying a new house or apartment felt so wrong because it felt so permanent.,medium
"At Easter 2019, we finally sold our apartment and had no plans for the future.",medium
"For sure, we did have some quite scary situations on our way and the learning curve was as steep as a wall.",medium
Before buying a boat we sold all of our possessions that we would not bring to our new floating home.,medium
Selling things we didn't need anymore gave us some money to keep us floating for a while.,medium
"Before, I used to work as a consultant in a Norwegian consultant company making software for clients.",medium
About a year ago I leaped and started my own company working as a self-employed developer.,medium
I wanted the flexibility to pick the clients with interesting projects - not just working for the clients a company has obligations to.,medium
I also wanted more time with family and more time to travel.,medium
Being the boss of my own company makes it easier to live the life I wanted.,medium
At one point I simply didn't see why I couldn't just be a self-employed developer.,medium
"In the end, we are just humans with knowledge and what company I work for does not change my knowledge.",medium
I have not had any income in my company for a while now-,medium
The virus ruined all our future traveling plans and it forced us to be creative and make the best out of our situation.,medium
We are now working full-time programming while living on the boat.,medium
We quite like it and see ourselves continuing this lifestyle in the future.,medium
So how is my new office space compared to living on land?First of all - I do not always work from the boat.,medium
"You need your basic tools like a computer, keyboard, coffee, etc.",medium
But there are some basics that a landlubber probably takes for granted - like power and Wifi.,medium
"Because of our basic needs, we often spend our office day on land where we have wifi and unlimited power.",medium
One solution to the reception problem is what I call Pirate style wifi .,medium
You go to a bar - buy a beer - get wifi code - go back to the boat and enjoy the wifi.,medium
"Unfortunately, we do not have a wifi repeater but we are planning to get one.",medium
"Usually, we try to find a cafe or somewhere offering wifi.",medium
When I used to be a landlubber I took public transport to get to work.,medium
I do not have space for a car in my boat nor have I prioritized to fit a bike in there either.,medium
And a bike will not take me from the boat to land anyway.,medium
That's like a small rib that acts like our small floating car.,medium
A laundry is where I currently sit right now writing this article.,medium
Like I started the article: wherever good coffee and wifi exist is my office.,medium
I have a MacBook and sitting on a table only using this every day might not work well for your body.,medium
I have a laptop rooster stand to raise my computer to a height where my neck can be straight.,medium
"I also added a wireless keyboard, wireless touchpad, and a noise-canceling headset.",medium
Everything I use is small in terms of size and weight and fits perfectly in my backpack together with my MacBook.,medium
You know - a cafe does not necessarily make good coffee because they sell coffee.,medium
I bring it in my big coffee container to keep me going.,medium
Other options like checking into a co-working space are also possible.,medium
"Unfortunately, they are not quite common in the Caribbean and it usually requires you to spend some time in one place.",medium
When traveling we usually have prioritized to explore islands rather than work.,medium
You will stress test your relationship while sailing and living together in a small place like a sailboat.,medium
I am so grateful that I can bring my hobby and my work with me wherever and whenever I want.,medium
"What a blessing!After corona, more companies have some practice in working remotely.",medium
I look forward to seeing if I can get more projects working remotely from the boat.,medium
Norway has not been leaning forward on this remote work but maybe things will change in the future?,medium
Maybe I don't have to work from a Norwegian company at all?,medium
You are most of your time alone working because your colleagues are not there.,medium
They say that the happiest moment for a sailor is when the new owners leave with the boat.,medium
"The todo-list of maintenance is a never-ending story and can be quite overwhelming, especially in the beginning.",medium
The ocean is a rough place and you need to endure whatever weather mother earth throws at you.,medium
Yes - I know because I regularly find soda and beer floating around where I store my cans.,medium
What set me out on this journey was the fear of the repeating circle of my everyday life.,medium
When living on your boat you meet new people all the time and you travel through different countries and cultures.,medium
Just heading to a grocery store on a different island is a new experience.,medium
"Together with the big accomplishments, the sum of small things breaks the circle and gave me the contrast I needed.",medium
The sudden importance of the sun because your solar panels and the sun is your power supply.,medium
The clean water because you make water from the sea to keep you going.,medium
The feeling of a freshwater shower - the boat is not magically supplied with unlimited amounts of water!,medium
You have to make the water from seawater and a shower is not something you can do every day.,medium
Some friends expressed their worries about what if I just realize that home is simply the best place to be? .,medium
You now know how to appreciate the small things when you get back home.,medium
"You see, there are lots of things you can do to break the repeating circle.",medium
"We want to earn the 6-figure salary, work more flexible hours, and achieve career milestones.",medium
"At the same time, we want to spend time with friends, pursue our passions outside of work, and have experiences.",medium
Every minute you spend with your friends is another minute you can't grow in your career.,medium
Every minute you're working is another minute you can't be with your family.,medium
Work gives us purpose and can be very meaningful if we choose the right work.,medium
"Family, friends, and the things that make us happy are incredibly important for living a complete life.",medium
"If you have a deadline coming up a big project, you should spend extra time on that big project.",medium
"Once that project is over, you should spend extra time with friends and family.",medium
"Whether it's a quick phone call, family dinner, or some other occasion, make room for those conversations.",medium
You can go on fun experiences and spend more quality time with those people when the timing is right.,medium
You can also reserve more time during the weekend for your personal life.,medium
The reason most people struggle with this balance is because they don't know what they want.,medium
I strive to write at least 1 article per day on Medium and another article each day for my blog.,medium
"Get detailed with this list as the more accurate it is, the better.",medium
Most people don't know what to list for personal goals because they're more vague.,medium
"Spending time with friends and family and having experiences are qualitative goals, but you can get quantitative with them.",medium
"Growing our careers is important, but so is getting the same tasks done sooner.",medium
"Writing 1,000 words 30 minutes sooner gives you extra time to focus on a different task or stop working sooner.",medium
Look at your existing workflow for opportunities where you can improve your efficiency.,medium
"You should embrace your professional work, but not for longer than you should.",medium
"If you get distracted as you work, you'll spend too much time working and end up with a lower output.",medium
This will help you get the same tasks done faster and therefore have extra time to spend with family and friends.,medium
It's okay to be imperfect as long as you learn from the mistakes you make.,medium
"When most people think about the work-life balance, they see work as a vice.",medium
"However, both are important elements of a life that feels whole.",medium
Work gives you purpose and self-discovery while the relationships and experiences are what you'll remember the most.,medium
"On some days, you'll be more work oriented and on other days you'll be more oriented towards relationships and experiences.",medium
"It's not meant to be a perfect balancing act each day, but rather over the long-term.",medium
Want to learn how to make money investing in the stock market?,medium
"For years, circumstances have forced marketers to step up and pay for our attention.",medium
The recorded changes in advertising are evident in the impact this has on how people consume media today.,medium
"These performances include actors, hidden cameras, and effects that are out of the ordinary.",medium
"Agencies in charge of these pranks can then later edit, compile, and share the video to the ever-thirsty internet.",medium
"There are a lot of these, and when done perfectly, no one can ignore them.",medium
This is in a world where legends like Eminem are still releasing hits.,medium
"For one, pranks cost the lives of many over the years.",medium
"Often, some people even tweet about it in dismissal of how embarrassed, confused, or terrified, they were.",medium
The question then is: how far can one go to be too far?,medium
"But as you might have guessed, anything with the potential of leading to death should be off-limits.",medium
The last thing your brand needs is getting sued for taking a life for internet points and petty recognition.,medium
"For aside from death, there are plenty of other ways to earn your brand a blow you'll hardly ever recover from.",medium
"Toys R Us, an American toys and clothing retail company, learned this the hard way.",medium
And one need not know what the campaign was about to realize: nobody wants that for their brand.,medium
"Dead Man Down, an American crime thriller released in 2013.The video confused me when I first watched it.",medium
I didn't find the prank in the least funny because I couldn't tell what I was supposed to be laughing at.,medium
"Our sense of humor is as vast as the languages we speak, if not wider.",medium
"One man's meat is another man's poison, goes the saying.",medium
"Watch and learn from previous pranks, but remember to never copy them.",medium
Research has revealed that the world is sadder and angrier than ever.,medium
"And like every great adventure, this makes prankvertising both exciting and terrifying to venture into.",medium
"The year is 2021, and there isn't any sign of prankvertising going anywhere.",medium
"The newer, more sensational your campaigns are, the more likely your audience will share them.",medium
Pranks can be a great way to boost your brand's image or introduce a new product to the market.,medium
"But, like a joke, a terrible one will have you wishing you'd never bothered trying.",medium
Why won't you listen to me that red is just not your color?,medium
Martha scrunched her nose and waggled a finger from the screen of my tablet - teasing me with feigned snootiness.,medium
"I've decided that I'm wearing red exclusively now, I poked back matter-of-factly.",medium
"She beamed her usual squinty-eyed smile, and I couldn't help but smile back.",medium
"Well, she said, For once I'm glad I'm not around to see that.",medium
"Afterall, I still didn't fully understand what I was dealing with.",medium
"This wasn't Martha, but an AI that had been programmed in her likeness.",medium
A hollowness crept into her eyes as she waited for my response.,medium
"So I told her how I woke to Millie barking at the wind again, and about my day at work.",medium
"Speaking of groceries, don't forget to stock up on Cherry Coke!",medium
She tapped her side of the screen and a Target ad appeared on mine.,medium
She wasn't wrong: I used to buy a lot of Cherry Coke.,medium
"I need to get going, Martha, I said, forcing a polite smile.",medium
"If you have ever visited the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, you will have heard the guards saying, at regular intervals,",medium
There are signs everywhere forbidding both photography and video and this is enforced every few seconds by the staff.,medium
I have personally been told off there when I checked my phone and a largely disinterested guard just tapped me on the shoulder.,medium
It is actually down to a deal with a camera company and then kept in place for several valid reasons.,medium
It also came with a hefty price tag that forced them to seek outside financial assistance.,medium
"In fact, at first, the deal was ridiculed by many.",medium
"However, in return for funding the project, Nippon TV got exclusive rights to all photography and video relating to the work.",medium
This meant the process of restoration itself and all the final restored art.,medium
A photographer called Takashi Okamura was commissioned and he set about recording it all.,medium
"Although NTV has never announced if they made any profit, it seemed like they had made a good deal.",medium
The exclusive NTV rights ended in 1997.There is nothing underhanded going on from Nippon's side.,medium
"In fact, they originally stated that the photo and video ban didn't apply to 'ordinary tourists'.",medium
"However, at the time, authorities understandably instigated a broad policy of 'No photos or videos'.",medium
They worried a cunning professional photographer could sneak in and get off some snaps.,medium
"Once the exclusivity period ended, Vatican officials decided to keep the ban in place.",medium
He argued that the chapel and its art was supposed to be a place of quiet contemplation.,medium
"In the popular summer months, around 30,000 people visit the chapel every day.",medium
The temperature can reach 40 Celsius and that can lead to safety issues.,medium
"With that many visitors, it makes sense to keep people moving.",medium
The main reason people think there is a ban is down to the damage flash photography does to art over time.,medium
But the mere presence of that many people brings other problems that damage the art.,medium
It is the sheer numbers that are causing the problems and allowing photography would exacerbate the problem.,medium
There have been numerous calls demanding a limit to the numbers for over a decade.,medium
"Promises and plans have been made but so far, it has not happened.",medium
"There is no need to take a picture, just pause and admire the work.",medium
You will never be able to capture it with just a holiday camera or phone.,medium
"Then, on your way out, don't forget to visit the souvenir shop.",medium
"Laying on a beach somewhere tropical, sipping a drink while updating your travel blog.",medium
"Now you can spend the rest of your time looking at beautiful vistas, sampling exotic cuisine, and flirting with locals.",medium
"Every day for you is a vacation, a friend back home once told me while I was living abroad.",medium
The image of expat life that many think of is terribly romantic.,medium
"It seems like a wonderful fantasy because for 99% of people who live in other countries, it is.",medium
Creating content and building up brand relationships is a full-time job for most of these people.,medium
It can be hard to afford to go back to your home country in these cases too.,medium
"For some companies, you must be a US resident to work for them.",medium
"If you must be present for regular meetings and work sessions, time zones will have you living an offset life.",medium
Will you still be able to take advantage of all the supposed benefits of living abroad then?,medium
Not to mention the everyday logistical challenges of living in another country.,medium
Are you fluent in the language of whichever country you would like to move to?,medium
"While some people thrive in a setting that challenges them, others long for comfort and familiarity on a regular basis.",medium
Many people are looking for a break by going somewhere else during this pandemic.,medium
"Even countries where numbers are better, the effects of Covid have still changed life in other countries.",medium
Restrictions might even be stricter than in the country you're coming from.,medium
It's important to ask yourself what exactly it is you're hoping to get from this other place.,medium
Then evaluate whether or not it's realistic to expect it from wherever you're going.,medium
What will be the consequence to your life in your home country?,medium
Living abroad can be extremely enriching and rewarding despite all the challenges.,medium
"More than just a temporary bandaid on a deeper problem, living abroad is a serious lifestyle choice.",medium
"Study the language, be prepared to become part of a new community, and do the research to know what to expect.",medium
"But also know that work is still going to be part of your life, not just play.",medium
"For the past years, I've been studying what high-performers in any field or industry do differently than mediocre performers.",medium
"What's even more fascinating is that, in most cases, this is learned behavior - not genetics.",medium
"Anyone can put in the work on the days where they feel motivated, inspired, and everything seems to flow easily.",medium
"The pros, on the other hand, put in the work regardless of how they feel.",medium
They follow their schedule - even if the metaphorical weather is terrible.,medium
"This makes them ultra-consistent, which is why they perform at the top of their field.",medium
"In fact, I had quite a terrible night of sleep, so I'm pretty low on energy.",medium
"Before I knew it, ideas started to flow, inspiration struck, and I'm writing this piece right now.",medium
"It might get a ton of views, it might get zero.",medium
"It might be valuable to you, or maybe you hate it.",medium
"And with consistency, I know one of my articles in the next few weeks will be a big hit.",medium
"The pros understand that mastery is the name of the game, and mastery can't be achieved when you go too broad.",medium
You need to focus deeply on just a handful of skills - sometimes even just one.,medium
You can't just hop from idea to idea - or from opportunity to opportunity.,medium
"If you do, however, you'll never develop the level of skill necessary to stand out in your field.",medium
"Most amateurs tend to get distracted by every new opportunity, idea, or exciting piece of information.",medium
"I used to believe in this idea for years, and I was hopping from business idea to business idea.",medium
I was impatient and thought I could strike gold with the next business idea.,medium
You don't need to do many different things; you need to do one thing really well.,medium
"Whether you're a pro or an amateur, working towards big, ambitious goals requires a lot of effort.",medium
"And thus, they try to escape from it by inaction, excuses, and distractions.",medium
"Instead of being intimidated by the effort, they get inspired by a clear and compelling 'why'.",medium
They focus more on the results their efforts will yield than pondering over the effort it takes to get these results.,medium
"This difference in perspective makes the pros continue to put in the work, achieve great things, and be rewarded exponentially.",medium
Failure is a natural part of the process of pursuing worthwhile things.,medium
"If you're not making mistakes or screwing up now and then, you're simply not challenging yourself enough.",medium
"When they make a mistake, they think they are a mistake.",medium
"When they screw up, they think they are a screw-up.",medium
They also fear that others perceive them as a failure when they fail at something.,medium
This is why they'd rather avoid failure simply by not taking any action at all.,medium
"The pros, however, understand that making a mistake is not the same as being a mistake.",medium
And that screwing up doesn't mean you are a screw-up.,medium
They've also learned not to care about how other people think of them.,medium
They simply think of it as gaining experience or gathering new data.,medium
"The more you learn about what doesn't work, the closer you come to discover what does work.",medium
Each failure is another step forward - another stepping stone towards success.,medium
"Each failure contained a valuable new lesson that allowed me to come better smarter, stronger, and better.",medium
"Of course, it's not easy to go from failure to failure, but you should not fear it.",medium
"It should never become a reason for inaction, staying in your comfort zone, and letting your dreams pass by.",medium

You should have been out by now chasing your goals and dreams.,medium
Buffett then gave him one of the most powerful time management advice.,medium
He walked his pilot through a three-step strategy to give more clarity about his life goals.,medium
This is what Buffett said in his own words and that's the key to Buffett's success.,medium
Focus on the things that really matter and avoid things that don't really help you to achieve your top goals.,medium
"When you have 20 focuses on your life, it's likely to achieve none.",medium
"If you focus on the long-term, you may really be able to accomplish 3-5 goals, at most.",medium
Having multiple tasks on your to-do-list will also make you more stressed.,medium
"Also, there are people who are prone to bad habits and distractions that take their time away without them noticing it.",medium
The momentum so created after finishing task after task also distracts you from making progress on the important tasks.,medium
It's easier to get distracted from tasks that you really need to do.,medium
"Because you get in the excitement, joy, and temporary pleasure of things that aren't simply as important.",medium
It's easy to get caught up and lose track of time when you get into that zone.,medium
This helps you to eliminate bad habits and low-value tasks that don't serve any purpose in your life.,medium
"When you add something to your not-to-do list, you simply say no to it no matter what.",medium
"Every day you feel like you shouldn't do certain things, but you can not stop yourself from doing these things.",medium
Writing these things down on your to-do-list will help you to systematically take care of all of these things.,medium
The basic idea of a not-to-do list is to help yourself with self-discipline.,medium
Creating a not-to-do list helps you to avoid unnecessary tasks by giving your mind a signal.,medium
What to write on your not-to-do list depends on your personal behaviors.,medium
"It can be as simple as not browsing the Facebook feed needlessly, not searching for news, or not going to parties.",medium
Here's my personal not-to-do list as of now.,medium
Don't email first thing in the morning or last thing at night.3.,medium
Don't agree to meetings or calls with no clear agenda or end time.5.,medium
Don't check email constantly - batch and check at set times only6.,medium
"Don't over-communicate with low-profit, high-maintenance customers7.",medium
The idea that a person could see and predict the future was nothing short of amazing to my young mind.,medium
I read as many short novellas on the subject as I could get my little hands on.,medium
And I ate them up as fast as I could devour my sacks of Halloween loot every year.,medium
"I read books voraciously at that age, and these were just a few of many.",medium
Of all of the magical books I was reading at the time - these were the only ones that were true.,medium
Frank is trying to find a devoted audience for his newsletter on stock markets.,medium
Frank read all the advice and books about True Fans and how to turn a newsletter into a business.,medium
"In his research, Frank came across a method to get 10,000,000 real email addresses.",medium
"He had a few goals:On the first day of the month, Frank sent out his initial prediction.",medium
Millions of people viewed his short email and didn't pay much attention.,medium
"After 12 months of insanely accurate predictions, Frank now had his followers.",medium
"Although by this point, they should probably be referred to as worshipers.",medium
"In fact, Frank had lost almost all of his subscriber base.",medium
"Of the 10 million initial email addresses, he only had a few thousand left.",medium
But these few thousand were quite willing to pay a monthly fee of $250 to keep hearing his predictions.,medium
"I'm sure they would've spent considerably more than that, too, if he had asked.",medium
"On the second anniversary of his newsletter, Frank shut it down with no notice.",medium
"Shockingly, his subscriber base had shrunk down to just one person.",medium
And he made that one last person an incredible amount of money as well.,medium
"Did you figure out what happened?Frank was undoubtedly a devious messiah, but he was also a clever one.",medium
"When he first started out with his 10 million email addresses, he divided them into two groups.",medium
"To half, he sent a letter saying the stock market would go up the next month.",medium
"The next month, he split the winning group in half again.",medium
"After every month, his potential subscribers would go down in half.",medium
"The negative predictions moving to the trash bin, the positive predictions staying on.",medium
Now imagine you were in that lucky remaining group sometime in the second year.,medium
"Maybe you'd start paying attention, and certainly by the eighth.",medium
Sign over my house today because I'll get a mansion tomorrow.,medium
"After one year of free and accurate predictions, only 5,000 people would be left to receive Frank's email.",medium
But those few remaining people wouldn't know his newsletter was going out to fewer and fewer people.,medium
They wouldn't know why Frank was able to see the future.,medium
They're lapping up his newsletter the minute it gets sent out.,medium
"Month after month, they do this and only get more confident, wealthier, and happier.",medium
"All those months while people were dropping off like flies, Frank was smiling.",medium
Frank's most accurate prediction was the most important one - people are greedy.,medium
Thousands of people invested in a mysterious digital newsletter with the name Frank attached at the end.,medium
They didn't need to know why or how the email was making these foretellings.,medium
Twenty-four straight months of accurate predictions in the stock market can bring a smile to the most miserable among us.,medium
"Arjun tapped away at his keyboard, changing a few model parameters, and started the simulation.",medium
"He was testing out a new powertrain configuration, the result of months of research.",medium
"He was surrounded by people smarter than him, and learnt a lot every day.",medium
He waited for a minute and glanced at his watch - 5.56 pm.,medium
"He shut down his PC, grabbed his bag and waved goodbye to his teammates with a quick Happy weekend!",medium
He got out of the elevators and waved bye to the doorman before heading to where his bike was parked.,medium
"A few seconds later, at exactly the moment his watch ticked to 6 pm, the equilibrium of the world shifted.",medium
"Arjun nearly tripped and fell, and stopped in his tracks to regain his balance.",medium
"Sluggish, almost imperceptibly heavier in some way, like he was holding a pair of dumbbells.",medium
"He helped a couple of people up, but everyone just seemed confused.",medium
"That's when he heard it, a sound he would never forget.",medium
"The building that housed his startup and a number of other companies, all 25 stories of it, was wobbling.",medium
The building shook for a few more seconds and then it happened.,medium
"Once he had made it to the entrance of the complex, he finally stopped running and turned around.",medium
"He could barely see anything, a huge dust cloud obscuring his vision and forcing him to shut his eyes.",medium
"About a minute later, it cleared enough for him to open his eyes again.",medium
"The adrenaline started to wear off and the shock and nausea hit, making him feel faint.",medium
"He stood up and started walking back to his home, still in a daze.",medium
"He paid no attention to his surroundings, his mind shutting down to avoid thinking about what had just happened.",medium
"If he had been paying attention, he would have seen chaos on the street.",medium
"After he had walked for about ten minutes, his phone rang, snapping him out of his reverie.",medium
"It had only been about ten minutes, and his parents lived in Mumbai.",medium
How had they found out about something happening in Bangalore so soon?,medium
Your father and I were at home when the house suddenly started shaking!,medium
"Don't leave the house until we know more, and be prepared for more earthquakes.",medium
"Yes Ma .He hung up, and immediately tried to call his sister.",medium
He talked to her every other day and they told each other everything about their lives.,medium
He tried again a few more times but couldn't get through to her.,medium
"He tried to call his sister one more time, and when it failed again the feeling of dread intensified.",medium
The exact thing he had witnessed before his very eyes was happening all over the world.,medium
"No one understood what was happening, and the governments of the world were yet to make a statement about the global calamity.",medium
I was taking the subway into Manhattan when the train stopped in the middle of the tunnel!,medium
It took a while for them to rescue us and there was no cell signal inside.,medium
"It's not great here, but from what I heard, Brooklyn is still doing way better than Manhattan.",medium
"The family wasn't home at the moment, having left to visit relatives in Hyderabad a few days earlier.",medium
"There were a few books strewn on the ground, probably from the shaking earlier, but it looked mostly all right.",medium
"He then turned on the TV and flipped it to the news, and put the displaced books back on their shelves.",medium
This is a COSMIC EVENT that happens once every TEN MILLION YEARS.,medium
The alignment of the sun and the moon make all matter on earth BRITTLE for 24 hours!,medium
Please share this with friends and family and stay safe during this dangerous time!,medium
I was on a bus on the way back from work when the buildings started collapsing.,medium
"The street was absolutely chaotic, people panicking and crashing into each other.",medium
"This may sound a little weird, but have you been feeling a little strange?",medium
"He almost felt foolish doing it, but got up and walked over the weighing scale they had in their bathroom.",medium
He had happened to measure his weight at the gym just a few hours earlier.,medium
The government was setting up temporary relief shelters to house all the people displaced by the disaster.,medium
"But while the theories got wilder and wilder, no one could say for sure what was happening.",medium
"After a few hours, they decided that they needed to get some sleep and went back to their rooms.",medium
He looked up to see his family on the other side of the floor.,medium
"He became more and more desperate, and as he reached out a hand, he felt the earth start to shake.",medium
"It was barely noticeable, but he could still feel mild tremors.",medium
"He ran out of his room and barged into Sai's room, yelling Wake up!",medium
Then Sai abruptly stopped talking as the shaking seemed to intensify slightly.,medium
"They both ran outside, still in their pyjamas and slippers and bolted down the stairs and onto the street.",medium
"Just as they got there, the shaking intensified to the point that it was unmistakable.",medium
"It kept growing in intensity, until they could no longer stand and had to drop to the ground.",medium
They watched in despair as the roof of the house came crashing down.,medium
"Telephone poles and street lamps crashed to the ground around them, some narrowly missing them.",medium
They heard the panicked shouts of other people who had run out onto the street.,medium
"After another minute or so, the shaking came to a stop.",medium
"The buildings were crumbling, poles and wires strewn across the ground, people on the road in a state of shock.",medium
The last time Bangalore had suffered a large earthquake was in 2001.,medium
This was one of the strongest earthquakes in the city's history.,medium
"Arjun and Sai sat on the ground, slowly recovering from what they had just experienced.",medium
"They didn't have anything on them except for their phones, and they obviously couldn't go back into their apartment.",medium
"After talking about it for a bit, they decided to walk to the government shelter nearby.",medium
"On the way, Arjun saw on his phone that the disasters were intensifying around the world.",medium
"Earthquakes everywhere, and coastal cities being hit the hardest with tidal waves.",medium
"He tried to call his family, but he couldn't get through to any of them.",medium
"Apparently cell towers were being knocked out everywhere, and cellular connectivity was taking a hit.",medium
He was lucky to still be able to use mobile data to read the news.,medium
"It was sturdy however, and though parts of it had caved in from the earthquake, it was mostly intact.",medium
"Inside, there were blankets laid out all across the floor, but the earthquake had woken everyone up.",medium
Everyone's meagre belongings were strewn across the floor of the warehouse in a jumbled mess.,medium
"Arjun and Sai settled into a corner and sat on the floor, not saying anything.",medium
"It wasn't comfortable, but exhaustion overtook Arjun and he dozed off, sleeping fitfully.",medium
"He woke up a few hours later, and Sai told him that they would be handing out breakfast in an hour.",medium
All of the news was pointing to the same thing - an announcement made by ISRO about ten minutes ago.,medium
"No, my phone died a little while ago , he replied.",medium
The ISRO chairperson stood at a podium in front of a room full of reporters.,medium
We have spent the last 12 hours working tirelessly to understand what has caused the disasters around the world.,medium
All of these occurrences have the same cause - the Earth's gravity has increased .Arjun and Sai gaped at the little screen.,medium
"At exactly 6pm IST last evening, the universal gravitational constant appears to have increased by precisely 2%.",medium
"The Earth's core and crust are now adjusting to this change, causing massive tectonic shifts and earthquakes around the world.",medium
"The moon's orbit around the Earth has started to tighten, increasing tidal forces.",medium
The repercussions of this are more far-reaching than just on Earth.,medium
"If this change continues, the equilibrium of the cosmos itself will shift.",medium
"The Earth's orbit around the sun will change, along with all of the planets in our solar system.",medium
It's hard to predict exactly what the universe will look like after it has stabilized from this change.,medium
"We will continue to investigate this shift, and will provide a more comprehensive analysis soon.",medium
"Arjun and Sai looked at each other, eyes wide and disbelieving.",medium
Panicked shouts started from around the warehouse as the ground started to tremor again.,medium
He set the gravitational constant perturbation parameter even higher this time - 5%.,medium
They had to choose a specific sub-field within computing and write a detailed history of it.,medium
The first HRS had been run by the ENIAC 7 supercomputer 22 years ago to simulate the whole planet.,medium
"It had broad models for the ecosystem and environment, but it modelled 10 billion humans individually.",medium
"It became a hot field after the first supercomputer simulation, generating plenty of academic interest and military funding.",medium
It was around then that interest in the field started to decline.,medium
"It was never proved definitively, and so it was still legal to run a HRS.",medium
"Broadly speaking, he wanted to show human civilization's dependence on these parameters.",medium
"However, this was a widely accepted fact and not particularly novel.",medium
In all honesty he just wanted an excuse to try running a few simulations.,medium
He wrote a quick conclusion and submitted the assignment with just a couple of minutes to spare.,medium
"As soon as it became midnight, the auto-grader evaluated his assignment and gave him comprehensive feedback.",medium
"Bellingham, Washington is 85 miles north of Seattle, Washington, and 50 miles south of Vancouver, British Columbia.",medium
"I had lived in Seattle when I was younger, and moved here after graduate school.",medium
"And I stayed in Bellingham for violence, dogs, and love.",medium
"Bellingham is a city between, and much of what defines it is that position between.",medium
"Bellingham Bay is itself between, this time between the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.",medium
"This means you can go north by water from Bellingham, via Victoria San Juan Cruises, to Victoria, on Vancouver Island.",medium
"Its waters feed one of Bellingham's gems, Whatcom Falls Park.",medium
"Miles of trails wind through the park, and an amazing network of trails spiderweb through Bellingham.",medium
"Besides your fellow Bellinghamsters, you'll see deer, coyotes, and more menacing things.",medium
"We've got tons of microbreweries, some good local restaurants, a moderate arts scene, and lots to do.",medium
"It was a small but dedicated group practicing bojutsu, a Japanese art of staff fighting.",medium
I've taken tai chi classes as well as self-defense classes.,medium
"And if you're less violent, well, there's a range of movement and entertainment arts, too.",medium
For almost 50 years the Ski to Sea race has been run.,medium
It's a team multi-sport race that starts at Mount Baker - a local ski attraction - and ends in Fairhaven.,medium
"Team members ski, bike, kayak, and run, and do other things to cover 93 miles in seven legs.",medium
"I've taken part in Dog Days of Summer, as well as a pit bull parade around Lake Padden.",medium
"And if Bellingham is good for dogs, it is even better for kids.",medium
The fact that Bellingham is a patchwork city formed by four towns growing together means that streets often stop and start.,medium
I can't tell you how many times I got lost when I first moved here.,medium
The result is a ferocious housing market that isn't matched by the job market.,medium
Median house price in Bellingham itself in the last quarter of 2020?,medium
"A cool $550,000.Everything you've heard about how much it rains in Washington?",medium
"They are very cool, but it also means sometimes cats disappear and coyotes are happy.",medium
"That's an active volcano, one of several in the state.",medium
"Shoo!Leave me here, with my aging pit bull, my violent hobbies, and those I love.",medium
Setting a schedule to go about your day is a not so secret technique to make sure you get everything done.,medium
The problem with schedules arises when you write down way too many things you need to get done.,medium
Looking at all of these tasks is definitely overwhelming and results in not getting anything done.,medium
Time blocking is the practice of scheduling periods throughout your day to finish different tasks.,medium
Distractions are a part of our daily life and often hard to ignore.,medium
"By time blocking your day, you can actually give yourself time during the day to indulge in those distractions.",medium
Time blocking gives you permission to engage in the distractions but only after you've finished your more pressing tasks.,medium
"If distractions are still a big issue, try time blocking only every half hour.",medium
"On Mondays, you may be bombarded with emails while Tuesdays are quiet.",medium
Having a good idea of how your weeks typically play out is a good way to start.,medium
Knowing what priorities you should emphasize on each day of the week is an amazing way to begin your time blocking habit.,medium
It may be a good idea to avoid looking at emails on a certain day when you know you have something else due.,medium
I've gone through waves in my life where I'm a morning person.,medium
"If you're needed at an office and have a 9-5, try playing around with different times to do things.",medium
This one may sound silly but you should also time block your breaks.,medium
Having an extensive list of things to do can be mentally draining.,medium
"Working towards a goal, in this case, a break is a mental trick.",medium
Your brain knows that there is a break coming so it doesn't get burnt out.,medium
"During your time blocked break, don't limit yourself to just one thing.",medium
Use your break in a way you'll know that it will make you more effective after it's done.,medium
"If you know you cant bounce back from an afternoon nap, try playing a video game instead.",medium
Your brain will still be active but in a more relaxing way.,medium
"Similarly, it's not necessary to time block sleep from 10 PM-7 AM .",medium
You know yourself best and the ideal way to start new habits is to ease into them.,medium
It has been proven that color can affect someone's memory and the way they react to things.,medium
There's no harm in lightening how long you think a certain task will take.,medium
This will give you the flexibility you need to begin time blocking while also giving yourself boundaries.,medium
Be sensible and realize that it's not realistic to plan things to the minute.,medium
"If you don't suffer from chronic procrastination, this may not be the thing for you.",medium
Time blocking can be wise if you use it appropriately and if you ease into it.,medium
Give it a chance and ease your way into it for better results.,medium
"Your job, whatever it is - writer, artist, gizmo maker - is to make content that people want to share.",medium
But what gets people to interact with it in the first place?,medium
What motivates people to give something their time and consideration?The answer is in something called Cultural Cartography.,medium
I'm going to appall you by mentioning a name: BuzzFeed.,medium
"Whether you like to admit it or not, you can't deny their appeal.",medium
"To give you an example, 104,000 people on Facebook shared this BuzzFeed video: 4 Mesmerizing Marbled Clay Projects.",medium
I would call that engagement!Publications had declined my linked-article above about Malcolm Gladwell because I mentioned a popular YouTube personality.,medium
The editors gave me specific feedback about not using that YouTuber's name.,medium
"They know how to make viral content, and we can learn something by paying attention.",medium
"Three years ago, BuzzFeed's Publisher Dao Nguyen gave a TED talk entitled What makes something go viral?",medium
"They ended up with 90,000 people watching a 30-minute-long video in real-time.",medium
How did they get thousands of people to tune-in at the same time to watch a video about goats?,medium
"Nguyen's answer is Cultural Cartography, a mapping of what influences culture.",medium
This map illustrates content that engages people and makes them want to share that same content.,medium
People love to laugh and they love to make other people laugh.,medium
"Kohl's rewarded Payne with $2,500 of gift cards and piles of Star Wars toys and Kohl's points.",medium
These pieces of content include things that make you say this is us or you are not alone or even WTF? .,medium
"You want to do something, even if that something is sharing the content.",medium
"It is about TikTok user Katie Schieffer, who couldn't afford to buy her son insulin.",medium
"So far, a share on Twitter has 89,000 likes, 22,700 retweets, and 1,600 comments.",medium
The YouTuber uploads one video a month and usually gets 36 million views per video.,medium
"I don't plan on making a glitter bomb, but I feel like I'm learning something.",medium
I watch and share the videos because I feel like we are all doing something together.,medium
"Powerful emotions include those that people empathize with, make them feel good, or make them curious.",medium
Example: How about I get a few songs stuck in your head?,medium
Ed Sheeran's Shape of You video has 5.14 million views on YouTube.,medium
Mark Ronson & Bruno Mars's Uptown Funk has 4.06 million views.,medium
"Another selection, not too far away is Katy Perry's Roar with 3.25 million views.",medium
"Through Cultural Cartography, attention is grabbed, held, and shared.",medium
"As I said above, your job is to make content that people want to share, no matter what your job is.",medium
"They've had massive success in Kickstarter, raising funds to make their games.",medium
"In 2019, their game Wingspan sold 44,000 copies in three months globally.",medium
Stonemaier makes a specific reference to cultural cartography in their blog post about breaking the internet to build a community.,medium
"Wingspan became one of the 20th best-ranked games on BoardGameGeek's list of 18,000 games.",medium
"It also took home the prestigious 2019 Kennerspiel des Jahres, akin to the Oscars' best picture award.",medium
You don't have to sell your soul to make something go viral.,medium
"If anything, it involves digging into yourself and finding something that will make a human connection.",medium
"Look around at things that are trending or have multiple views, shares, and comments.",medium
"I write about being unproductive, breaking habits, and getting lots of sleep, AND still getting things done.",medium
And we all have this inner desire to stay on the path and get to where we want to go.,medium
There are several obstacles on the path which need to be overcome.,medium
"In his book Mastery, George Leonard shares some of these obstacles that we may encounter on our journey.",medium
"Of course, we may not be able to overcome all of them.",medium
"However, it's good to know they're there so we can learn to conquer them when they do show up.",medium
What most of us fail to realise is that the journey to becoming the best at anything doesn't exist in a vacuum.,medium
"Instead, we have to dig up our way through a landscape of lively obligations.",medium
"You have work, relationship, health, spirituality, finance, etc.",medium
"As they say, The chain is only as strong as its weakest point.",medium
Don't let other areas of your life be a hindrance to your goals.,medium
"Instead, work on them so they support you in your path to greatness.",medium
Perhaps the deadliest enemy to our path to greatness can be our obsessive desire for the destination itself.,medium
"Because, when we get overly attached to results, we want to witness quick growth.",medium
"Due to our desire for instant gratification, we start working excessively.",medium
"And all of this pays off, but only for a while.",medium
"And when you reach the top, as the Zen saying goes, keep on climbing.",medium
The second option is a much quicker and better way to walk the path.,medium
"However, it's important to recognize a good teacher in the first place.",medium
"If we listen to such people, we'll surely be walking the wrong path, and end up on the wrong destination.",medium
"First of all, according to George Leonard, instruction is the first key to mastery.",medium
"Hence, find a teacher who knows what they're talking about.",medium
"However, mild competition can be healthy and in fact, a necessary source of inspiration.",medium
"The mindset of Winning isn't everything, it is the only thing is sure to take a toll on your mental health.",medium
"Be competitive, but not to the point that it messes with your mental health.",medium
A simple way to find the balance is to try to sublimate envy into inspiration.,medium
"Hence, whenever you feel envious, try to be inspired instead.",medium
We're animals and we're hardwired to save energy for emergencies.,medium
That is why it's hard to spend energy when it's not a question of survival.,medium
"In fact, from an evolutionary and a mere goal of 'survival' laziness is the best tool you possess.",medium
"However, humanity has outpaced evolution to the point that survival is not much of a concern anymore.",medium
"And forgive me for stating the obvious, but, inaction and laziness are truly the enemies of greatness.",medium
A simple way to overcome laziness is to - and Nike would back me on this - just do it.,medium
"Besides that, I personally like to use two tools to overcome laziness effectively.",medium
Studies show that rewarding gold stars to students initially speed up their learning.,medium
"Ergo, external motivation is not effective when it comes to producing lasting results.",medium
And god knows the journey to greatness is a long and arduous one.,medium
"It's okay to be motivated by external incentives, however, only if there's a solid foundation of internal motivation.",medium
One of the reasons we may have decided to become the best at something is to look good.,medium
"However, we fail to realise that getting to the point of looking good takes a lot of looking stupid.",medium
"Since there's no action, there'll be no failure, but there'll also be no lessons.",medium
"Suffice it to say, if we succumb ourselves to vanity, we can bid goodbye to the path to greatness.",medium
"Michael Jordan once said, I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career.",medium
"Twenty-six times, I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed.",medium
I've failed over and over and over again in my life.,medium
The path to greatness at anything is already a tough one to bear.,medium
"And yes, it takes a certain amount of seriousness to keep walking on it.",medium
"However, when we begin to take our goals way too seriously, even minor setbacks and failures can hurt us deeply.",medium
And all of this seriousness leads to a vicious circle where our mental health is chopped into pieces.,medium
There's scientific evidence that shows that laughter helps boost your mental well-being.,medium
"Life is short, and not meant to be taken too seriously.",medium
"In fact, with laughter and fun, the pressure of the difficult journey becomes bearable, and hence the journey becomes easier.",medium
George says - Consistency of practice is the mark of the master.,medium
"Quite obviously, inconsistency leads to loss of practice time and keeps you stuck.",medium
"However, excessive inconsistency might even regress your growth and lead to the dissolution of the progress you had made earlier.",medium
"Interestingly, consistency is actually easier than inconsistency if you follow some basic rules.",medium
"Due to the hyper-connectedness of the world, we're often subjected to what perfect looks like.",medium
A budding artist sees the extraordinary paintings of Van Gogh in a museum.,medium
"We have examples of perfect shoved into our faces when in our journey, we are mediocre at best.",medium
"We may think if we'll never get to perfect, is there even a point at trying?Perfectionism can be paralysing.",medium
We often hold such a high picture to aim to that we're afraid of even starting.,medium
"However, we fail to see that people who have reached those levels were just as mediocre as we are.",medium
They have years and years of hard work and failure before they got to perfect.,medium
"Besides, as we discussed earlier, the journey is not about the destination but the journey itself.",medium
Unlocking your highest potential is about avoiding what chips away at your potential.,medium
We're offering a free course to all of our new subscribers as a thank you for your continued support.,medium
"I've gained some valuable experience over the years, resulting in high payouts and consistent performance bonuses.",medium
"The thing is, it doesn't take much to excel in a sales-related position.",medium
"By applying these strategies, even the most mediocre salesperson has a chance of genuine success.",medium
"When working in sales, you must focus on building a relationship with your customers.",medium
It's your job to identify what the client needs before they know they need it.,medium
"To identify the needs of your customer, get to know them better.",medium
Talking about something other than sales is a great idea because it takes pressure away from the sale.,medium
"If you can't find a show to relate to, try recommending something good to watch.",medium
"Above all else, however, people love to talk about themselves, specifically, what they do for their 9-5.",medium
"Sometimes, you'll even discover that your client owns a business, which opens up a whole other world of opportunities.",medium
"If a customer has a poor first impression of you, it could take a while to earn their trust.",medium
"As a rule of thumb, I aim to dress my best every day, whether I'm working or not.",medium
You don't need a fancy suit or an expensive dress to look nice.,medium
"Start with the basics: take showers often, groom yourself, and make sure your clothes are clean and free of stains.",medium
"As a rule of thumb, you should always do something to make your customers feel important.",medium
"Most sales positions are commission-based, which means that you're in control of your money.",medium
The amount that you make and your level of success in the field are highly dependent upon whether you know your numbers.,medium
How much do I need to sell by the end of the month to hit my quota?,medium
"After asking myself these very crucial questions, I'll move on to design my game plan for the rest of the month.",medium
It's a well-known fact that salespeople like to talk.,medium
Say what you need to say and let the customer decide the rest.,medium
"Unfortunately, I've seen hundreds of talented salespeople mess this part up by continuing to talk after closing.",medium
"I have lived in 4 countries: Portugal, France, the UK, and Hungary.",medium
"Moving to a new country is one of the most exciting, rewarding experiences you can have in life.",medium
"It pushes your boundaries, it forces you to grow, and it turns you into a much richer person.",medium
"But, let's be honest, it can also be hard.",medium
"Leaving behind your comfort, your home, your people, is something only the brave do.",medium
But even the brave ones can use a little help when making such a move.,medium
"Here are my tips to ease the transition to a new life, coming from personal experience.",medium
"For some of them, life in the new country corresponded to their imagination.",medium
"Type on Google moving to Berlin , or wherever you're going, and you will find a gazillion pages with useful tips.",medium
Take a step further and join Facebook groups of expats in your destination city.,medium
"I have received some messages from people moving to places where I lived, and I always answer their questions in detail.",medium
I know how important this is for them because I was in their shoes once.,medium
"Depending on where you move to, it might be a nightmare, or a dream come true.",medium
"My sister lived in France, where she worked as a 3D artist, with a one-year contract.",medium
They demand stable jobs and high incomes to even start thinking about letting someone near their property.,medium
"All they required from me was my ID - no work contract, no bank statement, nothing.",medium
"A place is about the life you live in it, and life is better with friends.",medium
"When I lived in the UK, I overlooked the power of community.",medium
I focused on my relationship at the time and had very few friends outside that circle.,medium
"But now, living in Budapest, I created my own circles.",medium
I have Hungarian friends who introduce me to the culture and help me learn Hungarian.,medium
"And I have my expat friends, who share the feeling of being a foreigner in Hungary.",medium
"Create strong relationships with some people, so you feel the constant support if you need it.",medium
"Even if you do all the necessary preparation, you still need to give yourself time to adjust to the new reality.",medium
"In the first few months, you will feel overwhelmed with all the tasks you need to do.",medium
"When I moved to Hungary, going to the supermarket was a tiring adventure.",medium
Treat these first few months in the new life as a long holiday.,medium
Moving to a new country is something you should at least once in your lifetime.,medium
"Follow their footsteps whenever you get lost, for a better chance to find your own path.",medium
I start this article by making a minor excuse: the title you see above is not 100% true.,medium
"There are exceptions, subordinated to specific contexts, where expatriates become like a native.",medium
"As much as achieving this stage of adaptation is a brilliant victory, there are different levels of it.",medium
We can break down the concept of integration into 4 different types.,medium
"They add their contribution both as supply, by their products, and demand, by their consumption.",medium
"Skilled expats often achieve this type quickly, but for students or non-working spouses, it can take longer.",medium
I may take longer to explain emotional integration because it is essential for understanding this entire article.,medium
This term is almost untranslatable but fits very well in this description.,medium
It is not only missing and does not have a completely negative meaning because it brings sadness and joy together.,medium
"It is, as deciphered by older generations, the love that remains.",medium
We can translate a partial emotional integration as loving your new country and shaping your personality by its influences.,medium
"The fully integrated, however, will go beyond this and not feel any Saudade from his origins.",medium
"If you are already living abroad for some time, you probably are thinking how far you are in those four different dimensions.",medium
The good news is that you don't need to achieve all of them.,medium
"In Chile, I was very well-integrated economically, socially, and culturally.",medium
I didn't need to do much effort since they are close to Brazil in all those components.,medium
"That is why in Poland, to reach the same level of assimilation from Chile, it took much longer.",medium
"In Qatar, I achieved economic integration, but the social and cultural aspects were distant from my daily life.",medium
"In an article of Humanity in Action Denmark, I read two stories that exemplify it.",medium
"One from Savas Coskun and the other from Sabeena Din, who moved, respectively, from Turkey and Pakistan to Denmark.",medium
To make the best efforts to integrate into a new country is not only good for you.,medium
"If you plan or already have children, this will have an enormous positive impact on them.",medium
"Even after learning the language, you still will speak with an accent that will persist for decades.",medium
"You will still have your tastes for food, music, and traces in your personality shaped in your fatherland.",medium
"If you are moving to a homogeneous country like some in Asia or Eastern Europe, you will also be the person looking different.â",medium
I have some splendid news for you: all those things can turn into opportunities.,medium
Your varied taste for food and music can give way to very interesting conversation topics.,medium
Your accent and knowledge of a foreign language can be useful to understand the so common loanwords from a globalized world.,medium
Those holidays you celebrated back in your country can double the opportunities for fun.,medium
This is a point that people miss when trying to understand how to adapt to a new culture.,medium
The same would be if a westerner moved to Thailand and mastered Thai.,medium
Levi Borba is the CEO of expatriateconsultancy.com and a best-selling author.,medium
"The inspiration for this article comes from the book Moving Out, Working Abroad, and Keeping Your Sanity.",medium
"AS MATT PLACED THE GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE IN FRONT OF HER, he said, You need to stay here today.",medium
"He was drinking out of an espresso cup with a thin gold band around the rim, holding it daintily above her head.",medium
"She could smell his aftershave, the prep-school essence of synthetic roses and a splash of lavender.",medium
It was the smell of soft hands that picked up nothing other than the cheque at a restaurant.,medium
The sunshine reflected dully off his immaculate white shirt as he sat opposite her and needlessly adjusted his cufflinks.,medium
"He wanted to draw attention to them, how heavy they looked.",medium
"His voice signposted the class of company he kept, the kind of muted executive swagger one collects when ascending multiple wage brackets.",medium
"It was war-ter not waw-dah, and it was going and not goin'.",medium
"I need to go out and do something, you can't just keep me stuck in here.",medium
What could I do to get myself in trouble at ten in the morning?,medium
"Matt raised his eyebrows as if to say, You'll think of something.",medium
"Of course he didn't say this, and smoothly redirected conversation: I've got a meeting today at eleven.",medium
"You aren't needed for any of it, but I do need you to stay here.",medium
"For a moment Hannah wanted to throw the glass at his face, watch it explode over his glossy expensive skin.",medium
"They both knew what happened when thoughts like these became regrettable, irreversible actions.",medium
"I didn't bring a book with me, and it's not like you've got any good ones here.",medium
"Hannah hooked a thumb over her shoulder toward the bookshelf, which was mostly empty.",medium
"Matt's eyes narrowed and seemed to darken, a sharp transition from hazel to black that Hannah found disquieting.",medium
"I didn't ask you here for your opinion, he said.",medium
"I like my own space, so I'd prefer it if you weren't here.",medium
"You always did stay in your room a lot, Hannah said.",medium
You say that as though all this just fell into my lap.,medium
"Well with the job you've got, yeah, seems that way.",medium
He looked into his espresso cup as though a fly were drowning in it.,medium
Hannah remembered that he had always been fascinated by small animals in enclosed spaces.,medium
She certainly felt like one in this apartment: the floor-to-ceiling windows made it feel like a fish tank.,medium
"He checked the time on a small Omega with a blue dial, an ocean on his wrist.",medium
Matt said nothing and she retorted to his silence by draining the glass.,medium
Matt took his espresso cup and walked to the narrow island of marble planted beside the kitchen table.,medium
"He wiped his hands on a tea towel, even though they weren't wet.",medium
"He grabbed his bag off the kitchen counter, threaded his hands through his jacket.",medium
"It was ten am, only ten am, and the day felt vastly unpromising.",medium
Saturday had at once become available and these were the men could afford it.,medium
"Striped ties, some silver, some red, the colours of metal and ore.",medium
"Just sits on her arse all day watchin' TV, makin' a bloody mess most of the time.",medium
"The ripple thumbed a message on its iPhone and asked, What'd she do again?",medium
"What was it, your mate Danny had fucked the bride or some shit like that?",medium
"I tell ya what, royally fucked up things between Ben and Sally -",medium
All because my shit-for-brains cousin can't handle her drink.,medium
"Ah, Mum's got the idea in her head that I've got more money than I know what to do with.",medium
"Reckons I should use it to take in me cousin, look after me own kind, y'know?",medium
Matt chewed on the inside of his cheek and breathed through his nose.,medium
A beggar seated outside a supermarket asked for change and was summarily ignored.,medium
"I mean, it's not like she can stay with any of her friends.",medium
"The creator of the Bullet Journal is Ryder Carroll, an American digital product designer and art director.",medium
In 2013 he started sharing his own life-hack on his website.,medium
I am not talking about a minority of people who have a special interest in personal development.,medium
It made me lose track of the content but also the priority levels of my various bullet-point lists.,medium
One advantage of a bullet journal is that it gathers all your thoughts in one place.,medium
Anything that is written in your BuJo is something less to keep in mind.,medium
The second reason why 2021 is the perfect year to start writing your own bullet journal is that it represents a fresh start.,medium
"Finally, one of the big advantages of bullet journaling is that it suits you and you only.",medium
The incredible variety of bullet journaling supplies makes your personal journal necessarily customized.,medium
"At the end of 2021, you will reflect on what you achieved during this year.",medium
Suzuki Roshi's quote and that of his colleague are about karma and the nature of problems.,medium
"When the tiger is hunting, he is totally focused on the job at hand.",medium
"If a problem arises he deals with it then, not later, and eats.",medium
"Some days he eats well, others not, but with each hunt he eats something.",medium
It is easy to procrastinate about problems especially if they are minor.,medium
Maybe you made a small promise to a friend but didn't get around to doing it.,medium
Maybe you put off a bill because 'it's not that important'.,medium
These small things can blow up into major problems if you let them by simply not taking action when they are manageable.,medium
"I occasionally lost a job because of it and worse, a client.",medium
That way it is staring me in my face every time I open the browser.,medium
The tab doesn't get closed until the job is billed or published.,medium
"Doing things for people when they need them, not on my schedule.",medium
"I had three months to write a trade paperback, about 80,000 words.",medium
I couldn't get started even though the entire thing was outlined on a page by page basis.,medium
And every day that mouse was turning into a giant cow I had to kill and eat.,medium
My worrying was as much about my reputation as it was about the project.,medium
"I started writing more and more and I made my deadline, and got paid.",medium
"But the payment was not the big thing, nor was the book.",medium
There is a notion that karma has to do with good deeds.,medium
"I think it has to do with being an honorable person, a respected person with a good reputation.",medium
Suzuki Roshi was a revered Zen teacher who was instrumental in raising awareness of Zen Buddhism in America.,medium
"Almost the entire focus of Zen, and Buddhism at its core, is living in this moment at all times.",medium
Meditation is a practice at doing this and Buddhism is itself far more of a training regimen than a conventional religion.,medium
"And karma, the law of cause and effect, is central to this training model.",medium
"It's not some mysterious Asian concept, it is a core aspect of life.",medium
"Moreover, it's an investment that Scandinavian governments, and citizens, take very seriously.",medium
"After all, a secret to a happy adulthood is in a happy childhood.",medium
Here are just a few things that I noticed Danish parents prioritize for their kids.,medium
"The stranger lady barely held back from making a comment and walked away, shaking her head.",medium
"While I wasn't surprised at all, my husband was perplexed by the woman's reaction.",medium
Danish children are treated with respect and allowed to make their own mistakes.,medium
"Forget children wearing helmets in rubber-floor playgrounds, so often seen in America.",medium
Teaching them common sense and trusting them to do the right thing might be a much better investment in the long term.,medium
"When I think of my childhood, I remember occasional bike rides as some of my happiest and most adventurous moments.",medium
"No one in Copenhagen seemed to be without a bike, including children.",medium
"Even in Copenhagen, children of all ages use bicycles to get to their schools, arriving rosy-cheeked and energized.",medium
"There were areas for play and relaxation, nooks for reading, and various outdoor spaces for playing and studying.",medium
"Likewise, Danish playgrounds are world-famous and known for their unique and creative designs.",medium
"Everywhere you look, children's environment in Denmark is given a lot of thought.",medium
This is a belief that parents in all Northern European countries share.,medium
"Despite, or because of, their infamous climate, Scandinavians are obsessed with fresh air.",medium
"Babies sleep outside in their strollers for hours each day, even in the coldest months.",medium
"Bundled up, they gradually develop resistance to cold, while receiving all the benefits of fresh air.",medium
"After all, fresh air is the best, and cheapest, way to improve moods and overall productivity in children.",medium
I realized the world was moving online and figured it was now or never to bet on myself.,medium
"If you didn't know, the online course business is booming.",medium
"While I'm getting the hang of it now, I'll be the first to say it's nothing like you think.",medium
"But at the same time, it is 100% possible, if you have the right strategy.",medium
"If you're someone who wants to start selling online courses, here is what you need to get started.",medium
The number one thing you need to sell online courses is experience in what you're selling.,medium
This obviously gives the e-learning industry a bad name and can taint digital courses to buyers in general.,medium
"While mastery is great, you really just need to be a few steps ahead of your ideal audience.",medium
You do not need to have a fancy degree or decades of experience to sell online courses.,medium
Thinking that you do is probably why you haven't created an online course yet.,medium
You just need to be able to help others get results more than anything else.,medium
"For example, when I quit my job in 2017 I had only made $200 ever from my blog.",medium
"Eventually, people started asking me how I did it and wanted to learn how they could as well.",medium
"Now, I have a program that teaches people how to do just that and several have already quit their jobs as well!",medium
"While you need expertise in your subject, this isn't enough anymore as there is more competition.",medium
"Now, it's not about creating more content to prove you're an expert either.",medium
And your personality isn't going to differentiate you from competitors either.,medium
"Instead, you need a unique framework or methodology to help get people results.",medium
"For example, there are a ton of different writers out there promoting a freelance writing course.",medium
"To differentiate myself from all the others, I created my own unique system called The Confident Writer Framework.",medium
This is a three-part system that I used and have taught my students to help them speed up their writing success.,medium
"Second, it will help you make unique content in your niche and pre-sell your product.",medium
"Finally, it will help you differentiate from others in your niche.",medium
"Once you have a unique framework, people will associate that with you and your brand.",medium
"Once you have nailed down your framework, it's time to start building your email list.",medium
"If you think you can depend on social media followers for consistent course sales, you are dead wrong.",medium
"With social media, you are only one internet apocalypse away from losing everything.",medium
"Every successful course creator I know makes an overwhelming majority of their sales from their email list, not social media followers.",medium
"If the president of the United States can get removed from Twitter and Facebook, no one is safe.",medium
Here's how I keep building my email list:Please notice that I put content strategy after email list.,medium
So many course creators start putting out social media content before having a list and are missing out on tons of subscribers.,medium
"Instead, sign up for email software before releasing content so you can capture as many leads as possible.",medium
"Once you do, then you should start putting out content that attracts your ideal audience.",medium
"Also, when it comes to content creation, don't try to be Gary Vee either.",medium
You don't need to be on every single platform 15X per day to become a successful course creator.,medium
I know because I tried to become omnipresent and it led to burnout and little results.,medium
"While I might schedule some old content on Pinterest or Twitter, I focus more on my big two than anything else.",medium
"Trust me, I know from first-hand experience this doesn't work.",medium
But there are myriad ways to run launches including:Pick one that resonates with you and give it a shot.,medium
"If you like the launch vehicle, keep doing it over and over again.",medium
"Don't try it once, have a bad launch, and then switch to a new style.",medium
"Instead, learn from your mistakes and keep tweaking a few times before looking for a new strategy.",medium
"Finally, you need tons of patience selling courses and can't expect to make it overnight.",medium
"While I'm all about staying positive, if you try to rush the process, you'll never make it.",medium
"One of my mentors, James Wedmore, preaches patience and is a shining example of how patience and consistency can pay off.",medium
"His signature program, Business by Design, made around $19,000 on his first launch a few years ago.",medium
"Fast-forward to June 2020, he had a $5,000,000+ launch selling the same product.",medium
"If you're an expert in pretty much anything, you can build an online business around your passion and help others succeed.",medium
"Not only is this a great way to work at home, but your work can actually mean something too.",medium
"Sure, making money online is great but helping people achieve their goals is even better.",medium
"When you get emails from students telling you how much your program changed their lives, it's addictive.",medium
It's fun to know that you're making a difference and positively impacting others.,medium
I never had any of this fulfillment from my boring corporate job and am grateful for everyone who works with me.,medium
"While it won't happen overnight, I promise selling your expertise is 100% worth it.",medium
People out there are waiting for you to share your gifts with the world.,medium
"Short bursts of breath slowly re-oxygenate my red backlit eyes, coating the rear hemisphere of my brain.",medium
His dirty tan hoodie plainly visible against the contrasting Prussian blue of the night.,medium
Doors used by students to leave after a late night at the lab.,medium
I gave up on the windows after the first few revealed they only opened about 2 inches.,medium
"If I stay away from the lights, I might make it.",medium
"I exit on to the side street, walking quickly, head down.",medium
I look down the next street and a surge of bile constricts my throat.,medium
"He's there, looking around, mapping routes in his head, searching.",medium
Thuds of panic slam in my head like tall church windows crashing in waves.,medium
"I can hear his sneakered feet, the sound pulsing up in amplitude as he reduces the distance between us.",medium
"Water from my eyes and nose mix with sweat as I hang my head down, wanting to disappear into the earth.",medium
"My face slams shut, like a ventriloquist's dummy that has consumed its master.",medium
"There is no language, no words, that could come remotely close to a satisfactory articulation.",medium
"I feel beaten, dehydrated like a dead flower stuck in a claustrophobic library book.",medium
The skies were clearer than they had been for months the day they arrived.,medium
There was no large spinning disk in the sky that shot laser beams.,medium
"Every now and then, it'd stop, send out a light on an area, and move on.",medium
"You can go if you want, I said firmly, but I'm staying.",medium
I made the face my mother said reminded her of my grandfather who I never met but heard was an awful man.,medium
His brown skin blushed deep shades as he looked away from the girls and me and the UFO skating through the air.,medium
"Yeah, Shelly chirped in, but not to humiliate Billy, her back-porch boyfriend.",medium
"That thing looks lost not deadly, B. Maybe it needs directions.",medium
"Grass and dirt stained her rainbow shorts, but she didn't care because it was only grass and dirt.",medium
No one noticed but me that she shot him in wink under the glare of the sun.,medium
"It was gross, annoying, cute, everything they were, and I was not.",medium
They were whispering about whatever girls like them whisper about and nothing else matter.,medium
Shelly left Billy sore and smiling on the ground to return to calling the UFO over.,medium
"It's not about being scared, Billy said from the dirt.",medium
Dad says it's about being smarter than the idiot before you.,medium
"Well, I don't think there's any idiots before us.",medium
"I'd say we are the first to experience this, I said.",medium
"Shelly listened to Jules and ignored Billy as she sat back down, frowning.",medium
"Yeah, filled with people like us but better, smarter, kinder.",medium
"Yeah, dude, way to steal someone's idea and while the world is witnessing its final day.",medium
"The sunscreen on her skin shined brightly, reflecting the lights now whirling from the floating cube.",medium
"This time instead of trying to yank me up, he went for Shelly.",medium
The look in Shelly's eyes was enough for Billy to release her and put his hands in his pockets.,medium
"Suddenly, the cube shot out a strong light that blinded me and knocked me on my ass.",medium
Jules was ripping grass from the dirt and tossing it to get caught in the wind while Madrona examined her body.,medium
"Billy said, quickly getting up to his feet and helping Shelly up.",medium
Jules stood up with a handful of grass in her hand and dumped it on Madrona's head.,medium
"I feel that, Jules said, gazing down over the town.",medium
He pulled Shelly closer and began to walk toward our home on the other side of the hill.,medium
"Yeah, alright, Shelly said, letting him lead her away.",medium
I glanced back to see if there was anything I could see different about the town.,medium
I followed it down the hill toward the world and away from my home.,medium
"Aigner Loren Wilson is a queer Black SFWA, HWA, and Codex writer.",medium
She was listed on the honors list for the Otherwise Fellowship award for 2019.,medium
"Her work has appeared in Tor Nightfire, Rue Morgue, Arsenika, and more.",medium
She offers a writing craft newsletter to people who want to become better writers and publish quality pieces.,medium
For starters he didn't go to college like the rest of them.,medium
Let's just say the gap year he took after completing high school still hasn't ended.,medium
"At 18, along with two friends, he went backpacking across the country.",medium
"For 3 months, no one had the slightest idea where he was or how he was doing.",medium
"My grandmother, who would be considered archaic even in the 1800's, nearly had a heart attack seeing him this way.",medium
"To date, she still holds him responsible for her heart condition.",medium
"Unconcerned, he borrowed some money from my granddad and disappeared again for a few weeks.",medium
"The next they heard of him, he had set up a bookstore somewhere in Delhi.",medium
"I saw him as the epitome of 'cool', my mother saw him as a bad influence.",medium
I think both these points of view are pretty self-explanatory.,medium
The words 'gap year' were taboo in my house because of Kabir.,medium
"Kabir would spend half his time hunched over a book, and the other half bent over his type-writer.",medium
"Yes, he was one of those people who still owned a type-writer.",medium
This was the first reason I loved him; he made me read The Kite Runner.,medium
"His words were all that he had, there was no place this man could have worked than at a bookstore.",medium
Between The Lines was a bookstore which was as quirky as its owner.,medium
"It didn't only serve as a bookstore, but also as a library of sorts.",medium
It was a system that was similar to a game I had played back in 5th grade.,medium
The next person who borrowed a book would have to continue it from where it was left off on the laptop.,medium
"At the end of each month, Kabir would compile it all and get it printed.",medium
I'd always lurk around the laptop and the minute a person finished writing I would go read it.,medium
The people I'd least expected to have any sort of writing prowess would write stories that would blow my mind.,medium
Everyone who's had a childhood has a story to share Kabir always said.,medium
The books at BTL weren't arranged according to genres or sections.,medium
Another thing about Between The Lines was that no song that was played in the store could ever be repeated.,medium
"Now, this was both a blessing and a boon for me.",medium
"I used to spend long hours curled up in a corner, hunched over some book.",medium
"The bookstore also held some special memories of mine, including my first kiss.",medium
"I knew every nook and cranny of the place, and knew where exactly each book was.",medium
I guess this was why Kabir would have me work at the store from time to time.,medium
"BTL didn't have a large customer base, so I got a lot of time to just sit and write.",medium
"Trust me, there are few experiences as liberating as writing in a bookstore.",medium
"It's quite ineffable to describe the feeling, but it used to make me feel oddly superior.",medium
"Palakh walked into my life in the same way she walked into the store; with poise, grace and purpose.",medium
"She popped by the counter and asked, Hey, do you have Private Peaceful by Michael Morpurgo by any chance? .",medium
"Being the charming, suave man I am, I replied quite eloquently, Uhhh..",medium
That was the first time a girl had left me tongue tied.,medium
"She took Morpurgo on the first day, Archer on the second and my heart on the third.",medium
"Aside from her name, there wasn't much I really knew about her.",medium
"Maybe it was the mystery that drew me towards her, maybe it was her glasses.",medium
"She was a regular at BTL, and we had struck up a friendship of sorts.",medium
How can you be so engrossed in a screen when you're in a bookstore like this?,medium
"By now, a certain coherence had entered by speech when I talked to her.",medium
"Anyway , she continued, I want to listen to your story. .",medium
"I would have forgotten that she was standing in front of me, had it not been for her eyes.",medium
"She was silent for a moment, and then she said in a soft but clear voice It was passionate. .",medium
"Before, I could even process her critique, she had collected her books and left.",medium
I stayed up the whole night thinking about what she had said.,medium
"She didn't come by for a week after that, and I grew more and more anxious.",medium
I couldn't stop thinking about her and became more and more sure of my feelings.,medium
"I decided that the next time I see her, I was going to make my move.",medium
"So, when she did finally turn up, I called out to her before she made her way into the store.",medium
"As we walked towards the back of the store, I saw that she was positively smiling now.",medium
It was one minute of pure bliss and my mind and heart were both racing rapidly.,medium
Productive people don't glue themselves to social media and cable news.,medium
I felt justified in preaching as I had almost universally followed my own advice.,medium
That win-streak ended on January 6 when rioters stormed the capital.,medium
"Everything passes, even the good times, which always seem to zoom by, while the crises linger indefinitely.",medium
"Even my brain rebelled, surreptitiously contriving justification for my lack of motivation.",medium
"When thoughts like those started to make sense, I knew I had to reassert sanity.",medium
"There I stayed for a good 48-hours, clinging to the 24-hour news, drinking wine from a bottle.",medium
"The next morning, the scent of burnt ash and charred metal seeped through my window.",medium
"Two days into the melee, an exec at my company called, and we spoke for ten minutes.",medium
"That might not sound impressive, but he had over 100 people who worked under him.",medium
It forced him to set an example for everyone else to follow.,medium
It was a brilliant lesson and one I've followed during various crises over the last twenty years.,medium
"It doesn't require any special skill or willpower, only a small amount of effort and a desire to help.",medium
We'll accept it even when we have reason to discount it.,medium
"When the executive calmed me after 9-11, I knew he lacked the power to guarantee his promises.",medium
"Still, I bought his reassuring words because I needed to believe them.",medium
"And as he later told me, fulfilling the role of the leader that everyone else leaned on reassured him as well.",medium
"There are three components to this technique, none of which require more than basic interpersonal skills.",medium
A close friend of mine is the most anxious person I know.,medium
"Always on edge, she lived life as if every decision were a life or death situation.",medium
"When you're in the presence of someone like that, you can't help but absorb some of their angst.",medium
Studies show that other people's emotions can and do infect us.,medium
That's why you need to project an air of calm when you designate yourself as the one others rely on.,medium
It's tough to be productive and creative when you're agitated.,medium
You act out of emotion instead of logic and make less thoughtful decisions.,medium
"When you put out the message you're available for others, you thrust yourself into a leadership position.",medium
"Once anointed, we tend to act in a way that's consistent with that label.",medium
"Done correctly, it encourages you to demonstrate the skills, behaviors, and diligence your followers expect of you.",medium
You'll destroy your credibility and antagonize the people you mean to support.,medium
"Put on your listening caps, as your school teacher used to say.",medium
"Recognize their concerns, and then shift focus to the post-crisis world.",medium
"By focusing on the future state, you communicate your belief in an imminent post-crisis world without explicitly saying so.",medium
I've found it even helps to show apprehension or nervousness about the post-crisis reality.,medium
But you'll also communicate a subtle certainty that whatever angst stands in their way now will soon end.,medium
"A crisis, even a short one, can throw off even the most disciplined.",medium
It forces you to set an example for everyone else to follow.,medium
"Here, you're out of reach of the wandering Mudgelwangk and any other ground predators.",medium
The moon is on the rise and you have a clear view of the forest floor by the silvery light.,medium
It might be easier to spot Geoffrey from up here if he's anywhere nearby.,medium
"The twigs scratch your skin as you clamber over it, trying to keep to the edge.",medium
"Unlike other animals, they're known to track a threat far beyond their own territory.",medium
"Not only do they kill it, but then they eat it to ensure it won't return.",medium
You shove yourself away from the cracked eggs and crawl to the far edge of the nest.,medium
"Just as you climb onto the branch beyond, a rustling shadow passes over you.",medium
There's a ferocious shriek from above as heavy wings beat the air.,medium
"Your heart plummets into your stomach as you spiral up, up, up.",medium
You clear the canopy and arrows higher into the star-studded night.,medium
The suspension of disbelief is the readers' willingness to accept as credible facts and characters they would ordinarily consider incredible.,medium
"They know that events and characters aren't real, even when they look like they are.",medium
Yet readers accept them as real for the duration so to be able to enjoy the story.,medium
British author and literary critic Samuel T. Coleridge was the first to call this attitude suspension of disbelief in 1817.,medium
"Coleridge theorised that this happened because of a conscious, temporary act of belief on the readers' part.",medium
"In modern storytelling, the focus of the suspension of disbelief has increasingly shifted from the reader to the author.",medium
But authors must do all they can to make it easy for their readers to suspend their disbelief.,medium
"Good stories don't just allow the suspension of disbelief, they encourage it.",medium
"Then their involvement becomes complete, and a strong emotional bond is born.",medium
There isn't just one element that makes the suspension of disbelief acceptable to the reader.,medium
"Rather, this is a process that works at all levels of storytelling and is utterly pervasive.",medium
Sometimes one well-chosen word specific to a place or a situation will do more than any long description.,medium
"If the setting is where the reader is transported to, characters are the reader's travel companions.",medium
They know the way and will accompany the reader in the journey that is the story.,medium
"Whether soldiers from WWI or little mermaids with a dream, characters need to be coherent.",medium
"Handling characters' actions and reactions is one of the trickiest aspects of storytelling, but also one of the most powerful.",medium
This means that most readers will accept it because they have experienced something similar in their lives.,medium
They'll be likely to take it no matter the circumstances of the story.,medium
It may be tempting to think that readers will accept stories that mimic reality more readily than speculative stories.,medium
Readers are indeed more likely to accept stories that happen in actual locations.,medium
"Besides, when a place does exist, readers expect to 'recognise it'.",medium
What convinces the reader to suspend their disbelief isn't the genre of the story.,medium
"It is the skill with which the author creates characters, plots and conflicts.",medium
"Today, she's a dieselpunk author who writes fantasy stories historically set in the 1920s.",medium
Her life-long interest in Tolkien has turned quite nerdy recently.,medium
"Instead of risking going home for the holidays, we booked an air bnb and headed west.",medium
"And let me tell you that Moab, Utah in the winter is a truly unique sight.",medium
We awoke on day one with a blazing sense of purpose in this wonderfully strange terrain.,medium
"Suddenly exposed to famous trails known around the world, gear quickly began flying around the living room of our poor air bnb.",medium
"The dogs followed right at our heels, on to us and our uncovered, adventuring spirits.",medium
"Like anyone reading this, we had been locked indoors for months now.",medium
"Moab was our gateway to feeling alive again, and we were bursting over the threshold.",medium
"Soon enough, we plugged a trailhead into Google Maps and set off.",medium
"My partner and I were driving up towards the grand La Sal mountains, to a trailhead known as Porcupine Rim.",medium
"My partner Kyle had ridden it once years before, and we were on a mission to ride it together.",medium
"I don't remember any of this drive, it must be taking us up a back way, Kyle figured.",medium
"As we rose a few thousand feet, we neared the trailhead.",medium
"Suddenly, the Subaru Outback rocked back and forth as we swerved onto a fire road.",medium
"There were no tracks on the patches of snow, but the road itself had frozen tread marks of travelers past.",medium
"I scrolled the digital map, But it's also a fire road.",medium
"We were only a few miles out, and GPS estimated 6 minutes.",medium
"And suddenly, we were down a snowy hill, perched beside a barb wire gate.",medium
"As we got out to look around, one option became clear.",medium
"As long as we could keep going down, there seemed to be a way out.",medium
"Looking around, that was the only option among the minefields of rock and unruly terrain.",medium
"Luckily, we could unhinge the gate to get the car through.",medium
My mountain biking shoes were covered in snow when I got back in the car.,medium
"Their angry, incredibly dry branches clawed at my poor Subaru relentlessly.",medium
"We sure as hell didn't know how to get out, and Google Maps certainly didn't either.",medium
These fire roads were merely remnants of trails created to mend the fences that kept in cattle of generations past.,medium
I was starting to mentally log what kind of food and blankets we had in the car.,medium
"Could we hike out and look for other winter mountain bikers, on their way to the trailhead?",medium
"Another time, his brakes failed at the top of, you guessed it, a mountain road.",medium
"He wasn't particularly optimistic, but he sure as hell was going to be resilient.",medium
The ditch ahead was far deeper than my little Subaru would prefer.,medium
"Strangely, I felt like a kid building a fort in the snowy backyard.",medium
"We fit them together like puzzle pieces, as I'm sure I did on multiple lazy winter days in my childhood.",medium
"Needless to say, it was a jumping high-five moment.",medium
"Abandoned-chic, a skull hung ominously on the aged door.",medium
"Double pad-locked, the steel bars were chained with a purpose.",medium
"I'm glad we didn't have to destroy your gate, or get arrested for trespassing,",medium
"Sure, we have all followed GPS down a wrong alley or two.",medium
We would never take automated directions into such an over-the-top demise.,medium
"As we drove out of the canyon to real road, the immensity of what almost happened set in.",medium
"Is it possible to sue google, to soogle, if you will?",medium
"Ever since we started dating I've gotten you into these oddball, crazy situations.",medium
"You know, I think its weirdly, in a backwards way, a blessing, I countered.",medium
I have never been so grateful for safety and routine as I am now.,medium
"Sure, the highs of canyon views and steep descents on two wheels are viscerally satisfying.",medium
But maybe the lows exist because they put the highs in perspective.,medium
"They feel extra good because you evaded that discomfort, when you realize you could have, but didn't fall.",medium
"To put it crudely: The worse the bad gets, the better the good feels.",medium
"Despite the consequences, I realized that pushing this envelope of risk now and again is essential.",medium
Because good adventures are not the only ones that amount to something.,medium
"Hit me with hot chocolate and zoom calls, I've never been more ready.",medium
"The quiet felt ominous, like he was being watched with eager appetite.",medium
"He squinted up at the stars, the sun-blessed clouds.",medium
Van Gogh hadn't been crazy - or even mildly delusional like Brophy.,medium
The sky really was waves of energy pulsating the music of the universe.,medium
It was too dark to take a picture to send to Audrey.,medium
"Genius sells, but mad genius shatters sales records and builds her brand.",medium
A slobbering hound from hell knocked him flat and panted drool on his chest.,medium
"She was thirties-young, tall, lithe, and dark blonde.",medium
She definitely had a dog who couldn't wait to mangle him.,medium
My name is Brophy James and I'm trying to find Wild River Cabins.,medium
"She hacked a long, serious cough and spat into the leaves.",medium
She was shorter than she looked when he knew he was going to die.,medium
He couldn't believe he'd have to hack through the woods again to get to a warm fire and featherbed luxury.,medium
We live with the rest of the world until we can't take it any longer.,medium
"Believe me, my man, I have no problem attracting exactly what I need exactly when I need it.",medium
"The dog slumped onto the ground, lay his head on his paws.",medium
"A month later, Brophy's entire Hermit Series sold out the night of the opening.",medium
"This is Texas, remember, so these two places - both in the western part of the state- aren't exactly close.",medium
"I was a little suckered in by the photos too, so I agreed.",medium
"The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department purchased the 37,000 acres, once part of a working ranch, in 1988.",medium
"Devils River State Natural Area is in Val Verde County, near Del Rio where we were staying.",medium
"According to the park description, it contains three ecosystems: the Edwards Plateau, the Tamaulipan mezquital and the Chihuahuan Desert.",medium
"Dolan Falls, the highest volume waterfall in Texas, is there too.",medium
"And the Comanche, Kiowa and Kickapoo tribes once called the area home.",medium
"There is apparently a Buffalo dancer pictograph as well, representing a Native American.",medium
"Also in 1873, Texas Ranger Captain Pat Dolan clashed with native residents, at the falls named for him.",medium
I didn't appreciate why until we made our little day trip.,medium
"In the little window of time I had cell service, I called the park.",medium
"Maybe now is the time to mention that Del Rio was the hottest U.S. city on record that day, at 113 degrees.",medium
The gravel road turned out to be more like a big rock road.,medium
"After five minutes of bouncing up and down, I was so damn grateful that the idea had not been mine.",medium
"If the trip was a complete bust, it wouldn't be my fault.",medium
"One hour, one baby javelina, three roadrunners, and 10 ranch entrances later, we made it to the ranger station.",medium
"Once parked in the lot, there was another mile walk to get to the river.",medium
I thought to turn it into a game for my kids and said the first person to see the water was the winner.,medium
I've only seen water that color along 30A in Florida and the Caribbean.,medium
"And except for the birds and fish, we had it all to ourselves.",medium
"Because the land on either side was privately owned, there was no looking for cave art.",medium
"But that was OK because as I mentioned, it was fry-an-egg hot.",medium
"At one point, I left my crew downriver and came back to our starting point.",medium
"Alone, watching fish at my feet and a cliff rising in front, I felt perfectly content.",medium
"The drive out wasn't any better than the drive in, but we were all in agreement.",medium
But different would finally be OK where he was heading in a few days.,medium
"At 19, Boyce Brady would break away from Grandma Ronnie's clutches and board a bus to his destiny.",medium
I won't be no 'Double B Coming and Going' no more!,medium
He made that declaration at Christmas just before his last semester at Festus High.,medium
"Public school would be good enough for Boyce, she decided, maybe even straighten up his quirks.",medium
"She held on to a secret, though, that a fund had been established years ago in Boyce's name for college.",medium
She had been putting her coins away in a special place for years just for him.,medium
"And for that, she could be patient and help him get through the high school days.",medium
"But for Boyce Brady, high school was one long, tormented day after day of being the source of everyone's laughter.",medium
"It was nothing Gam could help him with, he was on his own.",medium
"You're not a boy, you don't play football or go out with girls.",medium
"Now, in just a few days he was headed to Missouri State in Springfield.",medium
"She thought it was important for Boyce to go to camp with the other boys, hoping for a blossoming to occur.",medium
"Boyce just sat in the corner listening, hoping not to be noticed.",medium
"A few weeks later, Anh invited Boyce over one afternoon during spring break.",medium
"When it was time for Boyce to go home, Anh walked him to the door and reached in for a hug.",medium
"As they pulled apart, Anh kissed Boyce lightly on the cheek.",medium
They talked about how they were both going to get out of that town one day.,medium
Don't you think we can be anyone we want to be?,medium
I do not want to pretend to be someone I'm not.,medium
Boyce wasn't sure what Anh meant exactly but he could feel its meaning somewhere deep in the sanctuary of his heart.,medium
"And a silent nod to Anh was confirmation, Defiant and firm.",medium
"Thuong means One Who Loves Tenderly, he said, looking deeply into Boyce for understanding.",medium
"Boyce didn't hesitate, he knew just what he wanted with Anh, that it was mutual and without shame or prejudice.",medium
Anh had helped him get part of the way there and now the rest was up to him.,medium
"As senior year approached, they accepted their fate and honored each other's needs and choices.",medium
"And holding all that they shared together, tightly and dearly in mutual respect and gratitude.",medium
"Boyce was excited, nervous, happy and sad all at once.",medium
Leaving his grandmother alone made him anxious but he knew his time to shine was now.,medium
"Gam, I just need to make one stop on the way to the bus station.",medium
I received an email the other day that said Let the spin machine go into action.,medium
"While I understand the order, I'm not a fan of the sentiment.",medium
"Spinning is great for turntables, spiders, and the aptly named spinning wheel.",medium
"Heck, I'm even OK with Dead or Alive telling their object of affection that they spin them right round.",medium
"But when it comes to public relations or marketing, spin is bad.",medium
"Basically, it refers to the act of putting a positive light on something that's not so great.",medium
"As a result, the term spin is associated with shady behaviour - making something bad seem not so bad.",medium
"In each one of these codes is a commitment to be honest, to communicate accurate information.",medium
"As we have seen with the rise of 24-hour news channels and social media, the truth will eventually come out.",medium
"If you tell a story and fudge some facts because it will distract from the positive points, that's spin.",medium
"When used out of context, the term spin only serves to reinforce the belief that public relations practitioners are untrustworthy.",medium
"In my case, the story I was asked to put in the spin machine was already a positive story.",medium
But the person who said it to me wanted the story to be promoted and shared.,medium
"I understood that, but using spin was not the way to make that point.",medium
A stroll up Walnut Street to the farmer's market would take her under five minutes from her northside apartment.,medium
"Hey, Viv! Franklin yelled out to her from his front balcony on the third floor.",medium
"I have to take Tilly to the vet, so no, Franklin said.",medium
"Sitting on the opposite corner of her apartment building, seemed to beckon her attention.",medium
It was an old wooden thing with part of its wicker seat missing.,medium
"I suppose it's for the taking, just sittin' there like that.",medium
"Remembering that she was on another mission at the moment, she let it go and headed for the market.. .",medium
He could hear her shuffle as she approached from the other side.,medium
"Smiling, she opened the door with his strawberries set into a paper box in her left hand.",medium
"Peering over Franklin's shoulder, Vivian could see the chair was no longer on the corner.",medium
Franklin turned around to see what she was looking at and saw nothing unusual.,medium
"Sliding her cycling gloves on and securing the velcro, she did a double take as she caught sight of it.",medium
"There it was, but a few feet down the street from its original perch.",medium
"Maybe someone took it and changed their mind, didn't quite fit, she pondered.",medium
She didn't have much time as she was already running late for a doctor's appointment.,medium
"As she was stepping through her bike, she noticed a swath of pink on the right arm of the chair.",medium
"Why did she think she had any right to it any more than the next person, anyway?",medium
"The moon would be almost full tonight, she knew, she could check on it later.",medium
"Cleaning, cooking, enjoying a strawberry dessert with Franklin upstairs in his apartment.",medium
Listening to Miles Davis wafting on a warm breeze from a neighbor's living room through open windows.,medium
"Monday rolled around and as she left for work in the morning, there it was.",medium
"Making another southward movement from the corner of its origin, the chair was now a few more feet from its previous perch.",medium
"Looking up, she heard her bus approaching, pulled her pass from her pocket, crossed the street and got on board.",medium
"Taking a seat near the back, she turned to get a last glance at the chair.",medium
"Once again, it would have to await its fate with her.. .",medium
"At mid-day, she had even considered phoning Judith, her elderly neighbor.",medium
"Sitting down on the couch, she noticed a text had come in on her phone from two hours ago.",medium
It was a terse message simply requesting that she call her first thing in the morning.,medium
"Scrolling through her phone briefly, she set her phone down and wandered into the kitchen to throw some dinner together.. . .",medium
"It may be nothing at all, but we should do the other tests to be certain.",medium
"I mean, should I be worried, or what should I be worried about?",medium
"Until then, she would just have to be patient and calm.",medium
"There was a genetic pre-disposition, she knew, but she couldn't think about that now.",medium
The day dragged on and she did her best to stay occupied.,medium
Picking up her pace she arrived at the chair with a laugh.,medium
"Its seat was fully restored now, the arms painted in turquoise.",medium
"The legs were still a tan color except for one, the rear right leg had been partially painted in pink and gold.",medium
"Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back! . .",medium
She wished she had made her appointment for the morning instead of having to wait all day.,medium
"Going back inside and closing the door, she got ready for work, a bit perturbed about the missing chair.. .",medium
"As she approached her building, she saw Judith in her front garden, on all fours.",medium
"Having moved back up the block towards her, not quite at its original starting place but somewhere in between.",medium
She excused herself from Judith and walked down the street for a good look.,medium
It would hardly be of any use to her now.. . .,medium
Franklin had arrived home just as she was sitting down on her front stoop.,medium
"He had joined her on the steps, the two of them facing out towards the street, talking idly.",medium
"Yeah, you're kind of a master of that, Vivian said.",medium
"A waiter by day, and so much more the rest of the time.",medium
"Vivian started to tear up, leaning her head onto his shoulder.",medium
"She began to reveal her story to him, the test results, what was ahead of her in the coming months.",medium
"They sat quietly then, watching the world go by, the sun slowly lowering in the sky.. . .",medium
"Alison asked, leaning down to look through the passenger side window from her seat behind the wheel.",medium
"As the car pulled away from the curb, the chair was revealed.",medium
"Vivian went over for a look, to say hello to a long-lost friend.",medium
"It had been months since she'd seen it, where must it have been!",medium
"Vivian stood with the chair, under the stop sign, face to face with it, in solidarity.",medium
"The weather was changing again, getting cool enough for a sweater, even for late morning.",medium
"Franklin came out the door of the main part of the building, coffee mug in hand.",medium
They often met up there on a Saturday morning if the timing was right.,medium
"Sitting next to her on the stoop, he noticed the new addition to her porch.",medium
"That she had turned a corner, moved forward just a little bit.",medium
"Aren't you worried someone will come and steal it off your porch, though?",medium
"I thought it was so important for me to have it, to give it new life.",medium
"But every time I saw it again, it was never the same chair.",medium
"Franklin scratched his chin, not quite grasping her meaning or how to respond.",medium
She looked at him then turned her gaze across the street to the corner across from their building.,medium
"Do we feel the passage of time, the incremental movement farther and farther away, second by second . . .",medium
She turned to look him squarely in the eyes for an answer.,medium
I think we're just sittin' there watching the world go by.,medium
For something or someone to come along and make us feel of use.,medium
"If we're lucky, we find a good collaborator or two to help things along, she said.",medium
"Franklin nodded, looking over at her staring off across the street.",medium
A woman in a Toyota slowed down at the stop sign opposite their building.,medium
He straightened his posture in a way he thought an innocent person might.,medium
"Then, he cracked it open to find Mariam, his old girlfriend.",medium
"She was holding bananas, mangos, and his favorite: pomegranates.",medium
"She breathed a sigh of relief, as if she were glad he was still alive.",medium
"He took the bag of fruit, and backed away from the threshold.",medium
Here he had passed the best - and worst - days of his life.,medium
"Khatami was president, and every month gave birth to new possibilities.",medium
But the most important change was not about clothing: reform was underway.,medium
"So long as he kept a low profile, he knew he could avoid arrest.",medium
He opened the door before the taxi stopped and rushed up the steep slope leading to the park.,medium
"He perched himself above a waterfall, and gazed at the foothills of the Alborz mountains in the distance.",medium
"After a pause, he added, Soon, I'll be thirty-five.",medium
"By the time dad was this age, he had a career and a future.",medium
"Although no one had been listening at first, passers-by had begun to stare at him as if he were possessed.",medium
It felt good to be uttering the words that had been buried in his heart for too long.,medium
"His audience was the river, the trees, and his beloved Darband, where the river flowed like champagne.",medium
"The park even had its own theatre, Tamashakhaneh, right in the center.",medium
No law had the power to destroy his life or to deny him a career.,medium
He then consoled himself: surely the theatres of St. Petersburg were just as captivating as those in Tehran.,medium
"Exactly two years ago, he had been arrested for his cartoons of the Ayatollah.",medium
They were not intended to cause offense; he had hoped to show the human side of this revered figure.,medium
"He thought of it as a way of paying homage, to humanize the leader of his country.",medium
Hossein did not publicize the cartoons himself; he knew better than that.,medium
"But once at a party with university friends, they were sharing what they did for fun.",medium
"When the students asked what they were about, he could not resist telling the truth.",medium
"Perhaps it was his bragging, or perhaps it was the simple yearning of an artist to have his work known.",medium
Everyone at the party expressed admiration for his courage and promised to keep his secret.,medium
He had no reason to believe that anyone who heard him speak had any particular reverence for the Ayatollah.,medium
He had always dreamed that someday somewhere his images might give someone pleasure.,medium
He was arrested and handed a ten-year sentence in Evin for defaming the Islamic Republic.,medium
"It was Nowruz, the beginning of the Iranian New Year when prisoners were typically selected for pardons.",medium
"Citing his compliant behaviour while in prison, they let him go three months after he entered.",medium
There was only one catch: he had to promise to never draw cartoons again.,medium
He remembered all the friends whom he was leaving behind in their cells.,medium
"When would they be free?The prison guard yelled at him from a distance, Go home!",medium
"Vicariously, he had relived the executions of Mandelstam and Gumilyev, the suicide of Tsvetaeva, and the banishment of Brodsky.",medium
He knew what awaited poets who felt compelled to speak the truth to power.,medium
It took him more than fifteen years - and his father's death - to fulfill his plan.,medium
"Finally, one bright Friday morning, a letter arrived from the embassy, wrapped in bright blue tape.",medium
He would do whatever he had to do in order to stay.,medium
He wanted to see his beloved country when no one else was looking.,medium
"Ramsar, the town of his birth, where he lived before he moved to Tehran to attend university.",medium
The Mazandarani dialect that his mother used to speak to him while rocking him to sleep in her arms.,medium
"The white marble hotel owned by Reza Pahlavi, a relic of an era that had vanished by the time he was born.",medium
"Unlike his parents, he could not feel nostalgia for Iran before the revolution.",medium
"He admired the anticolonial ideologies of early revolutionary thinkers like Ali Shariati, and their solidarity with oppressed peoples everywhere.",medium
"What would Shariati think of what the Islamic Republic had become, he wondered?",medium
"What he didn't understand was why it continued, growing more corrupt every year.",medium
"Before you knew it, there was no difference between an atheist state and a theocratic one.",medium
"Given his recent experience in Evin, Hossein was worried about what might happen at the border.",medium
"To his relief, he passed through passport control without being interrogated.",medium
"The line was long, and the guards seemed to be in a hurry.",medium
They barely checked his passport and did not ask where he was headed.,medium
"They did however ransack his bags, as they did with everyone passing through.",medium
"All they found were bottles of sealed rosewater, which he had planned to give as gifts in Russia.",medium
"Or to sell on the black market, if he didn't manage to make any friends.",medium
There was an hour left before his flight was due to depart.,medium
The intercom blared with the number of his flight: Tehran-St.,medium
"He couldn't wait to wander along the Neva under the blazing white sky, accompanied by the ghosts of Mandelstam and Akhmatova.",medium
"Now, instead, he was going to become a box maker.",medium
"For one, you were less likely to be spied on by the authorities.",medium
"Petersburg, I don't want to die, he began to hum the lyrics of Mandelstam to the tune of Alla Pugacheva.",medium
"He remembered Mandelstam's poem comparing Stalin's moustache to cockroaches, and told himself he would never write like that.",medium
"I have to try, he told himself, mumbling aloud just as he had done in Darband.",medium
"Revolution might be the only solution, he mumbled, I don't want to get swept up in it.",medium
It was one of the many poems he had memorized during his first year at the university.,medium
"Back then, he could never have guessed what they would mean to him now.",medium
"And then, louder, he questioned his words: Will I ever return?",medium
"The closed circuit TV was monitoring him, just as it had been for most of his life.",medium
"As soon as he sat down, he closed his eyes and imagined he was flying.",medium
"Didn't his favorite writer, Dostoevsky, once claim that beauty would save the world?",medium
"As the plane soared above the earth, he regretted how little he had heeded his words.",medium
"Now, all he could hope for was that the plane would make a U-turn in the sky.",medium
He would be more useful to the Iranian authorities in the prisons of Russia.,medium
"But then again, he'd been let out of prison once for good behavior.",medium
"I arrive at the restaurant to meet my friend, Bob, for lunch.",medium
"Nonetheless, for those of us that grew up here, it feels like home.",medium
Bob and I catch up in the way that friends do when they're with someone that is truly one of their tribe.,medium
"Six months or six minutes, our rapport returns like a rehearsed Laurel and Hardy routine.",medium
Bob's antiquated flip phone rings and he answers with a Yep.,medium
"ChickenHaus, he cries after a moment and hangs up, smiling triumphantly.",medium
I think Bob plans it this way on purpose because he's afraid to be alone with me.,medium
"Our one and only kiss, which surprised us both, ended with a mutually resounding, Yuck.",medium
"No judgment though, Bob, if that just felt normal to you.",medium
I'd sell tickets to our meetings if I thought I could get away with it.,medium
A Night at the Improv has nothing on a day out with the Bobs.,medium
The window above us simultaneously blinds and cooks us with the infiltrating afternoon sun.,medium
"From the corner of my eye, I see Evelyn wink at me awkwardly.",medium
"I glance back and Evelyn winks again - once, then twice.",medium
"Uncle Archie, Evelyn barks to her brother, pull down the shades for me.",medium
"Well, I don't fucking understand paying 75-damn-dollars to see some women in their panties.",medium
At least not if I'm a damn woman with my own panties I can see for free!,medium
"Besides, they're not panties, they're world-famous dancers in dance costumes.",medium
"But the important question is: Did you catch any fur shots, Mom?",medium
I struggle with the thought of asking my mother the same question.,medium
"Even more so, I am horrified at the thought that my mother would know what fur shot meant.",medium
"Evelyn looks at me, smiles her embarrassment, and reaches over to pop Bob's arm.",medium
She's an elegant woman in her mid-50s with a trendy haircut and a fancy t-shirt embroidered with flowers.,medium
Then WHY in the hell did you pay 75-damn dollars of my hard-earned money to go see that shit?,medium
"Buford hollers, catching the attention of half the establishment, despite the loud whine of Billy Ray Cyrus over the jukebox.",medium
"What I want to know, Buford, is if that $75 includes the gas to get to Mexico?",medium
"I choke on my coffee, not aware Garland has hookers and equally surprised to hear Archie is aware of such things.",medium
"Watch out for that one, Aunt Trudy warns the waitress, pointing a bony finger at Buford.",medium
Everything other than the words eggs or bacon that come out of his mouth are complete bullshit.,medium
Buford makes a rude gesture and turns a charming smile on the waitress.,medium
"Save it, buddy, the waitress quips and turns to Aunt Trudy.",medium
"I carefully rise, protecting the group from a fur shot and reach for the pull cord on the spring-loaded shade.",medium
"I'm wearing a short skirt, semi-sheer tights, and high-heeled leather boots.",medium
"As I reach my full height, a stiletto heel sinks into the cracked vinyl.",medium
I refuse to make eye contact with Bob and hope he doesn't notice my ass on his head.,medium
I am rewarded for my bravado with the shade nearest me slipping down into place and staying put.,medium
"I shift my weight and switch knees, trying to balance only on my toes to keep from puncturing the vinyl.",medium
Each battle wound here in ChickenHaus has been bravely earned over decades of enduring late-night drunks and rowdy locals.,medium
I stretch for the second shade in the far corner but can't quite grab the dingy ring.,medium
"I give it a little tug, afraid to breathe and lose my balance.",medium
"Without looking up or anywhere other than at my feet, I step back attempting to slink down to a sitting position.",medium
I consider momentarily ducking under the table and crawling for the door.,medium
The deafening silence is broken only by Tanya Tucker and my beating heart.,medium
I didn't know the human mouth could turn that far down.,medium
"I'm sorry about your Jesus, I whisper and wave my hands wildly like a rejected Rockette doing a vaudevillian routine.",medium
"No one says a word until Evelyn graciously puts a hand on my shoulder and says, Thank you, Sweetie.",medium
The laughter finally comes and with it a huge sigh of relief mixed with a wave of hot embarrassment.,medium
"Blissfully, the checks finally come, signaling an end to the afternoon.",medium
"I nod, noticing our food is quite literally on him, but am still too embarrassed to even make a joke.",medium
"You can get everyone's ticket, Mr. Moneybags, Buford offers, but Bob politely declines.",medium
"Hey, how about I give you a naked picture of me in exchange for this bill?",medium
"No, I don't think so, she responds, never missing a beat.",medium
"Only with my clothes on, Buford assures her, but she ain't buying it.",medium
I didn't think a breakable glass object was a good toy for a nine-year-old.,medium
"She was fiddling with a foot-tall hourglass enclosed in a wooden, three-column frame engraved with wild animals.",medium
She opened her eyes wide and offered me her puppy dog face.,medium
It was time to do my parental due diligence and learn more about Magda.,medium
I'll just keep an eye on her while she and Magda play hopscotch.,medium
"If Magda and I jump on the exact same hopscotch squares at the same time, I go to her castle.",medium
"That's why she gave me the hourglass, so we can hopscotch together.",medium
"The first trip was by accident, but now we know how.",medium
She held the hourglass with the now empty upper bulb to the light.,medium
"She waved to me and then jumped through several squares, landed on the ten, and vanished.",medium
I pressed my head into my palms and tried to extract a memory that didn't exist.,medium
"So let's take a look at what effects caffeine, alcohol, and exercise have had on my sleep.",medium
I started this analysis in mid-2018 when I wrote about the results of tracking and modeling my blood caffeine concentration for a month.,medium
"While providing some interesting insights, the data was far from statistically significant.",medium
"Finally, I want to draw some conclusions on what I managed to learn from this experiment.",medium
Later I also started to use rTracker to log my alcohol consumption.,medium
Armed with all this raw data I was almost ready to start my analysis.,medium
"I refer you to my previous articles, or the code itself, but here is the core caffeine model in a nutshell.",medium
"Just like caffeine metabolism, how much caffeine affects us also depends on the individual.",medium
It's responsible for pumping blood around our body and supplying it with oxygen and other important nutrients.,medium
"So the heart is clearly important for physical, as well as mental wellbeing.",medium
A heart rate of 60 bpm does not mean there is a beat exactly once every second.,medium
Our heart adapts to the slightest nuances in our environment and the ever-changing requirements from our body.,medium
It also speeds up with the in-breath and slows down with the out-breath.,medium
"The more rested and relaxed we are, the stronger this response.",medium
"But if we are stressed, fatigued, or otherwise in a sub-optimal state, our body's response gets dampened.",medium
"It's a sign that our sympathetic nervous system, responsible for our fight-or-flight response, is overactive.",medium
This makes HRV a great metric to measure how well-rested and ready for peak performance our body is.,medium
"In short, the higher our HRV, the stronger our adaptability to stress and the environment.",medium
"The results of this have been quite profound, and deserve a separate article which I'm planning to write soon.",medium
"For the sake of our analysis here, it's enough that we agree that higher HRV is better.",medium
"Looking at the plots below, we can see that these quantities are quite strongly correlated.",medium
"Nights during which my heart rate was lower, were also nights with higher HRV.",medium
The next variable I want to look at is how active I was during the day.,medium
I didn't doubt that exercise had a positive effect on my sleep over the long term.,medium
Maybe this mental effect and lower stress hormones more than made up for my tired body.,medium
One variable that did however behave as expected was the restlessness of my sleep.,medium
"Despite this, exercise for me seems to have a positive effect not just over the long term, but immediately.",medium
"Next, onto a variable whose effects are less subtle and difficult to interpret: alcohol.",medium
"Beyond a little bit of alcohol, the next day's readiness score drops considerably.",medium
"In reality, most factors probably have long term correlations and effects on each other.",medium
A single particularly good or bad night does not stand in isolation but affects the following days and nights as well.,medium
Fully unraveling and understanding the complicated relationships between these interlinked variables over time is pretty much impossible with the data on hand.,medium
But a simple and hopefully still enlightening first step is to look at moving averages over time.,medium
"Once I told them, they immediately sent me a free replacement ring.",medium
"But while they were intense, it was a very positive and rewarding intensity, much more eustress than distress.",medium
I'm wondering if part of my seemingly increasing stress that's apparent in the data is a result of this.,medium
"We talk about this in our book, in the form of the ancient concept of Noble Leisure.",medium
The best form of leisure is often very active and infused with a strong sense of meaning.,medium
I guess I'm a bit of an outlier in that data.,medium
One other potential contributor to my overall decline in HRV and an increase in resting HR might be found in the following plot.,medium
"Inspired by the above mentioned Oura study, I decided to also look at how my values vary over the average week.",medium
"The results turned out almost comical, with a consistent increase in stress markers over the week.",medium
One thing to note is that the variance is significantly increased on the weekend.,medium
Removing all days with Quite a bit or A lot of alcohol shows a slightly different picture.,medium
This aligns quite nicely with the average presented in the Oura study.,medium
This might be explained by the fact that this is also the night I'm most likely to spend with my girlfriend.,medium
"Why We Sleep, confirms this and even suggests a sleep divorce.",medium
The time I go to bed also varies somewhat predictably throughout the week.,medium
Especially in 2020 I rarely went to bed past 1 a.m. and was usually in bed by midnight.,medium
"While at a first glance this might look like a positive development, I'm not so sure about it.",medium
"If boozy nights are included, my weekend nights show significant variation.",medium
"In general, my sleep duration is very healthy at around 8 to 9 hours.",medium
"But I know just how important sleep is for me, and how poorly I perform on little sleep.",medium
"Less than 8 hours and the next day won't be great, less than 7 hours and it will be pretty miserable.",medium
"To understand a bit better at what's actually going on, let's take a look at the science of sleep phases.",medium
"It makes us more emotionally stable, and as a result, more empathetic and understanding of others.",medium
"Everything that doesn't fall into these two phases can, oversimplifying things a bit, be categorized as light sleep.",medium
"However, even if the data is potentially not 100% accurate, as long as it is consistent there is still valuable.",medium
So let's take a look at how my ratios of different sleep phases change with the total sleep duration.,medium
"Then, as the night progresses, our sleep shifts more and more towards REM sleep.",medium
"The final cycles of sleep, especially if we get a full night of sleep, are dominated by REM sleep.",medium
"Another factor that can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of sleep, even if we get enough hours, is alcohol.",medium
"Alcohol clearly kills my deep sleep, leading to more light sleep instead.",medium
"Surprisingly, REM sleep seems to be more or less unaffected by alcohol.",medium
"This goes against the academic literature, which has shown that alcohol has a particularly devastating effect on REM sleep.",medium
"Subjectively, I do remember more dreams on nights when I was drinking.",medium
It's possible that some of the effects caused by alcohol look similar to Oura's sensors as REM sleep does.,medium
"Similar to alcohol, more caffeine seems to increase light sleep at the expense of deep sleep, leaving REM mostly unaffected.",medium
I'm particularly skeptical about and don't think Oura is very good at detecting accurately.,medium
The effect becomes clearer when plotting the total amount of REM sleep I've been getting each night by itself.,medium
I never had to worry about job security or had to directly face any of the other stressors many people were confronted with.,medium
"While I've presented a lot of data and analysis here, this is only the tip of the iceberg.",medium
But this simplicity is the best way to start gaining some valuable insights.,medium
"Overall, I want to be cautious reading too much into these results.",medium
The relations of the different variables are so complex that it's almost impossible to clearly identify any causality.,medium
"Also, both my own self-tracking and modeling, as well as Oura's measurements and models contain some uncertainty.",medium
"For caffeine, the effect of my love for coffee is not as bad as I had feared.",medium
Maybe someone can point out that I just didn't look at the right studies.,medium
Maybe days on which I was already stressed made it more likely for me to drink?,medium
Attempting to answer this particular question would require to also manually track my perceived stress levels throughout the days.,medium
"I have some experiments in mind, and would also love to hear your suggestions for hitting my goals.",medium
"Whether through unbridled enthusiasm or the crush of business, work-life balance can take a beating.",medium
"Fortunately for them, they have mastered the appearance of hyperactivity while carving out welcome me time.",medium
"I daily block off time for rest and personal life, Zachariah said.",medium
Remember 'Do Not Disturb' on your phone along with screen time restrictions to automate quiet time from the noise.,medium
"Many systems create their own kind of chaos and anxiety, for sure, he said.",medium
Knowing which areas cause energy drain and which areas do not is important to diagnosing if there's even a problem.,medium
We have to be wise about how we're spending our time instead of scrolling and consuming content for hours on end.,medium
"One example is time spent retweeting, quote tweeting and the difference between them.",medium
Retweet as a quote is better because a mere retweet is a simple-non-involved push of a button.,medium
"When I had a smaller audience, I would reply to tweets more to find cool people, Zachariah said.",medium
"Now that I have a few more followers, I love to use quote tweets to expand the audience and involve more people.",medium
"I mostly reply to tweets because the conversation is between me and the other person, Sklar said.",medium
Another way to save time online while getting maximum engagement is through polls.,medium
I have used them to play two truths and a lie to get people to know me and our staff better.,medium
Sklar also uses Twitter polls to get feedback on an idea and learn more about her audience through entertaining questions.,medium
"With all that, people should not live, eat and breathe social media without a break.",medium
"As cool as our brains are, they aren't meant to always be on.",medium
Why do your best ideas come in the shower or at 2 a.m.?,medium
"The entire point of social media algorithms is to keep you on, he said.",medium
"Without rest, you're really being influenced at a psychological level.",medium
Sklar emphasized how important it is to disconnect for everyone's mental health.,medium
"It's not good to be so consumed in what everyone else is doing or sharing, she said.",medium
You're not going to miss anything that important if you step away for a little while.,medium
"Always allow yourself time away from social media to rest and recharge, Sklar said.",medium
It's easy to get caught up in the opinions of others and general negativity online.,medium
Sometimes you just need to be by yourself and shut out the outside world.,medium
Going back to draw on oldies-but-goodies evergreen content gives you a Twitter presence without having to do much work.,medium
"Don't be afraid to let people know when you're taking a break from social media, Sklar said.",medium
"This way, they'll know you aren't actively online and checking your notifications.",medium
It just might inspire them to take a work break of their own.,medium
It helps take a load off so you can achieve work-life balance.,medium
"In the good old days, online work and play could turn into real-life work and play.",medium
"The more stressed out and anxious you are, the lower quality will be for your content and replies.",medium
"If you're overwhelmed and 'go dark,' that's not good.",medium
"I love the idea of life-work balance instead of work-life balance, he said.",medium
Sklar has reinforced her beliefs for constructive pauses through three decades of experience.,medium
"As a social media marketer, I see the value in social media for building your brand, she said.",medium
Scheduling content ahead of time allows me to do this while ensuring I always have new content going out.,medium
Then you could scoot out for a day or weekend with few being the wiser.,medium
I love screen time on my devices to limit my exposure to the addiction of always being connected.,medium
You know you're getting the content out there without always running around to create it.,medium
"That's 100 percent the best way to do it, Zachariah said.",medium
Being mindful about your time on social media is as important as being mindful about your time with family.,medium
Listen to what it says to make sure you're home on time.,medium
"To set boundaries, start small and adjust based on how you feel, Zachariah said.",medium
"Give yourself a schedule to check Twitter and other social media or work, he said.",medium
Block off small portions of time at first and adjust as you grow comfortable with setting boundaries.,medium
"I have hundreds - and hundreds and hundreds - of muted words, Zachariah said.",medium
Don't get dragged into content and conversations you don't want to have.,medium
"It's beneficial to set certain times during the day to log onto Twitter, Sklar said.",medium
Then you'll be less likely to check notifications randomly throughout the day.,medium
"Maybe set Twitter check-ins for the morning, mid-day and evening.",medium
Get down to work much later as you get acquainted with others.,medium
"Aim for casual know, like and trust before you ever get to the world of marketing.",medium
"Link up with people who value a work-life balance, Zachariah said.",medium
It also can be the 'life' part of the balance.,medium
It helps to carry those connections away from the social platform to boost the rest of life's pleasures.,medium
"Rather than building anxiety, going online can be a welcome relief valve.",medium
"For many people, social media is actually a way to de-stress after a long day, Sklar said.",medium
Who doesn't want to go online and watch a few funny videos after a day of work?,medium
How you spend your time on social media doesn't always have to be work-related.,medium
Avoiding Twitter burnout is as easy - and hard - as putting the phone down.,medium
"Limit how much time you spend on Twitter each day, Sklar said.",medium
"If you allow yourself hours to scroll through your feed, you'll probably do it.",medium
"Take care of your body: eat, sleep, exercise, Zachariah said.",medium
Then get ready for your day - and don't check social last before going to sleep.,medium
"Also remember that you can easily follow too many accounts, he said.",medium
There's only so many people who realistically fit in your brain space.,medium

It stated they only select the best of the best with extraordinary grades from the top universities in Germany.,medium
Another requirement was to provide 2 detailed recommendation letters from professors or employers.,medium
"I have never been to China before, but I had this vision of myself on the Great Wall of China.",medium
"From my semester abroad in Thailand, I knew I love Asian culture and lifestyle.",medium
"Then I realized if I don't at least apply, I will never know if it would have worked out.",medium
"I was so afraid of failing and other people knowing about it, that I didn't tell anybody about my plans.",medium
"After several rounds of self-doubt and nights sitting over the application, I finally send it over.",medium
My heart was beating like crazy when I read the words:I felt sick to my stomach.,medium
"Preparing the application was a lot of work, but actually, I gained something from it.",medium
"My professor and old employer were really supportive, and it was great to hear that they believed in me.",medium
"Now, I could move on and delete dancing Karo from the Great Wall.",medium
It was a normal afternoon in the office; I was working on an investment memorandum when my phone rang.,medium
"I went outside, picked up, and the voice on the phone said:What the fuck.",medium
The first thing I did was calling my parents and telling them I am moving to China in 2 months.,medium
"For the first time, I didn't follow the safe way.",medium
My perspective changed from a small-town girl to an international professional.,medium
"I learned so much about myself, cultural differences, and of course, I learned to speak Mandarin.",medium
They think I have a talent for languages and I am a high-achiever.,medium
"But the truth is I am still the same average person, the only thing which changed is my mindset.",medium
Here is what I learned since this pivotal moment 8 years ago.,medium
"We are all just normal people, no matter what it says in our CV's.",medium
"When things don't go as expected, then have faith everything will be great just in another way.",medium
"Often we think about what we consider crucial decisions forever, but they actually don't matter that much.",medium
"And there is no fixed path, you can reinvent yourself at any time.",medium
I had such a limited perspective before moving to a foreign country.,medium
"To become the best version of yourself, you need to experience things outside your normal circle of influence.",medium
Your learning curve will speed up when you expose yourself to the unknown.,medium
"You will learn to see things from different angles, which makes you a better person and problem solver.",medium
"Everything has a price, an upfront investment you have to make.",medium
"Often we cannot see the fruits of our work directly, but long-term, your action will pay off.",medium
"Writing the application was hard work on top of my job, but it paid off.",medium
"When I was 24, I never imagined my life would turn out how it did.",medium
I could not have come up with this grand plan for myself.,medium
"Trust the universe and your progress and enjoy every second of this amazing gift, your life.",medium
"Take the opportunities given to you, they might change your life in wonderful ways.",medium

Food is a huge part of the experience whenever I go traveling.,medium
It's that every country expresses a great deal about itself through its food.,medium
Their menu and the dishes they serve vary and adapt according to a country's tastes.,medium
You've got countries that always have a certain spice they add to their dish.,medium
You've got countries that build their food around a certain flavor or taste.,medium
You've got countries that have become well-known because of a certain dish.,medium
One of my favorite places to visit and go on a food trip is Taiwan.,medium
"I'm very partial to Chinese food, which has proven to be my comfort food on more than one occasion.",medium
A lot of people avoid stinky tofu when it comes to Taiwanese street food because of the smell.,medium
"However, in my opinion, it doesn't smell too bad.",medium
"It's just fermented, and a little fermentation is good for your stomach.",medium
"I've tried different kinds of stinky tofu in Taiwan, but my favorite is the one in Raohe Night Market.",medium
The stinky tofu is perfect there - crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.,medium
Bomb pancakes are also known as scallion pancakes or green onion pancakes.,medium
"The result is a delicious, chewy street food you won't easily forget.",medium
Think of it as a little burrito that is filled with ice cream instead of meat and vegetables.,medium
It's one of the most popular street foods in Taiwan and you'll often see it in popular tourist spots.,medium
"The best place to have it, however, is in Ximending, the place of shops and nightlife.",medium
"There, the line is so long, it sometimes takes 20-30 minutes before your number is called.",medium
"It's worth it, though, but you'd better order everything you want to keep from falling in line again.",medium
"When my siblings and I were younger, one of our favorite books was Little Pear by Eleanor Frances Lattimore.",medium
Imagine our joy when we got to Taiwan and we heard them calling out Tanghulu!,medium
"Even before we arrived in Taiwan, we knew we just had to have their beef noodle soup.",medium
They did not disappoint!One of the best beef noodle soups we had was in the food court of Taiwan Main Station.,medium
"This is a very popular dessert in Taiwan and you can have it in two different ways, too - hot or cold.",medium
The taste and chewiness of the taro and sweet potato balls are just perfect.,medium
"In almost every corner you turn or every alleyway or little side street you go through, you will find milk tea stalls.",medium
"Some of our favorites were in the night markets of Raohe, Shida, and Shilin.",medium
"Not all the teas have milk in them, some are just plain fruit tea, but just as tasty.",medium
"A few years ago, I was about to start a business with a couple of friends.",medium
"The idea was exciting, we were motivated and were ready to launch a successful product in the market.",medium
People working in training and development would understand the meaning of SMART goals.,medium
RelevantT = Time BoundOne can set goals based on the most important outcomes that one wants to achieve.,medium
"The outcomes could be losing weight, getting a new job, starting a business, writing a book etc.",medium
"Then, why do people still fail to achieve their goals?Some end up setting the same goals next year.",medium
"Through the SMART goals' method, one can identify the actions that will get us the outcomes we are looking for.",medium
What this method doesn't mention is how to trigger those actions consistently.,medium
"As a result, most people start a new year by taking action to achieve their goals only to lose momentum and consistency.",medium
A more useful way of achieving goals is to form habits that will help one in becoming more consistent with our actions.,medium
"First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use.",medium
"Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional.",medium
"Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.",medium
"Someone wants to write a book, but they end up spending too much time watching Netflix.",medium
"Someone wants to get in shape, but they can't stop eating cookies.",medium
It is time to introspect the cues that lead us towards actions that do the opposite of achieving our goals.,medium
"Once those cues are identified, only then can we profoundly change our actions.",medium
Another way to identify a critical habit is to ask the question: how?,medium
Start with your goal and keep on asking the question how till you get a specific action.,medium
We can all vouch from personal experience that changing existing habits or building new ones is not an easy process.,medium
The best course of action would be to focus on 1 or 2 habits at a time.,medium
Working on 3 or more habits at a time could be overwhelming.,medium
"By now, we have narrowed down 1 or 2 critical habits.",medium
"As mentioned from the habit loop, one follows a routine to get some reward that our brain craves.",medium
"Before we change the routine, we need to change the reward our brain craves.",medium
A new reward could be dopamine response to engaging with friends online or learning something new.,medium
Adopting the new routine every time on cue will help in developing the habit.,medium
The initial days are always the toughest as the cravings for the old reward are high.,medium
"Once the brain gets used to the new reward, the new routine will become a habit.",medium
"Once a new habit has been built, consistent action will be taken automatically towards the achievement of one's goals.",medium
The only way to find this out is to review this approach at the end of the year.,medium
Try changing a couple of critical habits in 2021 and see what happens at the end of the year.,medium
Or - How to make goals into a process rather than a battleThe New Year is the time of goals.,medium
"How many times have you set out to achieve a goal, and then failed it?",medium
"For someone else, it's not something they even thing about.",medium
"This could be a missing limb, recent domestic violence, mental health, stroke, ect.",medium
"So, how can you measure success of therapy when people's goals are so different.",medium
"Most people don't think about success as a measure, but instead as a goal.",medium
"At this point, people will very often disengage from the idea.",medium
"This is very black and white, and gives no way to measure change.",medium
It only takes into account whether or not you achieved a goal.,medium
"And it doesn't really take into account how you achieved that goal, or how well you did.",medium
"In this example, success is $200, $400, $1000 dollars.",medium
You haven't failed at life because you only managed to save 100 dollars.,medium
And it's not just success if you somehow managed to double that and save 400 dollars.,medium
How can we measure success in a way that makes sense?GAS goals.,medium
"They're used all the time in occupational therapy, and they measure all different types of success.",medium
"By measuring goals this way, you can actually start to see patterns, and progress.",medium
Here's the theroy of a gas goal:Let's take the example above:Everything after this is personal.,medium
You will use this goal time and time again - it's made to be used over time.,medium
"So you set the parameters at the start, and then you can measure progress over time.",medium
"For someone else, it's entirely possible they would struggle to save 100, so they might have -1",medium
Let's say you save 160 because you drank some wine at that one dinner out.,medium
At that is the beauty of gas goals - they only measure success.,medium
I'm used to all that and frankly am happy to do my part in stifling the spread of the virus.,medium
"Shooting an 86 on a rather tough golf course should have sent me over the moon, but I found myself barely excited.",medium
"Neighbors, friends, family members constantly at odds with one another.",medium
My sister Emily has an excellent descriptor for what Florida means to our family.,medium
But now the problems of the world have encroached on our sacred place.,medium
The divisiveness and anger and name-calling have made their presence known.,medium
"No, not in bumper to bumper traffic on Chicago's Interstate 90 on a Friday afternoon.",medium
I'm talking about listening to all the music and podcasts you haven't had time for.,medium
"I'm talking about taking in the sights and sounds of the countryside, unseen when flying 6 miles above the Earth.",medium
It's about 350 miles from my grandfather's house to the Georgia border.,medium
"And coming from someone who sees very little green or sun from November through March, this is a welcome respite.",medium
"As I push North at 79 miles an hour, there is very little traffic.",medium
"Aside from Tampa, there are few large cities along the interstate to slow you down.",medium
"Florida might be really long and really flat, but it's also really fast.",medium
I find myself daydreaming about living some place where it's green year round.,medium
"I press on, boosted by my thoughts of what if .Georgia.",medium
The Interstate curves and winds and goes up and down and to the side.,medium
"While the Chicago Loop is high and mighty, Atlanta seems to stretch on forever.",medium
"As I navigate through spurts of intermittent traffic, I look at the faces of the motorists around me.",medium
Do I even know?Mumford & Sons' second studio album Babel comes across my music queue.,medium
"If there was ever an album written for a road trip, it's this one.",medium
I think momentarily about turning around and heading back to Bonita Springs.,medium
My vision is starting to blur from double-digit hours focused on the road.,medium
The lights of the cars behind me dart around like fireflies in the wind.,medium
"The areas surrounding the city of Chattanooga, TN might be one of my favorite spots in the continental United States.",medium
"The moon sits high in the East, casting short shadows over the looming foothills.",medium
The Interstate bends and weaves through the valleys and up the hillsides.,medium
I rock side to side ever so slightly in cadence with the music.,medium
I will hold as long as you likeJust promise me we'll be alright.,medium
Interstate 65 between Nashville and Louisville is a truly wondrous part of the country.,medium
The horse farms are different than the bean and corn farms of the midwest.,medium
"Barbed wire and wooden fencing encompass wide plains of grass, trees and mud.",medium
I pull into what has to be the 10th rest stop of my journey.,medium
A sister and a brother and a puppy hop out of the back as mom issues instructions.,medium
Sister and brother shriek in delight as they chase their new best friend around in the grass.,medium
Do I love anything as much as those children loved playing with that puppy on the side of the highway?I pass Indianapolis.,medium
"I'm about an hour North of the city when, in the distance, I catch my first glimpse.",medium
"They're hard to see at first, I have to squint hard in the late afternoon light.",medium
I'm not talking about the thirty-foot rinky-dink windmills you see in the movies.,medium
"Some turbines spin fast, others slow, others not at all.",medium
The Chicago skyline beckons in the distance like a long-lost friend as I prepare to cross the Skyway back into Illinois.,medium
Daredevils shoot in and out of my lane to save mere seconds of drive time.,medium
"The last parts of my journey include flying Northwest on Interstate 294, exiting at Willow Road.",medium
"Then, a few more streets until at last I'm home.",medium
Humanity is really good at solving problems halfway while simultaneously creating new ones.,medium
But what I do know is I felt much better getting out of the car than I did getting in.,medium
"Turns out, driving across the country is not just driving across the country.",medium
"If you'd like to join our newsletter and receive more stories like this one, tap here.",medium
"I wonder what it's like in Biarritz, France, on a day like today.",medium
"Being there makes you breathe deep, slow down, and take a look around.",medium
"When we do, I hope we remember this time of longing.",medium
"Every experience, from a trip around the world to dinner with friends, shall be a celebration of life.",medium
Biarritz is one of Southwest France's essential towns and is considered by many the surf capital of Europe.,medium
I can't think of a better place to go when this is all said and done.,medium
My brother and I arrived in Biarritz on an overcast and humid morning.,medium
The breeze from the sea immediately welcomed us after stepping off the plane from Paris onto the small runway.,medium
The unmistakable scent of the Atlantic Ocean filled me to the brim with joy.,medium
We rented a car and drove slowly through the outskirts of town.,medium
"As we did, we passed aged wooden farmhouses and cafes whose pastel colors had faded from the salty air.",medium
Surf culture took over Biarritz in the 1960s and changed the face of this erstwhile whaling town rooted in Basque tradition.,medium
"Surrounding Biarritz are many villages and towns full of rich history, unique stories, and nuanced ways of living.",medium
"Considered one of the oldest spoken languages in the world, perhaps even the oldest, the Basque language is gritty and passionate.",medium
"The spirit of Le Pays Basque is simple, pure, and incredibly beautiful.",medium
The green and brown Pyrenees mountains are speckled with white snow and provide a marvelous backdrop to the region.,medium
"In the cold winter months, the mountain snow may travel to the seaside towns as it had recently.",medium
"On one of our outings, my brother and I spoke with a local surfer while we visited the neighboring village of GuÃ©thary.",medium
"He told us that the winter before we were there, the beaches were covered in snow.",medium
"I'd been waiting to take a page out of one of my favorite books, Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises.",medium
"I had to begin with some shellfish and a beer, followed by a dip in the water.",medium
I outdid myself with a plate of massive shrimp that appeared to have met their maker just moments before arriving at the table.,medium
"When the world opens up, we mustn't take these moments for granted.",medium
The ocean became a pale grey-blue as we prepared to jump in before a late dinner.,medium
The tide had risen and the waves crashed against the stone staircase leading down to one of the small inlets off the boardwalk.,medium
"I swam far out to sea, taking in the summer rain.",medium
"Being on the Atlantic side of France, the ocean is colder and rougher than the Mediterranean.",medium
My body felt good as I waded in the water and looked back at the city.,medium
The evening festivities began to commence among the charcoal background of dusk.,medium
"Martin's Church sits in Port Vieux, the center of the town, and looms over the surrounding bistros and surf shops.",medium
"The cathedral is a reminder of this city's medieval history, a fascinating cultural blend of the past and present.",medium
The cathedral sitting next to the crashing waves is one of the most beautiful sceneries I've been lucky enough to witness.,medium
"The next morning the aroma of fresh coffee and pastries rose from the bakeries and intertwined with the crisp, damp air.",medium
"On one side of town is la Grande Plage, the city's main beach to lounge and enjoy the baking sun.",medium
"In 1854, the last French monarch Napoleon III and his wife, EugÃ©nie de Montijo, constructed their summer home in Biarritz.",medium
The estate was originally called Villa EugÃ©nie and is now the Hotel Du Palais.,medium
The city's famed hotel provides a charming site to marvel at on a boardwalk stroll.,medium
Off Port Vieux is an island about a quarter-mile out to sea.,medium
"Mother Mary's statue sits atop a man-made hill, blessing fishers as they set out for the day.",medium
I was there early along with a lone fisherman trying his luck.,medium
"I asked in my best French, so I'm sure it was rough.",medium
"Yes, he replied with a subtle smile, one I wouldn't be able to discern through a mask.",medium
It was connections like this between two strangers enjoying the simplicities of life that makes traveling a bridge between people.,medium
"I henceforth strive to truly appreciate these moments, whether traveling or in my hometown.",medium
This world is all of ours; it's connections like this one I'll always remember.,medium
"They're not biting today, the man remarked as he patiently gazed into the water's glassy surface.",medium
"He returned to his bait, attached a small fish to his line, and kept at it.",medium
"Around the other side of Port Vieux is the beach, La Cote des Basques.",medium
My brother and I went for sunset one evening and split a bottle of local wine with cheese and crusty bread.,medium
"We watched the final surf sessions of the day while the golden, darkening sky blended with the shade of the ocean.",medium
The sounds of clinking glasses and lively chatter surrounded my brother and me.,medium
"We spent our days exploring the different beaches, towns, and various unique restaurants.",medium
I'd not known much about the Basque Country before this trip.,medium
"After spending time in Southwest France, it's evident what qualities matter in life.",medium
"As I think back on the trip, I'm reminded to let the unnecessary worries, negativity, and fear fade away.",medium
"There's so much to appreciate, no matter where we are.",medium
"On my final night, I went down to the Grande Plage to watch the lighthouse scan the water.",medium
"I walked down the boardwalk towards the lighthouse, laid down on a bench, and closed my eyes to listen.",medium
"For as long as I can remember, I've been at war with goals.",medium
"Each one of the goals I followed came with a subset of exhausting smaller goals and modest, yet painful, sacrifices.",medium
"I was meeting the goals I'd adopted from my parents, but I wasn't happy.",medium
"To make things harder, by senior year, I'd realized that I was a lesbian.",medium
"I wanted to find love, security, and a queer community.",medium
"So I took out a credit card, quit my job, and moved to Los Angeles.",medium
"I'd hated the formal requirements of my desk job, so in LA I learned to bartend.",medium
Tending bar granted me a joy I didn't realize it was possible to feel at work.,medium
I started to make friends and I focused on making sure I didn't regret a moment of my time in LA.,medium
"Within a year, I'd built a life that was the exact opposite of the one I'd had in Virginia.",medium
Months of quarantine have afforded me ample time to reflect on the ups and downs of my life in California.,medium
"It started off jubilant but, at some point a few years in, I found myself struggling to maintain my joy.",medium
Each action I took that contributed to the successful expression of these values gave me joy and fulfillment.,medium
"After readers determine the precise words that speak to them, those words become a roadmap for daily living.",medium
"For every action and decision, readers learn to ask themselves, Does this make me feel the way I want to feel?",medium
My value-oriented life was an organic result of wanting to feel good.,medium
The Desire Map gave me a framework to make that focus on values intentional and maintain it as I continued to evolve.,medium
"Without a new framework to keep me focused on values, I shifted back to goal-oriented living.",medium
This isn't to say that goals are bad - I think they're incredibly useful for staying aligned with your values.,medium
Figure out the values that guide you and then set goals in service of those values.,medium
Instead I made a professional goal to play in photoshop a few times a month because I value strengthening my creative muscles.,medium
"One is a box to check off, the other is a creative adventure.",medium
"Turn the questions over, play with different options, and allow this thinking to transform how you see the world.",medium
We all have the power to find our own values and let them lead us to the future we dream of.,medium
"This might happen, and to be honest something should kill email - because email is awful.",medium
You're going to associate some of that with relevance and self-worth.,medium
"This is why many offices ultimately get very hair on fire, and while everyone complains, they secretly kinda love it.",medium
And group chat apps hand you all of 'em on a silver platter.,medium
It can be hard to choose the sleeping bag temperature that will be best for you.,medium
Finding the right balance can be difficult enough that a lot of serious outdoors-folk have multiple bags.,medium
"However, the normal, a budget-conscious recreationist like myself can't always afford multiple, quality sleeping bags.",medium
"During the winter months, you can add a liner to increase the warmth.",medium
"In warmer climates, you may want to bump the temperature up by 10 Â°F, or so.",medium
"If you do mostly summer-time trips, a 30 Â°F sleeping bag should keep you comfortable.",medium
"When you select a sleeping bag, make sure it is rated using EN or ISO testing standards.",medium
If your sleeping bag is not tested by these standards there is a good chance it won't be as warm as advertised.,medium
To decide what temperature sleeping bag you should get you first need to know when you will be using the sleeping bag.,medium
If most of your camping or backpacking is in the desert during summer you don't need a 0 Â°F bag.,medium
It's also important to consider the terrain you'll be sleeping in.,medium
Temperatures in the mountains can change dramatically as storms quickly roll in.,medium
"Desert temperatures can drop a lot at night, but the weather patterns are generally more stable and predictable.",medium
"Once you've decided on those things, picking a temperature rating becomes much easier.",medium
"For single-season use, it's pretty simple to choose a sleeping bag temperature rating.",medium
Look up the average low temperatures for the locations you usually visit during the season you're there.,medium
Then find a sleeping bag with a temperature rating slightly lower than that average low temperature.,medium
In winter you'll probably want a bag rated between -10 Â°F and 10 Â°F.,medium
"For spring and summer, a 20 Â°F to 30 Â° F bag should do the trick.",medium
"Of course, adjust these recommendations for the specific areas you visit.",medium
Choosing a sleeping bag temperature is more complicated when you want to use it across multiple seasons.,medium
"In this case, you need to balance staying warm enough when it's cold against being uncomfortably warm when it's not.",medium
If you spend time in the mountains from late spring through early fall I would recommend a 20 Â°F temperature rating.,medium
If you're in a warmer or colder climate you may want to adjust by 10 Â° F or so in either direction.,medium
Then get another sleeping bag with a -10 Â°F to 0 Â° F rating for the cold months.,medium
I've already mentioned that I take a warmer sleeping bag than I think I'll need when I go into the mountains.,medium
"In the backcountry, you only have the supplies you carry with you.",medium
A sleeping bag is arguably the most important piece of gear you carry on a backpacking trip.,medium
"Eventually, most of us encounter a situation where we have a sleeping bag that just isn't warm enough.",medium
If you end up in this situation there some simple things you can do to increase the warmth of the bag you have.,medium
"You'll be amazed at how much wearing extra clothes, especially a hat and socks, will warm you up at night.",medium
Sleeping bag liners that slide inside your bag can also increase its warmth.,medium
These liners are usually quite affordable and make it easy for your bag to function well in multiple temperatures.,medium
"You can take the liner idea farther by using two sleeping bags, sliding one inside the other.",medium
This is a good option if you're car camping and have two sleeping bags for warmer weather.,medium
"Around 100,000 years ago, humans began migrating outside of Africa, populating other continents.",medium
"At the same time, the African continent had its fair share of inner migration.",medium
"Spreading new farming, ironworking, pottery, and deforestation technologies, the Bantu people permanently imprinted on the places they migrated.",medium
Culprits like these forced 79.5 million people to migrate by the end of 2019.Our ancestry is a story of migration.,medium
My Scottish and English heritage hints at the dominance of a colonialist regime.,medium
"And, my Western, Eastern, Southern Bantu heritage speaks to an older migration, whose influence lasted thousands of years.",medium
I've migrated from my hometown of Baltimore to various other U.S. cities like Austin and Denver.,medium
"This year I even migrated from my country, moving to the Netherlands for school.",medium
"But she has lived in various parts of the city and county, migrating from different neighborhoods.",medium
"When one moves to a new neighborhood, state, or country, there are operational tasks one must complete.",medium
"I have previously submitted my new addresses to the USPS, and the city municipality in the Netherlands.",medium
We know that it is not generally condoned in our societies to be unidentified.,medium
It is preferable if your location is permanent and the institution knows the location's latitude and longitude.,medium
I must get my passport stamped to move to essentially any part of the world.,medium
Some nation has claimed every parcel of land that dots this earth.,medium
"For the first time in human history, every acre is attached to an administrative apparatus.",medium
"I by the League of Nations, a Western organization tasked to maintain peace.",medium
The U.S. then passed the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and The Immigration Act of 1924 limiting the inflow of immigrants.,medium
Too many people from unwanted countries were threatening the ideal of American hegemony.,medium
"On November 29, 1941, U.S. law required Americans to have a passport.",medium
"Still, I can't shake the feeling that I really can never do what my ancestors did.",medium
"It was always the case that migration brought the risk of disease, war, and death.",medium
"The club may offer benefits like clean water, roads, infrastructure, protection from invaders, and vaccines.",medium
"But in some clubs, club members walking on other club member's property could be a death sentence.",medium
"Our land has become too much like jail, so we have to look at other places.",medium
"He might look to the ocean next, for more than 80% of the ocean is unmapped and unexplored.",medium
What must it feel like to begin a sojourn to a place where you have absolutely no information?,medium
"You don't know what it's like, how it feels.",medium
"I feel connected to my Bantu ancestors, my oldest known story of ancestral migration.",medium
