An Ax for the Frozen Sea,"Franz Kafka moved in with me today. His hair is greasy with the slime of the grave. His bald pate, colored like a palm tree in the middle of an oasis of hair, shakes dandruff sequins from the desert mirage onto the floor. His hollow eyes, the size of a vulture's balls, penetrate me.""Franz,"" I say, ""what are you doing at an hour like this? You ought to be in bed!""Franz winks and smiles wide, revealing what remains of his two teeth. They are the color of ointment extracted from a baby's behind three days after its deposit.""Franz, why don't you talk to me? Speak. That's what you were born to do.""""I've been talking all my life,"" he says, ""but no one listened. In death it's too late to speak.""After the fact. Poor boy. He never looked like a man. There he sits, in a Halloween costume: a white sheet with boogie monster eye-slits beneath his forehead, trapped inside a boy's body, frozen at the age of twenty-two.""Franz, I feel sorry for you. You're stuck inside a boy's body. You look twenty two.""""If you'd let me marry you,"" he continues with my rhyme, ""I wouldn't be so blue.""""That's cheap. You can do better than that. Stick to prose in the future. We've made great strides since your time in the realm of poetry, and you don't stand a chance of catching up with us.""""And what about prose?"" he asks.""The novel - alas the novel! - always lags behind. You're still ahead of us in that area, bro.""He seems to think it strange that I speak with him on such familiar terms, my being a woman and all, but I explain to him the sexual revolution and finally comprehension's light bulb flickers.""It's simple,"" I say. ""The world has changed in unfathomable ways since you were born. War didn't even have a shape back then. Now it resembles a blob of chewing gum that expands as you add one more blob to the mixture. We keep chewing, chewing, chewing, until some nasty fink comes along and rips it out of our mouth.""""When will that happen?"" he asks.""When the world ends,"" I say. ""Nuclear war.""""How come you know all this?"" he asks. ""How can you sound so certain?""""It takes practice, bud."" I lean against him to make him smell the beer on my tongue, the froth still fresh on my lips. ""I have a talent for truth.""""Women were certainly different in my day and age. They were more delicate. I liked them better then.""""Me too,"" I say.Franz keeps me up, in the middle of night, refusing me sleep. I tell him that I deserve sleep, having worked all my life. He disagrees. Posterity always wins. Franz is a talker. I'm a listener. His steady voice grates heavy on my ear, an ax that hurts so much that finally I ask him what's the point.""The point of what?"" he says, confused. This is the first time that I have interrupted him in the middle of a speech.""The point of writing,"" I explain. ""The point if it doesn't redeem your pain.""""Easy,"" he says. ""The books we need are the kind that act upon us like a misfortune. They make us suffer like the death of someone we love more than ourselves. They make us feel as though we were on the verge of suicide - """"Franz,"" I interrupt again, worried, ""why do you say that?"" He ignores me."" - lost in a forest remote from human habitation. A book should serve as an ax for the frozen sea within us.""Now that he's coined a phrase I don't think he'll ever shut up. Franz's voice is a lonely trumpet in the middle of the sea, but his loneliness is a matter of indifference to him, as well as, perhaps, to me. Franz keeps talking.Join our free newsletter & keep up to date with new authors and help readers & writers connect!",https://miro.medium.com/max/2048/1*t_F3YdPA_rjO9fT7q4p57Q.jpeg,https://medium.com/written-tales/an-ax-for-the-frozen-sea-6b4c8807da76,fiction,0d987875be2e43a384c03cf2ad13b717249aee9805ffa2b87bf91d90
A Trick (Besides Goal-Setting) for Creating Lasting Change,"Ideas adapted from ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear.Almost every person I've met has thought about changing some aspect of their life. Some people merely wish for better days without doing anything about it, but a significant proportion of people will take some sort of action because they want to improve their lives. Undoubtedly the most popular form of self-improvement is setting goals.Accomplishing goals will rarely change long-term behavior.Living by goals has a ""yo-yo"" effect, bouncing between accomplishing goals and the time in between these accomplishments.Goal-setting is inefficient if the time between goals is spent reverting back to old habits instead of developing long-term solutions.Once a goal is reached, it is easy to revert back to old habits. This is because in order to accomplish a goal, many people will take steps that don't align with their normal behavior.For example, a recent goal of mine was to lose weight until I hit a certain number on the scale. After about two months of consistent effort, I was able to reach my goal.However, after hitting that goal, it became increasingly difficult to maintain progress. I lost the healthy habits I had previously attained - I stopped working out every day, allowed myself to snack more, and slept later.This is a classic example of the yo-yo effect in action. While I was able to reach my goal, maintaining it was much more difficult because I had not grown to love the process. Instead, I was focused on results.It was difficult for me to continue making progress after accomplishing the goal because I no longer had my source of motivation.On the other hand, once I shifted my focus to refining the system - working out consistently, eating healthy and nourishing foods, and sleeping well - maintaining my healthy diet and exercise habits has been much less painful because I continue my habits regardless of results.When actions are dependent on accomplishing a goal, results become everything. But letting results dictate action is contradictory.Prioritizing the goal over the system makes it more difficult to continue on a healthy trajectory after accomplishing the goal. While setting goals as a form of motivation is a great way to get a sense of direction for where you want to be in the future, they should not be the main focus of your energy.Two opposing teams in a sports game both have the same goal - to win. But only one team can accomplish this goal at a time.Thus the goal does not make the difference between winners and losers.The system of the team - how the coach encourages the players, how versatile and strong the individuals are, how efficiently they practice, how effectively the team works as a unit - is what ultimately determines the result of the game.In the same way that it's not enough just to set a goal, it's not enough to just want to win.While the desire to win is an important aspect of success in a game, it is insufficient without skill, practice, teamwork, and a little bit of luck. Similarly, focusing on the goal is an important step in the process, but it's not sufficient without consistency and practice.This concept can be applied to everyday life. Instead of trying to accomplish a goal, seek to optimize the habits that you live by. These little changes to how you live your everyday life will deliver results on a much grander scheme than focusing on accomplishing goals.Many people try to brute force their way to a goal. They make extreme temporary changes to their lifestyle - working later, practicing longer, eating healthier - to accomplish a notable feat, just to revert back to old habits after their goal has been reached.In this way, goal-setting is an addictive behavior. By setting goals and accomplishing them, we use the gratification of these small wins as motivation to accomplish the next goal.While gratification from accomplishments can and should be used to propel you forward and help you gain traction, it is often overhyped as a means to achieve long-term change. When steps taken to reach a goal require a great deal of willpower and sacrifice, it will likely not result in long-term change.To change your behavior, you first have to define an image of the type of person you want to be. Then, exhibit behaviors that align with this version of yourself.Expecting yourself to stick to behaviors that are unnatural or difficult is unreasonable. But this doesn't mean that change is hopeless - rather, we must change our conception of ourselves so that good behaviors come more easily.Notice that this subtle difference in language demonstrates two completely different responses.By saying ""I'm trying to quit,"" Person 1 is insinuating that they are still a smoker. In other words, they are still living the identity as a smoker.However, by saying ""I don't smoke,"" Person 2 is actively living as if they were already the type of person they strive to be (a non-smoker).By consistently acting like the type of person you want to be, new behaviors will start to come naturally. Unhealthy behaviors will start to feel incongruent with this new version of yourself, and many old habits will fall away with time.",,https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/why-setting-goals-alone-will-not-create-lasting-change-4252972d9b79,productivity,1a9b895751df17b7887f046996f4ae5342faf8f6db6ed20a407c1ea6
Encountering Prehistory in Walnut Canyon,"The region described in this article is the traditional territory of the Northeastern Yavapai and Northern Tonto Apache. The dwellings at Walnut Canyon were created by people that archaeologists call the Sinagua. They are the ancestors of modern-day Hopi people. Learn more about the Hopi Tribe.Whenever I get the chance to visit somewhere with a visible history of human habitation - not just the five or ten generations of my own ancestors but the hundreds and thousands of generations of the original stewards of this continent - I make it a point to think about the individuals who stood there before me. I think of people who, under a younger sun, planned for the day ahead or smiled at a memory. People who told stories, said goodbyes, made promises.Long before it was a national monument, or a state park, or a plaque at the side of the highway, someone - many someones - stood there when that place was simply home. Nothing more and not a fraction less.I've gone through this mental exercise in many places, but none of them connected with me quite as strongly as this one.Ten miles east of Flagstaff on I-40, Walnut Canyon - Wupatupqa, in Hopi - slices 400 feet into Permian Kaibab Limestone. This reveals the dark vein of the Toroweap Formation and, below it, moon-white Coconino Sandstone. It was carved by Walnut Creek, which advances to meet the Little Colorado River on its journey toward the Grand Canyon.Here the desert converges unexpectedly with conifer forests. On north-facing slopes that are cloaked in shade most of the day, there are the Douglas firs and ponderosa pines that dominate the Mogollon Rim. On south-facing slopes, drier and more exposed, juniper and piñon mingle with prickly pear and yucca.So named for the ""island"" of rock around which it circles, Walnut Canyon's Island Trail starts with a long climb down 240 concrete steps. The path is a mile long and loops fully around this outcropping of land, bounded on three sides by the negative space of the canyon.The deep stillness here is punctuated by the continuous climb and fall of hawks. They're hunting jays, tracing weightless arcs through the air with their pursuit.The temperature dips as I descend from the canyon rim. The trees and stone seem to emit an incongruous chill that, at least when I was there in April, helps to offset the desert sun.The first time I reach a pueblo, it's almost jarring. The miles of woodland between here and the nearest city lend the feeling that this is a nature preserve. But beyond its natural beauty, this national monument is, in fact, an archaeological site.It feels like such a clinical term, archaeological site. It does nothing to capture the feeling of the place.But it is a site of archaeological significance, evincing as it does the lifeways of past humans. Between about 1100 and 1250 CE, the Sinagua people - a pre-Columbian society that farmed, irrigated, traded, hunted, and gathered throughout central and northern Arizona - built cliff dwellings in the natural recesses under the canyon's lip. The Island Trail runs alongside twenty-five of these dwellings.What strikes me most are the smoke stains on the rock, 800-year-old relics of heat and light. I try to picture the faces that were lit by those fires, how the orange flicker would have thrown shifting patterns across those who sat by its warmth as they spoke and gestured and laughed.There is a moment, about three-quarters of the way through the loop, where a series of rooms beneath the rock overhang line the path to the left and a tree-lined chasm yawns open to the right. On the other side of this chasm is a steep, tiered expanse of canyon wall.The slope appears totally wild at first. It's just a plane of pathless rock, laden with stubborn pines. But then I blink and like an optical illusion, the image seems to invert: suddenly all I can see are the five rock-walled pueblos dotted along the opposite wall, just like the pueblo behind me.This is the image that Walnut Canyon left me with. I imagine standing here as dusk settles, the smell of woodsmoke drifting on the wind. I imagine seeing the glow of a fire in each of those five pueblos across the canyon, each of them a comforting point of light as the evening shadows deepen and snag on the pine tree branches. And I try to imagine being here not as a visitor, not as an uninvited guest, but as someone for whom this was home.It's an uncommon thing, to have this kind of opportunity to connect with the history of the landscape. I'm grateful to be reminded that, although it's rarely as tangible as it is in Walnut Canyon, the past is always a part of the fabric of the present.Plan your own visit to Walnut Canyon National Monument.",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/1*MjtumZ7hZS2IlUEgpjTntQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/@eleri.denham/encountering-prehistory-in-walnut-canyon-6fc2de5af5fa,travel,1b317fde068c45480efbf89ac9b589aeee36a59e7a0fc030a43573d5
My Transition to Becoming a Digital Nomad - Living a Life as a Sailing Software Developer ⛵ 👩‍💻,"A traveling nomad living her dream on her sailboat ""Hello World"" sailing around the world. Is it as charming as it might sound? I used to live in Norway working as a software developer living in my apartment in Oslo - now my new address is ""wherever the wind will take me"" 🌊 and my new office is ""wherever good coffee and wifi exist"" ☕️ I want to share my journey and share my key learnings from living as a digital nomad so far.The idea of living in a sailboat sailing around the world, propelled by the wind, sounds like music in my ears. Enjoying every sunset and sundowner 🌅 Taking my morning coffee looking at the crystal clear water with a living aquarium behind my home ☕️ 🐠 Sounds tempting? Like everything in life, nothing comes for free. You have to work for it! Living on a boat is a lot of joy but is also frustrating at times. What made me swap the safe life on land with a rough life at sea playing by the rules of mother earth? 🌎Today, my boyfriend and I are living the dream as digital nomads on our sailboat ""Hello World"" in the Caribbean 🌴A good story always starts with a clean sheet of paper - we sold everything we owned and bought a sailboat. But why?It all started with me feeling that something was missing in life. Every day I woke up, went to work, went home again, met some friends or watched some tv, went to bed. Repeat. It's not like every day looked like this, but it sure felt like it sometimes. I wanted a life with more contrasts - you need to feel the ups and the downs to appreciate the peaks! ⛰In the summer of 2018, we chartered a sailboat in Croatia and I immediately fell in love with sailing! When it was time to deliver the boat back after two weeks on the water I kept on wondering - how would it be if I could live like this every day?I started looking at couples on Youtube living on their sailboat and just kept on watching. My boyfriend thought it just was a short time of inspiration after the holiday in Croatia. But it wasn't. I kept on watching and daydreaming about life on a sailboat.We have had some minor issues with the apartment we lived in and the situation changed in April 2019. The marked looked good and it was time to sell the apartment. Buying a new house or apartment felt so wrong because it felt so permanent. Am I just going to keep the loop going or am I going to do something about it?My boyfriend had chartered sailboats a couple of times with his friends, but I only had my first experience from the holiday in Croatia. Our sailing experience was limited. At Easter 2019, we finally sold our apartment and had no plans for the future. A month later we bought a sailboat from a Norwegian couple currently at Bermuda on their way home from the Caribbean (without seeing the boat 😅). We got the boat in Norway 1. July and put up our sail 14. July leaving Norway on our way to the Caribbean. Quite bold, but we knew our limits - at least we thought so 😆 For sure, we did have some quite scary situations on our way and the learning curve was as steep as a wall. Anyway - we did manage to sail our way down Europe and cross the Atlantic ocean getting to the Caribbean all in one piece! 👏Before buying a boat we sold all of our possessions that we would not bring to our new floating home. That would include our apartment and the car. Selling things we didn't need anymore gave us some money to keep us floating for a while. Also, as software developers, we are (usually) fortunate that we have a good salary so we had some savings we could use. Sailing is one of the most expensive hobbies you can have so you need some money to buy and maintain it...and you need some money for food and coffee as well.So - we had cash from the 🏠 , 🚗 and💰. Before, I used to work as a consultant in a Norwegian consultant company making software for clients. About a year ago I leaped and started my own company working as a self-employed developer. Why? I wanted the flexibility to pick the clients with interesting projects - not just working for the clients a company has obligations to. I also wanted more time with family and more time to travel. Being the boss of my own company makes it easier to live the life I wanted.At one point I simply didn't see why I couldn't just be a self-employed developer. If some company hired me through a big consultant company - why did they not want to hire me for a project from my own company? In the end, we are just humans with knowledge and what company I work for does not change my knowledge. This decision made it possible to save up some buffer in my company so I could pay myself a salary without doing any work while sailing. Let's be honest - sailing is 100% work. At least if you are newbies like us. I have not had any income in my company for a while now- but that is according to the plan because I wanted to prioritize the experience rather than working.Ok - I need to be honest. The plan was not to be a digital nomad when we left Norway in 2019... The coronavirus suddenly changed us from travelers to digital nomads. The virus ruined all our future traveling plans and it forced us to be creative and make the best out of our situation. Sailing has been our full-time job until now. We are now working full-time programming while living on the boat. We quite like it and see ourselves continuing this lifestyle in the future.So how is my new office space compared to living on land?First of all - I do not always work from the boat. Why? First, you need to understand your basic needs. You need your basic tools like a computer, keyboard, coffee, etc. But there are some basics that a landlubber probably takes for granted - like power and Wifi. On a sailboat, there is no magic power cable connected. We generate our power from our solar panels and the sun. We also depend on a good 3G/4G reception that is not something that follows us everywhere we go. Where we are now, in Saint Martin (EU), we are lucky to have a 60GB package on our Norwegian sim that is ""Roam like home"" on every European country - including the European Caribbean islands. Because of our basic needs, we often spend our office day on land where we have wifi and unlimited power.One solution to the reception problem is what I call ""Pirate style wifi"". You can install something called a Wifi repeater. You go to a bar - buy a beer - get wifi code - go back to the boat and enjoy the wifi. Unfortunately, we do not have a wifi repeater but we are planning to get one.If we work from land - where do we go? Usually, we try to find a cafe or somewhere offering wifi. We only need power, wifi, a table, and a chair 🤷‍♀A co-working space would be preferable but these are not very common in the Caribbean.How do you commute yourself to work? When I used to be a landlubber I took public transport to get to work. I do not have space for a car in my boat nor have I prioritized to fit a bike in there either. And a bike will not take me from the boat to land anyway. Instead, we use a dinghy! That's like a small rib that acts like our small floating car. It is equipped with a 90s engine that sometimes works. We call it FooBar. It has caused us a lot of frustration but it does it job - getting us from the boat to land and back again. Maybe we will be dry when we get to land (or maybe not ) - it sure depends on the sea state!When you work at an office you probably have a nice chair, a great monitor and maybe a fitted desk to fit your height? This does not exist in my boat, in a cafe or a laundry...Laundry?! A laundry is where I currently sit right now writing this article. Why do you sit there you ask? They have a table, a chair, and great wifi 🙌 Working as a digital nomad forces you to be creative. Like I started the article: ""wherever good coffee and wifi exist"" is my office.I have a MacBook and sitting on a table only using this every day might not work well for your body. I have bought some gear for making my office more suitable. I have a laptop rooster stand to raise my computer to a height where my neck can be straight. I also added a wireless keyboard, wireless touchpad, and a noise-canceling headset. You simply can't ask people at a cafe to be quiet like you can in an office 😆 Everything I use is small in terms of size and weight and fits perfectly in my backpack together with my MacBook.And I mentioned coffee ☕️I am what you can call a coffee snob so I usually grind and filter my coffee in the boat if working off the boat. You know - a cafe does not necessarily make good coffee because they sell coffee. I bring it in my big coffee container to keep me going.I usually work from the boat and on cafes. Other options like checking into a co-working space are also possible. Unfortunately, they are not quite common in the Caribbean and it usually requires you to spend some time in one place. It sure would have helped with getting a better social life. When traveling we usually have prioritized to explore islands rather than work. While living on a sailboat it is more budget-friendly to work from the boat 😄 💸I guess this is one of the sentences you have been told before: ""you can do it"", ""if I can, you can"", ""you are the director of your life"" - blah blah. But it is true. I knew I could do whatever I wanted - but after eventually doing it made me realize that what is normal is not by default something you have to follow. In retrospect, I now see that I have done what I thought I had to do - not what I truly wanted to do.You will stress test your relationship while sailing and living together in a small place like a sailboat. If you get back home together after a year of sailing you know you can live your life together for the rest of your life.Just one word - Freedom! I love my profession as a computer scientist. I am so grateful that I can bring my hobby and my work with me wherever and whenever I want. What a blessing!After corona, more companies have some practice in working remotely. I look forward to seeing if I can get more projects working remotely from the boat. Norway has not been leaning forward on this remote work but maybe things will change in the future? Maybe I don't have to work from a Norwegian company at all? All options are available.Optimize your workplace for remote work helps a lot. Buying a laptop stand, good headset, wireless touchpad, and keyboard made it easier to work in a dynamic surrounding without getting back pain or damage your workflow.There is no one to listen to your joke at work. You are most of your time alone working because your colleagues are not there. Sometimes, I feel a bit alone. It is not all true since I live with my boyfriend, but sometimes I miss the feeling of getting excited about getting home to see him after a long day at work.They say that the happiest moment for a sailor is when the new owners leave with the boat. I guess that is not all true but it says something about the frustration you have when sailing and maintaining a sailboat. EVERYTHING breaks - at least one day. The todo-list of maintenance is a never-ending story and can be quite overwhelming, especially in the beginning. The ocean is a rough place and you need to endure whatever weather mother earth throws at you. It is also rough in terms of seawater and salt. Did you know that a small piece of salt can make a hole in a can of soda (or empty your beer before you manage to drink it yourself)? Yes - I know because I regularly find soda and beer floating around where I store my cans. No fun when I pick up a can and it is empty before I even manage to open it. It does not only apply to cans - salt is the enemy of all metal and electronics as well.What set me out on this journey was the fear of the repeating circle of my everyday life. When living on your boat you meet new people all the time and you travel through different countries and cultures. Just heading to a grocery store on a different island is a new experience. Together with the big accomplishments, the sum of small things breaks the circle and gave me the contrast I needed.I found myself just feeling the joy of seeing a bird after being out at sea for 17 days after crossing the Atlantic sea. Back home I never gave seeing a bird any special thought. The small things you just take for granted. The sudden importance of the sun because your solar panels and the sun is your power supply. The clean water because you make water from the sea to keep you going. The feeling of a freshwater shower - the boat is not magically supplied with unlimited amounts of water! You have to make the water from seawater and a shower is not something you can do every day. The small things I used to take for granted.Some friends expressed their worries about ""what if I just realize that home is simply the best place to be?"". I think it is a good thought - because the travel might give you the perspective you needed to break the repeating circle back home. You now know how to appreciate the small things when you get back home. One day.Yes, you can! Remember - you are the boss of your own life and whatever feels like the norm doesn't have to be your life. You don't have to spice up your life by selling everything you own and you sure don't have to buy a sailboat! You see, there are lots of things you can do to break the repeating circle. Living in a repeating circle is easy. Breaking out of it is not.

How To Accomplish Your Big Goals And Still Have A Life,"We all have personal and professional goals. We want to earn the 6-figure salary, work more flexible hours, and achieve career milestones. At the same time, we want to spend time with friends, pursue our passions outside of work, and have experiences.What will you do? We are all faced with this question and opportunity cost emerges. Every minute you spend with your friends is another minute you can't grow in your career.Every minute you're working is another minute you can't be with your family.Work gives us purpose and can be very meaningful if we choose the right work. Family, friends, and the things that make us happy are incredibly important for living a complete life.But how can we have both at the same time? While most of us can't work on personal and professional aspects of our lives at the same time, we can operate under different ""seasons.""If you have a deadline coming up a big project, you should spend extra time on that big project. Once that project is over, you should spend extra time with friends and family.Even when you've got deadlines surrounding you, it's still possible to make room for 15-30 minutes per day to have conversations with people you care about.Whether it's a quick phone call, family dinner, or some other occasion, make room for those conversations.You can go on fun experiences and spend more quality time with those people when the timing is right. You can also reserve more time during the weekend for your personal life.The reason most people struggle with this balance is because they don't know what they want. What does happiness look like? What does a successful career look like?These opinions differ from person to person, so you shouldn't listen to or model people who have different definitions for happiness and success when making your own life decisions.What are your professional goals? While most people think income (and that's a great goal to start with), you should also think about your actions. I strive to write at least 1 article per day on Medium and another article each day for my blog.List all of the professional goals and their corresponding actions. Get detailed with this list as the more accurate it is, the better.Now for your personal goals. Most people don't know what to list for personal goals because they're more vague. Spending time with friends and family and having experiences are qualitative goals, but you can get quantitative with them.Instead of just listing ""Spend Time With Friends"" as your goal, list something like ""Hang Out With At Least 1 Friend Each Week,"" ""Call At Least 1 Friend Each Week,"" and ""Comment On At Least 10 Facebook Posts From My Friends This Week.""You can quantify how many vacations you want to take and how many hours you want to spend time with your family (at the minimum. No maximums with this one).When you're working, it's not about how many hours you work but about your total output.If you want to write 1,000 words each day for your upcoming book, it doesn't matter if you write that many words in 30 minutes or 1 hour. Writing 1,000 words remains the goal.Growing our careers is important, but so is getting the same tasks done sooner. Writing 1,000 words 30 minutes sooner gives you extra time to focus on a different task or stop working sooner.Look at your existing workflow for opportunities where you can improve your efficiency. You should embrace your professional work, but not for longer than you should.If you get distracted as you work, you'll spend too much time working and end up with a lower output. When you work, only stay focused on your work. Don't surf the web at the same time, take phone calls, or do anything else that takes you away from your work.This will help you get the same tasks done faster and therefore have extra time to spend with family and friends.On some days, you'll work more than you wanted to, and on other days, you'll work less than you wanted to.It's okay to be imperfect as long as you learn from the mistakes you make.When most people think about the work-life balance, they see work as a vice. However, both are important elements of a life that feels whole. Work gives you purpose and self-discovery while the relationships and experiences are what you'll remember the most.On some days, you'll be more work oriented and on other days you'll be more oriented towards relationships and experiences. It's not meant to be a perfect balancing act each day, but rather over the long-term.The goal is to be okay with leaning more in one direction than the other during certain timeframes but to maintain a net even position in your lifetime.Want to learn how to make money investing in the stock market?

The Paradox of Prankvertising,"By the time today's kids become adults, they'll likely have to budget in deciding for what, where, and when to buy attention.It's already happening. For years, circumstances have forced marketers to step up and pay for our attention. The recorded changes in advertising are evident in the impact this has on how people consume media today. Hence, to remain competitive, all had to recognize and adapt to these changes, and the attention game has only gotten more expensive by the day.Prankvertising (a mash-up of the words prank and advertising) has been prevalent as far back as a decade ago. It is a marketing tactic that utilizes visuals to capture the reaction of the commoner in a particular occurrence (prank) to feed the online media.These performances include actors, hidden cameras, and effects that are out of the ordinary. Agencies in charge of these pranks can then later edit, compile, and share the video to the ever-thirsty internet. It makes sense. If your company has a unique feature you'll want to communicate to the market, what better way than with a dramatic outburst, right?Brands have been pulling such pranks to hook the attention of the often-distracted, less-sympathetic online observer. An excellent example is Heineken's The Candidate, a stunt in which an interviewer pretended to be having a heart attack right in the middle of an interview. The candidate to have gotten the job was later announced at the Juventus football pitch - being the most voted by the Heineken community, and as having most qualified for the job considering how he handled the bizarre interview.There are a lot of these, and when done perfectly, no one can ignore them. To date, the most viewed video on the internet in under 24 hours is a prank video, garnering an impressive 247 million views in two days. This is in a world where legends like Eminem are still releasing hits.While it seems like a peaceful day-to-day activity in viral marketing, prankvertising comes with not-so-pretty baggage.For one, pranks cost the lives of many over the years. So, orchestrating this tactic into advertising calls for revising how much technology has fueled our thirst to get noticed, cluttering our vision to neglect our humanity. If marketing is about making a change, and disrupting people's culture for the better, then this discovery calls for a complete halt in serving with such a strategy.Not all pranks end up in death, however. Plenty do not. A sizable number of pranks pulled by brands and individual pranksters - even though startling to experience - often end up with the victim laughing it off. Often, some people even tweet about it in dismissal of how embarrassed, confused, or terrified, they were.The question then is: how far can one go to be too far? What is the line in pulling up a prank before we term it as too much and perceived negatively by the audience you set to entertain?It might be hard to truly answer. But as you might have guessed, anything with the potential of leading to death should be off-limits. The last thing your brand needs is getting sued for taking a life for internet points and petty recognition.This, nonetheless, doesn't narrow it down. For aside from death, there are plenty of other ways to earn your brand a blow you'll hardly ever recover from. You also do not want to come off as offensive, racist, misogynist, and other qualities that can lead the market to dethrone you from whatever height you attained. As if you need reminding, this has never been easier. Thank you, Internet!To their bones, pranks might be risky endeavors, but it is no reason we can't strive towards a happy ending when all is over.Toys ""R"" Us, an American toys and clothing retail company, learned this the hard way. In a prank they pulled in 2013, they outraged a lot of moms at the worst possible time imaginable- the approaching holiday shopping season of the year.Will Burns, a contributor to Forbes magazine, while writing about the incident, observed how reality pranks are not designed to generate responses with phrases likeThe prank backfired. And one need not know what the campaign was about to realize: nobody wants that for their brand.To avoid making a similar timely mistake, always study the variables at play in your campaign, and then aim for a positive reaction. But even that is a vague way of putting it.In a prank that tests the reaction of people walking into an elevator to what appears to be a murder in progress, for instance, it is hard to see what we're supposed to be laughing at. Organized by Thinkmodo, an agency known for creating some of the most viral videos in the world, this prank was for the movie Dead Man Down, an American crime thriller released in 2013.The video confused me when I first watched it. To me, it is both brave and unsettling for a sane person to see murder in progress and then take out their phone to snap a picture. When an old woman tried to help the guy being murdered, I felt the descent of something unexplainable that bought tears to my eyes.I didn't find the prank in the least funny because I couldn't tell what I was supposed to be laughing at. The elevator door slides open, and you're confronted by a scene of intense violence as two men wrestle on the floor, one of them fighting for his life, the other choking the life out of his partner. I mean, seriously?! When I showed the same video to my friend, however, he spilled his drink on his shirt and fell off his seat in laughter.While I found Weather Channel's Bus Shelter prank amusing, others might be frustrated for getting wet in what they will later regard as a stupid prank.There will always exist a lot of people who might feel offensive and others entertained in the same targeted market for the same prank. Our sense of humor is as vast as the languages we speak, if not wider. There is simply no way to further narrow it down.This made crossing the line subjective and often hard to define. ""One man's meat is another man's poison,"" goes the saying.The most important factor then is to have your prank highlight a sharp edge of the message you're communicating and then associate it to an inner joke only your core audience can relate to and be happy to be a part of.Watch and learn from previous pranks, but remember to never copy them. Research has revealed that the world is sadder and angrier than ever. People are less likely to tolerate what they otherwise would. So, watch out!In pulling off a prank, there must exist some elements that aren't in your control, otherwise the word staged will manifest itself loud and clear - making the whole process lame and unprofessional. And like every great adventure, this makes prankvertising both exciting and terrifying to venture into.At the end of the day, says the marketer, Dave McMullen,There is no reason you can not be those exceptions.The year is 2021, and there isn't any sign of prankvertising going anywhere. The newer, more sensational your campaigns are, the more likely your audience will share them. That's how it has always been. Pranks can be a great way to boost your brand's image or introduce a new product to the market. But, like a joke, a terrible one will have you wishing you'd never bothered trying.",https://miro.medium.com/max/13740/1*-pWXMrsH8phEfC1NHA22rA.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-paradox-of-prankvertising-d6197bbbd9f5,marketing,1d045abe0cdb1b91fbeb51c8a7aee07450714f3bd3f9d830cba951c4

Holding On,"""New shirt, Dave? Why won't you listen to me that red is just not your color?"" Martha scrunched her nose and waggled a finger from the screen of my tablet - teasing me with feigned snootiness.Martha, my wife, died 18 months ago. Though she hasn't lost her sense of humor.""I've decided that I'm wearing red exclusively now,"" I poked back matter-of-factly. ""Perhaps orange if I find a handsome flame pattern.""She beamed her usual squinty-eyed smile, and I couldn't help but smile back.""Well,"" she said, ""For once I'm glad I'm not around to see that.""She was still smiling, but mine faded. My jaw clenched and pulse quickened. This was the first time she had acknowledged being gone.Her expression softened and concern filled her voice, ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean - """"It's fine,"" I said curtly. It probably sounded insincere, but I meant it. Afterall, I still didn't fully understand what I was dealing with. This wasn't Martha, but an AI that had been programmed in her likeness.""Dave...?"" she beckoned on screen as my mind raced.The first time I logged in to speak with her I honestly didn't expect much, but I was desperate. I quickly found, however, that the AI model was surprisingly true to Martha - right down to her ever-so-slight southern drawl. Considering the limited amount of data - profiles, text convos, pictures, videos - I was able to gather and submit, she - it - was unbelievable.""Why don't you tell me about your day?"" she asked, rolling a strand of hair between her thumb and forefinger.I studied her a moment. A hollowness crept into her eyes as she waited for my response. She smiled again and it disappeared.So I told her how I woke to Millie barking at the wind again, and about my day at work. She nodded along and jabbed me with her usual sharpness. Seeing her on my tablet felt as if she was just gone on business, chatting to me from the hotel bed before turning out the lights. For nearly an hour, we were together again; for nearly an hour, I felt whole again.""...Speaking of groceries, don't forget to stock up on Cherry Coke!"" she added with a bit too much zing. ""It's on sale at Target this week. Here's a link!"" She tapped her side of the screen and a Target ad appeared on mine.She wasn't wrong: I used to buy a lot of Cherry Coke. But I bought it for her, not myself. I loathed the stuff and Martha knew that. At least, my Martha knew that.""I need to get going, Martha,"" I said, forcing a polite smile. ""I'll talk to you tomorrow.""",https://miro.medium.com/max/15360/1*nF8Cq217UWjt7GWUFBATrQ.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/holding-on-e58203e84e14,fiction,2e1683b8c9a47660cbee5938a2e4d6063600ae4b9b2842573b8d1d8a
Here Is the Real Reason Why Photos Are Banned in the Sistine Chapel,"In 1512, Pope Julius II held a special vespers service. It was an evening event that was held to inaugurate the Sistine Chapel after Michelangelo had finished four years of toil painting frescos on the ceiling. It is now the most visited room in the world.If you have ever visited the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, you will have heard the guards saying, at regular intervals, ""No photo! No photo!"" There are signs everywhere forbidding both photography and video and this is enforced every few seconds by the staff.I have personally been told off there when I checked my phone and a largely disinterested guard just tapped me on the shoulder. I had been pre-emptively warned. I was one of 6 million visitors that year and from what I saw, nearly everyone else was snapping a picture and then being told off.So what is the point of the ban?Most people think it came about to limit the damage done by flash photography. That is not the case. It is actually down to a deal with a camera company and then kept in place for several valid reasons. Let me explain.In 1980, the Vatican decided it was time to undertake a comprehensive restoration of the Sistine chapel and Michelangelo's art in particular. It was a huge undertaking that would take 14 years.It also came with a hefty price tag that forced them to seek outside financial assistance. So they let corporations bid for access.The winning offer came from the Nippon Television Network Corporation of Japan (NTV). They offered $3 million (which eventually increased to $4.2 million) and no one was able to match them. In fact, at first, the deal was ridiculed by many.However, in return for funding the project, Nippon TV got exclusive rights to all photography and video relating to the work. This meant the process of restoration itself and all the final restored art. A photographer called Takashi Okamura was commissioned and he set about recording it all.No other photographers were allowed.When Nippon started to share the high-resolution photos showing the detailed processes going on behind the scaffolding, the ridicule soon dried up. The pictures were spectacular.Since making the deal, Nippon TV has made over a dozen documentaries, including a few in English, and coffee-table books of the art, translated into several languages. Although NTV has never announced if they made any profit, it seemed like they had made a good deal.As reported in the New York Times, the deal only lasted for the restoration period for each section and the three years that followed completion. The final phase, the ""Last Judgement"", finished in 1994. The exclusive NTV rights ended in 1997.There is nothing underhanded going on from Nippon's side. In fact, they originally stated that the photo and video ban didn't apply to 'ordinary tourists'. However, at the time, authorities understandably instigated a broad policy of 'No photos or videos'. They worried a cunning professional photographer could sneak in and get off some snaps.Once the exclusivity period ended, Vatican officials decided to keep the ban in place. Why?In 2012, an Italian literary critic called Pietro Citati caused a storm when he wrote an open letter to a major newspaper denouncing the crowds. He argued that the chapel and its art was supposed to be a place of quiet contemplation. The hordes of tourists disrupt that. If they were armed with cameras, it would be worse.He has a point. In the popular summer months, around 30,000 people visit the chapel every day. The temperature can reach 40 Celsius and that can lead to safety issues. Only the Sistine Chapel itself is air-conditioned and it is claimed that at least 10 visitors faint a day just while queuing to get in. Others have been injured and several have had panic attacks.As anyone who has been to a gallery that allows photography will testify, people snapping pictures get in the way and block things up. With that many visitors, it makes sense to keep people moving.The main reason people think there is a ban is down to the damage flash photography does to art over time. Which is another valid point. While it is pretty easy to turn off a flash, there are a surprising amount of people who 'forget', even though a flash wouldn't make any difference in a room that size.But the mere presence of that many people brings other problems that damage the art. Antonio Paolucci, the director of the Vatican Museums, said in an article in the Vatican newspaper:There are dehumidifiers, filters and climate controls in the chapel but the increasing numbers mean they are struggling to cope. It is the sheer numbers that are causing the problems and allowing photography would exacerbate the problem.It seems very, very likely. There have been numerous calls demanding a limit to the numbers for over a decade. Promises and plans have been made but so far, it has not happened. With the crowds comes a need to stop photography. It just makes sense.I went to the Sistine chapel years ago, on a cold January morning and it was crowded but bearable. It was also as incredible and beautiful as I had hoped. There is no need to take a picture, just pause and admire the work. You will never be able to capture it with just a holiday camera or phone.Then, on your way out, don't forget to visit the souvenir shop. They have some lovely pictures in there.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8248/0*LfvXdA3f83oH46pQ,https://medium.com/illumination-curated/here-is-the-real-reason-why-photos-are-banned-in-the-sistine-chapel-c501cb38f983,travel,3b39d15917caebfce40a7499fad3fa447ea08708c315acd0fa4e762f
Living Abroad Isn't a Permanent Vacation,"Laying on a beach somewhere tropical, sipping a drink while updating your travel blog. That's it, work's done for the day. Now you can spend the rest of your time looking at beautiful vistas, sampling exotic cuisine, and flirting with locals.""Why do you need to take a break? Every day for you is a vacation,"" a friend back home once told me while I was living abroad.The image of ""expat life"" that many think of is terribly romantic. It seems like a wonderful fantasy because for 99% of people who live in other countries, it is. This idea is also based on a privileged viewpoint that sees countries with less economic power as a sort of playground for wealthy first-worlders to take advantage of. And that absolutely does happen. But if you can't afford to only work a couple of hours a week in your home country, it's still unlikely you'll be able to do so abroad.I still worked a full 40+ hours a week and often lost out when it came to sending money home to pay off my student loan debt. When I see so many people discussing a move abroad as the solution to their pandemic fatigue or feelings of burn out at work, I feel it's worth offering a caution.In my time living abroad, I met several ""digital nomads"" - people who lived off of travel blogging and vlogging, photography, and freelance. It is possible. However, it was a lot of hard work.There's a lot of competition online so making your ideas stand out and get click-throughs and sponsorships is a real challenge. Creating content and building up brand relationships is a full-time job for most of these people. And typically, they still aren't rolling in the dough. Many of them choose to make countries like Vietnam their home base because the visa requirements aren't too strict and the cost of living is low.While they can manage to live decently in a country with a very low cost of living, things do get complicated when it comes to paying off any previous debt they carried (like the aforementioned student loans) or when it comes to saving up money. It can be hard to afford to go back to your home country in these cases too.Right now, with many upper-middle-class people working from home, the idea seems even more appealing to go live in another country with a lower cost of living while maintaining your current job. There is an ethical concern over Americans taking their plague-ridden selves to other countries that potentially have a better handle on the pandemic with the intention of being able to have more ""normalcy,"" and perhaps causing that country's numbers to surge. But there are other things to consider too.For some companies, you must be a US resident to work for them. If you must be present for regular meetings and work sessions, time zones will have you living an offset life. Will you still be able to take advantage of all the supposed benefits of living abroad then? Not to mention the everyday logistical challenges of living in another country.Are you fluent in the language of whichever country you would like to move to? Maybe not. And while English is a global language, having no knowledge of the local language puts you at a severe disadvantage when it comes to daily tasks, making friends, and getting involved in the community. If you would expect that someone moving to your home country should learn the language, you'd better get on Duolingo yourself or face your own hypocrisy.Everything will be different. It sounds silly, but that was a common complaint I heard from others when I lived abroad. While some people thrive in a setting that challenges them, others long for comfort and familiarity on a regular basis. If you're the latter, then you may quickly grow weary of sorting out the cultural practices, apartment leases, transportation, and supermarket labeling that's all going to be a bit different than you're used to.Of course, some places have neighborhoods, stores, and restaurants that are geared toward tourists, but you'll pay a premium for them. If the goal is to lower your cost of living, you'll have to do what the locals do at least some of the time.If you think that a move abroad at this time is right for you, take a moment to evaluate why you want to go and what you're looking for in these other places. Every country has its downsides and there's no perfect spot. Even if it's a country you've visited before, perhaps for a vacation, there may be issues you haven't anticipated.It's important to do your research. With the internet at your fingertips, it's easy to find articles, blogs, and videos that might give you a clearer picture of what life is really like for an immigrant, or expat in that country.Many people are looking for a break by going somewhere else during this pandemic. They find life in their home country to be too stressful and they want to put their problems aside and pretend that life is normal again. The trouble is that this pandemic is global. Even countries where numbers are better, the effects of Covid have still changed life in other countries. Restrictions might even be stricter than in the country you're coming from.It's important to ask yourself what exactly it is you're hoping to get from this other place. Then evaluate whether or not it's realistic to expect it from wherever you're going. You also have to ask yourself what the cost will be. What will be the consequence to your life in your home country? Will it be possible to return home when the situation changes?If, after considering everything, you decide that moving abroad is what you truly want - not just an escapist whim, you should prepare yourself. Living abroad can be extremely enriching and rewarding despite all the challenges. It broadens your perspectives and can break down barriers.More than just a temporary bandaid on a deeper problem, living abroad is a serious lifestyle choice. It shouldn't be taken lightly. Study the language, be prepared to become part of a new community, and do the research to know what to expect. But also know that work is still going to be part of your life, not just play.",https://miro.medium.com/max/4908/1*no_0egXqPrNNXGZ6DONn4A.jpeg,https://medium.com/farewellalarms/living-abroad-isnt-a-permanent-vacation-aa7346bdedbe,travel,3ce1e350864e1dee9b52a7968c779f8b3095f4179615945540af7ab4
4 Things The Pros Do Differently Than The Amateurs,"For the past years, I've been studying what high-performers in any field or industry do differently than mediocre performers. To me, it's fascinating to see how high-achievers tend to have different beliefs, habits, and ways of thinking compared to most others in their industry.What's even more fascinating is that, in most cases, this is learned behavior - not genetics. This means anyone can learn the beliefs, habits, and thought-models of high-performers and use them to elevate their personal and professional lives.Therefore, in this article, I'll share four things that the pros (the high-performers from any walk of life) do differently than the amateurs (the mediocre performers).If there's one thing that sets the pros apart from the amateurs, it's their level of consistency. Anyone can put in the work on the days where they feel motivated, inspired, and everything seems to flow easily.But what about those days where you don't feel motivated, where inspiration seems lightyears away, and when work feels like an uphill battle?On those days, most amateurs give up. They are 'easy-weather' workers. When the going gets tough, they tell themselves a hundred excuses why it's okay to escape to Netflix, social media, or other easy distractions.The pros, on the other hand, put in the work regardless of how they feel. They follow their schedule - even if the metaphorical weather is terrible. This makes them ultra-consistent, which is why they perform at the top of their field.Today, I didn't feel very motivated or inspired. In fact, I had quite a terrible night of sleep, so I'm pretty low on energy. Nevertheless, I just sat down and started writing. Before I knew it, ideas started to flow, inspiration struck, and I'm writing this piece right now.I don't know what this article is going to do. It might get a ton of views, it might get zero. It might be valuable to you, or maybe you hate it.Nevertheless, I'm putting my work out there and I'm being consistent. And with consistency, I know one of my articles in the next few weeks will be a big hit.The pros understand that mastery is the name of the game, and mastery can't be achieved when you go too broad. Success is all about becoming extraordinary at your craft. You need to focus deeply on just a handful of skills - sometimes even just one.You need to become so good they can't ignore you (whether that's the market place, a book publisher, coach, potential investors, etc.). This requires focus and discipline. You can't just hop from idea to idea - or from opportunity to opportunity. If you do, however, you'll never develop the level of skill necessary to stand out in your field.Most amateurs tend to get distracted by every new opportunity, idea, or exciting piece of information. They suffer from the 'shiny object' syndrome, which is the belief that the secret to success can be found in the next thing, the next idea, or the next piece of information. This is a false belief.I used to believe in this idea for years, and I was hopping from business idea to business idea. I was impatient and thought I could strike gold with the next business idea. It didn't work. Only when I focused my time and effort deeply on writing articles and creating productivity courses did I start achieving the success I so desperately desired for years.You need to develop the focus and discipline to really go deep and become so good at your craft that you can't be ignored anymore. You don't need to do many different things; you need to do one thing really well. That's it.Whether you're a pro or an amateur, working towards big, ambitious goals requires a lot of effort.Writing a book takes hours and hours of focused work. Building a business takes a ton of energy and mental strength. Training for an obstacle run requires grit and consistency. Effort is required to achieve these great things. Effort is the price you pay for big results.The difference between the pros and the amateurs, however, is that amateurs are overly focused on how much effort it takes to achieve great things. They get intimidated by this effort. They fear it. And thus, they try to escape from it by inaction, excuses, and distractions.The pros, however, are also deeply aware of the effort it takes to achieve great things, but they focus a lot more on their 'why'. Instead of being intimidated by the effort, they get inspired by a clear and compelling 'why'. They focus more on the results their efforts will yield than pondering over the effort it takes to get these results.For example, they focus on how writing a great book will positively impact their readers' lives - not on how much personal effort it takes to write it. They remind themselves of the impact their business might have on society - not on how much personal effort it takes to build it. This difference in perspective makes the pros continue to put in the work, achieve great things, and be rewarded exponentially.Failure is a natural part of the process of pursuing worthwhile things. If you're not making mistakes or screwing up now and then, you're simply not challenging yourself enough.Amateurs fear failure because they take it personally. When they make a mistake, they think they are a mistake. When they screw up, they think they are a screw-up. They also fear that others perceive them as a failure when they fail at something. This is why they'd rather avoid failure simply by not taking any action at all. At least you cannot fail if you don't try.The pros, however, understand that making a mistake is not the same as being a mistake. And that screwing up doesn't mean you are a screw-up. They've also learned not to care about how other people think of them.Instead, the pros view failure as a learning process. They simply think of it as gaining experience or gathering new data. Learning what doesn't work is incredibly valuable. The more you learn about what doesn't work, the closer you come to discover what does work.With this perspective, failure can be welcomed. Each failure is another step forward - another stepping stone towards success.Personally, I dare to say it is because of my business failures that I've achieved certain milestones and successes - not despite these failures. Each failure contained a valuable new lesson that allowed me to come better smarter, stronger, and better.Of course, it's not easy to go from failure to failure, but you should not fear it. It should never become a reason for inaction, staying in your comfort zone, and letting your dreams pass by.Remember, failure is valuable and it's temporary. If you want to become a pro, you need to learn how to embrace it and view it as an essential part of the process.Change only comes from taking action. Therefore, as an action point for this article, pick at least one of these concepts and apply it today! Whether this means journaling about it, meditating on it, or taking raw action - it's totally up to you.Want to be more productive?

Why a Not-to-Do List Is More Important Than to-Do List,"One day Warren Buffett walked to the pilot of his private jet and jokingly said to him, "" The fact that you are still working for me means I've not done my job right. You should have been out by now chasing your goals and dreams.""Buffett then gave him one of the most powerful time management advice. He walked his pilot through a three-step strategy to give more clarity about his life goals. Here's what the three-step strategy was:Warren asked his pilot again, "" What are you going to do with the rest 20 goals?"". ""Warren, these 5 are the most important thing in my life"", the pilot hesitantly responded, "" The other 25 are not my primary focus but I still plan to give them a dedicated effort.""This is what Buffett said in his own words and that's the key to Buffett's success. Focus on the things that really matter and avoid things that don't really help you to achieve your top goals.When you have 20 focuses on your life, it's likely to achieve none. If you focus on the long-term, you may really be able to accomplish 3-5 goals, at most.All those remaining 20 goals on your list act as a potential distraction from your top 5.To-do-list can make you feel overwhelmed if you have a problem saying no or delegating tasks. Having multiple tasks on your to-do-list will also make you more stressed.Also, there are people who are prone to bad habits and distractions that take their time away without them noticing it. The momentum so created after finishing task after task also distracts you from making progress on the important tasks.It's easier to get distracted from tasks that you really need to do. Because you get in the excitement, joy, and temporary pleasure of things that aren't simply as important.For example, you might want to use Facebook or Instagram to take a break from work just to realize you have already wasted 1-hour scrolling on social media mindlessly. It's easy to get caught up and lose track of time when you get into that zone.The basic idea of making a not-to-do list is to help yourself have more time and manage your time more effectively. This helps you to eliminate bad habits and low-value tasks that don't serve any purpose in your life.When you add something to your not-to-do list, you simply say no to it no matter what. You either delegate it or avoid it at any cost.Every day you feel like you shouldn't do certain things, but you can not stop yourself from doing these things. Writing these things down on your to-do-list will help you to systematically take care of all of these things.The basic idea of a not-to-do list is to help yourself with self-discipline. Creating a not-to-do list helps you to avoid unnecessary tasks by giving your mind a signal. It restricts your mind to do certain things.What to write on your not-to-do list depends on your personal behaviors. It can be as simple as not browsing the Facebook feed needlessly, not searching for news, or not going to parties.Here's my personal not-to-do list as of now.Here's a not-to-do list of Tim-Ferriss(Author of the Book 4 Hour Workweek):1. Don't answer calls from unrecognized numbers.2. Don't email first thing in the morning or last thing at night.3. Don't agree to meetings or calls with no clear agenda or end time.5. Don't check email constantly - ""batch"" and check at set times only6. Don't over-communicate with low-profit, high-maintenance customers7. Don't work more to fix overwhelm - prioritize8.

A Scientifically Proven Method for Predicting the Future,"I was fascinated with Nostradamus as a child. The idea that a person could see and predict the future was nothing short of amazing to my young mind.I read as many short novellas on the subject as I could get my little hands on. And I ate them up as fast as I could devour my sacks of Halloween loot every year.No one really noticed my obsession. I read books voraciously at that age, and these were just a few of many.But these passages struck a chord with me. Of all of the magical books I was reading at the time - these were the only ones that were true.True magic in the real world. What a concept.I want you to picture an intelligent financial advisor named Frank.Frank is trying to find a devoted audience for his newsletter on stock markets. Frank read all the advice and books about True Fans and how to turn a newsletter into a business.But Frank also knows how to predict the future.In his research, Frank came across a method to get 10,000,000 real email addresses. Sure, it required a few bucks to purchase from a dubious source, but Frank didn't mind - Frank had a mission to accomplish.He had a few goals:On the first day of the month, Frank sent out his initial prediction.And it did. Millions of people viewed his short email and didn't pay much attention.The next month, Frank sent out another one.Lo and behold, the market did go down. And people paid a bit more attention this time.In the third month, he predicted correctly again.And again. And again. 12 times in a row.Frank was more than just an investment guru by this point.Frank was a godlike financial clairvoyant.After 12 months of insanely accurate predictions, Frank now had his followers. Although by this point, they should probably be referred to as worshipers.Oddly enough, there were also many non-believers.In fact, Frank had lost almost all of his subscriber base. Of the 10 million initial email addresses, he only had a few thousand left.But these few thousand were quite willing to pay a monthly fee of $250 to keep hearing his predictions. I'm sure they would've spent considerably more than that, too, if he had asked.But he didn't. Frank was a gracious god to his worshipers.On the second anniversary of his newsletter, Frank shut it down with no notice.Shockingly, his subscriber base had shrunk down to just one person.Yet Frank had made his million dollars - and then some. Almost $1.25 million, in fact.And he made that one last person an incredible amount of money as well. And cost potentially thousands of people their own precious savings.Did you figure out what happened?Frank was undoubtedly a devious messiah, but he was also a clever one. When he first started out with his 10 million email addresses, he divided them into two groups.To half, he sent a letter saying the stock market would go up the next month. To the other, it would go down.The next month, he split the winning group in half again. And sent a very similar newsletter as the previous month.He repeated the process 24 times in total.After every month, his potential subscribers would go down in half. The negative predictions moving to the trash bin, the positive predictions staying on.The number of newsletter subscribers would look something like this.Now imagine you were in that lucky remaining group sometime in the second year.How long would it take before you'd be on your hands and knees praising this guy that made Warren Buffet look like The Count from ""Sesame Street?""You probably wouldn't care by the second or third month.But the fourth? Maybe you'd start paying attention, and certainly by the eighth.After 12 months, you'd be very willing to give this clairvoyant profit a meager $250 just to keep hearing his advice.And after 24 months? Jesus. Sign over my house today because I'll get a mansion tomorrow.But what about the others who were equally enthralled and invested? After one year of free and accurate predictions, only 5,000 people would be left to receive Frank's email.By 15 months, there'd be less than 1,000. By 18, not even 100. All the way down to one lucky soul.But those few remaining people wouldn't know his newsletter was going out to fewer and fewer people. They wouldn't realize people were losing massive amounts of money. They wouldn't know why Frank was able to see the future.The information dissymmetry would prevent them from seeing the truth.But would they really care at that point?Here is Frank, a mysterious figure claiming and proving he can predict the stock market, time after time.They're lapping up his newsletter the minute it gets sent out. And making stock adjustments the moment after.Month after month, they do this and only get more confident, wealthier, and happier.Until they don't. When one day they receive a wrong prediction.""How can this be?""And they never heard from Frank again.Frank was a mysterious god.All those months while people were dropping off like flies, Frank was smiling. He was making a considerable amount of money from the subscriptions.Frank's most accurate prediction was the most important one - people are greedy.Thousands of people invested in a mysterious digital newsletter with the name Frank attached at the end. They didn't need to know why or how the email was making these foretellings.All they could see was green.Until the day they only saw red.As for that last lucky member of Frank's newsletter - the one in 10,000,000 - he was probably just as happy as Frank.Twenty-four straight months of accurate predictions in the stock market can bring a smile to the most miserable among us.But then again, so can playing the lottery. It also has a one in 10,000,000 chance.Be careful who you believe in this world. A Frank could be just around the corner.And frankly, you wouldn't know it if he was.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2812/1*00_qpK9E9MI_KEqi9xmVMw.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/a-scientifically-proven-method-for-predicting-the-future-f5564f8d31eb,marketing,4dc537e5a79c2da998f6bce02c80eb3c9beee59d6cc22cbfb75e3581

Parameter,"Arjun tapped away at his keyboard, changing a few model parameters, and started the simulation. He was testing out a new powertrain configuration, the result of months of research. The electric vehicle startup he had joined a year ago had ambitious goals, but he liked his work and the general company culture. He was surrounded by people smarter than him, and learnt a lot every day.He waited for a minute and glanced at his watch - 5.56 pm. He had dinner plans soon, and it would take a while to get there in Bangalore traffic so he'd need to wrap up. He shut down his PC, grabbed his bag and waved goodbye to his teammates with a quick ""Happy weekend!"" before heading to the elevators.He was looking forward to today. He and some friends from university had set up a new weekly tradition - dinner every Friday night, taking turns to choose the location every week. Today it was his turn, and he had chosen a new Nepalese restaurant that just opened in Indiranagar, but the real treat was what would come after - a famous dessert spot that he'd been dying to go since he moved to the city. He got out of the elevators and waved bye to the doorman before heading to where his bike was parked.A few seconds later, at exactly the moment his watch ticked to 6 pm, the equilibrium of the world shifted.Arjun nearly tripped and fell, and stopped in his tracks to regain his balance. He felt... weird. Sluggish, almost imperceptibly heavier in some way, like he was holding a pair of dumbbells. He shook his head but the sensation remained. He didn't understand what exactly had just happened. Was it just his imagination?Then his focus returned to his surroundings, and he noticed that a number of people around him had fallen down. Those who hadn't had a dazed expression on their face - probably the same one he had on his own face a second ago. He helped a couple of people up, but everyone just seemed confused.That's when he heard it, a sound he would never forget. A loud creaking back the way he had come from. He spun around and gaped, unable to believe his eyes. The building that housed his startup and a number of other companies, all 25 stories of it, was wobbling. He heard panicked shouts but he couldn't look away. The building shook for a few more seconds and then it happened. It started to collapse.The shouts turned into screams and people started running away. He snapped out of it and joined them, adrenaline propelling him despite the new sensation of heaviness, as the deafening sounds of a collapsing building continued behind him. Once he had made it to the entrance of the complex, he finally stopped running and turned around. He could barely see anything, a huge dust cloud obscuring his vision and forcing him to shut his eyes. About a minute later, it cleared enough for him to open his eyes again.The space where his office building had just been was completely empty, with only a pile of rubble and the remnants of the dust cloud indicating that it had ever been there. He stared in disbelief, not comprehending what had just happened. Most of his teammates had still been inside. The adrenaline started to wear off and the shock and nausea hit, making him feel faint. He leaned against the gate to support himself.He had to get away from here. He stood up and started walking back to his home, still in a daze. How could this be happening? He felt like he was stuck in a nightmare. He paid no attention to his surroundings, his mind shutting down to avoid thinking about what had just happened. If he had been paying attention, he would have seen chaos on the street. Vehicles stopped in the middle of the road, people collapsed on the ground, and more dust clouds like the one he had just witnessed off in the distance.After he had walked for about ten minutes, his phone rang, snapping him out of his reverie. It was his parents.""Hello?"", he said.""Oh you're okay, thank God!"", exclaimed the voice of his mother on the other end of the phone.""Yes Ma, I'm fine, but my office.... The entire building collapsed."", he said, barely able to believe the words that were coming out of his mouth. ""My whole team, the company..."".""Your office building collapsed?! Are you okay, Arjun?"", his mother asked, her voice full of concern.""Yes, I'm okay, I'm walking home now."" And then it dawned on him. It had only been about ten minutes, and his parents lived in Mumbai. How had they found out about something happening in Bangalore so soon? Had the news spread that quickly?""How did you even know that something happened here?""""Haven't you seen the news? It's happening everywhere. Your father and I were at home when the house suddenly started shaking! It settled down quickly, and we thought it was an earthquake, but the news says it's been happening all over the world. Shaking, buildings collapsing. And your father and I have been feeling strange since then, almost like we're...""""Heavier?""""Yes, exactly! Do you feel it too?""Yes, I think so..."". Then he broke into a cold sweat. ""Wait, all over the world? Have you talked to Didi?""His mother's voice wavered. ""Not yet, your father is trying to get her on the line now but we aren't able to reach her phone"".A wave of dread overcame him. ""Okay, be careful! Don't leave the house until we know more, and be prepared for more earthquakes. I'll also try to call Didi.""""Okay Arjun, you be careful too! Message me when you reach home""""Yes Ma"".He hung up, and immediately tried to call his sister. She had moved to New York for work a little over two years ago, but she was still one of the closest people in his life. He talked to her every other day and they told each other everything about their lives. If something had happened to her...The call didn't go through. He tried again a few more times but couldn't get through to her.He quickly looked up news about New York. It didn't look good. Every picture he saw was one collapsed skyscraper after another. He tried to call his sister one more time, and when it failed again the feeling of dread intensified.He continued looking up the news while he walked home. He could barely believe what was happening. Every major city in the world had been hit simultaneously. Mumbai, Beijing, Seoul, San Francisco, London, Paris, Tokyo, Sao Paolo, Moscow, Johannesburg - the list was endless. The exact thing he had witnessed before his very eyes was happening all over the world. No one understood what was happening, and the governments of the world were yet to make a statement about the global calamity.He looked up to see his house in front of him. He had made it back. His eyes snapped back to his phone as it started to ring, showing the one caller he was desperately hoping to see - ""Didi'.He picked up immediately. ""Hello? Asha?""""Arjun! I'm so happy to hear your voice! Are you okay?""""Yes Didi I'm fine. What happened to you? Ma and Pappa said they couldn't reach you.""""I was taking the subway into Manhattan when the train stopped in the middle of the tunnel! It took a while for them to rescue us and there was no cell signal inside. I'm heading back home now though.""""How is everything there? The pictures I was looking at didn't look good.""""It's not great here, but from what I heard, Brooklyn is still doing way better than Manhattan. A few of the subway tunnels in the city collapsed too! I think I'm lucky I didn't leave for work ten minutes earlier...""""Yeah, I'm just glad you're okay.""They talked a little longer until Asha reached home as well, and then they hung up after promising to each other that they would be careful, and would keep each other updated if anything happened.Arjun then went up to the house. The family that owned the house lived on the ground floor, and he lived in the 2 bedroom flat on the first floor with a friend from university. The family wasn't home at the moment, having left to visit relatives in Hyderabad a few days earlier. He hoped they were okay.He climbed up the stairs to his apartment. Everything looked all right from the outside. He opened the door and switched on the light. There were a few books strewn on the ground, probably from the shaking earlier, but it looked mostly all right.""Sai?"", he called out. There was no response. His roommate wasn't home yet.He took a moment to reply to all the concerned messages on his phone from friends and relatives asking if he was okay, and sent out a few of his own. He then turned on the TV and flipped it to the news, and put the displaced books back on their shelves. In half an hour, he heard a lot of raised voices and confused opinions, but no one seemed to have any more idea about what was going on than he did.He went back to his phone and opened WhatsApp. World governments and the media may not have any idea what was happening, but his WhatsApp groups were already ripe with theories and speculation.""This is a COSMIC EVENT that happens once every TEN MILLION YEARS. The alignment of the sun and the moon make all matter on earth BRITTLE for 24 hours! Avoid all large buildings and stay outdoors when possible. Please share this with friends and family and stay safe during this dangerous time!""Normally Arjun paid no attention to forwarded messages like this, but considering the sheer scale of global events over the last hour, who could say what the real explanation was?He heard the sound of the door opening. ""Sai?""""Arjun! Are you okay? Have you seen what's happening out there?""Yeah I'm okay, but I was barely out of my office building when it completely collapsed! I just made it back home a little while ago.""""Your office collapsed?! Wow, I'm glad you made it out okay!""""What happened to you? Did you have trouble getting back home?""""I was on a bus on the way back from work when the buildings started collapsing. The street was absolutely chaotic, people panicking and crashing into each other. The bus driver rammed into the median! I had to get out and walk back home. I've never seen anything like it! It's crazy!""""Yeah, I still can't believe it...""They lapsed into silence for a minute. On a whim, Arjun asked ""Sai? This may sound a little weird, but have you been feeling a little strange? Like you're... heavier?""Sai looked at him in shock. ""How did you know that? Have you been feeling it too? I thought it was just my imagination!""""Yeah, I've been feeling the same way. My mom mentioned it too. I wonder if...""He almost felt foolish doing it, but got up and walked over the weighing scale they had in their bathroom. As he stood on it, the display lit up. ""70 kg"".He stared in surprise. He had happened to measure his weight at the gym just a few hours earlier. He had been around 68.5 kg at the time. How had he gained 1.5 kg in 4 hours?Sai measured himself, and also noticed a surprising increase in his weight since the last time he had measured it.Now even more confused than before, Arjun and Sai went back to the couch, spending the rest of the evening watching the news unfold. The government was setting up temporary relief shelters to house all the people displaced by the disaster. There was one not too far from their house too. Over the hours, the TV stations brought on everyone from an environmental scientist to an ex-military general to give their opinions on the crisis. But while the theories got wilder and wilder, no one could say for sure what was happening. No one seemed to bring up the apparent weight increase though. It wasn't clear if no one else had noticed it, or whether they were too skeptical to bring up the topic on the air.After a few hours, they decided that they needed to get some sleep and went back to their rooms. After checking on his family again, Arjun settled in for the night, his mind still racing from the events of the day. What could possibly be happening? What could explain something this catastrophic and... weird?It took him over an hour to fall asleep, and his sleep was riddled with nightmares. He found himself back at his desk at work. He looked up to see his family on the other side of the floor. He stood up and started walking towards them, but the whole floor seemed to lengthen so that the distance between them stayed the same. He started running but that didn't help either. He became more and more desperate, and as he reached out a hand, he felt the earth start to shake. The building began to crumble around him...He jolted awake, drenched in a cold sweat. A nightmare, just a nightmare. But wait. It was barely noticeable, but he could still feel mild tremors. He ran out of his room and barged into Sai's room, yelling ""Wake up!"".Sai snapped up out of bed, his eyes still half-closed from sleep. ""What's going on?"", he mumbled.""Do you feel that? The shaking?""""What are you talking about dude? I don't feel anyth-"". Then Sai abruptly stopped talking as the shaking seemed to intensify slightly.""Let's get out of the house, quick!"".There was no time to debate it. They both ran outside, still in their pyjamas and slippers and bolted down the stairs and onto the street. Just as they got there, the shaking intensified to the point that it was unmistakable.It kept growing in intensity, until they could no longer stand and had to drop to the ground. Arjun closed his eyes. It felt like his brain was vibrating in his skull. A tremendous crashing sound came from right ahead of them. They watched in despair as the roof of the house came crashing down. The same thing was happening to most houses on their street.. Telephone poles and street lamps crashed to the ground around them, some narrowly missing them. They heard the panicked shouts of other people who had run out onto the street.After another minute or so, the shaking came to a stop. They gradually stood up and looked around in disbelief. Their street was in shambles. The buildings were crumbling, poles and wires strewn across the ground, people on the road in a state of shock. The last time Bangalore had suffered a large earthquake was in 2001. This was one of the strongest earthquakes in the city's history.Arjun and Sai sat on the ground, slowly recovering from what they had just experienced. They didn't have anything on them except for their phones, and they obviously couldn't go back into their apartment. After talking about it for a bit, they decided to walk to the government shelter nearby. It was only about ten minutes away.On the way, Arjun saw on his phone that the disasters were intensifying around the world. Earthquakes everywhere, and coastal cities being hit the hardest with tidal waves. He tried to call his family, but he couldn't get through to any of them. Apparently cell towers were being knocked out everywhere, and cellular connectivity was taking a hit. He was lucky to still be able to use mobile data to read the news.They made it to the shelter soon enough. It was a large abandoned warehouse. It was sturdy however, and though parts of it had caved in from the earthquake, it was mostly intact. Inside, there were blankets laid out all across the floor, but the earthquake had woken everyone up. People were clustered in little groups, not saying much, apparently still in a state of shock at what was happening to them. Everyone's meagre belongings were strewn across the floor of the warehouse in a jumbled mess.Arjun and Sai settled into a corner and sat on the floor, not saying anything. It wasn't comfortable, but exhaustion overtook Arjun and he dozed off, sleeping fitfully. He woke up a few hours later, and Sai told him that they would be handing out breakfast in an hour.Arjun went back to his phone. All of the news was pointing to the same thing - an announcement made by ISRO about ten minutes ago. ""Have you seen this yet?"", he asked Sai.""No, my phone died a little while ago"", he replied.They sat together to look at the video. The ISRO chairperson stood at a podium in front of a room full of reporters.""We have spent the last 12 hours working tirelessly to understand what has caused the disasters around the world. The collapsed buildings, earthquakes, tidal waves. Some of you may have also noticed feeling heavier. All of these occurrences have the same cause - the Earth's gravity has increased"".Arjun and Sai gaped at the little screen.""But the issue is even more fundamental than that. It's not just the Earth's gravity. At exactly 6pm IST last evening, the universal gravitational constant appears to have increased by precisely 2%. The Earth's core and crust are now adjusting to this change, causing massive tectonic shifts and earthquakes around the world. The moon's orbit around the Earth has started to tighten, increasing tidal forces. This along with the earthquakes has caused the tidal waves wreaking havoc to our coasts""""The repercussions of this are more far-reaching than just on Earth. If this change continues, the equilibrium of the cosmos itself will shift. The Earth's orbit around the sun will change, along with all of the planets in our solar system. It's hard to predict exactly what the universe will look like after it has stabilized from this change.""""We will continue to investigate this shift, and will provide a more comprehensive analysis soon. For now, all we can advise is that you stay inland, and remain outdoors and avoid large buildings as far as possible. Keep your loved ones close. Thank you.""Arjun and Sai looked at each other, eyes wide and disbelieving. Arjun inadvertently looked upwards. He had never been very religious, but... A change like this? And the precise numbers. Exactly 2%, at exactly 6pm...Panicked shouts started from around the warehouse as the ground started to tremor again. Arjun closed his eyes, and for the first time in a long time, he prayed.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Kass let it keep going for another week, and then shut it down. He took down a couple of notes from this run:""Time until collapse of human civilization: 6 daysCasualties within first 24 hours: 217 million""He checked the time - 11.37pm. He had just about enough time for one more run. He set the gravitational constant perturbation parameter even higher this time - 5%. He kicked it off and went back to his assignment.Kass sighed. He had signed up for the ""History of Computing"" course because he had heard that it was interesting (and it was supposed to be an easy A). The professor had decided to increase the workload this semester though, and he'd spent way more time on the course than he had expected. Thankfully this was the last assignment.They had to choose a specific sub-field within computing and write a detailed history of it. Computing itself was broad enough that he could choose basically any topic he was interested in, so he decided on one that he had wanted to learn about for a while: high-resolution simulations, or HRS.Simulations, broadly, had been around for as long as computers had existed. They were typically used to model specific systems however. The first HRS had been run by the ENIAC 7 supercomputer 22 years ago to simulate the whole planet. It had broad models for the ecosystem and environment, but it modelled 10 billion humans individually.It became a hot field after the first supercomputer simulation, generating plenty of academic interest and military funding. The field progressed rapidly, with the resolution increasing to model every living being on the planet, and the scope broadening to include the entire solar system. Computing power had continued to grow exponentially under Moore's law for long enough to bring high-resolution simulations to personal computers 10 years ago.It was around then that interest in the field started to decline. The simulations were a stunning technical achievement, but it became increasingly clear that they had no real practical value and funding dried up. Academic pursuit continued at a slow pace for a few years until the human modeling element became precise enough for ethical questions to start cropping up. At what point did the humans in the simulation stop being just pieces of code and start being actual beings with feelings and rights? Finally, a study hinting that the human models in HRS had achieved sentience ended up being the final nail in the coffin for the field. It was never proved definitively, and so it was still legal to run a HRS. It was, however, looked down on by most people, and academic interest and funding turned to more relevant (and less controversial) problems.The field may no longer be relevant, but Kass found it fascinating that there was a complete solar system running on his computer at this very moment. To complement the history, he had decided to run a few simulations varying some universal physical parameters to see their impact on human society. Broadly speaking, he wanted to show human civilization's dependence on these parameters. However, this was a widely accepted fact and not particularly novel. In all honesty he just wanted an excuse to try running a few simulations.He ended the last 5% perturbation simulation a little earlier than the previous one, and entered the details in his assignment:""Time until collapse of human civilization: 3 daysCasualties within first 24 hours: 1.42 billion""He wrote a quick conclusion and submitted the assignment with just a couple of minutes to spare. As soon as it became midnight, the auto-grader evaluated his assignment and gave him comprehensive feedback. He scored well on the history itself, but he actually ended up being docked a few points for running the simulations when it was generally discouraged. He received a B- overall. He sighed again. Eh well, he'd take it.",https://miro.medium.com/max/13746/0*irdmfBVsrLp318TF,https://deepakdilipkumar.medium.com/parameter-6da2dbc4d560,fiction,4fe6145eeebbfbabb50e81a6ecc5552b641304ac4a5f067260017c80
The Magic City,,,https://medium.com/curious/the-magic-city-52d1a9bb50a6,travel,5bc0fdc2b4370020b1e19b7eca790109c001e4070d129c5485c63a01
Welcome to Bellingham!,"The City of Subdued Excitement.Bellingham, Washington is 85 miles north of Seattle, Washington, and 50 miles south of Vancouver, British Columbia. I had lived in Seattle when I was younger, and moved here after graduate school.I moved here for urban culture, thinking I'd bop down to Seattle to see friends or up to Vancouver for shows and restaurants.Then life happened, and I got busy. And I stayed in Bellingham for violence, dogs, and love.Bellingham's official motto is ""A Refreshing Change,"" but that official saying is used so seldom that I'd literally never heard it until I started writing this. Instead, what I hear, and what I see on t-shirts, bumper stickers, and the wall outside Lone Wolf Antiques (now closed) near the old City Hall Building is ""Ye Old City Of Subdued Excitement.""Bellingham is a city between, and much of what defines it is that position between. Bellingham centers on Bellingham Bay. Bellingham Bay is itself between, this time between the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. This means you can go north by water from Bellingham, via Victoria San Juan Cruises, to Victoria, on Vancouver Island. Or you can go further, and reach the Pacific itself. So, to the west/northwest, saltwater.To the east? The substantial freshwater lake of Lake Whatcom, often full of pleasure boats, kayakers, stand-up paddleboarders, moist pit bulls, and the occasional otter.Its waters feed one of Bellingham's gems, Whatcom Falls Park.When the rains have been heavy, like they have been this week, you can hear the falls from across the 240 acre park. In the summer, when it is dry, you may have to walk across the old stone WPA bridge to really hear them trickling.Miles of trails wind through the park, and an amazing network of trails spiderweb through Bellingham. You can walk or bike from the bay through the woods to most neighborhoods, and beyond the town up into the hills and mountains beyond. You won't be alone. Besides your fellow Bellinghamsters, you'll see deer, coyotes, and more menacing things. My dog tried to chase a cat under a bush. I stopped him when I realized it was a bobcat. Bear scat has been found less than half a mile from my house, and there's an owl who lives across the street.Bellingham has a good state university (Western Washington University) and a community college, and a technical college, but most people move hear for the feel and the activities. We've got tons of microbreweries, some good local restaurants, a moderate arts scene, and lots to do.I mentioned staying in Bellingham in part for the violence. I was in Boulevard Park, a city park on the water, situated between downtown Bellingham and Fairhaven, a cool older neighborhood to the south. (In the 19th century, Bellingham was originally four distinct settlements, Whatcom, Sehome, Fairhaven, and Bellingham. These names still persist, as well as other named neighborhoods.) It was a summer evening, and I was enjoying looking out at the waves, until I saw people trying to hit each other with sticks. It was a small but dedicated group practicing bojutsu, a Japanese art of staff fighting. I was hooked for about 10 years, but if sticks aren't your thing, you can find truth fencing, aikido, tai chi, BBJ, MMA, tae kwon do, and others. I've taken tai chi classes as well as self-defense classes.And if you're less violent, well, there's a range of movement and entertainment arts, too. You can study papercrafting, yoga, gymnastics, sacred dance, visit the climbing gym, and join the circus, or at least, the circus guild.For almost 50 years the Ski to Sea race has been run. It's a team multi-sport race that starts at Mount Baker - a local ski attraction - and ends in Fairhaven. Team members ski, bike, kayak, and run, and do other things to cover 93 miles in seven legs.And while a lot of adults take advantage of those offerings, one thing that's true - and important - about Bellingham is that it's great for both kids and dogs. Those miles and miles of trails? Not only will you find people walking dogs on them, there are companies who will pick your dogs up and take them for a trail romp while you're at work. I've taken part in Dog Days of Summer, as well as a pit bull parade around Lake Padden. There are dog off leash areas in many parks, and my dog knows hundreds of dogs by name, and thousands by smell.And if Bellingham is good for dogs, it is even better for kids. Again, everyone uses the parks and trails, and so do the kids, but in the summer, two of the parks are sprinkler parks, full of wet, squealing kids. Some of the elementary schools offer extracurricular activities that sound like something you'd find at a small liberal acts college, like mountain bike clubs. The schools have bike rodeos, and the community has safety fairs where kids get to climb into fire engines, Coast Guard boats, and helicopters. There's a bakery where kindergarten classes tour regularly, a local ice creamery where they do the same, and things like a kids building club hosted by the quite fine public library.If I make Bellingham sound idyllic, it isn't. The fact that Bellingham is a patchwork city formed by four towns growing together means that streets often stop and start. I can't tell you how many times I got lost when I first moved here. I'd be on a road, and it would just merge or end or change names, and I'd be like oh crap, here I am again, or rather, here I'm not.The fact that Bellingham is up the road from Seattle means we continually get people moving up here from Seattle, as well as the general influx from elsewhere. The result is a ferocious housing market that isn't matched by the job market. Median house price in Bellingham itself in the last quarter of 2020? A cool $550,000.Everything you've heard about how much it rains in Washington? Sometimes that's all true. It's been raining round the clock for days.Those cool animals I mentioned? They are very cool, but it also means sometimes cats disappear and coyotes are happy.And Mount Baker, the popular ski destination I mentioned earlier? That's an active volcano, one of several in the state. So come, visit, and then go home. Shoo!Leave me here, with my aging pit bull, my violent hobbies, and those I love. Leave me in my home, the city of subdued excitement.Well, okay. You can come. But be nice.I'd like to thank my dad (Garth Beatty) for the pictures in this story.Award-winning poet and story writer (https://beattytales.com/), PhD in English, assistant pit bull, keppa to rockstars.

Time Blocking and 6 Simple Ways to Use It to Increase Productivity,"Setting a schedule to go about your day is a not so secret technique to make sure you get everything done. The problem with schedules arises when you write down way too many things you need to get done. Looking at all of these tasks is definitely overwhelming and results in not getting anything done.A to-do list has no boundaries, no priorities, and no designated times for the tasks you're trying to accomplish.Time blocking is the practice of scheduling periods throughout your day to finish different tasks. Instead of sitting down at your desk trying to respond to emails, logging into Facebook, and drinking your coffee, your time block 8:00 AM-9:00 AM for strictly checking emails.This helps because you're less likely to get distracted by impending tasks and you're able to cross off something on your to-do list right away.Distractions are a part of our daily life and often hard to ignore. Cutting out distractions can be difficult because more often than not, the things we distract ourselves with are more fun than what we're currently doing.By time blocking your day, you can actually give yourself time during the day to indulge in those distractions. Time blocking your workday can be exhausting but having something to look forward to like answering messages or playing games can be the motivation you need. Time blocking gives you permission to engage in the distractions but only after you've finished your more pressing tasks.If distractions are still a big issue, try time blocking only every half hour. 30 minutes of work rewarded with 30 minutes of phone time is a sweet deal. In a perfect world, you would begin to time block more than 30 minutes of work to increase productivity because you know that you're phone's not going anywhere, plus, you've already squeezed it in your schedule to text back.Priorities vary every day. On Mondays, you may be bombarded with emails while Tuesdays are quiet. Having a good idea of how your weeks typically play out is a good way to start. Knowing what priorities you should emphasize on each day of the week is an amazing way to begin your time blocking habit.By acknowledging your priorities, you'll know how much time to assign to each task, especially if those tasks have a deadline. It may be a good idea to avoid looking at emails on a certain day when you know you have something else due.Besides work, feel free to prioritize breaks. They will make you more efficient overall.I've gone through waves in my life where I'm a morning person. I would be at my best at 7 AM and I would be ready to tackle anything that came my way. Similarly, I've found that the mornings are just too exhausting and I begin to work by best after 2 PM.If your lifestyle allows it, find times throughout the day that work for you. If you're needed at an office and have a 9-5, try playing around with different times to do things. Maybe you know you're more lethargic after lunch so try for a late afternoon lunch and focus on your heavier tasks in the morning.This one may sound silly but you should also time block your breaks. Having an extensive list of things to do can be mentally draining. Working towards a goal, in this case, a break is a mental trick. Your brain knows that there is a break coming so it doesn't get burnt out.During your time blocked break, don't limit yourself to just one thing. Use your break in a way you'll know that it will make you more effective after it's done. If you know you cant bounce back from an afternoon nap, try playing a video game instead. Your brain will still be active but in a more relaxing way.Time blocking is not meant to be rigorous or stressful. If you find yourself struggling to keep up with the predetermined schedule you made for yourself, it may be time to change your time blocking habits.Similarly, it's not necessary to time block ""sleep from 10 PM-7 AM"". Tight schedules with no flexibility can be overwhelming and feeling like you didn't accomplish a certain goal can be taxing to your mental health.Feel free to set boundaries while also being flexible. You know yourself best and the ideal way to start new habits is to ease into them.This technique is more popular when studying. It has been proven that color can affect someone's memory and the way they react to things. Color-coding your tasks is a simple way to visualize how much you actually have to do and how long you have to do it.Different colors can have different functions and meanings. You don't have to use the full rainbow. Start off with 3-5 colors and assign each one to breaks, work, eating, etc...There's no harm in lightening how long you think a certain task will take. This will give you the flexibility you need to begin time blocking while also giving yourself boundaries. If there's a bathroom emergency during one of your time blocks, you're not going to ignore it just to stay on schedule.Be sensible and realize that it's not realistic to plan things to the minute. Extend the length of your tasks and look at time blocking as an aid to your day to day life, not a life or death schedule.Obviously, this practice can be seen as very restrictive. If you don't suffer from chronic procrastination, this may not be the thing for you.Time blocking is what you make it and at the end of the day, no one will force you as much as you force yourself.Time blocking can be wise if you use it appropriately and if you ease into it. Give it a chance and ease your way into it for better results.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*iF4WV6-a3avEigkj,https://medium.com/illumination/time-blocking-and-6-simple-ways-to-use-it-to-increase-productivity-f436fd1ca5d0,productivity,5e3ff163b4e7bfad1c5156e51cc58f3afc08cfd56c4adf581ce5ff5a
Make Content That People Want To Share Through Cultural Cartography,"Your job, whatever it is - writer, artist, gizmo maker - is to make content that people want to share. You want to create something that's so attention-grabbing and sensually appealing that people will engage with it and then get their friends and followers to engage with it.Malcolm Gladwell has already explored the tipping point of when something goes viral, and a lot of that has to do with how sticky something is. But what gets people to interact with it in the first place? What motivates people to give something their time and consideration?The answer is in something called Cultural Cartography.I'm going to appall you by mentioning a name: BuzzFeed. Whether you like to admit it or not, you can't deny their appeal. There are two types of people: those that admit to clicking on BuzzFeed videos and articles and those that lie about not clicking on BuzzFeed videos and articles.To give you an example, 104,000 people on Facebook shared this BuzzFeed video: 4 Mesmerizing Marbled Clay Projects. That same video has 17,000 comments. I would call that engagement!Publications had declined my linked-article above about Malcolm Gladwell because I mentioned a popular YouTube personality. The editors gave me specific feedback about not using that YouTuber's name. But, that YouTuber has over 36 million views on a video he posted on Dec 19, 2020.Despite making your skin crawl (probably out of jealousy, envy, or confusion, or as an editor puts it ""a desire to yell into the void 'there are more than 5 people in the world to use as examples!!! Also they are all white guys!!!""'), you can learn something from these - whether you like it or not - successful influencers. They know how to make viral content, and we can learn something by paying attention.Three years ago, BuzzFeed's Publisher Dao Nguyen gave a TED talk entitled ""What makes something go viral?"" To illustrate her point, Nguyen gave the example of a prank they played on a co-worker, where they had turned his office into an area for goats, including hay, feed, and live goats.They streamed the setup on Facebook Live, where online viewers could watch in anticipation (there's a keyword for viral content) of the co-worker walking into his office to find it full of goats. They ended up with 90,000 people watching a 30-minute-long video in real-time.How did they get thousands of people to tune-in at the same time to watch a video about goats? Nguyen's answer is ""Cultural Cartography,"" a mapping of what influences culture. This map illustrates content that engages people and makes them want to share that same content.The map of viral, audience-engaging content spreads out over five main areas: humor, identity, shared connection, participation, and emotion.Humor engages and excites people by making them smile. A good joke or a novel theme can spread fast. People love to laugh and they love to make other people laugh.Example: remember Chewbacca mom? 37-year-old Texas mother Candace Payne had our sides splitting with her infectious laughter. The whole world wanted to buy a Chewbacca mask. Kohl's rewarded Payne with $2,500 of gift cards and piles of Star Wars toys and Kohl's points.This content is something people can personally identify with. Human beings are pretty much the same and carry the same pattern of concerns: aging, dieting, being wanted, having sex, etc. A relatable piece becomes a viral piece.Example: Nathan Apodaca. It's COVID, his house has no electricity, his truck breaks down, and he says, ""F*ck it, I'm going to skateboard down a highway and drink my Ocean Spray while jamming to Fleetwood mac."" This maneuver turned into commercials for both Ocean Spray and TikTok.Here are pieces that form the human bond. These pieces of content include things that make you say ""this is us"" or ""you are not alone"" or even ""WTF?"". It engages you and makes you feel like participating. You want to do something, even if that something is sharing the content.Example: Here's one that's less than 24-hours old, as of this writing. It is about TikTok user Katie Schieffer, who couldn't afford to buy her son insulin. So far, a share on Twitter has 89,000 likes, 22,700 retweets, and 1,600 comments. See if it makes you feel:This content doesn't have to apply specifically to the individual audience member, but it does have to help them learn something or live vicariously through it.Example: Another YouTuber (who I won't name, but you probably know) is famous for building mini-bombs of glitter that capture porch pirates unaware. The YouTuber uploads one video a month and usually gets 36 million views per video. I don't plan on making a glitter bomb, but I feel like I'm learning something. I watch and share the videos because I feel like we are all doing something together.There are so many emotions that connect with people. There is more than just happiness, sadness, or anger. Powerful emotions include those that people empathize with, make them feel good, or make them curious.Example: How about I get a few songs stuck in your head? Ed Sheeran's ""Shape of You"" video has 5.14 million views on YouTube. Mark Ronson & Bruno Mars's ""Uptown Funk"" has 4.06 million views. Another selection, not too far away is Katy Perry's ""Roar"" with 3.25 million views. Each song makes you feel something.In each example above: humor, identity, shared connection, participation, and emotion, the audience engages by either saying, ""I need this"" or ""you need this."" They want it. They want to share it. Through Cultural Cartography, attention is grabbed, held, and shared.As I said above, your job is to make content that people want to share, no matter what your job is. Take, for example, the board game makers Stonemaier Games. They've had massive success in Kickstarter, raising funds to make their games. In 2019, their game Wingspan sold 44,000 copies in three months globally. It would have sold even more, but they didn't have enough copies available - Stonemaier had to issue an apology for being unable to keep up with demand.Stonemaier makes a specific reference to cultural cartography in their blog post about breaking the internet to build a community.Wingspan became one of the 20th best-ranked games on BoardGameGeek's list of 18,000 games. It also took home the prestigious 2019 Kennerspiel des Jahres, akin to the Oscars' best picture award.You don't have to sell your soul to make something go viral. If anything, it involves digging into yourself and finding something that will make a human connection.Look around at things that are trending or have multiple views, shares, and comments. In every case, it probably has one or more of these five things from Cultural Cartography in common: humor, identity, shared connection, participation, and emotion.Thanks for reading!

10 Hindrances That May Be Stopping You From Living Up to Your Full Potential,"I don't know you. But I do know that you're on a path. You may be stationary on the path. You may be walking or perhaps you're sprinting. You may even be running in the opposite direction. In any case, we're all on our individual paths.And we all have this inner desire to stay on the path and get to where we want to go. However, it's not as simple as just moving. There are several obstacles on the path which need to be overcome.In his book Mastery, George Leonard shares some of these obstacles that we may encounter on our journey. Of course, we may not be able to overcome all of them. However, it's good to know they're there so we can learn to conquer them when they do show up.What most of us fail to realise is that the journey to becoming the best at anything doesn't exist in a vacuum. Instead, we have to dig up our way through a landscape of lively obligations. It'd be really convenient if you can simply focus on your craft and forget about everything else; however, that's just not the way it is.Life consists of several areas. You have work, relationship, health, spirituality, finance, etc. And these areas are interdependent. For instance - if you want to become the best writer on the face of this planet, yet you don't take care of your relationships, you will lack the support system needed to get to the point of greatness. Or if you need to work insanely hard for a few months to get your startup off the ground, yet your health sucks, you simply won't have the energy to do so.You cannot overcome the nature of life completely. However, the point is when you're facing resistance in achieving your goals, try to examine and take care of the rest of your life. As they say, ""The chain is only as strong as its weakest point."" Don't let other areas of your life be a hindrance to your goals. Instead, work on them so they support you in your path to greatness.Perhaps the deadliest enemy to our path to greatness can be our obsessive desire for the destination itself. Because, when we get overly attached to results, we want to witness quick growth. Due to our desire for instant gratification, we start working excessively. We start looking for shortcuts.And all of this pays off, but only for a while. We get quick results initially. But soon, our excessive efforts lead to disappointment and burnout as we don't get the results we desired as fast as we want them.It's fine to have ambitious goals but we need to remember that on a day-to-day basis, growth is slow, almost invisible to the short-termed-eye. Hence, stick to the path. Delay gratification. As George says - ""When you're climbing a mountain, be aware of the peak, but keep your eyes on the path. And when you reach the top, as the Zen saying goes, keep on climbing.""There are two ways you can get to your destination. First- you try to find the path yourself. Second- you take the help of someone else - a teacher. The second option is a much quicker and better way to walk the path. However, it's important to recognize a good teacher in the first place.There's a lot of inexperienced noise on the internet trying to teach people how to do something when they don't know how to do it themselves. If we listen to such people, we'll surely be walking the wrong path, and end up on the wrong destination.First of all, according to George Leonard, instruction is the first key to mastery. So don't skip it. You don't have to figure it out yourself. Take the help of a teacher. Learn through courses, books, youtube and what have you.Second - make sure you find a good teacher. Poor instruction will give you poor results. Hence, find a teacher who knows what they're talking about. Here are a few tips from George to find a good teacher -Competition and comparison have gotten a bad name. However, mild competition can be healthy and in fact, a necessary source of inspiration. If you don't look around once in a while to see what's possible, how will you even begin to walk the path of doing the impossible?On the other hand, overcompetitiveness can make you miserable. The mindset of ""Winning isn't everything, it is the only thing"" is sure to take a toll on your mental health. Because no matter what, sometimes you gotta loose. That's an unavoidable part of the journey.In short, find the balance. Be competitive, but not to the point that it messes with your mental health. A simple way to find the balance is to try to sublimate envy into inspiration. Both of them are derived from comparison. However, envy is unhealthy, and inspiration is healthy. Hence, whenever you feel envious, try to be inspired instead.We're animals and we're hardwired to save energy for emergencies. That is why it's hard to spend energy when it's not a question of survival. In fact, from an evolutionary and a mere goal of 'survival' laziness is the best tool you possess.However, humanity has outpaced evolution to the point that survival is not much of a concern anymore. Thrival is. We all want to live extraordinary lives. And forgive me for stating the obvious, but, inaction and laziness are truly the enemies of greatness.A simple way to overcome laziness is to - and Nike would back me on this - just do it. Besides that, I personally like to use two tools to overcome laziness effectively.Excessive use of external motivation can knock you off the path. Studies show that rewarding gold stars to students initially speed up their learning. However, this progress eventually fades way. Ergo, external motivation is not effective when it comes to producing lasting results.And god knows the journey to greatness is a long and arduous one. Which is why, if you're not internally motivated to stay on the path, rewards alone will never be enough to support the long journey.It's okay to be motivated by external incentives, however, only if there's a solid foundation of internal motivation. You've got to love what you do. As George says in his book - ""Perhaps we'll never know how far the path can go, how much a human being can truly achieve until we realize that the ultimate reward is not a gold medal but the path itself.""One of the reasons we may have decided to become the best at something is to look good. However, we fail to realise that getting to the point of looking good takes a lot of looking stupid. Many times, because we're afraid that we'll fail and that people will know, and hence, we don't even try.This excessive pride is called vanity. Vanity can restrict us from taking action. Since there's no action, there'll be no failure, but there'll also be no lessons. Suffice it to say, if we succumb ourselves to vanity, we can bid goodbye to the path to greatness.Michael Jordan once said, ""I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.""Think about it. Even at that level, Michel Jordan and other players like him have to fail and look stupid and that too in the sight of millions. Hence, it only makes sense that we should be willing to fail and look stupid in front of a few of our friends and colleagues.Think about it. The path to greatness at anything is already a tough one to bear. And yes, it takes a certain amount of seriousness to keep walking on it. However, when we begin to take our goals way too seriously, even minor setbacks and failures can hurt us deeply.We become ashamed of ourselves when we fail. We become overly critical of ourselves when we become lazy. And all of this seriousness leads to a vicious circle where our mental health is chopped into pieces.Laugh. They say laughter is the best medicine. There's scientific evidence that shows that laughter helps boost your mental well-being. Life is short, and not meant to be taken too seriously. In fact, with laughter and fun, the pressure of the difficult journey becomes bearable, and hence the journey becomes easier.George says - ""Consistency of practice is the mark of the master."" Quite obviously, inconsistency leads to loss of practice time and keeps you stuck. However, excessive inconsistency might even regress your growth and lead to the dissolution of the progress you had made earlier.Interestingly, consistency is actually easier than inconsistency if you follow some basic rules.Due to the hyper-connectedness of the world, we're often subjected to what perfect looks like. A budding artist sees the extraordinary paintings of Van Gogh in a museum. A high school basketball player can see the magic of...well, Magic Johnson on Youtube.We have examples of perfect shoved into our faces when in our journey, we are mediocre at best. This may lead to self-doubt. We may think if we'll never get to perfect, is there even a point at trying?Perfectionism can be paralysing. We often hold such a high picture to aim to that we're afraid of even starting. However, we fail to see that people who have reached those levels were just as mediocre as we are. They have years and years of hard work and failure before they got to perfect. Besides, as we discussed earlier, the journey is not about the destination but the journey itself. So focus on getting better, not perfect.Unlocking your highest potential is about avoiding what chips away at your potential.

How To Increase Your Sales Using These 5 Effective Strategies,"I've gained some valuable experience over the years, resulting in high payouts and consistent performance bonuses. The thing is, it doesn't take much to excel in a sales-related position. By applying these strategies, even the most mediocre salesperson has a chance of genuine success.People sell to people. When working in sales, you must focus on building a relationship with your customers. It's your job to identify what the client needs before they know they need it. To identify the needs of your customer, get to know them better. As a rule of thumb, I always ask at least three questions during our transaction: these questions should somehow relate to the customer.This is a great question, especially if you have kids, but even if you don't, knowing whether the customer's a parent or not can make a huge difference when personalizing the sale.Talking about something other than sales is a great idea because it takes pressure away from the sale. If you can't find a show to relate to, try recommending something good to watch. (Peaky Blinders on Netflix!)Knowing what your client does for work has multiple advantages. For one, you'll able to personalize the sale better. Above all else, however, people love to talk about themselves, specifically, what they do for their 9-5. Sometimes, you'll even discover that your client owns a business, which opens up a whole other world of opportunities.First impressions mean everything, especially in sales. If a customer has a poor first impression of you, it could take a while to earn their trust. As a rule of thumb, I aim to dress my best every day, whether I'm working or not. You don't need a fancy suit or an expensive dress to look nice. Start with the basics: take showers often, groom yourself, and make sure your clothes are clean and free of stains. To make a quality first impression, you must dress nice; however, you could adopt a few other strategies to increase your chances.It doesn't matter who I'm dealing with: my customers always leave happy, regardless of how they felt before entering my store. I've got regulars that'll stop by to buy something, though I'm 90% sure they're just having a bad day and needed someone to chat with. As a rule of thumb, you should always do something to make your customers feel important.If you can make somebody feel important, they'll want to be around you more, they'll trust you more, and - most important - they'll buy more from you.Most sales positions are commission-based, which means that you're in control of your money. The amount that you make and your level of success in the field are highly dependent upon whether you know your numbers. I make it a habit of mine to review my numbers daily, and I'll ask myself questions like; in what areas am I doing well this month? What needs improvement? How much do I need to sell by the end of the month to hit my quota? After asking myself these very crucial questions, I'll move on to design my game plan for the rest of the month.It's a well-known fact that salespeople like to talk. Yet, the most successful individuals understand that in sales, sometimes, the best thing to do is to shut up and let the customer decide. Don't draw out your pitch. Say what you need to say and let the customer decide the rest. If you followed the previous two steps - be personable and dress to impress - and you have a strong initial sales pitch, then it's likely that you've already done all that there is to do. Just don't forget to close the sale. After a successful sales pitch, I always end with, ""so if you're ready to move forward, I can get the process going. How does that sound?"" Unfortunately, I've seen hundreds of talented salespeople mess this part up by continuing to talk after closing. Silence is good. It means that your client's thinking - they didn't say no, that's what matters. They might ask a question or two, which's a good sign, so use that opportunity to fill in anything that you might've left out in the initial pitch, but besides that, just shut up.But if you take away anything from this post, let it be this:",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*G3RgmHzgaK-oqpOv3vQH3g.jpeg,https://medium.com/illumination/how-to-increase-your-sales-using-these-5-effective-strategies-ffeb81514ef8,marketing,5fddedae2ac2d3e9ed0c229da22d1f90f7e4e84bee0208dd07f29f30
4 Practical Tips for When You Move to a New Country,"I have lived in 4 countries: Portugal, France, the UK, and Hungary. Moving to a new country is one of the most exciting, rewarding experiences you can have in life. It pushes your boundaries, it forces you to grow, and it turns you into a much richer person.But, let's be honest, it can also be hard. Leaving behind your comfort, your home, your people, is something only the brave do. But even the brave ones can use a little help when making such a move. Here are my tips to ease the transition to a new life, coming from personal experience.In the 50s and 60s, thousands of Portuguese men and women crossed borders illegally, trying to reach France, where they heard life was much better. For some of them, life in the new country corresponded to their imagination. For others, the dream fell short.But we live in the 21st century, you can do much better than just having a vague idea of the place you are moving to.Go online and read about it. Type on Google ""moving to Berlin"", or wherever you're going, and you will find a gazillion pages with useful tips. Take a step further and join Facebook groups of expats in your destination city.Don't be afraid to interact and ask questions. I have received some messages from people moving to places where I lived, and I always answer their questions in detail. I know how important this is for them because I was in their shoes once. Most people will know this too, reach out to them.Renting is an entirely country-specific situation. Depending on where you move to, it might be a nightmare, or a dream come true.My sister lived in France, where she worked as a 3D artist, with a one-year contract. This is unacceptable to most landlords! They demand stable jobs and high incomes to even start thinking about letting someone near their property.In contrast, when I moved to Hungary I had no job, was about to start a course at a non-official school, and I managed to rent a nice apartment in the city center in a matter of days. All they required from me was my ID - no work contract, no bank statement, nothing.There are a few things to consider when renting a place in a new country:This will take time but it will transform your whole experience for the better. A place is about the life you live in it, and life is better with friends.When I lived in the UK, I overlooked the power of community. I focused on my relationship at the time and had very few friends outside that circle.But now, living in Budapest, I created my own circles. I have Portuguese friends for when I miss speaking my language. I have Hungarian friends who introduce me to the culture and help me learn Hungarian. And I have my expat friends, who share the feeling of being a foreigner in Hungary.One of the scariest feelings you can have in a foreign country is to think that, if you get sick, there is nobody to help you. Create strong relationships with some people, so you feel the constant support if you need it. It will make a world of difference.Even if you do all the necessary preparation, you still need to give yourself time to adjust to the new reality. In the first few months, you will feel overwhelmed with all the tasks you need to do. Take care of bureaucracy, fix things up in your new apartment, find a good shop nearby...Everything will take longer too. When I moved to Hungary, going to the supermarket was a tiring adventure. Many products were different from other countries where I had lived, the labels were written in languages I didn't speak, and the currency was new to me, so I had to do a mental calculation in my head for each item I wanted to buy.This is all part of the deal though. Be patient and try to look at it as a holiday. The feeling you have on a trip, where everything is new and exciting, is one of the things that make holidays memorable. Treat these first few months in the new life as a long holiday.Always be kind to yourself. Don't expect to feel at home immediately, don't get mad because you can't sort out everything alone, and don't push yourself when you get homesick. Everything will get better, sooner or later.Moving to a new country is something you should at least once in your lifetime.

How to Adapt to a New Culture,"I start this article by making a minor excuse: the title you see above is not 100% true. There are exceptions, subordinated to specific contexts, where expatriates become like a native. For example, in the French south-west, where some long-term Brits living among wineries abandoned their fish and chips and become more French than the locals, as the blog Bordeaux Expats reported:It is refreshing to see cases like this above, where immigrants adapt so flawlessly. However, two points make these exceptions.1st - The United Kingdom and France are neighbors with centuries of cultural, social, and economical entanglement. Therefore, the civilizational difference decreases thanks to mutual influences, and the expatriate adaptation is quicker.2nd - Even in the British-in-France context, there are plentiful examples of not-so-smooth adaptation, to the point of existing a mutual-help social network. The name of it is ""Survive France"".​Therefore, this advice is for anyone moving (or planning to) between countries not that similar. And if you arrived here in this article, congratulations: you already know how to go through the worst phases of your new life. The German firm Archer Relocation designed the Expat Adjustment Curve, where the first stages remind what I described in a previous article, but with a different end:​The fundamental difference here is the sixth phase. Whoever reaches the Integration overcame the culture shock (this article help you with it) and recovered to run the show in their new life. As much as achieving this stage of adaptation is a brilliant victory, there are different levels of it. We can break down the concept of integration into 4 different types.● Economic Integration - It is when foreigners work and generate wealth for themselves via their salaries and profits, and for their new country by paying taxes. They add their contribution both as supply, by their products, and demand, by their consumption. Skilled expats often achieve this type quickly, but for students or non-working spouses, it can take longer.● Social - When people mingle with the locals, adopt social codes of the new country and its etiquette. Although the personal efforts to achieve social integration are important, how fast you will achieve depends also on how friendly is the population. The portal Internations researched a similar subject and concluded that in places like Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, or Colombia, to create a social circle can be much easier than in Nordic countries or Saudi Arabia.● Cultural - This kind of integration is when people adopt the habits and culture of the new place. To reach a full cultural integration, it is indispensable to have a good understanding of the local language and go across all its components (music, literature, beliefs, and celebrations). Cultural integration can be even harder than social integration if your original country and the new one are from different civilizational foundations, for example, India and Eastern Europe.● Emotional - This is the last type of integration in the list for a reason: it is the hardest. I may take longer to explain emotional integration because it is essential for understanding this entire article. There is a word in my native language called Saudade. This term is almost untranslatable but fits very well in this description. We may define Saudade as the presence of absence, the yearning for something or someone that right now is unreachable, and whose absence creates a void in your inner self. It is not only ""missing"" and does not have a completely negative meaning because it brings sadness and joy together. It is, as deciphered by older generations, the love that remains. We can translate a partial emotional integration as loving your new country and shaping your personality by its influences. The fully integrated, however, will go beyond this and not feel any Saudade from his origins.If you are already living abroad for some time, you probably are thinking how far you are in those four different dimensions. The good news is that you don't need to achieve all of them. In Chile, I was very well-integrated economically, socially, and culturally. I didn't need to do much effort since they are close to Brazil in all those components. This similarity plays a big role. That is why in Poland, to reach the same level of assimilation from Chile, it took much longer. In Qatar, I achieved economic integration, but the social and cultural aspects were distant from my daily life.What about emotional integration? Even though I had part of my personality changed by every country that I lived in, my core is still the same, and it is Brazilian. Therefore, differently than the British mentioned in the initial paragraphs of this story, I am still not 100% emotionally integrated, and maybe I will never be. Maybe I will always feel Saudade of the southeastern plains of Brazil.​And this is ok.​It is almost the rule when you are a first-generation immigrant.In an article of Humanity in Action Denmark, I read two stories that exemplify it. One from Savas Coskun and the other from Sabeena Din, who moved, respectively, from Turkey and Pakistan to Denmark.To make the best efforts to integrate into a new country is not only good for you. If you plan or already have children, this will have an enormous positive impact on them. Descendants of first-generation, well-assimilated immigrants growing up in the company of local children will carry the advantage of youth years shaping them when compared to their parents. This will allow them to adjust (economically, culturally, socially, and emotionally) to a much greater degree.​ Even doing your best attempts, still there is a chance you will never be like a native (especially if you are a first-generation newcomer like me). Even after learning the language, you still will speak with an accent that will persist for decades. You will still have your tastes for food, music, and traces in your personality shaped in your fatherland. If you are moving to a homogeneous country like some in Asia or Eastern Europe, you will also be the person looking different.​ I have some splendid news for you: all those things can turn into opportunities. Your varied taste for food and music can give way to very interesting conversation topics. Your accent and knowledge of a foreign language can be useful to understand the so common loanwords from a globalized world. Those holidays you celebrated back in your country can double the opportunities for fun. With my wife we celebrate both Valentine's (14 of February) as her tradition and Dia dos Namorados (12 of June) as mine, so we have twice the amount of romantic dinners than a standard couple!​ Sometimes, being a different person opens doors to great opportunities. This is a point that people miss when trying to understand how to adapt to a new culture.In Poland, it is normal that younger people come to talk to me in English, since I look like a foreigner, and when I answer in their language, I hear nice compliments and salutations for learning their idiom. The same would be if a westerner moved to Thailand and mastered Thai. Inside homogeneous countries, with a quick look people will know you are a foreigner and while this may scary some expatriates, it is a significant chance to surprise and earn the local admiration.Nobody likes the arrogant expatriate that prefers to show off his differences at every point while despising the social and cultural features of his new home. On the other side, the complete opposite of him-the expatriate wishing to cut his roots and be like a local in every aspect- also risks entering a road to frustration because of unachievable goals.You don't need to lose your roots to be the guy from a snowless country talking about winter sports with his Norwegian workmates, or the American that moved to South-Africa and now invites his neighbors for a braai (South African barbecue). In countries where people expect you to be just another foreigner without interests in common, you will be in high-regard if you go beyond their expectations.Levi Borba is the CEO of expatriateconsultancy.com and a best-selling author.

The Men Who Bought Saturday,"AS MATT PLACED THE GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE IN FRONT OF HER, he said, ""You need to stay here today."" He was drinking out of an espresso cup with a thin gold band around the rim, holding it daintily above her head. She could smell his aftershave, the prep-school essence of synthetic roses and a splash of lavender. It was the smell of soft hands that picked up nothing other than the cheque at a restaurant. The sunshine reflected dully off his immaculate white shirt as he sat opposite her and needlessly adjusted his cufflinks. He wanted to draw attention to them, how heavy they looked. How expensive.""And do what?"" she asked, ""count your shoes?""He took another clean sip from the espresso cup. ""Stay out of trouble,"" Matt suggested.His voice signposted the class of company he kept, the kind of muted executive swagger one collects when ascending multiple wage brackets. He was still undoubtedly Australian, but an educated one: he pronounced his t's as t's and didn't slice off the ends of his words. It was war-ter not waw-dah, and it was going and not goin'.Hannah hated how money had changed him so obviously. He sounded ridiculous.She slapped her hand on the glass table. ""Matt, it's a Saturday! I need to go out and do something, you can't just keep me stuck in here. It's ten am, for fuck sake! What could I do to get myself in trouble at ten in the morning?""Matt raised his eyebrows as if to say, You'll think of something. Of course he didn't say this, and smoothly redirected conversation: ""I've got a meeting today at eleven. You aren't needed for any of it, but I do need you to stay here. That would make things a lot easier for me and I'd be done by three, anyway, so just watch Foxtel or something. God forbid, read a book.""For a moment Hannah wanted to throw the glass at his face, watch it explode over his glossy expensive skin. Blood and orange juice would splatter all over his blue suit, a grand's worth of tailoring ruined and the potential for permanent facial damage. It was a promising idea, but she thought better of it and instead picked at the sleeve of her - Matt's - dressing gown.They both knew what happened when thoughts like these became regrettable, irreversible actions.""Piss off, smartarse,"" she conceded. ""I didn't bring a book with me, and it's not like you've got any good ones here."" Hannah hooked a thumb over her shoulder toward the bookshelf, which was mostly empty. ""What, a few John Grishams, the odd Dean Koontz... and a shitload of books about ore mining. Pretty crap library, mate.""Matt's eyes narrowed and seemed to darken, a sharp transition from hazel to black that Hannah found disquieting. This repertoire of threatening facial expressions seemed to be something else he had acquired from money, something to earn him kudos in board meetings, perhaps, as the new-money yuppie with something to prove in his Ralph Lauren shirt and Fred Astaire shoes. But Hannah saw through that. His cheeks were still too pink, his brown hair too curly; he was, for all intents and purposes, the same thirteen-year-old boy who caught geckos in lunchboxes on Auntie Gina's veranda.""I didn't ask you here for your opinion,"" he said.""You didn't ask me to be here at all.""Matt laid his ankle on his knee and placed his hands on his calf, one smooth motion that suggested it had been performed on repeat occasions. ""It doesn't make things much easier for me, no. I like my own space, so I'd prefer it if you weren't here. But that's the way it is.""He shrugged.""You always did stay in your room a lot,"" Hannah said. ""I think you still like living inside your own head, the only difference now that you've got a big fuck-off apartment to hide out in.""""You say that as though all this just fell into my lap.""""Well with the job you've got, yeah, seems that way. You earn more in a year than I reckon I would in four lifetimes, and I really can't say what exactly the fuck it is you do, Matt.""He looked into his espresso cup as though a fly were drowning in it. Hannah remembered that he had always been fascinated by small animals in enclosed spaces. She certainly felt like one in this apartment: the floor-to-ceiling windows made it feel like a fish tank.Matt finally emptied his cup with one quick sip, and as he stood up the steel chair grunted quietly across the wooden floorboards. He checked the time on a small Omega with a blue dial, an ocean on his wrist.""New watch?"" Hannah asked.""Hm? Oh, I need to upgrade this one, actually. Had for it about a year now.""She laughed bitterly. ""Yeah, Jesus, that's fuckin' ancient.""""Look, is there anything else you want? Some more toast? There are a few eggs left so help yourself.""She lifted the glass of orange juice and swilled it around. ""This'd be better with vodka.""Matt said nothing and she retorted to his silence by draining the glass.Matt took his espresso cup and walked to the narrow island of marble planted beside the kitchen table. He placed the cup in the sink and, flicking the tap on, a soft white bolt of water exploded the residual coffee grains out of the bottom. He wiped his hands on a tea towel, even though they weren't wet.""Right, I'll see you later. Give me a call if anything happens."" He grabbed his bag off the kitchen counter, threaded his hands through his jacket. ""Bye.""He closed the door behind him.And Hannah didn't know what to do. It was ten am, only ten am, and the day felt vastly unpromising. She had been here two days in this shiny white purgatory, channel-hopping and eating away the hours with Indian takeaways charged to Matt's credit card. He had given her licence to order whatever she wanted, but every bite was a sour reminder of her dependency on his charity, the shame of it just a further tax upon her bankrupted self-worth.She decided to have another shower.The men rolled out of the boardroom in a polyester tide. Their words were quick, each voice sewn together by the same questions: where to have lunch, where to drink that night. The men must eat and drink. Saturday had at once become available and these were the men could afford it.Clean faces beneath polished hair. White teeth. Blue suits, two buttons, no waistcoat. Single-breasted, for god's sake. White pocket squares. Striped ties, some silver, some red, the colours of metal and ore. Shoes: leather, all pointed, all black. These were the men who bought Saturday.Matt emerged from the tide with a small blue ripple at his side, while the mass of high-quality tailoring flowed in the other direction. ""How's it goin' with you and ya cousin?"" the small ripple asked.""Aw, pretty shit,"" Matt replied, wiping his nose with the back of his wrist as they rolled further along the corridor. ""Just sits on her arse all day watchin' TV, makin' a bloody mess most of the time. But she's not drinkin', hey, so that's a relief.""""Yeah, s'pose.""""Still, fuckin' kills me havin' her round all the time, though."" Matt snorted and spat in a bin.""Ah mate,"" the ripple jabbed Matt with its elbow, ""y'afraid she's cockblockin' ya? Can't get any action with your cousin over, hey.""""Nah, guess not. Bit of a fucker but can't do nothin' about, so let's just wait and see what 'appens with that one, then.""They reached the elevator.""Hungry?"" the ripple asked.""Starvin'.""In under a minute the two men were sixty-four floors below, rolling over the lobby like a high wave toward the shore. The revolving doors spun beneath tall black letters printed across the windows: RIO TINTO MINING CORPORTATION.The high wave broke, washed into the polyester tide. The men pooled once again and spoke of food, of drink, before flowing backwards into the tarmac stream of St Georges Terrace.The ripple thumbed a message on its iPhone and asked, ""What'd she do again?""""Hey?""""Ya cousin. I know you told me but I forgot what 'appened.""""She fucked up at the engagement party, remember? Got pissed and spilled the beans about Danny and Sara, told everyone how long they'd been havin' a go with each other. She was probably on somethin' too, fuckin' druggo.""""Ah yeah, righto."" The ripple looked up from his phone for a moment, saw Matt staring hard ahead, breathing through his nose, and returned to the screen. ""What was it, your mate Danny had fucked the bride or some shit like that?""""That's the one, yeah. Shoulda kept her bloody mouth shut. I tell ya what, royally fucked up things between Ben and Sally - they called off the wedding in the end, the hotel, the catering, everything. All because my shit-for-brains cousin can't handle her drink.""Matt looked down to his feet and watched the warped reflection of the sky moving in his polished shoes, thinking of Hannah in his apartment. He shook his head, wondering what kind of bullshit world he lived in where he had to be related to people like that, and thought about calling her. He wouldn't be home until later that night so he supposed he should let her know where he'd be.She can go fuck herself, he thought in the end.""How come she can't stay at your mum's place?"" the ripple asked.""Ah, Mum's got the idea in her head that I've got more money than I know what to do with. Reckons I should use it to take in me cousin, look after me own kind, y'know?""Matt chewed on the inside of his cheek and breathed through his nose. The street ahead was clustered with small packs of thin men in tight suits, the crests of shiny dark hair flipping back in the wind. A glint of cuff links, the occasional tie clip. The more athletic ones dared to open a second button, a tuft of chest hair inhaling the cooler air outside the slim-fit shirt. A beggar seated outside a supermarket asked for change and was summarily ignored. None of these men lifted a finger from their iPhones or turned their head a single degree from the tanned, unlined faces of their peers.""The way I see it,"" Matt said, hand stuffed in his pocket, ""it takes a load off Mum's back for me to take her in. Besides, it's not like Auntie Gina wants a fuckin' thing to do with her so she's been dumped on my bloody doorstep.""""Sounds fucked, mate.""""I mean, it's not like she can stay with any of her friends. The only ones she had were at that party, and now they won't fuckin' touch her with a four-foot pole. Bloody idiot.""Matt continued walking for a few moments, thinking of how badly he wanted a smoke right now, before realising the small ripple had left his peripheral vision. He turned around and found it pointing at a restaurant. ""Mate,"" it called out, ""wanna try this place?""Matt shrugged. ""May as well.""And the tide rolled into the restaurant.",https://miro.medium.com/max/6734/1*IU7A44TiVbMAXdqOQ9FGow.jpeg,https://medium.com/prismnpen/the-men-who-bought-saturday-c206cd9fdfca,fiction,7c72fc388521cc60ba5ec9493b2264722fdf336c6f77b616c8ed92c8
"Dear 2021 Readers, Bullet Journaling Is Not Outdated","You may have heard the term ""Bullet Journal"" or ""BuJo"" before. Maybe even long before today. The creator of the Bullet Journal is Ryder Carroll, an American digital product designer and art director. And what you may not know (yet) is that he initially created this method to better structure his learning efforts while he was still in college in the late 1990s.In 2013 he started sharing his own life-hack on his website. As he explains it his website went viral in the summer of 2013, since then he has turned his personal routine into a full-time job. Surprising, right? It is indeed even more surprising with today's perspective, as bullet journaling has become a widespread routine for many persons who want to better structure their daily life and achieve their life goals.I am not talking about a minority of people who have a special interest in personal development. I am talking about a number of people representing enough search volume to impact Google search results for ""bullet journal"" every year around New Year's Eve!In a word: I am talking about normal people, like you and me, who have dreams in life and want to achieve goals, but who are sometimes overwhelmed by the necessities of everyday life. As I have just started my 2021 Bullet Journal, I would like to share with you the 3 main reasons why I have taken up this daily habit.To be completely honest, one of the main reasons why I started a bullet journal is because I kept losing my to-do lists, whether they were about grocery shopping, week-end plans or life goals. I used to write all kind of things that seem important to me on several writing supports: post-it notes, smartphone note app, ... It made me lose track of the content but also the priority levels of my various bullet-point lists.One advantage of a bullet journal is that it gathers all your thoughts in one place. Anything that is written in your ""BuJo"" is something less to keep in mind. Hence you will get more free head space and you will be able to - literally - keep an eye on all your notes. By pushing you to write down any kind of ideas, thought and to-dos, bullet journaling helps you organizing your thoughts and getting them out of your head.The second reason why 2021 is the perfect year to start writing your own bullet journal is that it represents a fresh start. 2020 was a particularly challenging year for most of us worldwide. As reported by the WHO in October 2020 ""the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted or halted critical mental health services in 93% of countries worldwide while the demand for mental health is increasing"".Bullet journaling is one of many exercises to help structuring one's thoughts and keeping track of one's goals. This is particularly beneficial especially in contexts of uncertainty like nowadays. Personally I revised my ambitions and re-ordered my priorities this year, as I experienced unexpected changes in my life during 2020. As I transitioned from a consulting job to a data analyst one and moved from Germany back to France, in 2021 I intentionally put more emphasis on my family and my personal development in the field of data analytics.Finally, one of the big advantages of bullet journaling is that it suits you and you only. The concept of bullet journal may be universal, in the end it is how you build it, how you fill it with your thoughts and how you decide to integrate it into your daily life that makes it unique. There are many tools available that you can use to fill your bullet journal (e.g. future log, vision board, mood tracker): you decide which ones are best for you.The incredible variety of bullet journaling supplies makes your personal journal necessarily customized. Whether you choose to buy a ready-to-use bullet journal or you decide to build your own journal from scratch, what ultimately matters is that it corresponds to your special needs.At the end of 2021, you will reflect on what you achieved during this year. Not only will you see all the crossed out items, you will also have gathered a picture of your own personality during this year. Believe me, you don't want to miss that feeling!",https://miro.medium.com/max/2288/1*oBEXriHT5YGYlZ7rnTwcVA.png,https://medium.com/writers-blokke/dear-2021-readers-bullet-journaling-is-not-outdated-d2fa8569a832,productivity,8cab77f05afecc2a4d65d1083a0e19cfb704fbca40dc2b440859e2e9
"""A Tiger Catches a Mouse With His Whole Strength""","Suzuki Roshi's quote and that of his colleague are about karma and the nature of problems. When the tiger is hunting, he is totally focused on the job at hand. If a problem arises he deals with it then, not later, and eats. Some days he eats well, others not, but with each hunt he eats something.It is easy to procrastinate about problems especially if they are minor. Maybe you made a small promise to a friend but didn't get around to doing it. Maybe you put off a bill because 'it's not that important'. Or skipped an oil change. You get my drift. These small things can blow up into major problems if you let them by simply not taking action when they are manageable.We all do it. I'm tired, I can't get to it right now, it's not that important. Until it is. When I started freelancing, for example, I would often procrastinate until I found myself up against a deadline with no ideas and too much work ahead of me. And faced with making an excuse. I occasionally lost a job because of it and worse, a client.So I made a personal rule: I always start a writing job right away, even if it is only opening a browser tab and starting a doc with a project name. That way it is staring me in my face every time I open the browser. In fact, this is how I organize my current jobs. The tab doesn't get closed until the job is billed or published. It's my way of keeping a how-to list.This extends out to a lot of other things. Paying bills right away while they are still small and manageable. Returning calls and texts. Doing things for people when they need them, not on my schedule. And it's liberating.Don't get me wrong, it took a long time to figure out that using your whole strength on small things helps you avoid needing it for really hard things later. I once procrastinated on a non-fiction book contract. I had three months to write a trade paperback, about 80,000 words. Tight, but doable. But I put it off. Days went by. I couldn't get started even though the entire thing was outlined on a page by page basis.And that deal was important. It was a multi-book deal worth quite a bit and I was something of an unknown risk for the publisher. Not to mention I had been paid an advance. It started to keep me up at night worrying. And every day that mouse was turning into a giant cow I had to kill and eat.My worrying was as much about my reputation as it was about the project. I'd worked hard to get this deal. Finally, with one month to go. I wrote the first chapter. It wasn't so bad! I started writing more and more and I made my deadline, and got paid. But the payment was not the big thing, nor was the book. It was the sense of relief it brought. A great mental weight was off my shoulders. And I vowed to never let that happen again.There is a notion that karma has to do with good deeds. I think it has to do with being an honorable person, a respected person with a good reputation. To achieve those things you have to deal with problems. And it is a lot easier when they first arise. Big problems seldom start as big problems. They escalate.Suzuki Roshi was a revered Zen teacher who was instrumental in raising awareness of Zen Buddhism in America. Not to be confused with his predecessor, D.T. Suzuki (Suzuki is a common surname in Japan), who actually wrote that book that started American Zen. Shunryu Suzuki came later* and one of the most famous books about Zen, Zen Mind Beginner's Mind consists of his short lectures to his students at the San Francisco Zen Center.Almost the entire focus of Zen, and Buddhism at its core, is living in this moment at all times. Meditation is a practice at doing this and Buddhism is itself far more of a training regimen than a conventional religion. And karma, the law of cause and effect, is central to this training model.When you address the situation at hand instead of putting it off you are living in the present and you will see the nature of karma. It's not some mysterious Asian concept, it is a core aspect of life. Your actions now determine the direction of your life, even the small ones.*Interesting anecdote: When Shunryu was asked about D.T., he said, ""He is the big Suzuki, I am the small Suzuki"".",https://miro.medium.com/max/10144/0*nbGDec0RofRldzVL,https://medium.com/curious/a-tiger-catches-a-mouse-with-his-whole-strength-c9ba3b597383,productivity,8dae841f681d2b74f9baee71afb9e1fcfaff50c1cf7303a81c22ba63
What American Parents Can Learn from the World's Happiest Children,"Childhood in Scandinavia is a very serious business. Moreover, it's an investment that Scandinavian governments, and citizens, take very seriously. After all, a secret to a happy adulthood is in a happy childhood.Perhaps, it's one of the main reasons why these Northern European countries top the list of the world's happiest nations year after year.Since the birth of my (Danish-American) daughter I've been giving a lot of thought to the major differences in how Danish and American societies accommodate their children's needs.Here are just a few things that I noticed Danish parents prioritize for their kids.My Danish husband and I were walking through Brooklyn's Prospect Park when we noticed a boy of around 5 years old leaning over a rail of a small bridge in curiosity. Neither of us paid much attention, until we noticed a woman who suddenly stopped and stood frozen, eyeing the boy and nervously looking around, searching for his parents. I could tell she was getting agitated when, luckily, a busy-with-two-other-kids mother appeared and asked her son to step down. The stranger lady barely held back from making a comment and walked away, shaking her head. Not only was she a neurotic New Yorker, but also a fear-driven American, to whom a child exploring alone in the park, even if for a minute, is a dangerous game.While I wasn't surprised at all, my husband was perplexed by the woman's reaction. He said that no one in Denmark would think the boy was in danger, trusting him to be careful and mindful of his actions.Danish children are treated with respect and allowed to make their own mistakes. And since getting hurt is a part of life, you might as well teach your kids about that right from the start, their parents say.Forget children wearing helmets in rubber-floor playgrounds, so often seen in America. Danish kids are actually encouraged to take risks. For them, playing with saws and hammers, making fire or climbing trees with minimum supervision or interference are all perfectly normal activities, meant to make them resilient and life-proof.While certainly no one wants to see their child get hurt, fear-driven parenting, so common in the U.S., is not always the best solution to keeping our kids safe. Teaching them common sense and trusting them to do the right thing might be a much better investment in the long term.When I think of my childhood, I remember occasional bike rides as some of my happiest and most adventurous moments. Now, imagine a childhood of biking every day, everywhere.One of the things that struck me the most upon my arrival in Denmark's capital was the number of bicycles in the streets. No one in Copenhagen seemed to be without a bike, including children. The youngest ones were pedaled around by their parents, the rest biked on their own along the city's many bike roads and paths.Since bicycling everywhere is a big part of Danish culture, children are taught to ride at an early age and cycling lessons and exams are a part of the school curriculum. Due to fantastically developed biking infrastructure, riding a bike in Denmark is stress and danger-free, making it the healthiest, and happiest, way to commute. Even in Copenhagen, children of all ages use bicycles to get to their schools, arriving rosy-cheeked and energized.Unfortunately, commuting by bike is not a safe option for most children, or even adults, in the U.S., especially those living in the cities. Yet it's still possible to incorporate cycling into kids' lives by seeking out safe and accessible routes, even if only on weekends.When my 10 year old step-daughter joined a (well-ranked) public school in Brooklyn, she asked me why schools in New York looked like jails. I got defensive, but I knew what she meant. Bleak corridors, colorless rooms, barred windows, lack of fresh air, metal fences around the building - nothing about her school was ""cozy,"" the word so loved in her home country.Back in Denmark, famous for its architecture, my step-daughters' public school looked like a building out of a design magazine. It wasn't a repurposed structure, as it's often the case in America, but a well thought-through environment, meant to stimulate children's development and growth. It provided more than just desks. The rooms were airy and filled with light. There were areas for play and relaxation, nooks for reading, and various outdoor spaces for playing and studying. It reflected the Danish belief that growing up, especially for younger kids, is not about academic success but about playing, exploring, taking risks and connecting with the outdoors.Likewise, Danish playgrounds are world-famous and known for their unique and creative designs. Everywhere you look, children's environment in Denmark is given a lot of thought.While not all schools in America look, and feel, like jails, many of them do resemble institutions for mini-adults, rather than those for kids. And while we can't always control the American school system, we can make sure that at least children's home environment is full of coziness and opportunities for relaxation. Open windows, gentle lights, warm colors, soft blankets and hiding nooks don't cost a lot and can give your child that sense of comfort he or she isn't likely to get in school.A Russian friend of mine told me of a time when she left her baby in a stroller on the balcony in winter, as many Russians do, causing tenants in her New York building call the management company to complain. This much is obvious: not only Americans like to put their noses in other people's business, they also don't trust that fresh air, even, or especially, when it's cold outside, is good for children. This is a belief that parents in all Northern European countries share.Despite, or because of, their infamous climate, Scandinavians are obsessed with fresh air. And they start early. Babies sleep outside in their strollers for hours each day, even in the coldest months. Bundled up, they gradually develop resistance to cold, while receiving all the benefits of fresh air. In general, people across all Scandinavia believe that connecting with nature and the outdoors of any kind is an essential part of growing up healthy and happy.In Danish kindergartens and schools children spend a lot, if not all, of their time outside, in any weather, both playing but studying. Forest schools, where children's entire study is conducted in a forest, originated in Denmark and is now quickly gaining traction around the world.On the contrary, in her Brooklyn school, my step-daughter often spent her days in poorly, if at all, ventilated rooms, with short outdoor breaks and alarmingly short recess times. And while not much can be done to take the lessons, or at least play, outside in any weather in American schools, there are many opportunities to increase our kids' outdoor time. After all, fresh air is the best, and cheapest, way to improve moods and overall productivity in children.As for my own family, while we certainly struggle to maintain our lifestyle since arriving in the U.S., we're aware of the differences and gaps that need to be filled in. I know for sure, though, that my daughter, who went on her first hike at three weeks of age and didn't stop since, will be spending as much time outdoors and in nature as possible. And I'll find a way for her to bike daily, even if it means that there won't be a Starbucks around the corner for me.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10494/1*pxP3MG3rILHaoEGJd-L6VQ.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/what-american-parents-can-learn-from-the-worlds-happiest-children-1ab60236ac91,travel,9b950ff1f9b23f4e6f79de8ada537eb14bb1f1d47b9a076608ec9863
What You Need To Create Your First Online Course,"When I first started selling online courses in 2018, I thought all I needed was a blog, some course modules, and a few emails before I started making sales.At the time, I saw so many influencers and entrepreneurs selling courses about everything from Pinterest, email marketing, social media, and more.And I was buying them and getting results myself. I figured if they could do it, I can too.I realized the world was moving online and figured it was now or never to bet on myself. If you didn't know, the online course business is booming. According to Forbes, the online education market will be roughly $350 billion by 2025 (and this study was pre-pandemic).I had so much confidence in my ability to sell online courses and build an online business I quit my $100,000 job after my blog had made $200 in 2017.Nearly four years later, I can say that I was 100% wrong about what it really takes to sell online courses. While I'm getting the hang of it now, I'll be the first to say it's nothing like you think.But at the same time, it is 100% possible, if you have the right strategy. While I am not a six or seven-figure course creator (yet), I have had some success and keep learning from several seven-figure mentors like James Wedmore.If you're someone who wants to start selling online courses, here is what you need to get started.The number one thing you need to sell online courses is experience in what you're selling. I know this sounds obvious but I had to include it because unfortunately, there are people that try to pedal digital products without experience in the subject they're ""teaching."" This obviously gives the e-learning industry a bad name and can taint digital courses to buyers in general.While you need experience, I want you to know that you don't need to be world-class or the best in your field to succeed.While mastery is great, you really just need to be a few steps ahead of your ideal audience. You do not need to have a fancy degree or decades of experience to sell online courses. Thinking that you do is probably why you haven't created an online course yet.You just need to be able to help others get results more than anything else.Personally, I think it's your obligation to share what you know with the world, especially if people are asking you for it.For example, when I quit my job in 2017 I had only made $200 ever from my blog. Fast-forward to today and I have made nearly $200,000 from freelance writing part-time and have never had to go back to a 9-5 job. Eventually, people started asking me how I did it and wanted to learn how they could as well.Now, I have a program that teaches people how to do just that and several have already quit their jobs as well! If I never took the time to create my program, tons of other writers would still be struggling to build an online business and stuck in jobs they hate.While you need expertise in your subject, this isn't enough anymore as there is more competition. In the past few years, online courses have become more common, which means there is more competition in pretty much every niche imaginable.But competition is not a bad thing, instead, realize people clearly are interested and use it as an opportunity to stand out. Now, it's not about creating more content to prove you're an expert either. And your personality isn't going to differentiate you from competitors either.Instead, you need a unique framework or methodology to help get people results.A unique framework does three things:By coming up with a framework or methodology, it forces you to get clear about what a new student would need to get results. It will also help you create the roadmap for success by taking a 30,000-foot view of what worked for you and basically hand them the blueprint for success.For example, there are a ton of different writers out there promoting a freelance writing course. To differentiate myself from all the others, I created my own unique system called ""The Confident Writer Framework."" This is a three-part system that I used and have taught my students to help them speed up their writing success.Second, it will help you make unique content in your niche and pre-sell your product. More on that in the next section.Finally, it will help you differentiate from others in your niche. A unique framework will help you stand out from your competitors and make it easy to spot if anyone is trying to copy your program. Once you have a unique framework, people will associate that with you and your brand.Once you have nailed down your framework, it's time to start building your email list. If you think you can depend on social media followers for consistent course sales, you are dead wrong. With social media, you are only one internet apocalypse away from losing everything.Every successful course creator I know makes an overwhelming majority of their sales from their email list, not social media followers.You can't rely on social media as they are a third party platform (just like writers shouldn't rely 100% on Medium followers). If the president of the United States can get removed from Twitter and Facebook, no one is safe.You need to build your email list so that you control your list and are protected in case your social media accounts get shut down.Here's how I keep building my email list:Please notice that I put content strategy after email list. So many course creators start putting out social media content before having a list and are missing out on tons of subscribers.Instead, sign up for email software before releasing content so you can capture as many leads as possible. Once you do, then you should start putting out content that attracts your ideal audience.Also, when it comes to content creation, don't try to be Gary Vee either. You don't need to be on every single platform 15X per day to become a successful course creator. I know because I tried to become omnipresent and it led to burnout and little results.Instead, focus on 1-2 main platforms. For example, now I only focus on YouTube and Instagram. While I might schedule some old content on Pinterest or Twitter, I focus more on my big two than anything else.When it comes to creating content, use these strategies:Once you've nailed your content strategy, you need to find a way to sell your offer. Gone are the days of posting a course to a page on your website and hoping people will just find it and then somehow magically buy it. Trust me, I know from first-hand experience this doesn't work.Instead, you need to do launches to grow your email list, gain awareness about your offer, and get it in front of people. Personally, I love webinar launches, but it's probably because I'm the most familiar with them and been a writer for EasyWebinar for two-plus years.But there are myriad ways to run launches including:Pick one that resonates with you and give it a shot. If you like the launch vehicle, keep doing it over and over again. Don't try it once, have a bad launch, and then switch to a new style.Instead, learn from your mistakes and keep tweaking a few times before looking for a new strategy.Finally, you need tons of patience selling courses and can't expect to make it overnight.When I first started selling online courses, I was under the impression that I was ""one funnel away"" from millions of dollars and massive success. While I'm all about staying positive, if you try to rush the process, you'll never make it. Remember, it's a marathon, not a sprint.One of my mentors, James Wedmore, preaches patience and is a shining example of how patience and consistency can pay off. His signature program, Business by Design, made around $19,000 on his first launch a few years ago. Fast-forward to June 2020, he had a $5,000,000+ launch selling the same product.Online learning, specifically online courses, is the future.If you're an expert in pretty much anything, you can build an online business around your passion and help others succeed. Not only is this a great way to work at home, but your work can actually mean something too.Sure, making money online is great but helping people achieve their goals is even better. When you get emails from students telling you how much your program changed their lives, it's addictive.It's fun to know that you're making a difference and positively impacting others. I never had any of this fulfillment from my boring corporate job and am grateful for everyone who works with me.While it won't happen overnight, I promise selling your expertise is 100% worth it.People out there are waiting for you to share your gifts with the world. Get out there and make it happen.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10646/1*3bMztSEznK3eRlhMkE51hw.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/what-you-need-to-create-your-first-online-course-a2729ad5ca20,marketing,9f6bd20b90346b4ecb8546654947ac38b664d657e2a4c5db0b41cb8b
Run,"I'm out of breath. Speed has never been my thing. Short bursts of breath slowly re-oxygenate my red backlit eyes, coating the rear hemisphere of my brain.I tell myself to calm down. To think. To find a hiding spot.The last time I looked back he was gaining on me. His dirty tan hoodie plainly visible against the contrasting Prussian blue of the night. The serial lamps on the streets creating ignominious globules of visibility that told me to stay away out of sight, use the cover of darkness.I must mitigate the risk. If I can't outrun, I must conceal myself. And wait for dawn.I have a tiny sliver of an advantage. I know the internal layouts of the buildings around us. And I know which side exits will have unlocked doors. Doors used by students to leave after a late night at the lab.All my wanderings around campus have come to good use. I know all the doors, even the windows.I gave up on the windows after the first few revealed they only opened about 2 inches. And some had a metal cage around them on the outside. All to ward off any potential jumpers.No - the doors, they were more interesting.I can create convoluted routes of escape. Entering through the first-floor north side janitorial door, I make my way to the third floor, up the stairs, and then use the bridge on the southwest corner to get into the next building.I'm glad I'm wearing black. If I stay away from the lights, I might make it.I exit on to the side street, walking quickly, head down. There are few students around at this time of night.I look down the next street and a surge of bile constricts my throat. He's there, looking around, mapping routes in his head, searching. For me.Thuds of panic slam in my head like tall church windows crashing in waves. I turn and run. Again. I can hear his sneakered feet, the sound pulsing up in amplitude as he reduces the distance between us.There's nowhere left to hide. It's over now.I come slowly to a stop, panting. Water from my eyes and nose mix with sweat as I hang my head down, wanting to disappear into the earth.He comes up to me and I raise my eyes, meeting his.""I'm sorry,"" he says.My face slams shut, like a ventriloquist's dummy that has consumed its master. Wooden on the outside, volcanic on the inside.There is no language, no words, that could come remotely close to a satisfactory articulation.""Let's go home,"" he says.My hands are limp. I feel beaten, dehydrated like a dead flower stuck in a claustrophobic library book. He takes my hand.I wait a moment, then fall into step behind him.Paroma Sen 2021",,https://psiloveyou.xyz/run-bfd878a9a1a0,fiction,11eeb536070f1f14f3ded2d3ff84dc6e67712959905723330d98653d

On the Hill of Arrival,"The skies were clearer than they had been for months the day they arrived. It wasn't like in the movies. There was no large spinning disk in the sky that shot laser beams. From where I sat on the hill with Billy and a few of the others, there were no beams of any kind descending from the three-dimensional square craft as it soundlessly cut through the air at a slow and steady pace. Every now and then, it'd stop, send out a light on an area, and move on.""Holy cow,"" Billy said with his fingers in his mouth. He chewed on the fragile cuticles just beginning to grow back. ""Annie, we gotta get home before they get us.""He tried to pull me up by my arm to join the ones who ran down the other side of the hill, screaming.""No,"" I said, yanking out of his grip. ""I want to see what it does.""My friends Jules, Madrona, and Shelly were still on the hill watching the ship go this way and that in the sky.They didn't run. But they also weren't staying for me.""You can go if you want,"" I said firmly, ""but I'm staying."" I made the face my mother said reminded her of my grandfather who I never met but heard was an awful man.""Annie,"" Billy pleaded. We both knew the rules. He couldn't return home no matter what without me or else he'd be in trouble. ""We'll die up here just like in the movies!""Madrona and Shelly shot him a look. Jules only laughed and rolled her eyes.""If this were the movies,"" Madrona began. ""You wouldn't be so short and pimply, Billy.""His brown skin blushed deep shades as he looked away from the girls and me and the UFO skating through the air.""Yeah,"" Shelly chirped in, but not to humiliate Billy, her back-porch boyfriend. ""That thing looks lost not deadly, B. Maybe it needs directions."" She stood up. Grass and dirt stained her rainbow shorts, but she didn't care because it was only grass and dirt. ""Hey! Over here,"" Shelly yelled at the craft.No one noticed but me that she shot him in wink under the glare of the sun. Billy leapt on Shelly. It was gross, annoying, cute, everything they were, and I was not. Madrone and Jules barely noticed them wrestling. They were whispering about whatever girls like them whisper about and nothing else matter. Not even a flying cube.Shelly left Billy sore and smiling on the ground to return to calling the UFO over. There was a small space between Shelly and Madrona, I took it and watched to see if the cube would come anywhere near us.""Maybe the dork is right,"" Jules said. ""We should get out of here.""""Naw, fuck that,"" Shelly barked, whipping her curly bleach blonde hair back over her shoulder. ""I'm not sacred of no ET.""""It's not about being scared,"" Billy said from the dirt. ""Dad says it's about being smarter than the idiot before you.""""Well, I don't think there's any idiots before us. I'd say we are the first to experience this,"" I said.Shelly listened to Jules and ignored Billy as she sat back down, frowning.""What do you think it wants?"" Madrona asked.""World domination,"" Jules answered, ""obviously.""""What if it really is lost?"" I asked. ""What if it thought we were a different Earth? Different people?""""A different Earth?"" Shelly said.""Yeah, filled with people like us but better, smarter, kinder. And somehow it ended up here,"" I said.""You're all wrong."" Billy stood up from the grass. ""It's here to enslave us.""""That's what I said,"" Jules spat.""Yeah, dude, way to steal someone's idea and while the world is witnessing its final day."" Madrona sat down beside Shelly and leaned back on the grass. The sunscreen on her skin shined brightly, reflecting the lights now whirling from the floating cube. ""We might want to go, though.""""Yeah!"" Billy shouted. This time instead of trying to yank me up, he went for Shelly. ""Let's get out of here before it gets us.""The look in Shelly's eyes was enough for Billy to release her and put his hands in his pockets.Suddenly, the cube shot out a strong light that blinded me and knocked me on my ass. When I came to, it was gone, and Shelly was staring at Billy the way she does when they're alone and she's scared, crying about her dad. Jules was ripping grass from the dirt and tossing it to get caught in the wind while Madrona examined her body.""What the hell?"" Billy said, quickly getting up to his feet and helping Shelly up.""Did we die?"" she asked, leaning into his arms. ""I think we're dead.""Jules stood up with a handful of grass in her hand and dumped it on Madrona's head. ""Doubtful.""""That's good,"" Billy whispered to Shelly. ""That's so good.""I checked my watch. No time, that I could see, had passed. ""Naw, we haven't left or gone anywhere. We're just where we were, but...""""Somethings different,"" Madrona said. ""Somewhere, something is different.""""Same. I feel that,"" Jules said, gazing down over the town.""We should go,"" Billy said, eyeing me. He pulled Shelly closer and began to walk toward our home on the other side of the hill.""Yeah, alright,"" Shelly said, letting him lead her away.I glanced back to see if there was anything I could see different about the town. It all looked the same. Same mono-colored buildings. Same school. Same church. Same damn sky over us all. It was all the same, but not me. I could feel the change in me. A turn coming on. I followed it down the hill toward the world and away from my home.Aigner Loren Wilson is a queer Black SFWA, HWA, and Codex writer.

Delhi Summers,"My uncle was unlike any man I had ever met. Sometimes I even wondered whether he was adopted, because there's no way that he shared the same blood as the rest of my family. For starters he didn't go to college like the rest of them. Let's just say the gap year he took after completing high school still hasn't ended. At 18, along with two friends, he went backpacking across the country. For 3 months, no one had the slightest idea where he was or how he was doing. He turned up at the front door after a few months with his hair bunched up into a man bun, sporting a rugged thick beard and no footwear. My grandmother, who would be considered archaic even in the 1800's, nearly had a heart attack seeing him this way. To date, she still holds him responsible for her heart condition. Unconcerned, he borrowed some money from my granddad and disappeared again for a few weeks. The next they heard of him, he had set up a bookstore somewhere in Delhi. Naturally, he was my favorite.Kabir (he insisted I call him by name) was perhaps the only one in my family who treated me like an adult. Nothing was ever off the table when I was with him, so you can imagine the number of times my young teenage mind nagged him with questions. Kabir always had a story to share, either from his school days, his trips, hikes or even just some of his past experiences. Like when he bunked a week of school just to watch the India-Australia test match or when he smoked weed with a group of monks he met on his hike in Manali. I saw him as the epitome of 'cool', my mother saw him as a bad influence. I think both these points of view are pretty self-explanatory. The words 'gap year' were taboo in my house because of Kabir.Kabir would spend half his time hunched over a book, and the other half bent over his type-writer. Yes, he was one of those people who still owned a type-writer. Not because he didn't believe in technology or anything, just because he felt a type-writer brought a certain aesthetic and made him seem smarter than he actually is. I remember one day, back when I was in the 10th grade, Kabir pulled me aside and thrust a book between my hands, saying ""This is my copy of the book. Remember this as the day your life changed forever"". This was the first reason I loved him; he made me read The Kite Runner. And he was right, it did change my life, because that was the book that made me want to be a writer.His words were all that he had, there was no place this man could have worked than at a bookstore.Between The Lines was a bookstore which was as quirky as its owner. It didn't only serve as a bookstore, but also as a library of sorts. You could borrow books from Between the Lines and keep it for however long you took to finish it. But, there was a catch. It was a system that was similar to a game I had played back in 5th grade. One student would go to the front of the class and start telling a story, then they'd be stopped midway and the next student had to takeover from them and continue the story. Kabir's system was very similar. Each time a person borrowed a book, they'd have to tell a story, not in front of everyone, but write a page out on the laptop by the store exit. The next person who borrowed a book would have to continue it from where it was left off on the laptop. It was simple, yet ingenious. You were made to work for your book. At the end of each month, Kabir would compile it all and get it printed. This cycle repeated itself every month. I'd always lurk around the laptop and the minute a person finished writing I would go read it. Some of the stuff on that laptop was mind boggling. The people I'd least expected to have any sort of writing prowess would write stories that would blow my mind. ""Everyone who's had a childhood has a story to share"" Kabir always said.The books at BTL weren't arranged according to genres or sections. In fact, they were all randomly distributed. You could find Kane and Abel seated comfortably next to a Steve Jobs autobiography, or a Dan Brown thriller right by a Mills and Boons. When I brought this up with Kabir, he had a one line reply for me, ""Every story in the world is a love story, so I don't see a point in sorting the books out in any type of order"".Yup, that was the sort of man he was.Another thing about Between The Lines was that no song that was played in the store could ever be repeated. Now, this was both a blessing and a boon for me. If I liked a song, I had to find its name immediately otherwise my chances of hearing it again would be next to none. But, a boon as well because through this I got to listen to a wide variety of songs. And that's the second reason I loved my Uncle. Through him, I discovered the Beatles.The bookstore was my safe place, my comfort zone. We used to go to Delhi only in the summers, so I'd spend a large part of my vacation reading in Between the Lines. Pun wholly and completely intended. I used to spend long hours curled up in a corner, hunched over some book. The bookstore also held some special memories of mine, including my first kiss. I knew every nook and cranny of the place, and knew where exactly each book was. I guess this was why Kabir would have me work at the store from time to time.My job was easy. I'd work the cashier desk and help customers locate books. BTL didn't have a large customer base, so I got a lot of time to just sit and write. Trust me, there are few experiences as liberating as writing in a bookstore. Inspiration, is quite literally all around you. It's quite ineffable to describe the feeling, but it used to make me feel oddly superior. This was of course, before Palakh burst my bubble.Palakh walked into my life in the same way she walked into the store; with poise, grace and purpose. She popped by the counter and asked, ""Hey, do you have Private Peaceful by Michael Morpurgo by any chance?"". Being the charming, suave man I am, I replied quite eloquently, ""Uhhh..umm yeah yeahh second floor, first shelf on the left"". That was the first time a girl had left me tongue tied.She took Morpurgo on the first day, Archer on the second and my heart on the third. Aside from her name, there wasn't much I really knew about her. She was a closed book. Maybe it was the mystery that drew me towards her, maybe it was her glasses. I'm not quite sure what drew me to her.She was a regular at BTL, and we had struck up a friendship of sorts. Our conversations were mainly restricted to books and authors, and aside from the fact that she despised Harry Potter she was nearly perfect.""What do you keep writing on your laptop all day? How can you be so engrossed in a screen when you're in a bookstore like this?"" she asked me one day.""Oh, I'm actually working on a story, and I enjoy writing here, it gives me a kind of peace."". By now, a certain coherence had entered by speech when I talked to her.""A kind of peace? Oh, so you're one of those hippy writer types? That's interesting."" she replied with a smirk running across her face.Was she mocking me?""Anyway"", she continued, ""I want to listen to your story."". Just as I started to lift my laptop to hand to her, she stopped me, ""Nuh uh, I want you to read it out to me. I want to hear it in your voice."".Well, her wish was my command, so I lifted my laptop and started reading it aloud. It was a simple story I'd written, about how a seasoned footballer goes to visit the stadium the night before his last game ever to relive his memories and take it all in one last time.It was quite an emotional piece and I was completely engrossed in the narration. I would have forgotten that she was standing in front of me, had it not been for her eyes. She didn't take her gaze off me for even a minute, and let it linger there for a few seconds after I had finished."" So, what do you think?"" I asked her in anticipation.She was silent for a moment, and then she said in a soft but clear voice ""It was passionate."". Before, I could even process her critique, she had collected her books and left.I stayed up the whole night thinking about what she had said. Did she like the story? Did she just like the way I narrated it? Passion is a funny word to use to describe a story. Was it so bad that passionate was all she could say about it? How had she said so much by saying so little? This girl was truly mystifying. I loved it.She didn't come by for a week after that, and I grew more and more anxious. I couldn't stop thinking about her and became more and more sure of my feelings. I decided that the next time I see her, I was going to make my move. What was it that Kabir used to say? Five minutes of confidence can change your life.So, when she did finally turn up, I called out to her before she made her way into the store. I leaned across the counter, as if it were that of a bar, looked into her eyes, just as I'd seen in countless movies and said, ""Can I buy you a book?"". She covered her surprise with that familiar smirk and nodded. As we walked towards the back of the store, I saw that she was positively smiling now.Somewhere between Tagore and Segal, our lips met. It was one minute of pure bliss and my mind and heart were both racing rapidly. I pulled away, looked down at her and asked, ""So, how was it?""""It was passionate.""",https://miro.medium.com/max/8064/1*L_VdRGJ1KIrhLRLty_9qSQ.jpeg,https://shubi16.medium.com/delhi-summers-1e4e585273e3,fiction,31a427c503ae2d4921c1bf86b360525d16233aaf27782e921eaa01f3
"How To Stay Calm, Motivated, And Productive During A Crisis","It seems I'm a fraud.For years, I've advocated and even profited from preaching about the evils of distractions and enslaving yourself to the crisis news networks. Productive people don't glue themselves to social media and cable news. They don't stress over transitory bullshit. They put their heads down and get to work.I felt justified in preaching as I had almost universally followed my own advice. That win-streak ended on January 6 when rioters stormed the capital. I became the person I advised not to become, immersing myself in headline news, checking Twitter for constant updates because mainstream media felt like clay-tablet technology.Had this become the new me? Would it last forever? You know that adage, ""This too shall pass."" It's true. Everything passes, even the good times, which always seem to zoom by, while the crises linger indefinitely.Even my brain rebelled, surreptitiously contriving justification for my lack of motivation. It's a throwaway month. It's okay.When thoughts like those started to make sense, I knew I had to reassert sanity. Thankfully, I regained my senses. It wasn't willpower or refrigerator magnet proverbs that helped me. It took a lesson from a former boss who coached me after 9-11.When the first tower fell on September 11, I left my office and raced back to my apartment. There I stayed for a good 48-hours, clinging to the 24-hour news, drinking wine from a bottle. The next morning, the scent of burnt ash and charred metal seeped through my window.The events, the sounds, the scent. It so consumed me with fear, outrage, and angst; The commentary of pundits and news anchors proved addictive even though I knew it would only worsen the tension.Two days into the melee, an exec at my company called, and we spoke for ten minutes. That might not sound impressive, but he had over 100 people who worked under him. For several days he made sure he spoke with every employee, promising us we'd still have a job, motivating us to stay strong, and projecting an unwarranted reassurance that somehow, everyone accepted.When the crises passed, he explained that being the one everyone else leaned on made it easier for him to focus on his day-to-day without getting caught up in the minute by minute drama. It forced him to set an example for everyone else to follow.It was a brilliant lesson and one I've followed during various crises over the last twenty years. It doesn't require any special skill or willpower, only a small amount of effort and a desire to help.In times of turmoil, we crave certainty and reassurance. We'll accept it even when we have reason to discount it.When the executive calmed me after 9-11, I knew he lacked the power to guarantee his promises. Still, I bought his reassuring words because I needed to believe them. And as he later told me, fulfilling the role of the leader that everyone else leaned on reassured him as well.There are three components to this technique, none of which require more than basic interpersonal skills.A close friend of mine is the most anxious person I know. We used to live a few blocks from each other. I could walk into her apartment cool as blue and stumble out two hours later as though she'd injected me with an IV of caffeine. Always on edge, she lived life as if every decision were a life or death situation.When you're in the presence of someone like that, you can't help but absorb some of their angst. Studies show that other people's emotions can and do infect us. That's why you need to project an air of calm when you designate yourself as the one others rely on.Your calmness infects those around you. It encourages them to stick by you because they feel reassured. Their calmness, in turn, contributes to your emotional state. It's tough to be productive and creative when you're agitated. You act out of emotion instead of logic and make less thoughtful decisions.When you put out the message you're available for others, you thrust yourself into a leadership position. You become a person of authority and responsibility.Once anointed, we tend to act in a way that's consistent with that label. As Robert Cialdini writes in his book, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, we have an obsessive desire to act (and appear) consistent. ""Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpernal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.""The mere act of declaring yourself as the person who will be there for everyone else influences you to act in a way that's consistent with that manner. Done correctly, it encourages you to demonstrate the skills, behaviors, and diligence your followers expect of you.Never pretend the crisis doesn't exist. Don't dismiss anyone's concerns or fears. You'll destroy your credibility and antagonize the people you mean to support.Nobody likes to feel belittled or dismissed. They want to be heard and reassured.Put on your listening caps, as your school teacher used to say. Recognize their concerns, and then shift focus to the post-crisis world.By focusing on the future state, you communicate your belief in an imminent post-crisis world without explicitly saying so. I've found it even helps to show apprehension or nervousness about the post-crisis reality.Those who depend on you will worry their sweat glands dry. But you'll also communicate a subtle certainty that whatever angst stands in their way now will soon end.A crisis, even a short one, can throw off even the most disciplined. Once you find yourself off your game, take a deep breath, and remind yourself that as the adage goes, this too shall pass. Then, commit to being the one others can lean on. It forces you to set an example for everyone else to follow.",https://miro.medium.com/max/9938/1*5bK8SRg7bNZ9nyLRvlN_Nw.jpeg,https://barry-davret.medium.com/how-to-stay-calm-motivated-and-productive-during-a-crisis-65f72c19798f,productivity,051cf119c61d8a04e1c890830a454eb86fd3b30292c232e30f77d314

The Mudgelwangk (Home to Roost),"It would be safer to stay in the canopy. Here, you're out of reach of the wandering Mudgelwangk and any other ground predators. The moon is on the rise and you have a clear view of the forest floor by the silvery light. It might be easier to spot Geoffrey from up here if he's anywhere nearby.You inch forward. The mawt's nest is far larger than you first realized. The twigs scratch your skin as you clamber over it, trying to keep to the edge. You slip, rolling into the bowl. Something cracks under your back. The eggs! You'll never get that scent off you now.The mawts will surely hunt you down. Unlike other animals, they're known to track a threat far beyond their own territory. Not only do they kill it, but then they eat it to ensure it won't return.You shove yourself away from the cracked eggs and crawl to the far edge of the nest. Just as you climb onto the branch beyond, a rustling shadow passes over you. There's a ferocious shriek from above as heavy wings beat the air. Sharp claws dig into your back as a mawt grabs you.Your heart plummets into your stomach as you spiral up, up, up. You clear the canopy and arrows higher into the star-studded night.The last thing you see before the mawt feasts on your flesh are the moonlight-kissed branches of the forest below you and the lights of your village glowing in a clearing half a league away.I hope for Geoffrey's sake you taste terrible. If not, the mawt may try him next.If you'd like to start at the beginning, here's the opening scene:",,https://medium.com/theliving/the-mudgelwangk-home-to-roost-910e832f6298,fiction,80f748a40bc83d1cd9617690c8de92dab0b0f4e97b320bea20f217c6
Suspension of Disbelief: Never Risk to Lose Your Reader's Emotional Involvement in Your Story,"The suspension of disbelief is the readers' willingness to accept as credible facts and characters they would ordinarily consider incredible.The suspension of disbelief is an essential part of modern storytelling.Modern readers know that stories are not facts. They know that events and characters aren't real, even when they look like they are. Yet readers accept them as real for the duration so to be able to enjoy the story.British author and literary critic Samuel T. Coleridge was the first to call this attitude suspension of disbelief in 1817. The concept was of special importance for a Romantic like him because Romantic authors wrote stories that not only weren't real, but they also didn't look like they were. Fantastical elements were included in these stories, and even if readers knew these didn't exist in the real world, they were still willing to pretend they could and read the story in the same way they did a perfectly realistic story.Coleridge theorised that this happened because of a conscious, temporary act of belief on the readers' part.In modern storytelling, the focus of the suspension of disbelief has increasingly shifted from the reader to the author. Readers must be willing to suspend their disbelief, which they may do selectively - this is why, for example, some readers don't read fantasy, or don't read romances: because this kind of stories stretches their suspension of disbelief too thin. But authors must do all they can to make it easy for their readers to suspend their disbelief. Good stories don't just allow the suspension of disbelief, they encourage it.When readers come to think that a story may be real, somehow, somewhere, they become willing to believe, if only for the time it takes to consume that story. Then their involvement becomes complete, and a strong emotional bond is born.There isn't just one element that makes the suspension of disbelief acceptable to the reader. Rather, this is a process that works at all levels of storytelling and is utterly pervasive. But there are some areas where it is more essential.Have you ever felt that a story transported you there? That you could almost see, smell, touch, hear what a place looked, smelled or sounded like?The stronger this sensation, the more the reader will be willing to believe, and it doesn't matter whether the place where the story happens is a real place or it's imaginary. Whether it is New York City or Middle-earth, if the reader may place themselves there, they are likely to believe all the rest.This kind of immersive feeling is often created by details. Generic settings or descriptions rarely do the trick. Sometimes one well-chosen word specific to a place or a situation will do more than any long description.If the setting is where the reader is transported to, characters are the reader's travel companions. They know the way and will accompany the reader in the journey that is the story.But to do this, they need to be trustworthy. Whether soldiers from WWI or little mermaids with a dream, characters need to be coherent.Coherence works at different levels.Handling characters' actions and reactions is one of the trickiest aspects of storytelling, but also one of the most powerful. If a reader comes to consider a character as good as a real person, and maybe one of their friends, investment in the story (and so the suspension of disbelief) will be almost unbreakable.Action is strongly related to the plot. Therefore to the sequence of events and motivations. Therefore to the structure of the story. Coherence and logic are paramount here.The relation cause/effect that propels the story has to make sense regarding both the plot and reality. Events need to be inherently logic. This means that most readers will accept it because they have experienced something similar in their lives. They'll be likely to take it no matter the circumstances of the story.But events also need to make sense inside the plot. Random events that don't cause a forward movement in the plot will weaken the story, its likeliness and therefore the reader's willingness to suspend their disbelief.It could seem that the suspension of disbelief is easier with stories that mimic reality, but is more needed with speculative stories with magical elements.This is not the case.It may be tempting to think that readers will accept stories that mimic reality more readily than speculative stories.Readers are indeed more likely to accept stories that happen in actual locations. Besides, when a place does exist, readers expect to 'recognise it'. For example, if I've visited New York, inaccurate details may break my suspension of disbelief and cause me to abandon the story.A speculative story generally needs more work on the suspension of disbelief, because the reader needs to make an initial step, conscious and hard, towards the fantastical environment. Some readers never take that step. But if they do, they'll be more tolerant towards the imagined world... as long as it is credible.But other important elements, such as coherence in characters' behaviours and logic in plot development, work in the same exact way whether the story is mimic or speculative.What convinces the reader to suspend their disbelief isn't the genre of the story. It is the skill with which the author creates characters, plots and conflicts.Sarah Zama wrote her first story when she was nine. Fourteen years ago, when she started her job in a bookshop, she discovered books that address the structure of a story and she became addicted to them. Today, she's a dieselpunk author who writes fantasy stories historically set in the 1920s. Her life-long interest in Tolkien has turned quite nerdy recently.She writes about all her passions on her blog https://theoldshelter.com/",,https://medium.com/the-gogs-and-gears-storyteller/suspension-of-disbelief-never-risk-to-lose-your-readers-emotional-involvement-in-your-story-664108607e4,fiction,81ed78db898c924e3a5307b233eccb90451c3bb87b96fa0d6ff57e5e
A Vacation Gone Terribly Wrong,"It's a strange year for the holidays. My partner and I, among our other roommates, decided to celebrate unconventionally, in hopes of fending off COVID for our families' and essential workers' sakes. Instead of risking going home for the holidays, we booked an air bnb and headed west.And let me tell you that Moab, Utah in the winter is a truly unique sight. You'd think you were on Mars if it weren't for the dustings of snow, desperately lingering Trump signs, and 40,000 Watt Christmas spectacles. Oh yes, we are on earth after all.No matter the season, Moab is the land of adventure. We awoke on day one with a blazing sense of purpose in this wonderfully strange terrain. Suddenly exposed to famous trails known around the world, gear quickly began flying around the living room of our poor air bnb. The dogs followed right at our heels, on to us and our uncovered, adventuring spirits.Like anyone reading this, we had been locked indoors for months now. Who hasn't been dying to get back at it? Whether that be exploring the expanses of the west, or the sweaty throttles of clubs, we all miss something from our pre-quarantine world. Moab was our gateway to feeling alive again, and we were bursting over the threshold.Soon enough, we plugged a trailhead into Google Maps and set off. My partner and I were driving up towards the grand La Sal mountains, to a trailhead known as Porcupine Rim. Any passionate mountain biker has heard of this trail. Part of what's known as ""The Whole Enchilada,"" the ride consists of 15 miles of epic decent over slick, red rock, and crisp, desert scenery. My partner Kyle had ridden it once years before, and we were on a mission to ride it together.""I don't remember any of this drive, it must be taking us up a back way,"" Kyle figured. ""Although, I was one of four people crammed into the backseat of a truck, so I can't say I saw much of anything.""As we rose a few thousand feet, we neared the trailhead. Our eyes scanned for a turn that would appear over the barren hill, ""Should be on the left...Now?""""Turn left,"" Siri said.Suddenly, the Subaru Outback rocked back and forth as we swerved onto a fire road. There were no tracks on the patches of snow, but the road itself had frozen tread marks of travelers past.""This can't be right, can it?""""It looks like there's another route with the same ETA..."" I scrolled the digital map, ""But it's also a fire road. What should we do?""""Your car, your decision.""""Might as well try it."" And so I gave my famous last words. We were only a few miles out, and GPS estimated 6 minutes. How bad could it be?*cue ominous evil laughter*Slowly, we winded along the increasingly snowy road.Surely, it began to descend.And descend, and descend.And suddenly, we were down a snowy hill, perched beside a barb wire gate.""Well shit,"" Kyle said. ""No way we're getting back up the way we came."" As we got out to look around, one option became clear. The winding road we were on seemed to connect to a dirt road, father down the canyon, although the intersection was obscured by the hills. As long as we could keep going down, there seemed to be a way out.Looking around, that was the only option among the minefields of rock and unruly terrain. Luckily, we could unhinge the gate to get the car through. My mountain biking shoes were covered in snow when I got back in the car.Kyle drove us through, parked, and got out to re-hinge the gate, ""So the farmer doesn't loose his cattle."" The invisible farmer tipped his hat to him.""Turn right"" Siri asserted.Down, down, down we went.Soon the trees were closing in. Their angry, incredibly dry branches clawed at my poor Subaru relentlessly.""I'm so sorry!"" Kyle said amongst the screams coming from my car.""It's ok!"" I lied, I was feeling each blood-curdling screech in my gut, ""You're getting us out of here!""""Turn Right"" Siri mocked ruthlessly.""What the hell, there's nothing but trees that way.""The car stopped.This is when the situation started to hit. We were in the middle of the unforgiving wilderness. We sure as hell didn't know how to get out, and Google Maps certainly didn't either. These ""fire roads"" were merely remnants of trails created to mend the fences that kept in cattle of generations past.I was starting to mentally log what kind of food and blankets we had in the car. When was the last time we saw a house? Another person? Could we hike out and look for other winter mountain bikers, on their way to the trailhead? No way AAA is making it out here... Do we leave the car and come back for it in the summer?I wanted to cry.Kyle was silent. He was accustom to being ""that guy,"" the one who finds himself in impossible situations; Once he was forced into a three point turn on an unguarded, cliff-side mountain road. Another time, his brakes failed at the top of, you guessed it, a mountain road. So yeah, Kyle had a history with unforgiving situations (mountain roads seem to be his forte). He wasn't particularly optimistic, but he sure as hell was going to be resilient.We soldiered on, opening and closing cattle gates, flooring it up single track hiking trails, cursing the branches and Siri who kept trying to allure us into death traps. Suddenly, we were forced into a stop yet again.The ditch ahead was far deeper than my little Subaru would prefer.""Are we building?"" I asked.""We're building."" Kyle confirmed.Strangely, I felt like a kid building a fort in the snowy backyard. It was as if we had nothing better to do as my gloves clawed at the frozen rocks to haul them to the ditch. We fit them together like puzzle pieces, as I'm sure I did on multiple lazy winter days in my childhood.Sure enough, our work paid off in ways 10 year-old Haley never could have dreamed; My Subaru lurched over our rock bridge and onto the ""road"" on the other side. Needless to say, it was a jumping high-five moment.And so we continued on, to our last test.""Hey, a house!"" Kyle pointed to a cabin alongside the road. ""We're doing it!""As we neared the cabin, it appeared to be deserted. Abandoned-chic, a skull hung ominously on the aged door. We kept driving.The dirt turned to gravel. Houses appeared on the hillside. Telephone poles and wires sprung out of the landscape ahead. We were so close. And then we rounded the bend.""You gotta be kidding me.""Once again, the car stopped.This gate was no cattle deterrent. Double pad-locked, the steel bars were chained with a purpose. I took this photo of the scenario below:But the best part was?We were locked inside.""No way the farmer saw this coming.""We got out to inspect the challenge. ""We could cut the barbed wire?"" I offered reluctantly.""Or..."" Kyle spun around to the car. After rummaging in the back he magically revealed a wrench. Of all things to bring on a bike ride; you could always trust Kyle to be prepared, especially when bikes are involved.Thus, we proceeded to take the heavily locked gate off its hinges, drive the car through, and put the gate back together. Kyle swears we left it better than we found it. I'm glad we didn't have to destroy your gate, or get arrested for trespassing, mystery Moab dweller....It was much funnier when Micheal and Dwight found themselves following GPS into a lake; sheer frustration soon gives way to panic as their car descends into a pond. Salvaging briefcases from the murky, shallow water, we laugh. Sure, we have all followed GPS down a wrong alley or two. But completely off the map? We would never take automated directions into such an over-the-top demise.Yeah, no. Apparently not.No matter how experienced you think you are, it is more than possible to make a few wrong turns; to become dangerously lost.As we drove out of the canyon to real road, the immensity of what almost happened set in.What if we didn't have a wrench?What if we had a little Honda instead of a Subaru?What if we had to hike out of there? Or spend the night in the car?Hell, there are so many ways that could have gone terribly, horribly wrong.""Is it possible to sue google, to soogle, if you will?"" I joked. ""Because maybe we should do some soogling later.""Kyle laughed and then turned somber. ""You know, I'm sorry,"" he sighed. ""Ever since we started dating I've gotten you into these oddball, crazy situations. I can't help but be ""that guy"" on every adventure. How is it possible? I have no clue.""""You know, I think its weirdly, in a backwards way, a blessing,"" I countered. ""I have never been so grateful for safety and routine as I am now.""Maybe that's part of why we seek out adventure. Every trip has its ""highs"" and ""lows."" Sure, the ""highs"" of canyon views and steep descents on two wheels are viscerally satisfying. They make me feel alive. But maybe the ""lows"" exist because they put the ""highs"" in perspective. They remind us that demise is right around the corner. Discomfort is real. And those descents? They feel extra good because you evaded that discomfort, when you realize you could have, but didn't fall. You persevered, you earned your comfort. How grounding.To put it crudely: The worse the bad gets, the better the good feels.There's a fine line between destruction and growth. Luckily, we treaded lightly and ended up with the latter.Despite the consequences, I realized that pushing this envelope of risk now and again is essential. Because ""good"" adventures are not the only ones that amount to something. I came out of that death-trap with a renewed appreciation for my partner, and respect for the outdoors and risk-taking.I developed a hatred for google maps, sure, but I also a rejuvenated my love of even the most dull, predictable qualities of life, even in quarantine. Hit me with hot chocolate and zoom calls, I've never been more ready.",https://miro.medium.com/max/7982/1*8dqxZ1u_o_jEhitpnMv-DQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/a-vacation-gone-terribly-wrong-c4821f65d2f0,travel,86bb63434161e114fca5ff5287cfcd1054f310c009bad2dbc48324fc
I'm a Very Popular Hermit,"Brophy sat down on his suitcase.Anyone else would have surrendered, but not him. He would enjoy his weekend in the wilderness.Night was falling fast. Birds or bats swooped overhead. The quiet felt ominous, like he was being watched with eager appetite.He squinted up at the stars, the sun-blessed clouds. Van Gogh hadn't been crazy - or even mildly delusional like Brophy. The sky really was waves of energy pulsating the music of the universe.It was too dark to take a picture to send to Audrey. She would see Brophy did not need an intervention, was not another one of her broken artists to coddle and flatter into yet another gallery show.Genius sells, but mad genius shatters sales records and builds her brand. Dead artists have always been her bestsellers.From somewhere behind him, a branch snapped.Brophy spun around. A slobbering hound from hell knocked him flat and panted drool on his chest.""Down, Skye!"" Her voice was clear, confident, and undeniable authority.The hound stood down, eying Brophy and licking its chops.""Who are you and why are you in my woods?""She was thirties-young, tall, lithe, and dark blonde. Her cool blue eyes assessed his threat. Folding her arms, she was grounded goddess.She probably had a gun.She definitely had a dog who couldn't wait to mangle him.Brophy sat up, holding his hands high.""Please don't kill me! I'm lost. My name is Brophy James and I'm trying to find Wild River Cabins.""""I'm not going to kill you. Too much trouble to get you out of here. You're only five miles from the resort."" She hacked a long, serious cough and spat into the leaves.Brophy stood up and stretched. ""Five miles, you say?"" He looked down at filthy jeans and ruined Italian leather boots.""Five miles. That way."" She pointed the way he'd come.She was shorter than she looked when he knew he was going to die.""That's the way I came."" He couldn't believe he'd have to hack through the woods again to get to a warm fire and featherbed luxury.""You took the wrong fork in the road.""He rubbed his hands together and stuck them in his pockets.She took a step back. ""Skye! Alert!""""Stop! I'm an artist, not a killer!""""Interesting how you happen to wandering around on private land the very day that my location was leaked to the media...."" She bit her lip, looked at her dog.""I don't know who you are. I'm just lost. And why would anyone care where you are?""""I am the most popular hermit in the world. My woods are infested with bloggers, journalists, and losers.""""Why you?""""I come from a long line of hermits. The Clancy's. No doubt you've heard of us.""""I haven't - and how is that even possible? How do you...have children?""""We're not total hermits. We live with the rest of the world until we can't take it any longer. Then we come here and recover.""""Do you...?"" He looked into her eyes. ""Who are your friends?""""You mean lovers? Believe me, my man, I have no problem attracting exactly what I need exactly when I need it.""The dog slumped onto the ground, lay his head on his paws.""Why do you think you wound up in my woods tonight?"" She smiled.A month later, Brophy's entire Hermit Series sold out the night of the opening.After the show, Audrey sent him to Wild River Cabins for another intervention/inspiration weekend.",https://miro.medium.com/max/5198/1*_XjUzy-YcnyJqMO7j87ShQ.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/im-a-very-popular-hermit-aa29a337483e,fiction,97ae821ff616ebff4d98eb017f20a9392d855e87e03f18a2914158a3
I Survived Devils River,"Our first clue that things weren't going to be easy was at the Del Rio, TX Border Patrol station when the agent asked us where we were going.""Devils River.""He stepped back and looked at our rental sedan.""You might make it.""Let me backtrack a bit. In the summer of 2020, my family drove to West Texas, first to visit Davis Mountains State Park and then on to Seminole Canyon State Park & Historic Site. This is Texas, remember, so these two places - both in the western part of the state- aren't exactly close. They were also both my idea, so when my water-loving spouse saw the online photos of Devil's River, he asked if we could make Seminole Canyon a half-day stop with the next day in the water. I was a little suckered in by the photos too, so I agreed.The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department purchased the 37,000 acres, once part of a working ranch, in 1988. Devils River State Natural Area is in Val Verde County, near Del Rio where we were staying. According to the park description, it contains three ecosystems: the Edwards Plateau, the Tamaulipan mezquital and the Chihuahuan Desert.Dolan Falls, the highest volume waterfall in Texas, is there too. And the Comanche, Kiowa and Kickapoo tribes once called the area home.In 'The Devils River: Wilderness Area Map Service,' Louis Aulbach wrote that pictographs of red panthers can be found in the area's 53 rock shelters, which archeologists date back to 3000 B.C. There is apparently a ""Buffalo dancer"" pictograph as well, representing a Native American.'The Encyclopedia of Indian Wars: Western Battles and Skirmishes, 1850-1890' says that future Confederate General John Bell Hood and a small U.S. Cavalry force fought with Comanche braves along the banks of the river in 1857. Also in 1873, Texas Ranger Captain Pat Dolan clashed with native residents, at the falls named for him. I'm very sure the indigenous people called it something else.There are less than 10,000 people who visit there each year. I didn't appreciate why until we made our ""little day trip.""""Call the ranger station,"" my husband said. ""And ask them what's up.""In the little window of time I had cell service, I called the park. The ranger said that once we turned off the main road, there was a gravel road that would take about 45 minutes to drive.""Go slow,"" she said. ""We don't want you to pop a tire.""Maybe now is the time to mention that Del Rio was the hottest U.S. city on record that day, at 113 degrees. We did, thankfully, pack plenty of water.The gravel road turned out to be more like a big rock road. After five minutes of bouncing up and down, I was so damn grateful that the idea had not been mine. If the trip was a complete bust, it wouldn't be my fault.One hour, one baby javelina, three roadrunners, and 10 ranch entrances later, we made it to the ranger station. I was greeted there by name since I was the only person who had bought a day pass for the river on that day. Go figure.Once parked in the lot, there was another mile walk to get to the river. I thought to turn it into a game for my kids and said the first person to see the water was the winner. No one saw the water. I started to panic. We were all beginning to turn on each other. And then - at last - there we were.I've only seen water that color along 30A in Florida and the Caribbean. It was clear. It was green and blue. And except for the birds and fish, we had it all to ourselves.Because the land on either side was privately owned, there was no looking for cave art. But that was OK because as I mentioned, it was fry-an-egg hot. We stuck to the water.Eventually, we made it down to Dolan Falls, and then back up to where the spring water flows into the river, a shock of welcome cold.At one point, I left my crew downriver and came back to our starting point. Alone, watching fish at my feet and a cliff rising in front, I felt perfectly content. Not an easy feat in these turbulent times.The drive out wasn't any better than the drive in, but we were all in agreement. Devils River was an adventure that was totally worth it.If you enjoyed this piece, you might like this one too...",https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1*PO3bwRCs-AFsJHPOAlAAyg.jpeg,https://medium.com/weeds-wildflowers/i-survived-devils-river-84d6e3382573,travel,135f02f59135f52d4e9c51aace5e85f36a6f56c79b6f76c592f93da7
Double B Coming and Going,"Who gives a boy a name like that growing up in a tiny river town of less than a thousand residents in Jefferson County, Missouri? With most boys running around the softball field with names like Jimmy and Johnny, Boyce Brady didn't have half a chance but to stand out as different.But different would finally be OK where he was heading in a few days. At 19, Boyce Brady would break away from Grandma Ronnie's clutches and board a bus to his destiny.""Gam,"" he'd said to Grandma Ronnie, ""I'm a misfit in this town and I've got to go where people will understand me. I won't be no 'Double B Coming and Going' no more!""He made that declaration at Christmas just before his last semester at Festus High. His mom had wanted her son to attend St. Pius but she'd passed away just after his fourteenth birthday and there was no money for such things in Grandma Ronnie's estimation. Public school would be good enough for Boyce, she decided, maybe even straighten up his quirks. Toughen him up.She held on to a secret, though, that a fund had been established years ago in Boyce's name for college. She had been putting her coins away in a special place for years just for him. And for that, she could be patient and help him get through the high school days.But for Boyce Brady, high school was one long, tormented day after day of being the source of everyone's laughter. It was nothing Gam could help him with, he was on his own.""What are you, Boyce Brady?"" the kids would ask.""You're not a boy, you don't play football or go out with girls. What kinda name you got anyhow? Where is the Boy in Boyce!"" they would taunt.Somewhere along the line he became BB, then Double B. Then by the ninth grade it turned into Double B Coming and Going, and it stuck because no one could make heads or tails of Boyce Brady. Now, in just a few days he was headed to Missouri State in Springfield. Springfield! Population 136,040. And soon to be 136,041. He was beyond excited but for one important detail.Leaving his only friend behind.In the summer after eighth grade, Boyce Brady went to camp at Bear River Ranch, back when his mom was still alive and was able to save her tips from waiting tables at the Stoplight Cafe. She thought it was important for Boyce to go to camp with the other boys, hoping for a blossoming to occur. He watched as the boys paired off with girls behind the latrines to kiss and tell about it in their A-frame cabins each night, bragging about things they didn't actually do. Boyce just sat in the corner listening, hoping not to be noticed.""BB, what about you. Hey. Double B! Why aren't you kissing anyone, huh? You don't know how to kiss a girl, BB?""But Boyce Brady was kissing someone. Back home, not at camp. Boyce was kissing Anh. Anh Thuong Johnson. Anh had explained his name to Boyce on a walk home from school one day when they happened to walk the same route and ""might as well walk together.""""Anh means Intelligent One. But the kids calls me Andy,"" he said, flashing a bright toothy smile set inside delicate brown features, shining eyes and thick black hair. Anh was the son of a Vietnam vet and his bride from Hanoi who settled in Missouri to work in a nearby factory and raise their son.A few weeks later, Anh invited Boyce over one afternoon during spring break. With his parents at work, the two boys filled up the baby pool on an unusually warm spring day, grabbed the Johnson's mutt Momo, stripped down to their underwear and splashed around until they got hungry for sandwiches of baloney, individually sliced American cheese and Miracle Whip on white bread.When it was time for Boyce to go home, Anh walked him to the door and reached in for a hug. Taken by surprise, Boyce stood with his arms at his sides then gradually reached around to hug Anh back, feeling a kind of warmth he had not known before. As they pulled apart, Anh kissed Boyce lightly on the cheek.""See you tomorrow!"" he said, with a little wave, then turned on his heel with Momo running alongside.Every day that week Boyce returned to Anh's house to play cards or Yahtzee, get in the pool or watch TV and make sandwiches after. They talked about how they were both going to get out of that town one day. During an episode of Gilligan's Island, the one where Mary Anne gets amnesia and wakes up and thinks she's Ginger, gets up on stage in Ginger's clothes and tries to sing but fails miserably, Anh turned to Boyce.""Don't you think we can be anyone we want to be? I do not want to pretend to be someone I'm not. What about you, Boyce? You are not Double B, after all. Who are you? Who do you want to be?"" he probed.Boyce wasn't sure what Anh meant exactly but he could feel its meaning somewhere deep in the sanctuary of his heart. That this was, in fact, precisely true but something he could not yet articulate was enough of an answer to that question. And a silent nod to Anh was confirmation, Defiant and firm. Absolute and right.""I am Boyce Brady,"" he said quietly.""Let me tell you more about my name,"" Anh said softly, pulling a piece of errant hair back off Boyce's forehead as he spoke.""Thuong means One Who Loves Tenderly,"" he said, looking deeply into Boyce for understanding.He leaned in for a kiss on the mouth. Boyce didn't hesitate, he knew just what he wanted with Anh, that it was mutual and without shame or prejudice. The two embraced and kissed again. They giggled and hugged afterwards, sharing a new-found freedom together, a liberating moment of long-awaited peace and understanding. Belonging.The two carried on a secret romance for the years to come right into high school, all the while guarding their secret affection, knowing that their town would not understand their friendship and love for each other. Though Boyce never wanted to say the word out loud, he knew he was at the very least bisexual because he sometimes liked to watch the Miss America Pageant with Gam.He didn't know anything for certain, not yet, but he knew that Springfield was an open door to find out one way or another just who Boyce Brady was. Who Boyce Brady could and would become. Anh had helped him get part of the way there and now the rest was up to him.As senior year approached, they accepted their fate and honored each other's needs and choices. Anh, whose parents were unable to pay for college, would remain behind but their last few days before Boyce's departure were spent together at Anh's house, their special sanctuary, for hours on end talking and laughing and crying and holding each other. And holding all that they shared together, tightly and dearly in mutual respect and gratitude.""It's time we get you to the bus station, Boyce, gather up your things,"" Gam yelled out from the kitchen where she was washing up the last of the breakfast dishes.The day had finally arrived. Boyce was excited, nervous, happy and sad all at once. Leaving his grandmother alone made him anxious but he knew his time to shine was now.""Coming,"" Boyce yelled back to Gam.""And Going,"" he whispered under his breath.Pulling his suitcase on wheels into the kitchen, Boyce spoke.""Gam, I just need to make one stop on the way to the bus station.""Pulling up to Anh's house, he got out and walked slowly to the mailbox, gazing across the lawn at the front door to Anh's home and heart. That door that had opened wide into a place of awakening. Knowing that Anh's parents were at work and Anh himself away at his job as a clerk at a store at the new mall in town, he slipped the envelope with Anh's name on it, tightly sealed with two layers of Scotch tape, into the box marked Johnson.As he made his way back to the car and forward towards his new life, he recited in his head the simple message to his friend who was the illuminating light in his life:My Dearest Anh Thuong, Intelligent One Who Loves Tenderly,Thank you for showing me I can be anyone I want to be.May we both be free to be whoever and whatever that isforever and ever amen.I Love You Always,Boyce Brady. . .From the Life Lines collection, © Mary Corbin 2020marycorbinwrites.commarycorbinart.comJoin our free newsletter & keep up to date with new authors and help readers & writers connect!",https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*kv5VcZUMAmkdvFxIU0Pphw.jpeg,https://medium.com/written-tales/double-b-coming-and-going-fd745292a566,fiction,169dd9d1b56bc0a6f9b64d724ddb3727d60a2a151e0cfa1e6b102d01
"What's wrong with calling it ""spin""?","I received an email the other day that said ""Let the spin machine go into action."" While I understand the order, I'm not a fan of the sentiment. Spinning is great for turntables, spiders, and the aptly named spinning wheel. Heck, I'm even OK with Dead or Alive telling their object of affection that they spin them right round. But when it comes to public relations or marketing, spin is bad.Let me explain.The term spin doctor started appearing in the late 1970s and was used largely to refer to public relations professionals working in politics in the US and UK (Valentini, 2016). Basically, it refers to the act of putting a positive light on something that's not so great. If a politician has some unsavory history, a spin doctor could push it under the rug and highlight all the positives things someone has done. Or turn the misdeeds into lessons and learnings for everyone. As a result, the term ""spin"" is associated with shady behaviour - making something bad seem not so bad.Public relations practitioners and communications professionals (I tend to use the term interchangeably) follow a code of ethics. Whether it's from the International Association of Business Communicators, the Public Relations Society of America, the American Marketing Association, or the Canadian Public Relations Society (or any other marketing or public relations organization in the world), there is a code of ethics that we must abide by. In each one of these codes is a commitment to be honest, to communicate accurate information.As we have seen with the rise of 24-hour news channels and social media, the truth will eventually come out. If you tell a story and fudge some facts because it will distract from the positive points, that's spin. If you try to hide information, that's spin.When used out of context, the term ""spin"" only serves to reinforce the belief that public relations practitioners are untrustworthy. In my case, the story I was asked to put in the spin machine was already a positive story. There was nothing to hide about any of it. But the person who said it to me wanted the story to be promoted and shared. I understood that, but using ""spin"" was not the way to make that point.Our jobs are hard enough as it is. Using outdated language to describe our work makes it even harder, and only perpetuates the stereotype that all communications or marketing professional are untrustworthy, always trying to sell something, or hide from the facts.Instead of ""Let's spin this,"" say ""Let's tell this story"".Instead of ""Let's put a positive spin on this"" say ""Let's share the facts as we know them"". (Because sometimes there isn't a positive angle to take on a story.)Being honest and telling the truth goes so much farther for an organization than hiding behind jargon and half-truths. Save the spin for fitness studio.",https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1*-SNEYKfe1zga4Yfy31F7-w.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/whats-wrong-with-calling-it-spin-e08168b031de,marketing,250e5565a8191651849822944caaa6b7accfe8f32ba9c63689504763
Chair,"Vivian. Now she is a real one of a kind. Sturdy and dependable. Independent. Colorful and bright.A stroll up Walnut Street to the farmer's market would take her under five minutes from her northside apartment. It was a weekly occurrence every Tuesday afternoon. Donning a pastel floral dress to match the mood of the emerging summer weather, she grabbed her basket - the one she got in France a few years ago - turned the key on the lock and skipped down her front steps.""Hey, Viv!"" Franklin yelled out to her from his front balcony on the third floor. ""You off to market?""""Yep. See ya there?"" she asked.""I have to take Tilly to the vet, so no,"" Franklin said. ""Hey. Could you pick me up a couple baskets of strawberries and I'll pay ya later?""Vivian waved her answer to Franklin and skipped away.A chair. Sitting on the opposite corner of her apartment building, seemed to beckon her attention. As she approached it, she slowed to a stop. It was an old wooden thing with part of its wicker seat missing. Vivian stopped to inspect it. Take in its size and shape, its general demeanor.I could maybe fix that seat, she thought. I suppose it's for the taking, just sittin' there like that. I like the color . . .She grabbed the top of the chair, moved it around looking for wobbles. Remembering that she was on another mission at the moment, she let it go and headed for the market.. . .Franklin stood on the stoop of Vivian's apartment ringing the doorbell. He could hear her shuffle as she approached from the other side. Smiling, she opened the door with his strawberries set into a paper box in her left hand.""Thanks, Viv!""""How's Tilly, she ok?""""Oh, yeah. Just time for some shots. She hates the vet, though, you know. So do I. Anyway, thanks for the strawberries. How much do I owe you?""""Nothing. Invite me up for shortcake or something,"" Vivian said.Peering over Franklin's shoulder, Vivian could see the chair was no longer on the corner.""Shoot.""Franklin turned around to see what she was looking at and saw nothing unusual.""What is it?""""Oh, nothing. Well. A chair. Did you see it? Someone left it out on the corner. I thought I might do something with it.""Franklin shrugged, the conversation turned to something else and as he ambled down the steps to return to the main entrance to the upper units, Vivian lingered in the doorway, leaning forward in the direction of where the chair had been, as though it might magically reappear.. . .Carrying her bicycle down her front steps on Friday morning, she leaned it up against the fence to put her helmet on. Sliding her cycling gloves on and securing the velcro, she did a double take as she caught sight of it. There it was, but a few feet down the street from its original perch. She walked her bicycle over to it for another look.Maybe someone took it and changed their mind, didn't quite fit, she pondered.She didn't have much time as she was already running late for a doctor's appointment. As she was stepping through her bike, she noticed a swath of pink on the right arm of the chair.Hmm. Was that there before?When she returned two hours later, the chair was, again, gone.. . .Vivian paced about her apartment wondering who had taken the chair this time. Why did it even matter, it was just a chair. Why did she think she had any right to it any more than the next person, anyway? She found herself peeking through her living room curtain in the direction of the chair as sunlight filtered through the trees, landing on the empty spot where the chair used to be. A spotlight, waiting for its soliloquy.It reappeared once, right? It could happen again.The moon would be almost full tonight, she knew, she could check on it later.But the weekend came and went without the chair. Vivian tended to her usual things. Cleaning, cooking, enjoying a strawberry dessert with Franklin upstairs in his apartment. Listening to Miles Davis wafting on a warm breeze from a neighbor's living room through open windows. Preparing canvases for fresh color and story. Reading. Writing in her journal. Coffee with her girlfriends.Monday rolled around and as she left for work in the morning, there it was.Making another southward movement from the corner of its origin, the chair was now a few more feet from its previous perch. She skipped over to take a look. Someone had repaired the rip in the seat.But why fix it only to abandon it, she wondered.Looking up, she heard her bus approaching, pulled her pass from her pocket, crossed the street and got on board. Taking a seat near the back, she turned to get a last glance at the chair. Once again, it would have to await its fate with her.. . .Returning home from work, of course the chair was missing from its spot. At mid-day, she had even considered phoning Judith, her elderly neighbor.Couldn't she bring it to my porch? No. I shouldn't bother her, it can wait.She walked down the street to the end of the block, just in case someone had moved it again but it was nowhere in sight. She walked up and down the cross street to no avail. Defeated, she sauntered home, changed into her sweatpants, poured a glass of wine, began to draw a bath and sat down on her couch to contemplate the chair.Leaving her phone behind, she checked the bath, dropped in some essential oils, turned off the faucet and climbed in, sinking into the welcome depth of relaxation and wandering thoughts.Emerging later from the bath and throwing on her robe, Vivian shuffled to her front window, pulled back the curtain and peered out. No chair. Sitting down on the couch, she noticed a text had come in on her phone from two hours ago.Oh. From Dr. Eugene, hmm.It was a terse message simply requesting that she call her first thing in the morning. Scrolling through her phone briefly, she set her phone down and wandered into the kitchen to throw some dinner together.. . .""It may be nothing at all, but we should do the other tests to be certain.""""Sure, Dr. Eugene. Um. What's the worst that can happen? I mean, should I be worried, or what should I be worried about?"" Vivian asked.""Let's do the tests and then we can discuss the results. Try not to worry.""Vivian hung up the phone feeling worried anyway, of course. She scheduled her visit with her doctor for Wednesday at three. Until then, she would just have to be patient and calm. There was a genetic pre-disposition, she knew, but she couldn't think about that now.Dr. Eugene said not to worry.The day dragged on and she did her best to stay occupied. Distracted. Getting off the bus carrying groceries she'd picked up on her way home from work, she was walking slowly towards her building when it came into view.That's it, isn't it?It had continued on its journey south and was now at the top of the next block under the stop sign. Picking up her pace she arrived at the chair with a laugh.""You're back!"" she said, as though it was an old friend returned from a trip.""But you're . . . different, somehow.""She eyed the chair in its new incarnation. Its seat was fully restored now, the arms painted in turquoise. The legs were still a tan color except for one, the rear right leg had been partially painted in pink and gold.""You wait right here while I drop my groceries off. Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back!"". . .The new day came with some anxiety. She wished she had made her appointment for the morning instead of having to wait all day.Soon enough. Stay calm.Walking out onto her stoop with her coffee, the chair was gone!She'd left it on her porch and someone had come and taken it.What the...!Padding down the steps, she peered down the block where she had found it. Not there. Looking in all directions, it was nowhere in sight. Going back inside and closing the door, she got ready for work, a bit perturbed about the missing chair.. . .When Vivian got off the bus that afternoon, her medical tests done, the alarming results revealed, she had all but forgotten the chair. As she approached her building, she saw Judith in her front garden, on all fours. She was chatty and would hold you hostage if you let her but Vivian welcomed the distraction today.The elderly woman was pointing out how well her roses were doing along the front fence, the warming weather, the extra watering that would need to be done, when Vivian noticed the chair. Sitting peacefully. Solitary. Having moved back up the block towards her, not quite at its original starting place but somewhere in between. She excused herself from Judith and walked down the street for a good look.It's the same chair, isn't' it?It seemed so, yet someone had changed its colors again, it sat dismal in muted grays and brown. It would hardly be of any use to her now.. . .""You believe in reincarnation?"" Vivian asked.Franklin had arrived home just as she was sitting down on her front stoop. He had joined her on the steps, the two of them facing out towards the street, talking idly.""Mmm. I'm not sure,"" he said. ""I believe in reinvention. Exploring all the different parts of ourselves while we are alive. All the various sides and angles, potential colors.""""Yeah, you're kind of a master of that,"" Vivian said.And he was. A musician, an artist, a great cook. A carpenter, a fix-it guy. A waiter by day, and so much more the rest of the time.Vivian started to tear up, leaning her head onto his shoulder. She began to reveal her story to him, the test results, what was ahead of her in the coming months. They sat quietly then, watching the world go by, the sun slowly lowering in the sky.. . .""Thanks for the lift, Alison,"" Vivian said, slowly getting out of her friend's car, returning from her usual treatment.""Want me to stay a bit?"" Alison asked, leaning down to look through the passenger side window from her seat behind the wheel.""No, no. I'm fine. I'm just gonna take a nap, anyway. Thanks again, friend,"" she said, giving a wave.As the car pulled away from the curb, the chair was revealed.There it was sitting at its original starting place. Vivian went over for a look, to say hello to a long-lost friend. It had been months since she'd seen it, where must it have been! The seat had been completely gutted, the arms and legs, the back of the chair discolored by someone, a novice someone, having attempted to strip it clean of its paint.Vivian stood with the chair, under the stop sign, face to face with it, in solidarity. In recognition of its difficult journey.. . .She sat with her morning coffee on the stoop. The weather was changing again, getting cool enough for a sweater, even for late morning. Franklin came out the door of the main part of the building, coffee mug in hand. They often met up there on a Saturday morning if the timing was right. Sitting next to her on the stoop, he noticed the new addition to her porch.""That's a fine-looking chair, Viv,"" he said, nodding at it then looking back to her with a smile.Vivian smiled back, feeling some clarity finally. That she had turned a corner, moved forward just a little bit. Woken up anew. She turned her gaze back outward.""It is, isn't it. Sturdy, dependable,"" she beamed. Taking a sip from her mug.""So colorful and bright!"" Franklin added. ""Aren't you worried someone will come and steal it off your porch, though?""""Nah,"" she said. ""If they need it, they can have it.""Silence.But for a few crows chasing each other across the sky.""Funny. How a nearly imperceptible change - a little tweak here, a bit of color there, can change the way you see a thing,"" Vivian said.""I'm not sure what you . . ."" Franklin started.""Like a chair. Left on a corner. Just in need of a little work. Some re-invention. I thought it was so important for me to have it, to give it new life. But every time I saw it again, it was never the same chair. It changed. Or I did, I don't know.""Franklin scratched his chin, not quite grasping her meaning or how to respond. Set his coffee mug down on the step next to him. She looked at him then turned her gaze across the street to the corner across from their building. Barren. Just concrete squares and a stop sign.""You okay, Viv?"" he asked, rubbing her back with his palm.Silence.""How awake are we, do you think?"" she said, still gazing out across the street. ""I mean. Franklin, what do we notice? What do we miss? Do we feel the passage of time, the incremental movement farther and farther away, second by second . . . inch by inch?""She turned to look him squarely in the eyes for an answer.""I don't know, Vivian. I'm not sure how awake I really am half the time,"" he said, with a little laugh, releasing his arm from her and reaching for his mug.""Mmm,"" she murmured. ""Yeah.""""What say you, Viv?""""Mostly? I think we're just sittin' there watching the world go by. Waiting. For something or someone to come along and make us feel of use. If we're lucky, we find a good collaborator or two to help things along,"" she said.Franklin nodded, looking over at her staring off across the street. He knew she was measuring time differently than he was. Counting it out in her head. They sat in silence together. A woman in a Toyota slowed down at the stop sign opposite their building. Getting out of her car, she ran to the back, opened the trunk and pulled a small table out and set it on the sidewalk.. . .From The Tenants collection, © Mary Corbin 2020marycorbinwrites.commarycorbinart.com",https://miro.medium.com/max/6912/0*O_-QaZS4MUIXHAQF,https://medium.com/scuzzbucket/chair-ef4d701f74fa,fiction,454e51c1f256024510a3284e03e338910b947820adaaae75785568ad

How to be a Migrant (short story),"Ever since Hossein Malekzadeh turned in his visa application, any knock at the door, any phone call, and any time he heard his name yelled in public made him jump. Were the police after him again? When the IRGC inevitably arrested him, would he be so lucky to get released a second time?So he heard a knock and jumped. He tiptoed to the door. He straightened his posture in a way he thought an innocent person might. Then, he cracked it open to find Mariam, his old girlfriend. She was holding bananas, mangos, and his favorite: pomegranates.She breathed a sigh of relief, as if she were glad he was still alive.""No one has seen you for weeks,"" she explained. ""I thought you might be sick."" She pushed the fruit into his hands.Since the recent death of Hossein's father the lacquer box maker, Miriam was the only person who risked coming to see him. It was making it that much harder to leave. He took the bag of fruit, and backed away from the threshold. ""I'm feeling a bit sick today."" He shut the door.He decided to take a journey to Darband, his favorite place in Tehran, in the north of the city near the Tajrish bazaar, overlooking the city's chaos and pollution. Here he had passed the best - and worst - days of his life.Here he held hands with a girl for the first time, and here a year later, right by the fountain, he kissed Miriam gently on the lips when no one was watching.It was dawn, during the years of hope. Khatami was president, and every month gave birth to new possibilities. Hijabs were getting looser. Men started wearing t-shirts in public.But the most important change was not about clothing: reform was underway. Here too, during the years of darkness, after he graduated from the University of Tehran, had he sought consolation in poetry.Russian literature was his major and his passion, and, he had read, in fits of delirium, the Russian poets who wrote of atrocities even worse than those he had witnessed: Mayakovsky, Mandelstam, Tsvetaeva. Here too he had come immediately after his release from prison.Sure, he experienced discrimination when universities refused to hire him because he would not cooperate with the IRGC, but he consoled himself that many brave souls before him had faced greater challenges. So long as he kept a low profile, he knew he could avoid arrest.When he arrived at the Tajrish metro station at the end of line #1, he hurled himself into a taxi headed in the direction of the park. He felt like he was being chased by a merciless demon. He opened the door before the taxi stopped and rushed up the steep slope leading to the park.He perched himself above a waterfall, and gazed at the foothills of the Alborz mountains in the distance. Snow-capped Mt. Damavand lingered on the horizon.""With all this fear,"" he said aloud to himself, after checking that no one could hear him, ""Why do I even bother? Every change comes with risks. Leaving home is always dangerous. But lovers of freedom cannot expect peace."" After a pause, he added, ""Soon, I'll be thirty-five. By the time dad was this age, he had a career and a future.""Although no one had been listening at first, passers-by had begun to stare at him as if he were possessed. It felt good to be uttering the words that had been buried in his heart for too long. There was no one left to assuage his grief. He was an orphan. His audience was the river, the trees, and his beloved Darband, where the river flowed like champagne.When the crowd became too dense for him to complete his soliloquy to the waterfall, he took metro line #1 back to his temporary home on the edge of Honarmandan, the park named for all the artists who worked there. Located in Iranshahr Street, Honarmandan honoured creators like himself: sculptors, visual artists, playwrights. The park even had its own theatre, Tamashakhaneh, right in the center.Walking through the sculpture garden reminded him of the many sweet days he had spent there, watching plays by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, David Mamet, and Rita Dove, sometimes alone and sometimes with Miriam, who dreamed of becoming an actress, before she gave up and left him for a man who was willing to have children with her and support her financially.From that small corner of Tehran, anything seemed possible. No law had the power to destroy his life or to deny him a career. He then consoled himself: surely the theatres of St. Petersburg were just as captivating as those in Tehran.Exactly two years ago, he had been arrested for his cartoons of the Ayatollah. They were not intended to cause offense; he had hoped to show the human side of this revered figure. He thought of it as a way of paying homage, to humanize the leader of his country.Hossein did not publicize the cartoons himself; he knew better than that. But once at a party with university friends, they were sharing what they did for fun. He mentioned that he liked to draw cartoons. When the students asked what they were about, he could not resist telling the truth. Perhaps it was his bragging, or perhaps it was the simple yearning of an artist to have his work known. Whatever it was, it landed him in jail.Not immediately. Everyone at the party expressed admiration for his courage and promised to keep his secret. He had no reason to believe that anyone who heard him speak had any particular reverence for the Ayatollah. Still, Hossein could easily guess the culprit: one of the more obsequious students who gushed over his talent and asked if he could copy some of the images for himself. He had always dreamed that someday somewhere his images might give someone pleasure.The next thing he knew he had a huge following on all social media, including those banned within Iran: Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, and Facebook. It was then that the authorities began to pay attention.He was arrested and handed a ten-year sentence in Evin for defaming the Islamic Republic. Then suddenly, in one of those arbitrary miracles that made life in the Islamic Republic so unpredictable, the prison authorities decided to have mercy on him. It was Nowruz, the beginning of the Iranian New Year when prisoners were typically selected for pardons. Citing his compliant behaviour while in prison, they let him go three months after he entered. There was only one catch: he had to promise to never draw cartoons again.The fresh breeze had caressed his face after he exited Evin. He remembered all the friends whom he was leaving behind in their cells. When would they be free?The prison guard yelled at him from a distance, ""Go home! Start your life over again, far from here. It may be your last chance.""Since turning eighteen, he had been reading Soviet poetry. Vicariously, he had relived the executions of Mandelstam and Gumilyev, the suicide of Tsvetaeva, and the banishment of Brodsky. He knew what awaited poets who felt compelled to speak the truth to power.Hossein was confident that he would be spared such a fate, not because he did not fear his jailors, but because he knew he was not made to be a martyr. If he were ever pressured again, he would bend. This too was why he had to leave. If he was ever to have a career, to become a man like his father, that could only ever happen outside Iran. It took him more than fifteen years - and his father's death - to fulfill his plan.Finally, one bright Friday morning, a letter arrived from the embassy, wrapped in bright blue tape. He tore open the envelope to find a one-month tourist visa to the Russian Federation, but he would extend it once he got there. He would claim asylum, like the Christians and Bahais. Or find someone to sponsor him. He would do whatever he had to do in order to stay.St. Petersburg at last! He hurried to the travel agency on Vali Asr Street and booked a ticket for next Friday, using the money that his father had bequeathed to him in his will, with the proviso that he use it to learn how to become a man.There was a lot more to learn than language. He planned to set up shop on Liteinyi Prospect, honouring his father by selling his carefully crafted lacquer boxes, with poetic inscriptions on the insides and on the tops, intermingling verses of Hafez, Sadi, and Rumi. All his life he had refused to carry on his father's craft, but now his father was dead and it was all he had. He would become a street artist, an everyday craftsman. And maybe, just maybe, his new self would discover freedom for the first time, far from the land of his birth.On the day of his flight, he awoke at dawn. He wanted to see his beloved country when no one else was looking. How he would miss the mountains of his homeland!Mt. Damavand, hovering high on the edge of the horizon.Ramsar, the town of his birth, where he lived before he moved to Tehran to attend university.The Mazandarani dialect that his mother used to speak to him while rocking him to sleep in her arms.The Caspian Sea with its fresh fish, that scientists said was becoming radioactive, but which seemed to him to simply be gaining in iridescence.The forgotten white beaches, their sand covering him in oblivion.The white marble hotel owned by Reza Pahlavi, a relic of an era that had vanished by the time he was born.Unlike his parents, he could not feel nostalgia for Iran before the revolution. Unlike his friends who had migrated to the United States, the UK, and Germany, he had passed his life in Iran without ever wishing to leave.He was not good enough to become a professional box maker for the Iranian bazaar, but in Russia, his boxes might - he hoped - become exotic curiosities. He would make a living, finally, as a cliché of himself, a stereotype of the wandering Iranian dissident, shipwrecked in a foreign country.Still, Iran felt like his destiny. He did not despise the revolution. He admired the anticolonial ideologies of early revolutionary thinkers like Ali Shariati, and their solidarity with oppressed peoples everywhere. He just doubted that the revolution had achieved its aims.What would Shariati think of what the Islamic Republic had become, he wondered? Streets were named after Shariati, but wasn't that always what happened to revolutionaries, who die conveniently before the revolution begins?He understood why the shah had to go. What he didn't understand was why it continued, growing more corrupt every year. Revolutionary fervor begat bloodshed, and bloodshed begat corruption. Before you knew it, there was no difference between an atheist state and a theocratic one.None of it mattered anymore. He had his visa in hand, and he was leaving Iran later that morning, to start a new life somewhere on the other side of the Alborz mountains, first in St. Petersburg, and then in the Caucasus, closer to home.Given his recent experience in Evin, Hossein was worried about what might happen at the border. To his relief, he passed through passport control without being interrogated. The line was long, and the guards seemed to be in a hurry. They barely checked his passport and did not ask where he was headed.They did however ransack his bags, as they did with everyone passing through. All they found were bottles of sealed rosewater, which he had planned to give as gifts in Russia. Or to sell on the black market, if he didn't manage to make any friends. He had deleted all his private data before entering the airport.There was an hour left before his flight was due to depart. He wandered through the food court, staring at the different ice-cream flavours displayed behind the glass: pistachio, saffron, sour cherries. Faloodeh, sweet frozen noodles in rosewater. Koloocheh, stuffed with cinnamon and walnuts. Sohan, made of saffron. And his favorite: gaz, made of nougat and pistachios.The intercom blared with the number of his flight: Tehran-St. Petersburg, Aeroflot 211. St. Petersburg, the city built on water. He couldn't wait to wander along the Neva under the blazing white sky, accompanied by the ghosts of Mandelstam and Akhmatova. Now was the chance to live the dream that had percolated during his university years, back when he imagined himself becoming a university professor, or entering some other respectable profession: lawyer, doctor, banker. Now, instead, he was going to become a box maker.There were certain advantages to obscurity. For one, you were less likely to be spied on by the authorities.Petersburg, I don't want to die, he began to hum the lyrics of Mandelstam to the tune of Alla Pugacheva. He remembered Mandelstam's poem comparing Stalin's moustache to cockroaches, and told himself he would never write like that. His days of dangerous living were over. He just had to learn to abandon his old self. In becoming a migrant, he would also become a man.""I have to try,"" he told himself, mumbling aloud just as he had done in Darband. ""Revolution might be the only solution,"" he mumbled, "" I don't want to get swept up in it. I am made to be a migrant, not a martyr.""He recalled the prophetic words of Lermontov, who had been exiled to the Caucasus in 1837 after writing a poem critical of the tsar. It was one of the many poems he had memorized during his first year at the university. Back then, he could never have guessed what they would mean to him now. Lermontov's words resounded in him like a prayer to a God unknown:He composed a variation on Lermontov's poem*:It was the first poem he ever wrote. He expected it would be the last.""But unlike Lermontov, I will return someday,"" he mumbled.And then, louder, he questioned his words: ""Will I ever return? For what? To visit my father's grave?""He stood frozen in the airport, speaking to the air. The closed circuit TV was monitoring him, just as it had been for most of his life. He checked his watch. 8PM, exactly when evening performances began in the Honarmandan theatre.He stepped onto the plane. As soon as he sat down, he closed his eyes and imagined he was flying. The plane hoisted him high over Mt. Damavand.He remembered his father and the lessons he had taught him in modesty as they crafted pen boxes together when they lived in Ramsar, before he entered the university.""The artist must forget himself and his ego,"" he used to say to his son, ""in order to create works of beauty.""Didn't his favorite writer, Dostoevsky, once claim that beauty would save the world? As the plane soared above the earth, he regretted how little he had heeded his words. Now, all he could hope for was that the plane would make a U-turn in the sky.When he was detained at the border soon after his arrival in St. Petersburg, with his bag full of undeclared goods, he was hardly surprised at all. The Iranian authorities had been tracking him ever since he left the airport, but had decided to let him cross the border first, before he was arrested by their partners in Russia. He would be more useful to the Iranian authorities in the prisons of Russia.But then again, he'd been let out of prison once for good behavior. Why not twice?*The Lermontov poem is translated by Rebecca Ruth Gould.Thanks for reading!

The Day I Killed Jesus and Flashed a Whole Restaurant,"I arrive at the restaurant to meet my friend, Bob, for lunch. He is late, so we immediately sit down and order our $3 ""Chicks and Eggs"" special with a couple of steaming cups of joe. Our chosen meeting place is ChickenHaus, a Garland staple, at least if the staple was rusted nearly in half and stained with a century of nicotine vapors. The old vinyl booths have cracks that could pinch a plug out of a bare thigh and the tables are so de-laminated that getting a splinter while enjoying an afternoon meal is a high probability. Nonetheless, for those of us that grew up here, it feels like home.Bob and I catch up in the way that friends do when they're with someone that is truly one of their tribe. Six months or six minutes, our rapport returns like a rehearsed Laurel and Hardy routine. We've had our differences over the last few years but much like ChickenHaus, Bob is broken and stained but feels like home.Bob's antiquated flip phone rings and he answers with a ""Yep.""""ChickenHaus,"" he cries after a moment and hangs up, smiling triumphantly. ""Mom and the fam are joining us, Kitten.""I think Bob plans it this way on purpose because he's afraid to be alone with me. It happens nearly every time we get together. I think sometimes Bob's passion for life overtakes him and any woman in mating range risks getting caught up in the current of pheromones. Our one and only kiss, which surprised us both, ended with a mutually resounding, ""Yuck."" We both agreed it felt like kissing a cousin, and by that, I mean a first cousin and illegal, not to mention immoral. No judgment though, Bob, if that just felt normal to you.But I never mind these additions to our dates. Bob's family is golden, salt of the earth people. And by that, I mean salty as hell people. By their very nature, they are storytellers and comedians. I'd sell tickets to our meetings if I thought I could get away with it. A Night at the Improv has nothing on a day out with the Bobs.Within 15 minutes, the backup arrives and we move to the corner booth, the big circular one with the vinyl version of spike strips that cops use to stop car chases. As we squish in, I feel one, then two, tears in my new tights and at least one I probably want to heavily disinfect after I get home. As I settle between the two large men, the warmth of the booth surface reminds me of going down a playground slide in the middle of July and a layer of sticky thigh meat sizzles. No matter, I think, who needs thighs. And scars add character.The window above us simultaneously blinds and cooks us with the infiltrating afternoon sun. From the corner of my eye, I see Evelyn wink at me awkwardly. I look away quickly and listen to Bob finish a story about his latest conquest, the one they call ""Bob Barker,"" because she barks like a seal during orgasm. I glance back and Evelyn winks again - once, then twice. She must have caught me staring in alarm because she is quick to explain the sun streaming in above the booth is making her eyes water. I offer sweetly to try and climb up and pull the shades, despite my petite height and the fact I'm wearing a skirt.""Uncle Archie,"" Evelyn barks to her brother, ""pull down the shades for me.""""Buford,"" Archie, a slight unassuming man, asks in his polite, soft voice, ""please pull down the shades for your wife.""Buford, a big man that looks like a Navy captain playing opposite Frank Sinatra in a war movie, ignores him as he continues a story about taking Evelyn and Aunt Trudy to see the Radio City Rockettes in New York City.""Well, I don't fucking understand paying 75-damn-dollars to see some women in their panties. At least not if I'm a damn woman with my own panties I can see for free!"" he tells Bob, his face incredulous.""It was entertainment, 'ya pervert,"" Evelyn retorts. ""Besides, they're not panties, they're world-famous dancers in dance costumes.""Bob leans in, squaring his gaze on his mother. ""But the important question is: Did you catch any fur shots, Mom?""I struggle with the thought of asking my mother the same question. Even more so, I am horrified at the thought that my mother would know what ""fur shot"" meant.Evelyn looks at me, smiles her embarrassment, and reaches over to pop Bob's arm. ""Bob Benjamin!""Bob winces while he and Buford cackle in harmony.""Maybe we did,"" answers Aunt Trudy thoughtfully. She's an elegant woman in her mid-50s with a trendy haircut and a fancy t-shirt embroidered with flowers. ""But I don't think so. We were several rows back. But maybe if you had been in the front row. No, no fur shots that I recall.""""Well, I..."" Buford starts.""And,"" interrupts Aunt Trudy, ""I know you'll be shocked to hear this, but it wouldn't turn me on to see their 'panties' or 'fur' even if I did.""""Then WHY in the hell did you pay 75-damn dollars of my hard-earned money to go see that shit?"" Buford hollers, catching the attention of half the establishment, despite the loud whine of Billy Ray Cyrus over the jukebox.""Your money, huh?"" interjects Evelyn saucily. ""The money you work night and day for? What would you have done with it, Buford?""""Could've gotten a damn good hooker for that money.""""Now, guys, hey, hey, hey,"" stutters Bob.I'm thinking he is surely about to steer the conversation in a more appropriate direction as we continue to draw even more attention as the subject matter and volume escalate.""What I want to know, Buford, is if that $75 includes the gas to get to Mexico?"" asks Bob. Nope, no censorship in this crowd.Archie looks perplexed.""What's wrong, Archie?"" asks Evelyn concerned.""I just don't understand why you'd have to pay $75 in New York or Mexico when we have good-looking hookers in Garland.""I choke on my coffee, not aware Garland has hookers and equally surprised to hear Archie is aware of such things. Bob pounds me on the back hard enough to make me gag just as the waitress arrives to take the rest of the orders.""Watch out for that one,"" Aunt Trudy warns the waitress, pointing a bony finger at Buford. ""Everything other than the words ""eggs"" or ""bacon"" that come out of his mouth are complete bullshit.""Buford makes a rude gesture and turns a charming smile on the waitress. ""Now Darlin'...""""Save it, buddy,"" the waitress quips and turns to Aunt Trudy. ""And you don't gotta tell me, Sugar, he's a man ain't he?""The womenfolk at the table have a good laugh and the waitress leaves smacking the same wad of gum she was working two hours ago when we first arrived.I glance over to see Evelyn wink again.""Evelyn,"" I say quietly. ""It's not that I don't enjoy the special attention, but would you like me to pull the shades for you so you can stop winking at me?""She snorts and nods. I carefully rise, protecting the group from a ""fur shot"" and reach for the pull cord on the spring-loaded shade. Now, mind you, I'm five feet tall. I'm wearing a short skirt, semi-sheer tights, and high-heeled leather boots. As I reach my full height, a stiletto heel sinks into the cracked vinyl. I brace a knee against the booth top and balance a hip on Bob's head to avoid splaying my backside smack into the center of a platter of biscuits. I refuse to make eye contact with Bob and hope he doesn't notice my ass on his head. I am rewarded for my bravado with the shade nearest me slipping down into place and staying put.I shift my weight and switch knees, trying to balance only on my toes to keep from puncturing the vinyl. Belatedly, I realize this is a moot point as the booth is more punctures, cracks, and duct tape than actual material. Each battle wound here in ChickenHaus has been bravely earned over decades of enduring late-night drunks and rowdy locals. Respect. I stretch for the second shade in the far corner but can't quite grab the dingy ring. I reach one hand behind me to tuck my skirt between my legs and say a little prayer as I lean out over Trudy and Archie. The tip of my pointer finger loops around the pull and I give it a little tug, afraid to breathe and lose my balance.Nothing. Dammit. I tug a little harder. Nothing happens again. I take a deep breath, curse under my breath, and lunge like an Olympic competitor yanking that bastard shade with all my might. A loud crack, followed by a metallic clank, result. I lean back to regain my balance and survey my work.As if in slow motion, a ripping sound reaches my ears just as the entire shade gives way and comes slamming down on the porcelain nativity display below. The nativity scene that is probably older than the Baby Jesus himself, and that I have somehow managed not to notice before now, explodes. The small swaddled Jesus antique goes flying across the room, bounces off a bald man's head, and crashes to a halt before resting in a fine white powder on the restaurant floor. Mary, Joseph, a donkey, and what looks like a figurine of Winston Churchill, rain down around me like hellfire and brimstone, landing in bowls of picante sauce and sawmill gravy.Without looking up or anywhere other than at my feet, I step back attempting to slink down to a sitting position. My heel catches in one of the cracks and I smash my face against the tar-covered wallpaper while my skirt flips almost to my waist. My knees buckle and I land with a bounce and a thud back on the vinyl booth, my feet awkwardly crunched beneath me. I consider momentarily ducking under the table and crawling for the door. The deafening silence is broken only by Tanya Tucker and my beating heart.""Goddamn,"" I hear from the back of the lunch counter.""Woo-wee,"" I hear from the far corner near the bathroom.""Hot damn,"" says someone at our table.I make the mistake of looking directly at the waitress. Her frown is extraordinary. I didn't know the human mouth could turn that far down.""I'm sorry about your Jesus,"" I whisper and wave my hands wildly like a rejected Rockette doing a vaudevillian routine.No one says a word until Evelyn graciously puts a hand on my shoulder and says, ""Thank you, Sweetie.""Bob punches my arm playfully. ""Good job, Kitten.""  The laughter finally comes and with it a huge sigh of relief mixed with a wave of hot embarrassment.I sit for another 20 minutes with my back to the rest of the patrons, pretending I'm someone else, somewhere else. I apologize to Bob, but he is too preoccupied with the picante sauce and eggs on his chin, shirt, and crotch to be concerned with what I am saying.Blissfully, the checks finally come, signaling an end to the afternoon.Bob snatches up my ticket. ""This one's on me, Kitten.""I nod, noticing our food is quite literally on him, but am still too embarrassed to even make a joke.""You can get everyone's ticket, Mr. Moneybags,"" Buford offers, but Bob politely declines.Buford then turns to the frowning waitress. ""Hey, how about I give you a naked picture of me in exchange for this bill?""""No, I don't think so,"" she responds, never missing a beat. ""I don't like old men. You all look wrinkly and shriveled.""""Not naked, I don't. Only with my clothes on,"" Buford assures her, but she ain't buying it. Just like she still ain't buying my apology.I hug Evelyn and shake hands with Archie. Trudy smiles sweetly and excuses herself to the ladies' room. Buford goes in for a bear hug and then I turn to Bob.""Thanks so much for lunch, Bob.""""No, thank you, Kitten. You provided all the entertainment.""I redden with embarrassment.""Besides,"" adds Buford on his way out the door, ""For $3 a piece, we all finally got that fur shot.""And that was the last time I had lunch at ChickenHaus.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*OnPvdTX5ln0NYElDGfGrng.jpeg,https://medium.com/muddyum/the-day-i-killed-jesus-and-flashed-a-whole-restaurant-9da09165bdb0,fiction,880ad75e61780ef960fd4cc20573090d19678f14b71716d7ebf31a08
Hopscotch,"""Did you buy Ella an hourglass?"" I asked. I didn't think a breakable glass object was a good toy for a nine-year-old.""She has an hourglass?"" My wife shrugged. ""Not my doing. Maybe she traded one of her dozen pandas for it.""I padded upstairs and knocked on Ella's door. ""Enter,"" she said. She was fiddling with a foot-tall hourglass enclosed in a wooden, three-column frame engraved with wild animals. Luminescent turquoise sand flowed from one bulb to the other.""Are you timing something?"" I asked.Ella studied the hourglass. ""Nope. I mean, yup. I'm watching the sand, Daddy."" She held the hourglass to her ear. ""It sounds like a wind chime.""""How's it going?""She pursed her lips. ""It's almost time."" She ran her fingertips along the side of the glass. ""Maybe another few minutes.""""Where did you get the hourglass?""""Magda gave it to me.""""Who's Magda?"" I thought I knew all of Ella's friends.""She's my hopscotch friend.""I sat next to Ella on her bed. ""Is Magda a new neighbor or a kid in your class?""""Nope."" Ella glanced up. ""I have a playdate with Magda soon."" She opened her eyes wide and offered me her puppy dog face. ""Can I go outside and play hopscotch, please?""I looked out the window. Ella's hopscotch board, a quilt of dayglo red, yellow, purple, green, and orange chalk lines forming squares with the numbers one to ten inside, occupied the pavement in front of our house.It was time to do my parental due diligence and learn more about Magda. ""Where does your friend live?""""Herstmonceux Castle."" Ella beamed. ""Yay, I said that right. I've been practicing!""""I see."" I leaned toward Ella. ""And where is Herstox Castle?""""Herstmonceux, Daddy. It's brand new.""""Herstmonceux.""""It's in East Sussex, where Magda lives.""Who can defeat a child's indefatigable logic? Fine. I'll just keep an eye on her while she and Magda play hopscotch.I glanced out the window, but nobody was there.""When is Magda arriving?""""She doesn't come to me, Daddy. I go to her.""I narrowed my eyes.""If Magda and I jump on the exact same hopscotch squares at the same time, I go to her castle. That's why she gave me the hourglass, so we can hopscotch together. The first trip was by accident, but now we know how. Her castle is amazing! There's a moat with a bridge and everything. Magda's older brother is a knight!"" She held the hourglass with the now empty upper bulb to the light. ""I have to go, Daddy.""I watched Ella from the window. She waved to me and then jumped through several squares, landed on the ten, and vanished.I snapped my phone out of my pocket and summoned Wikipedia.Herstmonceux Castle's construction began in 1441...I pressed my head into my palms and tried to extract a memory that didn't exist. What squares did Ella jump on, and in what order?",https://miro.medium.com/max/1714/1*pJi4V6FpYHl3BA2MwlrYeA.png,https://medium.com/sci-fi-shorts/hopscotch-6d3dde54ee38,fiction,972fa530c78e1a86a1dd5865cb23830d100b5a7874aefc83bf5a8565
"The Ultimate Self-Tracking Study on Sleep, Caffeine, Alcohol, and More","I've been trying to quantify, understand, and improve my sleep for many years now, and in the following, I want to share with you my longest and most in-depth self-study yet.So let's take a look at what effects caffeine, alcohol, and exercise have had on my sleep.I started this analysis in mid-2018 when I wrote about the results of tracking and modeling my blood caffeine concentration for a month.Towards the end of 2018, I shared the results of a more detailed experiment, covering around three months of sleep and related data and attempting to find correlations.While providing some interesting insights, the data was far from statistically significant. But since then, I have kept up the tracking, measuring my sleep data each night with my Oura ring, and logging every caffeinated beverage I consumed, my workouts, and my daily alcohol consumption.In total I accumulated 632 days of data, spanning from September 2018 to December 2020 (with two unfortunate small gaps in the data, more on that below). This is a detailed analysis of this data and what I learned from it about my sleep and my stress levels, as well as how my habits and behaviors impact them.First, we will take a look at my nightly heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV), which are key indicators for recovery, stress response, and overall health and performance.Then we will dive a bit deeper into the science of sleep, its individual phases, and look at how different factors influence my sleep phases.Finally, I want to draw some conclusions on what I managed to learn from this experiment.But before we dive into the results, a quick word on how I collected and modeled my data (feel free to skip this part if you just care about the results).My experimental journey began way back in 2015 when - driven by my lasting obsession with coffee (and a slight worry that I was drinking too much of it) - I decided to log every single caffeinated beverage I consumed using the simple app rTracker.Later I also started to use rTracker to log my alcohol consumption. Each morning I would assign a label of ""None"", ""A bit"" (roughly a glass of wine or beer), ""Quite a bit"" (on the order of three to five beers), or ""A lot"" (anything beyond) to the previous day.Sleep was even simpler to track. Ever since their original Kickstarter campaign, I've been a big supporter of the Oura ring, a sleep tracking device I wear constantly. So getting my sleep data was as simple as downloading a CSV file containing the well over 50 metrics the ring tracks through their Oura Cloud service.And while Oura's primary focus is on sleep, it also measures activity during the day, and the app can be used to log additional workouts and activities.Armed with all this raw data I was almost ready to start my analysis. Only one piece I was interested in was missing: if I wanted to find out how caffeine affects my sleep, I should first know how much caffeine was in my blood by the time I go to bed. So I had to create a model that could take my log of caffeinated drinks and estimate the actual caffeine levels in my body based on it.Leading up to the first article mentioned above, I made a model that could roughly tell me the amount of caffeine I had coursing through my bloodstream at any point in time.For the full details of the model (as well as more info on how exactly I tracked all the data and what tools I used) I refer you to my previous articles, or the code itself, but here is the core caffeine model in a nutshell.My caffeine logs were split into the main types of caffeinated drinks I consumed - filter coffee, espresso, cold brew, tea (cup), tea (bottle) - and an average caffeine amount for each, as well as an ""other"" category, for which I could specify a unique amount of caffeine in mg.In reality, caffeine concentration varies highly, even between different coffee beans, so that assuming a single value for e.g. my usual filter coffee made with 13g of coffee beans (let alone a coffee I'd get at a coffee shop) is a pretty strong simplification. But I believe that the resulting model is still insightful, and simplicity is key for actually turning the tracking into a habit that sticks. I also played around with a range of different values, and while the exact caffeine values in my blood change, all the results I will talk about below still showed the same relations across the values I tested.To actually model caffeine intake, I assumed that the rate at which caffeine enters my blood takes the form of a Gaussian distribution that peaks 60 minutes after consuming a drink (which I took to happen in a single moment in time in my log, usually the time when I started drinking).Further, I assumed that the half-life time of coffee in my blood was four hours. This seems to be a reasonable estimate, maybe even a touch conservative given that I know from DNA analysis that I'm a fast caffeine metabolizer.Feeding my raw logs (in the form of CSV files) into my model, which I coded up in Python, I could then get a reasonable estimate for how much caffeine I had in my blood at any point in time.While the individual days can vary widely (and we'll look more into this later when relating it to my sleep), below you can see what this looks like averaged over all 638 days in my dataset.You can see that I tend to get up between 8:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. (a bit later on the weekends), immediately have my first coffee, sometimes followed by a second coffee between 10:30 a.m. and noon. Then there's a little dip as my body gets rid of some of the caffeine while I have lunch (and maybe even a short nap), but in the afternoon I usually top up with another cup or two, this time in a slightly less regular fashion than in the morning.On the average weekday, my caffeine levels peak at just over 120mg at around 16:40 and then decay into the evening and night, but still being at over 40mg of caffeine by the time I go to bed around midnight. Even by the time I wake up, I usually still have the equivalent of a quarter espresso in my blood before the cycle begins again.Half-life times can mislead our intuition a bit, but seeing it plotted like this makes it clear just how long the caffeine stays in your blood. And that's only for my fairly average consumption of three to four cups of coffee a day, and a (probably) shorter than average half-life time given my fortunate genes. For many people, this might look much worse.Just like caffeine metabolism, how much caffeine affects us also depends on the individual. I can't speak for everyone (although I hope my results give some good general indications), but my N-of-1 experiment should at least give me some concrete insights about myself.So should I be worried? Is this ruining my sleep? Do I have to give up my beloved coffee? Let's find out.The heart is one of our most critical organs. It's responsible for pumping blood around our body and supplying it with oxygen and other important nutrients.For a long time, the heart, rather than the brain, was even seen as the center of the body and the seat of emotion. And more and more modern research is suggesting that this was not completely off, that there is at least some kind of two-way communication between heart and brain.So the heart is clearly important for physical, as well as mental wellbeing.The most common and well-known metric related to the workings of the heart is the heart rate (HR) - a simple counter of how many times our heart beats per minute.Heart rate variability (HRV) is a less well-known quantity, but it's quickly gaining popularity as a key quantity to keep an eye on if you're interested in your health and performance.Our heart does not tick like clockwork. A heart rate of 60 bpm does not mean there is a beat exactly once every second.Instead, the duration between consecutive beats varies. Our heart adapts to the slightest nuances in our environment and the ever-changing requirements from our body. It also speeds up with the in-breath and slows down with the out-breath.At least that's the ideal scenario.The more rested and relaxed we are, the stronger this response. But if we are stressed, fatigued, or otherwise in a sub-optimal state, our body's response gets dampened. It's a sign that our sympathetic nervous system, responsible for our fight-or-flight response, is overactive.This makes HRV a great metric to measure how well-rested and ready for peak performance our body is.In short, the higher our HRV, the stronger our adaptability to stress and the environment.I have recently spent a considerable amount of time and focus on trying to master and increase my HRV, following a ten-week program of twice-daily breathing exercises to deliberately increase my HRV and reduce stress and anxiety. The results of this have been quite profound, and deserve a separate article which I'm planning to write soon.For the sake of our analysis here, it's enough that we agree that higher HRV is better.The Oura ring measures and reports three different quantities related to the function of the heart during our sleep: HRV, as well as the average and lowest heart rate during the night.Looking at the plots below, we can see that these quantities are quite strongly correlated.Nights during which my heart rate was lower, were also nights with higher HRV. Similarly, average and lowest HR follow each other quite closely, with the average usually being around 5-7 beats higher than the minimum.Having established that HRV and resting HR are good indicators of how well-rested we are, we can use it as a proxy for overall sleep quality and stress to see how different factors impact my sleep.The plots below show how my heart rate and HRV vary with the amount of caffeine in my blood at the time I went to bed.As one might expect, we see that caffeine seems to have a slightly negative impact on my rest, increasing my heart rate and decreasing my heart rate variability.However, assuming a linear relationship between these variables is definitely a strong oversimplification, and a closer look suggests that the negative effect might be largely dominated by outlier days with particularly high caffeine, over around 80-100mg.I have to admit that I've not done anything close to a thorough literature review, but from a quick look at several papers that study caffeine's negative impact on sleep, I noticed that many of them only look at the higher end of caffeine amounts (sometimes 300 mg or more) administered in a rather unrealistic single large dose.I don't want to make any unfounded claims or accusations, especially since I haven't looked too deep into the literature, but it does make me wonder if many of the studies reporting negative effects of caffeine on sleep ignore a range of low to moderate caffeine and more realistic consumption where these effects are actually all but negligible. At least that seems to be the case for me.Overall, my data seems to suggest that as long as I don't overdo it with the caffeine, my coffee habit doesn't affect my sleep too badly.The next variable I want to look at is how active I was during the day. For this, I use Oura's Activity Burn metric, which estimates the number of calories I burned through activity, based on my motion and physical data, as well as exercises I logged in the app (e.g. Crossfit workouts, during which I'm not wearing the ring).Looking at the data, we can observe a slightly positive impact of exercise on my sleep quality.This was actually a little bit surprising to me.I didn't doubt that exercise had a positive effect on my sleep over the long term. But the night immediately following the exercise, which is what's shown in these plots, I would have expected a slightly increased resting heart rate and decreased HRV since my body had been under stress and now had to recover.One possible explanation could be that exercise reduces stress, and on days on which I exercised a lot, I was considerably more relaxed. Maybe this mental effect and lower stress hormones more than made up for my tired body.Or it might be that I exercised more on days on which I already felt particularly good and well-rested, and this carried on into the night.One variable that did however behave as expected was the restlessness of my sleep.In accordance with my subjective perception, more exercise did seem to lead to more restless sleep (although unfortunately, I'm not sure what unit Oura's ""Restless Sleep"" metric is in, or what exactly it measures, so I might also be misinterpreting this a bit).Often after a tough workout, especially if it was later in the day, I do feel like I'm tossing in bed a bit more than usual, and the data seems to confirm this suspicion.Despite this, exercise for me seems to have a positive effect not just over the long term, but immediately.Next, onto a variable whose effects are less subtle and difficult to interpret: alcohol.Plotting my heart metrics against the amount of alcohol I consumed shows without a shadow of a doubt that alcohol is bad for my sleep and recovery. Really bad.While a bit of alcohol doesn't seem to make too much of a difference (but is still definitely noticeable in the data), quite a bit or even a lot of alcohol dramatically increases my heart rate and lowers my HRV.Oura also provides an overall readiness score spanning from 0 to 100, which is a compound calculated from many different variables that indicates just how ready and well-rested you are.Here the effect is even more drastic. Beyond a little bit of alcohol, the next day's readiness score drops considerably.Even my breathing is affected by alcohol.While the effect is not as strong as on the other variables, my breathing does appear to slightly speed up when I had more than one drink.So while many of the other findings here are subtle and it's not always obvious that an effect is not actually the result of a third underlying hidden variable, I'm pretty confident to - once again and unsurprisingly- conclude that alcohol is really bad for your sleep.For this reason, I have also excluded days with ""Quite a bit"" or ""A lot"" of alcohol from all scatter plots presented in this article, such as the activity and caffeine plots above. As I've shown in my previous article, not doing this can easily lead to some strange (and faulty) conclusions, like more caffeine appearing to lower my heart rate.So far we have only looked at each day in isolation. However, this is another oversimplification for the sake of analysis. In reality, most factors probably have long term correlations and effects on each other. A single particularly good or bad night does not stand in isolation but affects the following days and nights as well.Fully unraveling and understanding the complicated relationships between these interlinked variables over time is pretty much impossible with the data on hand.But a simple and hopefully still enlightening first step is to look at moving averages over time.Below is my heart rate and HRV data for the entire range from September 2018 to December 2020, averaged with a moving window of 14 days to smooth out day-to-day variations and focus on longer-term trends.Overall, my heart metrics seem to have gotten worse over the timeframe I've been tracking, with a particularly noticeable drop in 2020.The extreme drop in HRV (and increase in HR) at the very end of 2020 is probably a bit of an outlier though, caused by me traveling back from Japan to Germany for the holidays (in itself quite a stressful experience), the ensuing jet lag, as well as the overeating of my grandma's Christmas cookies and overall consuming more sugar over just a few days than in the entire rest of the year combined.There are two unfortunate gaps in my data. The first is due to me not tracking caffeine and alcohol for a while in mid-2019, whereas the second one is due to my Oura ring breaking. (And I was too busy/lazy to contact Oura straight away. Once I told them, they immediately sent me a free replacement ring. Great customer service!)Especially the gap from late December 2019 to May 2020 is particularly unfortunate. In May I self-published my book. The months leading up to the publication, exactly the months, unfortunately, missing in the data, were some of the most intense I ever experienced, packed with writing, editing, designing, and marketing the book on a very tight schedule.But while they were intense, it was a very positive and rewarding intensity, much more eustress than distress. I poured a lot of energy and focus into it, but also got a lot of energy and a sense of purpose and meaning back from it. I would have loved to see my metrics for that time.Once the book was out in May, it was almost like I faced a kind of void, a feeling of ""now what?"" which I'm still only slowly recovering from.I'm wondering if part of my seemingly increasing stress that's apparent in the data is a result of this. With the data gap, it's just speculation, but it looks like my 2020 actually started out pretty well and only went into a steady decline after the book launch in May.Ironically, but not too surprisingly, removing the acute eustress of this meaningful project might have led to a slow creep of distress. We talk about this in our book, in the form of the ancient concept of Noble Leisure. The best form of leisure is often very active and infused with a strong sense of meaning. Remove that, and you create negative stress.In addition to that, I am also aware of some other stressors in my life during this time period, about which I might write in a future article. And of course, there was just the general stress and anxiety that almost everyone faced in 2020, either because of direct experience, or at least second-hand through the never-ending torrent of bad news.However, on this last point, Oura recently released their own internal study of pandemic trends titled ""What if Social Distancing is Good For Our Health?"" that shows some surprising trends.What they found is that on average their users actually showed lower resting heart rates in 2020 compared to previous years, probably as a result of people being able to choose their sleeping schedule more flexibly, and more in line with their own chronotype.They also found that, with social distancing in place and most people staying home more, sleep times became longer and more stable over the week, all factors contributing to better sleep and improved heart metrics.I guess I'm a bit of an outlier in that data. I have always been quite fortunate to make my own sleep schedule, possibly even more so in the past than in the latter half of 2020, making me maybe even more of an anomaly.One other potential contributor to my overall decline in HRV and an increase in resting HR might be found in the following plot.Over the two years that I've been tracking my data, my level of exercise seems to have steadily declined.2018 was definitely my most active Crossfit year, when I was in the gym 4 or 5 times a week. This dropped to probably around 2 or 3 times a week in 2019, and essentially to zero in 2020 (although I did run a bit more frequently again).I also used to commute to work by bike, another more or less daily activity that pretty much vanished for the part of 2020 covered by my data.Along with my decline in exercise level and increased HRV, Oura's aggregate restfulness score dropped from fluctuating around a very good 90 until late 2019, to a still solid but less ideal 80 in 2020.The strong and sudden drop in restfulness at the end of 2019 might be the result of a particularly large number of parties and gatherings around that time. During that time I was performing on average once or twice a week at events and clubs, which is fun, but obviously not great for my restfulness...Inspired by the above mentioned Oura study, I decided to also look at how my values vary over the average week.The results turned out almost comical, with a consistent increase in stress markers over the week.I start the week out very relaxed, with my resting heart rate low and my HRV high, and then go into a steady decline throughout the week, apparently getting more and more stressed until Sunday, when the cycle seemingly resets in the night from Sunday to Monday.One thing to note is that the variance is significantly increased on the weekend. This is not surprising, since those are the days I'm most likely to go out and have a few drinks, which also explains why the stress markers keep increasing on the weekend.Removing all days with ""Quite a bit"" or ""A lot"" of alcohol shows a slightly different picture.Now stress markers peak on Friday, or rather in the night from Thursday to Friday, and then start dipping again over the weekend. This aligns quite nicely with the average presented in the Oura study.Saturday to Sunday still has a slight decrease in HRV and increase in HR, suggesting that even with the alcohol removed from the equation my sleep quality is worse during that night. This might be explained by the fact that this is also the night I'm most likely to spend with my girlfriend.I don't want to say that spending time with her is causing me to be more stressed (at least not most of the time), but I do sleep considerably better when I'm by myself.Sleep scientist Matthew Walker, author of the excellent book Why We Sleep, confirms this and even suggests a ""sleep divorce."" He and his long-term partner are practicing it themselves, sleeping in separate bedrooms and during their own ideal sleep window:I know how miserable and awful I am to be around when I didn't sleep well, so I fully support his idea of a sleep divorce, for everyone's benefit.The time I go to bed also varies somewhat predictably throughout the week.When including the nights I got out and drink, my weekends have by far the most variance and are shifted towards later sleep times.Removing the days of moderate to high alcohol consumption, my average bedtime is much more stable throughout the week, sometime between 11 p.m. and midnight. In this case, the night from Saturday to Sunday actually has one of my earliest bedtimes (possibly also because I might have been out late and drinking the previous night, and am now having a recovery night).Over the entire timeframe, my sleep has definitely moved to an earlier time.Especially in 2020 I rarely went to bed past 1 a.m. and was usually in bed by midnight. Part of this is probably due to the fact that going out just wasn't a thing in 2020, and in previous years the occasional night out might have pushed the moving average to later times.While at a first glance this might look like a positive development, I'm not so sure about it. Maybe this positive association just comes from a culture that is built for and around morning people (which I am definitely not).In June 2020 I started a more ""traditional"" job, where I often have meetings from 10 a.m. and as a result, need to get up by 8:30 a.m. if I still want to enjoy my morning routine of coffee, reading, and meditation before starting work. This in turn also moved my bedtime to an earlier hour.While this might not seem like an issue or particularly early to most people (if anything, probably the opposite), I am really not a morning person and at least subjectively feel most rested when I sleep from around 1 am to 10 am. This could also be a contributor to my increased stress markers in 2020.However, at least looking at each day as an individual data point, bedtime hour does, quite surprisingly, not seem to have any impact on my HRV.My total amount of sleep takes a somewhat similar pattern to the bedtime hour.If boozy nights are included, my weekend nights show significant variation. However, once they are removed that variation drops, and Saturday to Sunday night becomes the night of most sleep, with an average of around 9.5 hours.In general, my sleep duration is very healthy at around 8 to 9 hours.But I know just how important sleep is for me, and how poorly I perform on little sleep. Less than 8 hours and the next day won't be great, less than 7 hours and it will be pretty miserable.Looking at the moving average shows a similar picture.It mostly stays above 8 hours, with 2020 actually appearing to be my year of longest overall sleep (which is again similar to Oura's findings on their average user).But all sleep is not created equal.To understand a bit better at what's actually going on, let's take a look at the science of sleep phases.To really understand and appreciate what sleep is and how it supports our health and creativity, we have to look at our brains.Quoting from my book Time Off, which has an entire chapter dedicated to sleep:In addition, deep sleep is also responsible for memory consolidation. It's the diligent librarian that makes sure nothing gets lost, everything is filed in the right place, and memories get efficient tags and cross-references.REM sleep on the other hand is the phase during which dreaming occurs, and it's a creative powerhouse, as well as a tool for us to process emotions. It makes us more emotionally stable, and as a result, more empathetic and understanding of others.Everything that doesn't fall into these two phases can, oversimplifying things a bit, be categorized as light sleep.While few people question the accuracy of Oura's heart rate and HRV measurements, there is some ongoing debate about how good it is at identifying the different sleep stages. However, even if the data is potentially not 100% accurate, as long as it is consistent there is still valuable.So let's take a look at how my ratios of different sleep phases change with the total sleep duration.While the amount of light sleep seems to be fairly independent of sleep duration, deep sleep and REM sleep definitely show some correlation.The longer I sleep, the less deep sleep and the more REM sleep I seem to be experiencing.This pattern is in good agreement with the science.Our first sleep cycle is usually dominated by deep sleep. Then, as the night progresses, our sleep shifts more and more towards REM sleep. The final cycles of sleep, especially if we get a full night of sleep, are dominated by REM sleep.Thus, many of us who cut our sleep short on a regular basis, consistently do not get the full benefits of REM sleep, including boosted creativity, better emotional regulation, and stress relief.Another factor that can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of sleep, even if we get enough hours, is alcohol.Alcohol clearly kills my deep sleep, leading to more light sleep instead.Surprisingly, REM sleep seems to be more or less unaffected by alcohol. This goes against the academic literature, which has shown that alcohol has a particularly devastating effect on REM sleep.Subjectively, I do remember more dreams on nights when I was drinking. However, my guess is that this is just due to lighter sleep and more frequent wake-ups, not due to actually dreaming more.Unless I'm a strange medical outlier (unlikely), or the scientific literature is pretty wrong (even less likely), the data above might show some of the limitations of Oura's sleep phase detection. It's possible that some of the effects caused by alcohol look similar to Oura's sensors as REM sleep does.Not surprisingly, and as we have already indirectly seen above, drinking alcohol tends to shift my bedtime hour to later times (or said less causally, I tend to drink more on days on which I also go to bed late).What is a bit surprising though is that my bedtime essentially seems to have no effect on my sleep phase ratios (plot not shown). From the literature, I would have expected earlier sleep times leading to more deep sleep, and later sleep times to more REM, but this was not the case.What does show some impact on sleep ratios though is caffeine.Similar to alcohol, more caffeine seems to increase light sleep at the expense of deep sleep, leaving REM mostly unaffected.Just as for the heart metrics, the negative effects on sleep phases seem to come most strongly above a certain threshold, but even at lower values, there might be some effect here.Surprisingly, sleep latency, the amount of time it takes me to fall asleep, seems to be almost unaffected by caffeine, even though that's probably the first thing that would come to mind when thinking of an over-caffeinated day.However, as I've mentioned in my last article on this, sleep latency is a metric I'm particularly skeptical about and don't think Oura is very good at detecting accurately. Especially long latencies seem to be drastically underestimated by the ring, probably due to me moving around in bed so much that it thinks I'm not even in bed yet.Looking at each day in isolation shows some interesting correlations, but it also misses out on the time-series aspect of the data.The moving averages can again give some insights into this.Most obvious is that my deep sleep seems to have increased over 2019, in exchange for less light sleep, with a slight reversal in 2020.What's less obvious in the above plot, but somewhat more concerning, is that my REM sleep has been getting less and less over the years. The effect becomes clearer when plotting the total amount of REM sleep I've been getting each night by itself.I've noticed this for a while just by looking at my daily values and reflecting on how I feel, but seeing it plotted as a trend like this really drives home this point.Whether or not Oura's estimate of REM sleep is actually correct or not, I have subjectively noticed a strong correlation between my energy levels and emotional wellbeing and the amount of REM sleep Oura reports. So seeing this consistently decrease over time is a bit concerning, and might be partially responsible, or at least related to my higher perceived levels of stress and anxiety in 2020.This is probably true for many people, but 2020 has been the first time in my 30 years so far that I felt genuinely anxious for extended periods of time.Objectively, I've not been affected negatively by the pandemic. I never had to worry about job security or had to directly face any of the other stressors many people were confronted with. I'm sure there is some collective level of anxiety that didn't go completely past me, but I don't think all the changes I personally experienced can be blamed on the pandemic.So this decrease in REM sleep (or whatever it is Oura is detecting as REM sleep), whether it's cause or effect, is definitely something I'd like to keep an eye on, especially knowing how critical REM sleep is to emotional wellbeing.While I've presented a lot of data and analysis here, this is only the tip of the iceberg.The Oura ring provides a lot of additional variables that I didn't look into here, and the analysis itself was also fairly simplistic. But this simplicity is the best way to start gaining some valuable insights.Overall, I want to be cautious reading too much into these results.The relations of the different variables are so complex that it's almost impossible to clearly identify any causality. And even the correlations that appear in the data might be driven by some hidden third variable, as we have seen when removing high alcohol days from the data.Also, both my own self-tracking and modeling, as well as Oura's measurements and models contain some uncertainty.If there is one conclusion I'm confident to draw with very little doubt, it's that - just as I've seen in my previous study with less data - alcohol beyond a small quantity is really bad for your sleep and recovery.But despite the above caveats, I think even beyond this rather obvious observation there are some interesting conclusions to draw from the analysis.For caffeine, the effect of my love for coffee is not as bad as I had feared. Above around 70 mg of caffeine in my blood at bedtime, I risk higher resting HR, lower HRV, and more light sleep. But as long as I keep my caffeine levels below this fairly high threshold, I shouldn't have to worry too much about affecting my sleep in a negative way.I'm again wondering if this raises the question if a lot of medical studies have even looked at this lower (but more realistic) range, or just extrapolated that caffeine is generally bad for sleep from high caffeine doses administered close to sleep. Maybe someone can point out that I just didn't look at the right studies.The results of the high caffeine days raise another question pointing at the complexity of these variables: was the high caffeine actually the cause of my light sleep and lower HRV, or were those days particularly stressful days which made me reach for more caffeine, and it was actually the stress that caused the bad results more so than the caffeine itself?The same could be said for alcohol. Maybe days on which I was already stressed made it more likely for me to drink? Again, we see how complicated and entangled these variables are.Attempting to answer this particular question would require to also manually track my perceived stress levels throughout the days. Maybe an experiment for the future.Overall 2020, or at least the part for which I had data, didn't look too good for me, with many stress indicators seeming to have gotten worse over the year. As I mentioned, I'm aware of some very concrete stressors, and working on them will be a big focus for me in 2021.I'm curious to see how this will be reflected in my data going forward from here.Concretely, I want to increase my amount of REM sleep again, and also work on my heart metrics, decreasing resting heart rate, and increasing HRV.I also want to try to flatten my heart rate and HRV throughout the week. I didn't expect stress to increase so noticeably throughout the week, and I don't think it has to be that way.I have some experiments in mind, and would also love to hear your suggestions for hitting my goals.Happy self-tracking and bio-hacking!",https://miro.medium.com/max/4242/1*wBAFxdFq8UrDILoPTeBzHA.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-humans/the-ultimate-self-tracking-study-on-sleep-caffeine-alcohol-and-more-ddd2f21dfacf,productivity,988caa4ef977d1c00e917602152a27886e399e3909ef5699804ea2ed
Solve Your Work and Life Balance to Rescue 'Me',"There is work, and there is overworked. Whether through unbridled enthusiasm or the crush of business, work-life balance can take a beating.This is an occupational hazard for social media marketers such as Jake Zachariah, who specializes in leadership and personal branding, and digital marketing expert Madalyn Sklar.Both of them spend a lot of time on Twitter. Sklar might well have a tattoo that states, ""Power User."" Zachariah also stays busy online. Fortunately for them, they have mastered the appearance of hyperactivity while carving out welcome ""me"" time.If you're constantly on Twitter, your work and regular life might be out of balance unless being on Twitter is part of your job. Even then, it's probably not your whole job. You might need a break or an intervention.""I daily block off time for rest and personal life,"" Zachariah said. ""You can't be constantly connected without space to breathe. Remember 'Do Not Disturb' on your phone along with screen time restrictions to automate quiet time from the noise.""Many systems create their own kind of chaos and anxiety, for sure,"" he said. ""Recognizing where you find anxiety is a great first step. Knowing which areas cause energy drain and which areas do not is important to diagnosing if there's even a problem.""One challenge is when temptation looms almost always within eyesight.""Work-life balance is difficult when we're constantly connected to platforms like Twitter since it's always accessible on our smartphones,"" Sklar said. ""We have to be wise about how we're spending our time instead of scrolling and consuming content for hours on end.""Online productivity helps maintain balance. One example is time spent retweeting, quote tweeting and the difference between them.Retweet as a quote is better because a mere retweet is a simple-non-involved push of a button. Adding a quote takes more effort while showing that you care. Of course, writing quotes takes more time.""When I had a smaller audience, I would reply to tweets more to find cool people,"" Zachariah said. ""Now that I have a few more followers, I love to use quote tweets to expand the audience and involve more people.""Weighing the personal touch is a key factor.""I mostly reply to tweets because the conversation is between me and the other person,"" Sklar said. ""From time to time I do a retweet with a quote because I want to be sure to share the conversation with my community.""She has published an article discussing replies compared to quote tweets.Another way to save time online while getting maximum engagement is through polls.""There are many ways you can use a Twitter poll,"" said Nick Martin, head of global social engagement at Hootsuite, giving a couple examples:""I love the idea of playing games in the polls,"" Zachariah said. ""I have used them to play two truths and a lie to get people to know me and our staff better.""Sklar suggested four ways to use Twitter polls:A Hootsuite article details ""How to Use Twitter Polls to Boost Engagement (Ideas and Examples).""Sklar also uses Twitter polls to get feedback on an idea and learn more about her audience through entertaining questions.With all that, people should not live, eat and breathe social media without a break.""We all need rest,"" Zachariah said. ""As cool as our brains are, they aren't meant to always be on. Why do your best ideas come in the shower or at 2 a.m.? Because you aren't pressuring yourself to perform. Rest well for better ideas.""The entire point of social media algorithms is to keep you on,"" he said. ""Without rest, you're really being influenced at a psychological level. That's not healthy in extremes.""Sklar emphasized how important it is to disconnect for everyone's mental health.""It's not good to be so consumed in what everyone else is doing or sharing,"" she said. ""You're not going to miss anything that important if you step away for a little while.""Always allow yourself time away from social media to rest and recharge,"" Sklar said. ""It's easy to get caught up in the opinions of others and general negativity online. Sometimes you just need to be by yourself and shut out the outside world. I do this on the weekends.""Going back to draw on oldies-but-goodies evergreen content gives you a Twitter presence without having to do much work.""Transparency about taking time off and rest,"" Zachariah said. ""Be honest that you need the time off. Someone else reading may feel inspired to take some time off and balance their work-life schedule a bit more because of what you share.""Announce your intent to take a break. Then follow through.""Don't be afraid to let people know when you're taking a break from social media,"" Sklar said. ""This way, they'll know you aren't actively online and checking your notifications. They won't expect a response from you right away.""You can also share 'real life' content mixed in with business posts to show people what you get up to when you're not working,"" she said. ""It just might inspire them to take a work break of their own. I'm all about repurposing your best, evergreen content. It helps take a load off so you can achieve work-life balance.""In the good old days, online work and play could turn into real-life work and play. Those days might return ... sometime.""Prevent burnout to avoid subpar content,"" Zachariah said. ""The more stressed out and anxious you are, the lower quality will be for your content and replies. Your engagement suffers. Your relationships suffer. If you're overwhelmed and 'go dark,' that's not good.""I love the idea of life-work balance instead of work-life balance,"" he said. ""That's a simple shift with a drastically different outcome.""Sklar has reinforced her beliefs for constructive pauses through three decades of experience.""As a social media marketer, I see the value in social media for building your brand,"" she said. ""However, I also understand the importance of taking time off. Scheduling content ahead of time allows me to do this while ensuring I always have new content going out.""To mindfully reduce time spent on social media, block out an hour or so in the morning to load a day's worth of tweets on TweetDeck. Then you could scoot out for a day or weekend with few being the wiser.""Set screen time limits and schedule posts,"" Zachariah said. ""I've used Hootsuite and Buffer to schedule stuff so I can focus on 'me' time. I love screen time on my devices to limit my exposure to the addiction of always being connected.""The schedule helps so much,"" he said. ""You know you're getting the content out there without always running around to create it.""An easy solution is to cut off notifications.""That's 100 percent the best way to do it,"" Zachariah said. ""Being mindful about your time on social media is as important as being mindful about your time with family. Notifications are the worst. You can create and schedule for later, and rest instead.""Sklar is one of screen time's biggest fans.""If you have an iPhone, the screen time feature can help you reduce the amount of time you're spending on social media and on your phone in general,"" she said. ""You can use screen time to set time limits for specific apps like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and any others you find yourself using a lot.""Make your calendar your best friend. Listen to what it says to make sure you're home on time.""To set boundaries, start small and adjust based on how you feel,"" Zachariah said. ""If you're not feeling a work-life balance right now, you're not going to feel it magically tomorrow after setting boundaries. Constantly evaluate. Give it time. Adjust and improve.""Give yourself a schedule to check Twitter and other social media or work,"" he said. ""Block off small portions of time at first and adjust as you grow comfortable with setting boundaries. Forgive yourself for past stumbles and make one small change. You don't need to be perfect right now. Make that one small change and stick to it.""Muting is also a powerful tool for peace of mind.""I have hundreds - and hundreds and hundreds - of muted words,"" Zachariah said. ""Don't get dragged into content and conversations you don't want to have. I love Twitter but only because I muted the yucky stuff.""Blocking time might be the ultimate productivity hack.""It's beneficial to set certain times during the day to log onto Twitter,"" Sklar said. ""Then you'll be less likely to check notifications randomly throughout the day. Maybe set Twitter check-ins for the morning, mid-day and evening.""Connecting with and using social media networks can be play time. Get down to work much later as you get acquainted with others. Aim for casual know, like and trust before you ever get to the world of marketing.""Link up with people who value a work-life balance,"" Zachariah said. ""It also can be the 'life' part of the balance. I've met so many friends through Twitter. It helps to carry those connections away from the social platform to boost the rest of life's pleasures.""Rather than building anxiety, going online can be a welcome relief valve.""For many people, social media is actually a way to de-stress after a long day,"" Sklar said. ""Who doesn't want to go online and watch a few funny videos after a day of work? How you spend your time on social media doesn't always have to be work-related.""Avoiding Twitter burnout is as easy - and hard - as putting the phone down.""Limit how much time you spend on Twitter each day,"" Sklar said. ""If you allow yourself hours to scroll through your feed, you'll probably do it. Give yourself a certain amount of social media time. Then when that time is up, go do something else.""Attend instead to physical betterment.""Take care of your body: eat, sleep, exercise,"" Zachariah said. ""Then set time limits. Don't check social first thing after you wake up. Give yourself some quiet 'me' time. Then get ready for your day - and don't check social last before going to sleep.""Also remember that you can easily follow too many accounts, ""he said. ""There's only so many people who realistically fit in your brain space. You can't know it all. Above all, mute the trolls.""About The AuthorJim Katzaman is a manager at Largo Financial Services and worked in public affairs for the Air Force and federal government.

Conquer Your Angst to Fail and Your Life Will Change in Wonderful Ways,"I couldn't have been more average. I went to an average university, lived in an average town, and my grades were good but not top-notch.After finishing university, I was working as a consultant in a Corporate Finance advisory company. No, not one of the big 4.First, I was super excited to get into the work-life and do important things. But after 2 years, I was so bored with this routine life. I couldn't bear the thought that this was it. This is my life. Really? It freaked me out, but I had no exit plan. So I was waiting for something to happen, although I had no idea for what.One day on my commute to work, I read an article about a lawyer who went to China with a scholarship by the German government to study Chinese and become a China expert for the German industry and trade. From this moment, I knew this is my exit plan and the beginning of a new adventure.After the first excitement passed, I researched the program and how to apply. The application website was so demotivating. It stated they only select the best of the best with extraordinary grades from the top universities in Germany. Another requirement was to provide 2 detailed recommendation letters from professors or employers.Immediately the voices in my head started.They will never choose you. You have nothing to offer. You don't work for a global company. You are not good enough.So I did nothing. The voices paralyzed me. But I also couldn't stop dreaming about moving to China. I have never been to China before, but I had this vision of myself on the Great Wall of China. From my semester abroad in Thailand, I knew I love Asian culture and lifestyle.Then I realized if I don't at least apply, I will never know if it would have worked out. I would regret it.I was so afraid of failing and other people knowing about it, that I didn't tell anybody about my plans. Not even my parents.I started working on the application by contacting one of my professors and the employer from my last internship to help me with the recommendation letters. It was so horrifying to ask them for a recommendation. I thought they would say no, but they said yes.After several rounds of self-doubt and nights sitting over the application, I finally send it over. Then the waiting began.I couldn't believe it, but I got an invitation for a personal interview with 6 high-ranking people from the government and top managers from companies like Volkswagen. I was super nervous, but it went okay.3 months passed when I found a letter from the German Academic Exchange Service in my post box. My heart was beating like crazy when I read the words:I felt sick to my stomach. The voices were right. Of course, I am not good enough. I threw the letter away and tried to forget about it.Preparing the application was a lot of work, but actually, I gained something from it. My professor and old employer were really supportive, and it was great to hear that they believed in me.I tried my best. Now, I could move on and delete dancing Karo from the Great Wall.It was a normal afternoon in the office; I was working on an investment memorandum when my phone rang. An unknown number. I went outside, picked up, and the voice on the phone said:What the fuck. I never believed 2 people would skip this amazing opportunity. You cannot imagine how excited and happy I felt. Dancing Karo on the Great Wall is going to happen.The first thing I did was calling my parents and telling them I am moving to China in 2 months. They were as speechless as I was.The moment I sent this application changed everything in my life. For the first time, I didn't follow the safe way. For the first time, I knew what I really wanted.Sending this application opened a completely unknown world for me. My perspective changed from a small-town girl to an international professional. I learned so much about myself, cultural differences, and of course, I learned to speak Mandarin.I wouldn't be the same person without all the amazing people I met on my way and all the obstacles and wonderful moments I experienced.It is hilarious when people hear I lived in China for 5 years and I speak German, English, Chinese, and work on my 4th language right now, they think I am special. They think I have a talent for languages and I am a high-achiever.But the truth is I am still the same average person, the only thing which changed is my mindset.Here is what I learned since this pivotal moment 8 years ago.Lesson 1: Believe in yourself.You are not alone. Everybody is scared of challenges, new things, and rejections. Feeling fear is normal. This should never stop us from going for our dreams. If we give our best, incredible things happen. There are millions of opportunities out there. Be scared and take them despite your fear.We are all just normal people, no matter what it says in our CV's.Lesson 2: Have faith and don't overthink.When things don't go as expected, then have faith everything will be great just in another way. At this moment, you might not understand why things are how they are, but whatever is going to happen, you will be fine.Often we think about what we consider crucial decisions forever, but they actually don't matter that much. You will do well whatever you do. And there is no fixed path, you can reinvent yourself at any time.Lesson 3: Broaden your perspective.I had such a limited perspective before moving to a foreign country. To become the best version of yourself, you need to experience things outside your normal circle of influence. Find friends from other cultures. Study a semester abroad. Take a language course overseas.Your learning curve will speed up when you expose yourself to the unknown. You will learn to see things from different angles, which makes you a better person and problem solver.Lesson 4: Embrace delayed gratification.Everything has a price, an upfront investment you have to make. Often we cannot see the fruits of our work directly, but long-term, your action will pay off. Every step you take gives you valuable feedback for the future. The feedback you need to become the best version of yourself.Writing the application was hard work on top of my job, but it paid off. This applies to everything in life.If you give, you will receive. It just takes a while.When I was 24, I never imagined my life would turn out how it did. I could not have come up with this grand plan for myself. Trust the universe and your progress and enjoy every second of this amazing gift, your life.Take the opportunities given to you, they might change your life in wonderful ways. You will never know if you don't try.Sign up for my Newsletter and get the latest Mindfulness Trends and Insights directly into your mailbox.",,https://medium.com/change-your-mind/conquer-your-angst-to-fail-and-your-life-will-change-in-wonderful-ways-e33aaca87c7f,travel,2615a6d6db72b6d252f50c6d8c7ed200ff2fb40646f60d05271dbbac
7 Foods to Try in Taiwan,"Food is a huge part of the experience whenever I go traveling. When I'm doing some research before I go to a certain place, I always include top restaurants to eat in or top foods to try out. As soon as the plane lands and we're on our way to the hotel or the Airbnb, I'm on the lookout for food stalls or restaurants that are close by.It's not just because I like eating (although I believe that plays a huge part too). It's that every country expresses a great deal about itself through its food.For example, if you were to visit McDonald's in every country, you'd find that the food tastes different depending on the country you are in. In some cases, they even have items on the menu that you wouldn't be able to find in any other McDonald's in any other country. Their menu and the dishes they serve vary and adapt according to a country's tastes.You've got countries that always have a certain spice they add to their dish. You've got countries that build their food around a certain flavor or taste. You've got countries that have become well-known because of a certain dish.One of my favorite places to visit and go on a food trip is Taiwan. I'm very partial to Chinese food, which has proven to be my comfort food on more than one occasion. Here are some X foods I think everybody should try when they go to Taiwan:Of course, we'll start with this controversial dish. A lot of people avoid stinky tofu when it comes to Taiwanese street food because of the smell. I get the aversion to the pungent, souring odour. However, in my opinion, it doesn't smell too bad. It's just fermented, and a little fermentation is good for your stomach.Stinky tofu is often served with some spicy sauce and cabbages and carrots on the side, which makes the dish really delicious and healthy. I can eat loads of this without any guilt and I know people who hesitated at first because they weren't a fan of the smell but pledged undying loyalty to it after.I've tried different kinds of stinky tofu in Taiwan, but my favorite is the one in Raohe Night Market. The stinky tofu is perfect there - crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.Bomb pancakes are also known as scallion pancakes or green onion pancakes. They are deep-fried dough made from green onions and flour, topped with some garlic, a half-cooked egg, and a soy sauce that they say is a secret recipe. The result is a delicious, chewy street food you won't easily forget.They are called ""bomb"" pancakes because of the runny yolk in the half-cooked eggs as well as the fact that the word ""fried egg"" sounds like ""bomb"" in Chinese.Think of it as a little burrito that is filled with ice cream instead of meat and vegetables. It's one of the most popular street foods in Taiwan and you'll often see it in popular tourist spots.It is made from a handmade crepe-like wrap, shaved peanuts, ice cream scoops, and coriander leaves (which I didn't have because it felt a little weird).Taiwan's Hot Star chicken is so popular, it has opened branches in different countries around the world. The best place to have it, however, is in Ximending, the place of shops and nightlife. There, the line is so long, it sometimes takes 20-30 minutes before your number is called. It's worth it, though, but you'd better order everything you want to keep from falling in line again.While their most popular item on the menu is their large fried chicken, they offer other items, too, like squid rings, tofu, tempura, mushrooms, and more.When my siblings and I were younger, one of our favorite books was Little Pear by Eleanor Frances Lattimore. Little Pear was a little boy living in a Chinese village and he was extremely fond of tanghulus, which was described as candied fruit.Imagine our joy when we got to Taiwan and we heard them calling out ""Tanghulu! Tanghulu!"" Of course, we had to try them and they became an instant favorite too!The tanghulu fruits vary, some of them being strawberries, cherry tomatoes, or hawthorn fruit. All of them are coated with sugar so if you eat it fresh off the stall just as they make it, it can be deliciously warm and crispy sometimes.Even before we arrived in Taiwan, we knew we just had to have their beef noodle soup. Since we don't know the Chinese language very well yet, we memorized the symbol for the beef noodle soup and would keep a lookout for it at almost every restaurant. They did not disappoint!One of the best beef noodle soups we had was in the food court of Taiwan Main Station. They have large bowls of beef noodle soup - some of the spicy, some of them just the regular kind - as well as other dishes.This is a very popular dessert in Taiwan and you can have it in two different ways, too - hot or cold. It is made of taro balls and sweet potato balls.Other shops sell it with red bean, grass jelly, tapioca balls, and other toppings, but the best one for me is in Jiufen Old Street. The taste and chewiness of the taro and sweet potato balls are just perfect. The shop is one of those quiet restaurants that don't have fancy interiors, but the view is stunning and dessert is delicious, so what more could you ask for?It's not food, but you should still try it out anyway.In almost every corner you turn or every alleyway or little side street you go through, you will find milk tea stalls. Some of them are the more popular ones, like Coco or YiFang, but sometimes, it's the little ones that taste delicious. Some of our favorites were in the night markets of Raohe, Shida, and Shilin. Not all the teas have milk in them, some are just plain fruit tea, but just as tasty.Have you been to Taiwan?

My 2021 Goals Focus on Habits Rather Than Outcomes,"A few years ago, I was about to start a business with a couple of friends. The idea was exciting, we were motivated and were ready to launch a successful product in the market. The only problem was the execution was extremely poor.Upon looking back, I realized that poor execution was the result of focusing too much on the final output rather than paying attention to the work required to generate the output. The same is true with new year resolutions and goal setting.Most of us believe that setting BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goals) at the start of a year will motivate us into taking action that we have been avoiding for a long time. This doesn't always work.People working in training and development would understand the meaning of SMART goals.S = SpecificM = MeasurableA = AchievableR = RelevantT = Time BoundOne can set goals based on the most important outcomes that one wants to achieve. The outcomes could be losing weight, getting a new job, starting a business, writing a book etc.By following the method of SMART goals, one can define the relevant actions within a defined period of time to achieve one's goals. This method seems pretty reasonable and realistic. Then, why do people still fail to achieve their goals?Some end up setting the same goals next year.We can agree that achieving goals depends on taking consistent action. Through the SMART goals' method, one can identify the actions that will get us the outcomes we are looking for. What this method doesn't mention is how to trigger those actions consistently.As a result, most people start a new year by taking action to achieve their goals only to lose momentum and consistency.A more useful way of achieving goals is to form habits that will help one in becoming more consistent with our actions.According to the New York Times Bestseller, The Power of Habit, a habit consists of the following loop:The book describes the loop in the following words:This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.I have realized that the biggest roadblock that prevented me from taking consistent action towards my goals was not knowing the cues that trigger habits I want to avoid. This might be true for others too.Someone wants to write a book, but they end up spending too much time watching Netflix. Someone wants to get in shape, but they can't stop eating cookies. It is time to introspect the cues that lead us towards actions that do the opposite of achieving our goals.Once those cues are identified, only then can we profoundly change our actions. These existing routines need to be replaced by new routines or habits that will give us a new reward of working towards the goals that we have set for ourselves.Now that we understand that we have some control over the actions that we can take, it is time to decide which habits we want to focus on in 2021. Using the 80/20 rule, it can be inferred that 80% of the output will be delivered due to 20% of our habits.Hence, narrowing down the critical habits that will give us the maximum bang for the buck will save us time from working on developing non- critical habits.One can identify these critical habits by thinking of our goals. If the goal is to get leaner this year, then the critical habits to focus on would be exercising, eating, and resting.Another way to identify a critical habit is to ask the question: how? Start with your goal and keep on asking the question how till you get a specific action. Here's an example:Goal →Start an online businessHow? →Sell online coursesHow? →Prepare and market online coursesThe table above shows that a habit that helps in preparing and marketing online courses will be essential in achieving the goal of starting an online business.We can all vouch from personal experience that changing existing habits or building new ones is not an easy process. The best course of action would be to focus on 1 or 2 habits at a time. Working on 3 or more habits at a time could be overwhelming.By now, we have narrowed down 1 or 2 critical habits. Then comes the most difficult part: developing or changing them.As mentioned from the habit loop, one follows a routine to get some reward that our brain craves. Before we change the routine, we need to change the reward our brain craves. Let's look at an example below:Cue: Afternoon break from workRoutine: Snacking on cookiesReward: Strong dopamine response to consuming sugarIn this instance, the reward of strong dopamine response to sugar needs to be replaced by another reward. A new reward could be dopamine response to engaging with friends online or learning something new. In this instance, the afternoon break from work could be spent on spending time on social media or listening to one's favourite podcast.Consistency is the key here. Adopting the new routine every time on cue will help in developing the habit. The initial days are always the toughest as the cravings for the old reward are high. Once the brain gets used to the new reward, the new routine will become a habit.Once a new habit has been built, consistent action will be taken automatically towards the achievement of one's goals. This consistent action should result in better outcomes.The only way to find this out is to review this approach at the end of the year.Try changing a couple of critical habits in 2021 and see what happens at the end of the year. I will review my results at the end of 2021 and write an article talking about the results in early 2022.If you found this article useful, then please follow me on Twitter.",https://miro.medium.com/max/9954/0*Og4LCMgEtTXHOLxN,https://medium.com/the-ascent/my-2021-goals-focus-on-habits-rather-than-outcomes-3668f2569fc,productivity,5165ba0535fa97a577c623292e5328c8d4699a588d40561af929a877
How to Measure Success- GAS Goals,"Or - How to make goals into a process rather than a battleThe New Year is the time of goals. Particularly given the hellfire that was 2020, most people in my life are looking to turn over a new leaf in the new year. But New Year's resolutions often fail at the first hurdle, and most people end in a circle of trying, dissappointment, and reversion.This is not just true of resolutions though. How many times have you set out to achieve a goal, and then failed it? Sometimes, this can be because the goal isn't spercific, measurable, or realistic (basically, it isn't a SMART goal).Sometimes, though, it's more than that. Sometimes we don't actually think about what success looks like.What is success? It's a very personal question - for a close family member, not buying soft-drink at the supermarket is a success. For someone else, it's not something they even thing about. The personal nature of success makes it very difficult to measure scientifically, and to compare different people's successes across goals?It's a problem that occupational therapy has a solution for. Occupational therapy focuses looks at what a person wants to do, then helps that person to figure out a way to achieve that goal - generally while working around a limitiation. This could be a missing limb, recent domestic violence, mental health, stroke, ect.So, how can you measure success of therapy when people's goals are so different. And how can you measure change over time.Most people don't think about success as a measure, but instead as a goal. Success is often seen as a pass or fail question. For example:Basically, a no spend challange.If you reach the 200 dollars, then success! You've done it!If you don't reach it, then you're a failure. At this point, people will very often disengage from the idea.This is very black and white, and gives no way to measure change. It only takes into account whether or not you achieved a goal. And it doesn't really take into account how you achieved that goal, or how well you did.In this example, success is $200, $400, $1000 dollars. Failure is $0, $50, $195 dollars. There's no specificity.So how can we measure success with specificity? Because life isn't black and white. You haven't failed at life because you only managed to save 100 dollars. Or 50. And it's not just success if you somehow managed to double that and save 400 dollars.So. How can we measure success in a way that makes sense?GAS goals. They're used all the time in occupational therapy, and they measure all different types of success. By measuring goals this way, you can actually start to see patterns, and progress. But the main positive is that they show change, even if you don't reach ""your ultimate goal"".A gas goal starts by defining what success looks like. Here's the theroy of a gas goal:Let's take the example above:Everything after this is personal. You will use this goal time and time again - it's made to be used over time. So you set the parameters at the start, and then you can measure progress over time.So for me personally, I would say saving 300 or over dollars is +2, 250 is +1, 100 dollars is -1, less than 50 is -2.Thus:This scale is very personal to me - I think in 50s, and I'm pretty sure I could save at least 100 dollars, so it wouldn't be relevant to me to have that as a parameter. For someone else, it's entirely possible they would struggle to save 100, so they might have -1 be: saved between 100-200 dollars. It depends on how you want to use it.So you start working on your goal. Let's say you save 160 because you drank some wine at that one dinner out. I would award myself a -1. This doesn't mean I've failed.At that is the beauty of gas goals - they only measure success. Sometimes the success is standard. Sometimes it's +1, sometimes it's less that you expected. But it's all success.Shame, productivity, self-care (both responsible and self destructive) play themselves out in most millenial's minds. There's so much hustle culture, so much advice, so much *everything* that it can be easy to get lost in a cycle of trying, failing, trying, failing, trying, succeeding. It's exhausting. We're a generation prone to burn out.Using gas goals makes success achievable over time. It can help you move out of that cycle of self-recrimination, and onto a much more productive question:How did I actually do, and where am I headed next.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*v4mhYZzFRV2LscfSqGXtQA.jpeg,https://sianejones.medium.com/how-to-measure-success-gas-goals-ccb9bb6f3f88,productivity,20613d341bbadfd20b46f54c4bb1306b600e85cffd1f0c8f89cd205d
Driving Across the Country Will Soothe Your Weary Soul,"Mental health is on my mind a lot these days.I just wrapped two weeks in Southwest Florida visiting my grandfather. I enjoyed many of the usual comforts - warm weather, sunlight and pool water so warm if shampoo was involved it would have been a bath.But things were different this time.It wasn't the social distancing. It wasn't the mask wearing. I'm used to all that and frankly am happy to do my part in stifling the spread of the virus. The very air felt heavy. The sun didn't shine quite as bright. Shooting an 86 on a rather tough golf course should have sent me over the moon, but I found myself barely excited.I pride myself on being able to separate church and state. To leave my problems at home when I go on vacation. To fully immerse myself in whatever I'm engaged with. Not this time. This time home followed me.Every time I opened my phone, turned on the TV or joined in a conversation, I was reminded of the horrific problems plaguing this country. I was reminded of how divided people are. Neighbors, friends, family members constantly at odds with one another. Our country is fracturing at it's core and all I can do is watch. And it makes me tremendously sad.My sister Emily has an excellent descriptor for what ""Florida"" means to our family. The nature of my grandfather's house, the restaurants we frequent (in normal times that is), the games we play, the activities we do. She calls Florida, and everything therein, our sanctuary.But now the problems of the world have encroached on our sacred place. The divisiveness and anger and name-calling have made their presence known.Our sanctuary has been breached.I've always found peace behind the wheel.No, not in bumper to bumper traffic on Chicago's Interstate 90 on a Friday afternoon. I doubt anything but rage can be found there.I'm talking about the harmonious nature of the open road. I'm talking about listening to all the music and podcasts you haven't had time for. I'm talking about taking in the sights and sounds of the countryside, unseen when flying 6 miles above the Earth.I'm talking about the freedom to let your mind wander, to let your imagination run wild, to let your long-since-forgotten desire to explore come to the forefront.So I decided to drive back.Bonita Springs, FL to Palatine, IL (30 miles outside Chicago): 1,350 glorious miles. 20ish hours in the car punctuated by a stop at the Hilton Garden Inn for a brief siesta.I know what you're thinking:I'll tell you how.Florida is a really long, really flat state.It's about 350 miles from my grandfather's house to the Georgia border. Broken up by bridges and rivers and bays here and there, it mostly involves shooting up Interstate 75 in long, boring stretches with trees limiting your view on both sides. For HOURS.But damn if it isn't green the entire time.Chicago is dreadful in the winter. It's gray, dull, and snows so infrequently the remnants lay there in giant clumps for weeks on end, nasty from dirt and soot and trash. It's also cold as f*ck more often than not.Florida is beautiful in the winter. It's bright, sunny and not too hot. And coming from someone who sees very little green or sun from November through March, this is a welcome respite.As I push North at 79 miles an hour, there is very little traffic. Aside from Tampa, there are few large cities along the interstate to slow you down. Florida might be really long and really flat, but it's also really fast.I find myself daydreaming about living some place where it's green year round. Some place where I'm bathed in sunlight 300+ days a year and where it's never too cold to run or bike or be outside. It brings a subtle smile to my face.I press on, boosted by my thoughts of ""what if"".Georgia. The ""Peach State"".While not as long as Floria, it's long enough to where you establish various milestones in your mind. First comes Valdosta, right near the state line, then Atlanta, one of the largest Metropolitan areas in the US, then onwards towards Chattanooga and the Tennessee border.Green has turned to red. The luscious palm trees and giant maples have been replaced with pines and firs and red clay as far as the eye can see. It's a little hillier now. The Interstate curves and winds and goes up and down and to the side.Atlanta is massive. And I mean massive. While the Chicago Loop is high and mighty, Atlanta seems to stretch on forever. As I navigate through spurts of intermittent traffic, I look at the faces of the motorists around me. Where are they going? Do they even know? Do I even know?Mumford & Sons' second studio album Babel comes across my music queue. If there was ever an album written for a road trip, it's this one. The steady flow of the guitar, banjo and bass, the smooth lyrics and the toe-tapping beats fill my energy bar back up.I think momentarily about turning around and heading back to Bonita Springs. Back to sunlight, back to warmth. Back to family and peace and serenity. But is that what I'd actually find? The moment passes.Onwards. It's getting dark now. My vision is starting to blur from double-digit hours focused on the road. The lights of the cars behind me dart around like fireflies in the wind.Hopeless Wanderer plays as I cross the border into Tennessee.""So when your hope's on fireBut you know your desireDon't hold a glass over the flameDon't let your heart grow coldI will call you by nameI will share your road.""The areas surrounding the city of Chattanooga, TN might be one of my favorite spots in the continental United States.Nighttime has taken over. The moon sits high in the East, casting short shadows over the looming foothills. The Interstate bends and weaves through the valleys and up the hillsides. My ears pop as I ascend and clog as I descend.I quickly check my mirror. My face is a mixture of weariness and awe. Tired eyes that sparkle slightly with every passing vehicle. I rock side to side ever so slightly in cadence with the music.I think of her as I dance in the moonlight. Sadness, heartache, but mostly gratitude fills my mind. I wonder what she's doing right now. Is she looking up at the moon too?I listen to Ghosts That We Knew for the 7th time as I pull into the parking lot of the hotel.""So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the lightCause oh that gave me such a frightBut I will hold as long as you likeJust promise me we'll be alright.""New dawn brings new light.A quick stop for coffee and I'm on my way. Interstate 65 between Nashville and Louisville is a truly wondrous part of the country. Rolling hills set against sunny skies. And horses. So many horses.The horse farms are different than the bean and corn farms of the midwest. Barbed wire and wooden fencing encompass wide plains of grass, trees and mud. Horses run and cows graze. Just the way their forefathers did 100 years ago.I pull into what has to be the 10th rest stop of my journey. I'm an expert at navigating these things now. A family of four has stopped to stretch their legs. A sister and a brother and a puppy hop out of the back as mom issues instructions. Dad beelines for the bathroom.Sister and brother shriek in delight as they chase their new best friend around in the grass. For them, there is nothing else. No fear, no anger, just pure, unadulterated joy.Do I love anything as much as those children loved playing with that puppy on the side of the highway?I pass Indianapolis. 200 miles to go. One final push.Little do I know, giants await.I'm about an hour North of the city when, in the distance, I catch my first glimpse. They're hard to see at first, I have to squint hard in the late afternoon light. But then, suddenly, they rise before me. Massive wind turbines the likes of which I've never seen.I'm not talking about the thirty-foot rinky-dink windmills you see in the movies. I'm talking about winged monstrosities four hundred feet tall. White titans against a translucent sky.I've reached the Meadow Lake Wind Farm.The farm seems to stretch on for miles and miles. Some turbines spin fast, others slow, others not at all. Almost as if each has their own personality. I'm constantly battling the urge to gaze upward as I continue to weave in and out of the traffic that's slowly building.How tall are they? (400 feet). How much do they weigh? How much power do they output? How much do they cost to build? How do you transport them? And how in the HELL do you stand one of them up?These are but some of the questions that crowd my mind as I barrel towards my destination, feeling a bit smaller in the world than 30 minutes ago.The home stretch.The Chicago skyline beckons in the distance like a long-lost friend as I prepare to cross the Skyway back into Illinois. I'm ready to be home. After two weeks in someone else's bed and far too many hours in the car, my one bedroom apartment is starting to feel like Buckingham Palace.With every foot I travel things feel more familiar. Cars are dirtier from the excess salt on the roads. Billboards clutter my view. Daredevils shoot in and out of my lane to save mere seconds of drive time. Oh Chicago, how I've missed you.The last parts of my journey include flying Northwest on Interstate 294, exiting at Willow Road. Then, a few more streets until at last I'm home.I'm not super optimistic about 2021. I think we'll see improvements somewhere but continued chaos elsewhere. Humanity is really good at solving problems halfway while simultaneously creating new ones. I suppose there's little utility in speculating too much. What will happen will happen.But what I do know is I felt much better getting out of the car than I did getting in. Sore back, tired eyes and all. I haven't had that much time for self-reflection and meditation in quite some time, while listening to some truly extraordinary music.I got to know myself better during those 20ish hours. I thought a lot, which was expected. But I also experienced a lot, which was less expected.

Every Experience Is a Celebration of Life,"Le Pays Basque is a laid-back part of the world where the smell of the ocean and fresh morning pastries dance in the air at the start of each day.I wonder what it's like in Biarritz, France, on a day like today. How I miss it. A year and a half ago this place took hold of me like the tide of the sea; once in its grip, I didn't want to let go.Being there makes you breathe deep, slow down, and take a look around. It makes you happy to be alive.I know we'll be traveling again soon. When we do, I hope we remember this time of longing. Every experience, from a trip around the world to dinner with friends, shall be a celebration of life.Biarritz is one of Southwest France's essential towns and is considered by many the surf capital of Europe. I can't think of a better place to go when this is all said and done.My brother and I arrived in Biarritz on an overcast and humid morning. The breeze from the sea immediately welcomed us after stepping off the plane from Paris onto the small runway.The unmistakable scent of the Atlantic Ocean filled me to the brim with joy. My soul felt at home in this foreign place. We rented a car and drove slowly through the outskirts of town.As we did, we passed aged wooden farmhouses and cafes whose pastel colors had faded from the salty air. They wore a distinct, rustic patina.Surf culture took over Biarritz in the 1960s and changed the face of this erstwhile whaling town rooted in Basque tradition. Surrounding Biarritz are many villages and towns full of rich history, unique stories, and nuanced ways of living.One could drive from town to town as my brother and I did, getting lost in the surf culture that makes this part of the world unlike anywhere else year-round.Considered one of the oldest spoken languages in the world, perhaps even the oldest, the Basque language is gritty and passionate.Still, its origin remains shrouded in mystery. While French is the region's dominant language, the Basque language is spoken in parts of both France and Spain, a commonality between these countries along with world-renowned Basque cuisine and a profound love of the ocean.The spirit of Le Pays Basque is simple, pure, and incredibly beautiful. The green and brown Pyrenees mountains are speckled with white snow and provide a marvelous backdrop to the region.In the cold winter months, the mountain snow may travel to the seaside towns as it had recently. On one of our outings, my brother and I spoke with a local surfer while we visited the neighboring village of Guéthary. He told us that the winter before we were there, the beaches were covered in snow.Imagine the scene: small, clean waves rolling in with only a few surfers in the water, a beach blanketed in white snow, and a world-class restaurant waiting to warm up with wine and delicious food post-surf. Now that's an afternoon I can get behind.We arrived in Biarritz eager to get a bite. I'd been waiting to take a page out of one of my favorite books, Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises.I had to begin with some shellfish and a beer, followed by a dip in the water. I outdid myself with a plate of massive shrimp that appeared to have met their maker just moments before arriving at the table.Sitting outside on a cobblestone street, eating, drinking, and watching the world go by is one of life's most wonderful pleasures.It's moments like that one I sincerely miss. We all do.When the world opens up, we mustn't take these moments for granted. Every second with somebody dear won't just be routine. It will be an occasion to savor.That first night it began to softly rain. The ocean became a pale grey-blue as we prepared to jump in before a late dinner. The rain only made it better.The tide had risen and the waves crashed against the stone staircase leading down to one of the small inlets off the boardwalk.I swam far out to sea, taking in the summer rain. Being on the Atlantic side of France, the ocean is colder and rougher than the Mediterranean.My body felt good as I waded in the water and looked back at the city. It looked like an oil painting in motion. The evening festivities began to commence among the charcoal background of dusk.St. Martin's Church sits in Port Vieux, the center of the town, and looms over the surrounding bistros and surf shops. The cathedral is a reminder of this city's medieval history, a fascinating cultural blend of the past and present.The cathedral sitting next to the crashing waves is one of the most beautiful sceneries I've been lucky enough to witness.The next morning the aroma of fresh coffee and pastries rose from the bakeries and intertwined with the crisp, damp air. Shopkeepers opened their stores and fishermen set out for their day.I made my way down to the dock, observing the stillness of the fishing boats as their reflections glistened off the algae green water.Biarritz has been a whaling town since the Middle Ages. Its coat of arms portrays seafarers alongside a blue whale with the inscription: Aura, sidus, mare, adjuvant, me (the air, the stars and the seas are helping me).I set out to explore the city from end to end along its coast, about an hour's walk from one point to the other.I wanted to get lost among the labyrinthian trails and walkways that make up the city's cliffs, so I bobbed in and out and ran into a few field mice along the way.I came across some incredible vantage points overlooking the water.On one side of town is la Grande Plage, the city's main beach to lounge and enjoy the baking sun.In 1854, the last French monarch Napoleon III and his wife, Eugénie de Montijo, constructed their summer home in Biarritz.The estate was originally called Villa Eugénie and is now the Hotel Du Palais. The city's famed hotel provides a charming site to marvel at on a boardwalk stroll.Off Port Vieux is an island about a quarter-mile out to sea. Mother Mary's statue sits atop a man-made hill, blessing fishers as they set out for the day. I was there early along with a lone fisherman trying his luck.""Can I take your photo?"" I asked in my best French, so I'm sure it was rough.""Yes,"" he replied with a subtle smile, one I wouldn't be able to discern through a mask. It was connections like this between two strangers enjoying the simplicities of life that makes traveling a bridge between people.I henceforth strive to truly appreciate these moments, whether traveling or in my hometown. This world is all of ours; it's connections like this one I'll always remember.""They're not biting today,"" the man remarked as he patiently gazed into the water's glassy surface.It didn't matter all that much to him. He returned to his bait, attached a small fish to his line, and kept at it. I loved that early morning.Around the other side of Port Vieux is the beach, La Cote des Basques. The gentle rolling waves serve as an ideal beginner surf spot. Extola Bibi sits on the overlooking cliff, a small beach cafe to grab a beer or coffee after a surf or a day at the beach.My brother and I went for sunset one evening and split a bottle of local wine with cheese and crusty bread. We watched the final surf sessions of the day while the golden, darkening sky blended with the shade of the ocean.The sounds of clinking glasses and lively chatter surrounded my brother and me. We couldn't have been happier.We spent our days exploring the different beaches, towns, and various unique restaurants. I'd not known much about the Basque Country before this trip.The people who give it spirit, the architecture that gives it charm, and the history that gives it meaning captured my heart. After spending time in Southwest France, it's evident what qualities matter in life.As I think back on the trip, I'm reminded to let the unnecessary worries, negativity, and fear fade away. Life is too precious for these restraints on our soul. There's so much to appreciate, no matter where we are.On my final night, I went down to the Grande Plage to watch the lighthouse scan the water.No matter what's happening out at sea, no matter the size of the waves or the impact of a storm, a lighthouse is there to guide one home, a beacon to turn to and trust.I walked down the boardwalk towards the lighthouse, laid down on a bench, and closed my eyes to listen.Join my Saturday Newsletter to receive my latest published stories and podcast episode, plus all that has me thinking, smiling, and dreaming of more.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2368/1*JQEQBuLBVuaFRHjmrGMrgQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/scribe/every-experience-is-a-celebration-of-life-91901b551777,travel,79537af1df48c01f06f10cca929979ffb65f2a6226e3c5010ca41f92
You Need To Change How You Set Goals,"For as long as I can remember, I've been at war with goals. I grew up holding fast to the ones my parents provided for me (working a 9-5, getting married, having kids) to the point that I didn't even realize there were other ways to do things. Each one of the goals I followed came with a subset of exhausting smaller goals and modest, yet painful, sacrifices. By my college graduation, I was exhausted. I was meeting the goals I'd adopted from my parents, but I wasn't happy.To make things harder, by senior year, I'd realized that I was a lesbian. In 2009, this meant that not only could I not get married, but I also had to keep my sexuality hidden or risk losing my apartment and my job. I struggled under the weight of my secret and wondered how I could possibly achieve a goal when the law rendered it nearly impossible. Eventually, I realized that I couldn't. And that realization freed me.Living in Virginia, the truth was I couldn't legally marry and I might struggle to adopt children. Those goals crumbled and, though I grieved them, losing them opened space for me to define new goals completely outside of the framework of what I'd been taught to aim for. I wanted to find love, security, and a queer community. So I took out a credit card, quit my job, and moved to Los Angeles.The new city gave me a fresh start. I'd hated the formal requirements of my desk job, so in LA I learned to bartend. Tending bar granted me a joy I didn't realize it was possible to feel at work. I started to make friends and I focused on making sure I didn't regret a moment of my time in LA. Within a year, I'd built a life that was the exact opposite of the one I'd had in Virginia.For years, I assumed that the happiness I felt in those first few years on the west coast was simply a result of finding my place in the world. While I believe that helped, I think something much more universal was at play - something that any person can tap into no matter where they are.Months of quarantine have afforded me ample time to reflect on the ups and downs of my life in California. It started off jubilant but, at some point a few years in, I found myself struggling to maintain my joy. After a lot of introspection and a ton of therapy, I learned that when I first moved to LA, I was living a value-oriented life. I wanted to have fun, make enough money to live independently, feel safe to be myself, connect with other people, and make a home for myself. These were pursuits that I could weave into my daily life, where the success didn't just come from the end result, but included the journey as well. Each action I took that contributed to the successful expression of these values gave me joy and fulfillment.Smack dab in the middle of building my new life, I joined a book club to read Danielle LaPorte's The Desire Map. In it, LaPorte walks readers through the process of choosing three to five words that perfectly encapsulate how they want to feel every day. After readers determine the precise words that speak to them, those words become a roadmap for daily living. For every action and decision, readers learn to ask themselves, Does this make me feel the way I want to feel? If yes, proceed. If no, pivot. I didn't realize it at the time, but LaPorte's book provided the guidance I needed to finalize my shift away from goal-oriented living.My value-oriented life was an organic result of wanting to feel good. The Desire Map gave me a framework to make that focus on values intentional and maintain it as I continued to evolve. For years, I committed to returning to the book annually to update my values and reaffirm my commitment to prioritizing a value-oriented life. But eventually, I fell out of practice. Without a new framework to keep me focused on values, I shifted back to goal-oriented living. I left food service for the perceived security of an office job and I began to strive for flashier titles, higher salaries, and recognition.I've achieved a few of my goals, but they only serve to give me a small spark of dopamine as I check off one box and move on to tackle the next. As I discussed my difficulty finding joy with my therapist, I realized that I've been struggling to celebrate my wins because I've lost sight of the beauty of the journey.We've all survived a tough year. In 2020, most of us felt the gravity of the pandemic, isolation, financial uncertainty, systemic racism, and the development of a new normal. As we wait for the COVID vaccine to reach the masses and continue to fight for a more equal world, 2021 is likely to carry similar hurdles. As uncertainty swirls around us, I suggest that we all find a way to experience joy in our daily lives, no matter how small. Focusing on our values is the easiest way to do that.This isn't to say that goals are ""bad"" - I think they're incredibly useful for staying aligned with your values. Figure out the values that guide you and then set goals in service of those values. I also find that small goals work best. Anything too big (like aiming for a specific professional title by the end of the year) leads me to stress and diminishes the fun. Instead I made a professional goal to play in photoshop a few times a month because I value strengthening my creative muscles. See the difference? One is a box to check off, the other is a creative adventure. My new photoshop skills could contribute to a new title, but I'll find joy in the adventure and continue to grow - even if they don't.How do you want to feel when you pursue growth? What values define your joy? Which pursuits make you feel good? Dig in deep and think about the answers to these questions. Turn the questions over, play with different options, and allow this thinking to transform how you see the world. We all have the power to find our own values and let them lead us to the future we dream of. Why not start today? 🖤",https://miro.medium.com/max/14720/1*y4R6mPY3NzRoCJEHcLW29A.jpeg,https://sondrarosemarie.medium.com/its-2021-let-s-change-the-way-we-do-goal-setting-32385c3fb63a,productivity,81500ca34bd7d5cb829d0ca5d7224f9b385d9982782f196ca38ddd15
Group chat at work is NOT productive,"Voice mail is essentially dead, and for the last 2-3 years, we've been arguing that Slack and other group chat apps will kill email. This might happen, and to be honest something should kill email - because email is awful. And while I love Slack's valuation like the next guy, I just don't know if group chat apps are about to really reset the productivity paradigm in the much-hand-wrung ""future of work.""I personally don't mind it. I have GroupMe and Slack channels for different things. Look at me, being all millennial.New article on Fast Company called ""Employers, Your Employees' Lack Of Productivity May Be All On You.""First reaction: no shit it is.Second reaction: look at this pull quote.Here's where the problems begin.52 minutes on, 17 off.""A focus day.""Knowing how to maximize 15 minutes.Understanding priorities and importance.Oh, that brings me to something else. From the same Fast Company article above, you've got this:Bingo Bango.Problem is: some people like these kinds of workplaces.They want to be urgent all the time.It's important to be (or be seen as) busy.Their new residence is the cross.Psychologically, this isn't rocket science. We spend 10-12 hours/day at work for the better part of our lives. You're going to associate some of that with relevance and self-worth. Because priority and strategy are often unclear, the best path to this necessary relevance is how busy/urgent/in need you are.This is why many offices ultimately get very ""hair on fire,"" and while everyone complains, they secretly kinda love it.In many ways, yes. Consider:All these bullet points are things that young urban professionals want from their lives, even if we claim to want other things. And group chat apps hand you all of 'em on a silver platter.But to assume group chat implies more productivity? That's probably folly.Your take on group chat at work?",https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*7Qke2t8I-0mxIvOvzDG3nw.jpeg,https://tedbauer2003.medium.com/group-chat-at-work-is-not-productive-b038816a63b4,productivity,5377154c7f23909dc93b66f7d300d644e851330882da9e6db361f919
Choosing the Right Sleeping Bag Temperature Rating,"It can be hard to choose the sleeping bag temperature that will be best for you. The most important function of a sleeping bag is keep to you warm when it's cold out, but you also don't want to sweat all night when it's warm out. Finding the right balance can be difficult enough that a lot of serious outdoors-folk have multiple bags. However, the normal, a budget-conscious recreationist like myself can't always afford multiple, quality sleeping bags. So how can you choose a sleeping bag that will keep you comfortable in multiple seasons?If you're looking for one sleeping bag to use year-round, a 10°F to 20 °F sleeping bag is probably the best option. During the winter months, you can add a liner to increase the warmth. In warmer climates, you may want to bump the temperature up by 10 °F, or so. If you do mostly summer-time trips, a 30 °F sleeping bag should keep you comfortable.When you select a sleeping bag, make sure it is rated using EN or ISO testing standards. If your sleeping bag is not tested by these standards there is a good chance it won't be as warm as advertised. I've made a guide about the EN and ISO sleeping bag temperature ratings, so you know what the ratings mean and how to determine the protocols used to test the bag.To decide what temperature sleeping bag you should get you first need to know when you will be using the sleeping bag. If most of your camping or backpacking is in the desert during summer you don't need a 0 °F bag. On the other hand, if you spend a lot of time doing backcountry ski trips in the winter, you don't want to get a 30 ° F bag.If you mostly use a sleeping bag while car camping the temperature rating won't be as important because you can easily bring extra blankets and clothes to use if you get cold. However, if you're using the sleeping bag in the backcountry you'll need to trust its warmth to keep you safe if an unexpected cold front rolls in, or if you get wet and need to warm up to prevent hypothermia.It's also important to consider the terrain you'll be sleeping in. Temperatures in the mountains can change dramatically as storms quickly roll in. That's why I usually take a sleeping bag that is warmer than I think I'll need when in the mountains because I want to be prepared if I encounter colder temperatures.Desert temperatures can drop a lot at night, but the weather patterns are generally more stable and predictable.Think about where you're going to spend the most time sleeping outside, then determine what the weather is like in those locations. Once you've decided on those things, picking a temperature rating becomes much easier. Especially if you're only camping during a single season.For single-season use, it's pretty simple to choose a sleeping bag temperature rating. Look up the average low temperatures for the locations you usually visit during the season you're there. Then find a sleeping bag with a temperature rating slightly lower than that average low temperature.For a summer sleeping bag, a temperature rating between 20 °F and 40 °F should be adequate, depending on your location. In winter you'll probably want a bag rated between -10 °F and 10 °F. For spring and summer, a 20 °F to 30 ° F bag should do the trick. When I'm uncertain I usually err on the side of more warmth.Of course, adjust these recommendations for the specific areas you visit.Choosing a sleeping bag temperature is more complicated when you want to use it across multiple seasons. In this case, you need to balance staying warm enough when it's cold against being uncomfortably warm when it's not. It's always best to lean toward a warmer bag because you can always unzip it or sleep on top of it, but you can't add extra warmth when it gets really cold.If you spend time in the mountains from late spring through early fall I would recommend a 20 °F temperature rating. You can get a 20 °F bag that isn't too heavy or expensive but will still perform in a lot of situations. If you're in a warmer or colder climate you may want to adjust by 10 ° F or so in either direction.For those that regularly sleep outside in both warm summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures, it's probably best to get two sleeping bags. Get one with a 20 °F-30 °F rating (again, depending on location) to use in the warmer months. Then get another sleeping bag with a -10 °F to 0 ° F rating for the cold months.I've already mentioned that I take a warmer sleeping bag than I think I'll need when I go into the mountains. This is especially true when I'm backpacking.In the backcountry, you only have the supplies you carry with you. If an unexpected cold front comes in when you're a 2-day hike from resources you have to make do with what you have.A sleeping bag is arguably the most important piece of gear you carry on a backpacking trip. If things go south and you're in a situation where hypothermia is a concern your sleeping bag is the best piece of gear you have to keep you warm. If you brought a 40 °F bag on a trip where a cold front brings in 20 ° F overnight lows you're going to have to work to find ways to stay warm.After you've done a few backcountry trips you'll get a feel for the temperatures and weather patterns in the areas you visit. You'll also learn things you like and don't like about the gear you have, and that will help you make informed decisions.If you're just starting out and don't have a feel for the temperature rating you need I would recommend a 20 °F bag for most backcountry activities from early to late summer. The 20 ° F temperature rating should keep you warm throughout the summer months while keeping the size and weight of the sleeping bag down.Eventually, most of us encounter a situation where we have a sleeping bag that just isn't warm enough. It can happen because the weather changed without warning, the temperature rating on a bag wasn't accurate ( see this guide to help prevent that), you didn't have the budget to buy a new bag for a late-season trip or a number of other reasons. If you end up in this situation there some simple things you can do to increase the warmth of the bag you have.You'll be amazed at how much wearing extra clothes, especially a hat and socks, will warm you up at night. I've spent a lot of cold nights in a bag that wasn't warm enough (because I was a cheap college student) and stayed warm all night by layering up with clothes inside my bag.Sleeping bag liners that slide inside your bag can also increase its warmth. These liners are usually quite affordable and make it easy for your bag to function well in multiple temperatures.You can take the liner idea farther by using two sleeping bags, sliding one inside the other. This is a good option if you're car camping and have two sleeping bags for warmer weather. I've done this several times with two 30 ° F bags when temperatures were below 20 ° F and have stayed toasty warm.Choosing the proper temperature rating for your sleeping bag will help you be safe and comfortable whether you're sleeping 30 miles from the trailhead or right next to your car. The budget-conscious outdoors-person can probably make one sleeping bag work for year-round use by using a liner or extra clothes to stay warm in the winter. By considering your needs and range of use before purchasing a sleeping bag you can make sure the temperature rating you select will support the majority of your outdoor pursuits.Originally published at https://publiclandsjournal.com.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10944/0*J9Mt3dB5ZwFsxPfa,https://medium.com/curious/choosing-the-right-sleeping-bag-temperature-rating-5766cea723ff,travel,07593317d4be9024667691481bb071769c2dfca67b51040f17756a9f
Migration is in Our Blood,"Around 100,000 years ago, humans began migrating outside of Africa, populating other continents. At the same time, the African continent had its fair share of inner migration. One of the major migrations was the Bantu expansion, where the Bantu people migrated from southern West Africa (modern Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon) to the central, eastern, and southern areas of the continent. The Bantu ended up dominating all of Africa south of a line crossing from southern Nigeria to Kenya, except for South Africa and the Namibian desert.Spreading new farming, ironworking, pottery, and deforestation technologies, the Bantu people permanently imprinted on the places they migrated. 500 languages spoken today are derived from the Proto-Bantu language.Many have left their homeland in search of something new. Sometimes it is for the excitement of exploring, but oftentimes it's due to the typical culprits - exhaustion of local resources, increased competition for local resources, overpopulation, famine, epidemics, warfare, and climate change. The story hasn't changed. Culprits like these forced 79.5 million people to migrate by the end of 2019.Our ancestry is a story of migration. I joke to my friends and family that I could become a top salesman for companies that offer genealogical DNA tests because I'm obsessed with talking about my own results. As a descendent of the Atlantic slave trade, I was stripped of the privilege of knowing the origins of my forefathers, but the genealogical DNA tests provide a fascinating story of my ancestors' movements.My Nigerian, Cameroonian, Congolese, Beninese, Togolese, Ghanaian, Malian, and Senegalese heritage blueprints a piece of the African Diaspora. My Scottish and English heritage hints at the dominance of a colonialist regime. And, my Western, Eastern, Southern Bantu heritage speaks to an older migration, whose influence lasted thousands of years.Your DNA, no matter where you are from, no matter your culture, no matter if you are the victor or the oppressed today, holds the same types of records. Migration is in our DNA.And I have migrated. I've migrated from my hometown of Baltimore to various other U.S. cities like Austin and Denver. This year I even migrated from my country, moving to the Netherlands for school. But some do not feel the necessary or adventurous pull to migrate - my mother is born and raised in Baltimore and will never leave. But she has lived in various parts of the city and county, migrating from different neighborhoods.When one moves to a new neighborhood, state, or country, there are operational tasks one must complete. I have previously submitted my new addresses to the USPS, and the city municipality in the Netherlands. We know that it is not generally condoned in our societies to be unidentified. Some institution has to track your location. It is preferable if your location is permanent and the institution knows the location's latitude and longitude.Today migration is limited by government administrations. I must get my passport stamped to move to essentially any part of the world. Some nation has claimed every parcel of land that dots this earth. For the first time in human history, every acre is attached to an administrative apparatus.I don't know about you, but I feel trapped. Bureaucracy governs movement.The worldwide passport standard emerged in 1920 after World War I by the League of Nations, a Western organization tasked to maintain peace. The U.S. then passed the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and The Immigration Act of 1924 limiting the inflow of immigrants. What was the emergency? Too many people from unwanted countries were threatening ""the ideal of American hegemony."" On November 29, 1941, U.S. law required Americans to have a passport. In 1978, an amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 made it unlawful to enter or depart the U.S. without an issued passport even during peacetime.As an American, my passport is relatively powerful - I can access 185 countries out of the 195 total countries in the world without a prior visa. Only 15 countries provide better access than the American passport (those members are entirely Asian and European). Yet, I feel uneasy. If I want to go anywhere in the world, I need to tow my passport with me, convert my currency, declare myself with legally binding documentation, be cognizant of the rules of the land to make sure I'm not met with various levels of violence (e.g., a $200 ticket for jaywalking, a night in a jail cell, 15 years of hard labor).Of course, my passport is one of the most privileged in the world. Still, I can't shake the feeling that I really can never do what my ancestors did.It was always the case that migration brought the risk of disease, war, and death. But now convoluted administration systems are added to these risks. Don't get me wrong. Belonging to a certain passport club with inures benefits. The club may offer benefits like clean water, roads, infrastructure, protection from invaders, and vaccines. But in some clubs, club members walking on other club member's property could be a death sentence. Migrating to a new club so that your children can live a better life might mean your children end up in cages separated from you. In this lifetime you cannot avoid border control.Our land has become too much like jail, so we have to look at other places. Elon Musk is looking to space. He might look to the ocean next, for more than 80% of the ocean is unmapped and unexplored.What must it feel like to begin a sojourn to a place where you have absolutely no information? You don't know what it's like, how it feels. I feel connected to my Bantu ancestors, my oldest known story of ancestral migration. Their story runs in my veins.I guess then I will look up to the stars too. Feast my eyes on a new horizon. Gather up my tools for an adventure. Await to learn of new lifeforms.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*JqPjJzXBx1cdr3km,https://medium.com/illumination/migration-is-in-our-blood-76537b4b4413,travel,8184664f6160f76133930368b893cc8f4c0e07fc11dc4012ece38a6b
22 Minutes,"6:00 a.m. Salim squats low, his back straight, his knees bent. He pivots upward, hoisting open the heavy metal gate of his coffee truck. He uses just his legs and ""core"", as a customer once advised. His breath blows white in the icy morning air. He wonders if he's getting too old for this. His wife says he is. But he can't imagine his days, long and empty. Sitting at home. Looking after grandkids? He makes a steaming cup of doodh pati chai, just as he's done at exactly this time, six days a week for nearly 40 years. The tea reminds him of home.6:01 a.m. Rebecca, 33 and tall, with wild auburn hair, cruises to the subway station on her bike. She gracefully flips a leg over the back of her seat and glides to a stop balanced on one pedal. She locks her bike to a stand, removes her helmet and snaps it to her bag. She looks in her bike mirror and smooths her hair. She enters the station with a weathered copy of Anna Karenina under her arm.6:02 a.m. His name is James. He sells tickets and makes announcements. It's his voice that pipes over the loudspeaker, informing people of delays, to mind the gap and to stay alert to their surroundings. James used to be Jenny. Years ago. Before London. He hangs his coat on a hook in the ticket office. He waves to Salim in his coffee truck.6:03 a.m. An indigo blue sky before dawn. Clouds, more like dark shadows. Two pigeons amble toward Salim's truck. They're like an old married couple the way they lean in close and constantly nip at each other. ""Shoo shoo!"" says Salim, coming out of the truck and waving his hands. He spots a dark bag by the subway entrance. Two construction workers order espressos.6:04 a.m. He's a young man, 5'8, watery blue eyes, mousy brown hair. He has a forgettable face with rounded features, a blunt nose, and thin unkissable lips. His name is Marshall. He hates his name. He can see the entrance to the subway station from his studio flat. Perfect commute, he thought, when he signed the lease six months ago. Not that it matters now. He brushes his teeth like it's any other day. He checks his backpack and phones. One is an old-fashioned flip model. He makes sure it's on vibrate.6:05 a.m. David is late. He likes to be at his desk in the City by 7 a.m. Halfway out the door, his sister rings. She needs money; he can tell by her chirpy tone. She lives in Myanmar. At least that's where she is this month. She teaches English. Ever since their parents died in that hotel blast in Sri Lanka, it's like she can't sit still. He envies her and pities her at the same time. David taps a reminder into his phone to wire money and walks out the door.6:06 a.m. James announces the trains are delayed. There's a person on the tracks at Parsons Green. He says this solemnly. It's the third time this month he's made this announcement. December suicides. The scripted phrasing, ""a person on the tracks"", always upsets him. It strips the person - already defeated - of their individuality. No name, no gender, no story. Salim is mouthing something to him from his coffee truck, while jabbing a finger toward the subway entrance. An elderly, sad-looking man named Omar, approaches the ticket booth. He asks James for help topping up his Oyster card.6:07 a.m. Hearing the announcement, Rebecca looks up from her book. Most people are still glued to their phones. It's like they didn't hear about the person on the tracks. Only a few people leave the station. She thinks there's a connection between the increasing number of people on phones and the increasing number of suicides on the tracks. Maybe she'll look into this at work. Three days before Christmas. There's not much else to do.6:08 a.m. When Marshall was five he danced in the aisle of a grocery store. His dad yanked his arm and whacked him hard on the rear. ""No one wants to see you making a spectacle of yourself,"" he hissed. This is what Marshall is thinking as he stares out the window at the station where until last week he had a good job. He pulls on a hoodie and walks out his front door.6:09 a.m. Over the loudspeaker, James tells people it's unclear how delayed the trains will be. He asks them to step back from the tracks. The next train isn't stopping. A teenage boy, looking at his phone and wearing big earphones, doesn't hear. A chain of empty cars whoosh past, blasting air in the boy's face and catching him by surprise. He tells himself this is what it means to be alive. He takes one step closer to the tracks and looks back at his phone.6:10 a.m. More people leave the station. A woman stops at Salim's truck and tells him about the suicide. ""So close to Christmas,"" Salim says sadly, and shakes his head.6:11 a.m. Marshall approaches the station as more people flood out. He's wearing a backpack across his chest. He doesn't know why people are leaving, but he's glad they are. Marshall isn't unfeeling. He enters the station, pausing briefly to smile up at the security camera. Salim sees him and is suddenly struck by a terrible premonition. He's had a bad feeling all morning, ever since seeing the bag by the entrance. It's also the day: December 22. Salim is a superstitious man. He thinks 22 is evil. A day on the calendar when terrible things happen. A typical number of casualties when bombs go off. An age at which young men do stupid cruel things. Once you know a thing like this, you see it everywhere. Marshall is 22.6:12 a.m. James sees Marshall pass by the ticket booth. He feels sorry for the young man. He was a good worker. But you can't yell at passengers. Even if they put themselves, and others, at risk. Firing Marshall was left to James. The look Marshall gave him still makes him shudder. But that was a week ago. Surely he's settled down. On impulse, James taps the window and waves. He offers an apologetic smile. Marshall looks up in surprise. He quickly nods a greeting and keeps walking.6:13 a.m. Omar sits on a bench. He sees people exiting and stands as if to go too. But he's in no hurry. The museum doesn't open until 10 a.m. Omar always leaves his house early. He feels the walls closing in. His wife died six months ago. Her clothes still hang in the closet; her bathrobe in the bathroom; her slippers by the bed. It's like she's just out shopping. He wishes he was the one who fell in the tub. His wife would have insisted he bring his cane. He feels faint and sits back on the bench.6:14 a.m. Rebecca scans the platform for her banker. That must be what he is. Neat hair, smart suits, early hours. He always smiles at her, like maybe they knew each other at school. She likes his wide shoulders and slim hips. She likes that he reads a newspaper instead of a phone. She imagines Sunday mornings, the two of them in bed, newspapers spilling over the sheets. She swears to herself that today will be the day she finally strikes up a conversation. She doesn't see him.6:15 a.m. David arrives at the subway. He passes her bike. It's locked with a cheap chain. He thinks one day he'll buy her a better lock, and a better bike too. He remembers the first time he saw her. The flash of a slim white ankle sailing over the back of a bike. For weeks, he's been working up the courage to ask her out. It's not a romantic thought, and he'd never tell anyone, but he can see her at 70, tall and slim, still riding high on a bike, her russet hair flying in the wind. They'll still hold hands. He likes that she's a reader. And still young enough to have kids. He's later than usual. He hopes she's still there.6:16 a.m. Rebecca reads her book; James thinks about getting a coffee. Omar twists his wedding ring as he sits alone on a bench staring at an empty subway track. Salim starts to call his wife but then hangs up. She'll call him a silly old fool. But he can't shake the feeling that something awful is about to happen. He wipes dried milk off the coffee steamer with a damp cloth.6:17 a.m. Marshall walks to the subway platform. His head is down. David, rushing to see the woman, knocks into him. ""Sorry mate,"" he says good-naturedly, and claps Marshall on the back like they're old friends. It's the first human contact Marshall has had in months. He mumbles something and moves away. He stands in front of the bench where Omar sits. David spots Rebecca, but is suddenly nervous and stays put. A train approaches with a loud rumble that fills the station. It stops short of the platform.6:18 a.m. A small yellow leaf clings to a tree. It's the sole winter survivor on a grand oak. A strong wind gusts, shaking the tree's branches. The leaf flails in the wind before snapping off. It spins to earth and lands on Salim's truck counter. It's bright and perfectly formed. Salim sees the leaf as significant. He shuts off the coffee machine and pulls the gate down on his truck and locks it. He notices the bag is gone from the entrance. He's probably being silly, but he goes for a walk around the block.6:19 a.m. Omar stands up again and steps forward. Suddenly he feels faint. Rebecca sees him sway and rushes over. She grabs him but he's heavier than he looks. Marshall, standing a step away, cradles his backpack. He looks a million miles away. Rebecca tries to support the elderly man. ""Help me! He's falling! I need help!"" she calls out. Marshall, startled, reverts to the subway worker he was a week ago. He steadies the man and helps Rebecca get him back to the bench. Omar smiles feebly. ""Thank you my dears,"" he says, nodding and grasping both young people's hands. ""Can I call someone for you?"" Rebecca asks. ""I'll be fine,"" says Omar. Marshall returns to a spot by the tracks. Rebecca runs off to get water.6:20 a.m. James announces that the train is still being held at a red signal. He thanks people for their patience. He looks at his watch. It's time for that coffee. He sees Salim's truck is closed. He remembers now that Salim tried to tell him something earlier. He walks outside to find him but he's not around. James returns to his booth to check on the train.6:21 a.m. Rebecca is back with a bottle of water. Omar puts a hand to his heart in thanks. David, now standing next to Marshall, watches the scene. His heart swells. Marshall, beside him, steps over the yellow line. If he were to lean forward now, he would fall on the tracks. He thinks maybe that would spare the others - the kindly old man and the pretty young woman. Just topple forward when the train barrels by. But he doesn't want to be just another person on the tracks. All that effort and planning for nothing. His hand is in his pocket; his finger on the button. He closes his eyes. He leans forward and starts to take that one final step...6:22 a.m. David throws his arm in front of Marshall. ""Careful mate,"" he says with a smile. ""We don't want to lose you so close to Christmas."" It's such a tiny gesture. The acknowledgement a person matters. Marshall looks at his feet and steps back from the yellow line. Without realizing it, he's let go of his phone. His finger is no longer on the button.[A story I wrote called 11 Minutes, which people seemed to like, inspired me to write another story of a genre I think of as Minute Fiction. It could be a thing!

I Canceled My Trip to Mexico Last Minute,"Not to sound like a total PV gay, but it's true: Up until yesterday morning, I was getting ready to pack my bags for Baja California.My two friends and I had hatched the travel plans over the summer - I guess in desperate hope that things would have been better by now on the Covid-19 front. Obviously, things didn't quite pan out like we (and the rest of the world) hoped.Covid-19 is worse than it's ever been on the West Coast and in nearby Baja California. And yet, less than 24-hours ago I was still hedging my bets on flying in from across the country and driving across the U.S.-Mexican border.In San Diego, ambulances are actually being diverted from local hospitals, forcing patients in need to wait for hours-on-end due to the sheer quantity of Covid-hospitalized people overwhelming ICU beds.The West Coast's Covid-19 tally is now four times what it was during the summer surge, and, perhaps most shockingly, it is facing a literal shortage of oxygen. You heard that right - according to New York Times reporting, guidelines were issued to emergency workers in L.A. county just after Christmas to administer the ""minimum amount of oxygen necessary"" to keep patients stable. Breathing easy has become a privilege not everyone can afford.It wasn't going to be 20 people crowded on a boat with margaritas flowing like water - although, I did plan on that last part being true.It was just the three of us: Me, my best friend that lives in LA, and a friend from Tijuana.Part of the reason I held onto the idea of getting on that plane tomorrow morning for so long was that I told myself we could do this thing safely. In reality, I would have probably seen less people if I went on this trip than I'm going to now that I'm staying in New York. I have two roommates and a pod of friends here; in Mexico, I would've just had my two compadres.I decided last week that I would go on a social media break while I was away. That was the first time I felt like I was doing something wrong.I knew I would get hate for traveling during possibly the worst of the pandemic, and I didn't want to have to explain to everyone the precautions I'd taken to go on this trip (not to mention to look like the guy that ""explains"" his way out of safety measures during a global pandemic).Then, with the rise of the now-infamous Instagram Covid-exposé account, Gays Over Covid, I suddenly felt like I was harboring a dirty secret that I could only whisper in private to my close friends.""*Ahem*, yes, I'm still planning on going ..."" I'd say, feeling the anxious knot ball itself up in my stomach.If you're considering leisure travel right now, I'm not here to judge you - I mean, who would I be to judge anyway?I understand it feels like you can do it safely - and I don't doubt that there are certain trips, with certain people where it can be done safely. I get that Covid can often feel like it's a million years behind us in day-to-day life, and I understand the feeling of just wanting to crawl out of your skin, bust down your apartment walls and run naked through the streets all the way to the airport.No? Nobody? Just me? Alright then.Because I can't help but share unsolicited advice (the curse of being a writer on the internet I guess), here's what I did to decide if I should stay or go.Momma knows best, as they say.No, but for real, I knew yesterday morning when I woke up that I needed to talk all this through with someone that would listen, unjudgementally. It wasn't until after my call with her that I realized I'd pretty much already made up my mind on what I should do before I even picked up the phone.As it turns out, sometimes you just need someone to listen to you so that you can tell them out loud what you already know.I didn't source those facts about dire-oxygen supplies and jumping Covid-spikes out of thin air.To help make up my mind, I forced myself to face the facts - and the graphs. The spiky curve I saw when I Googled ""Covid-19 San Diego"" was enough to give me pause. The news that followed was enough for me to cancel my flight.I wasn't traveling in March, and the Covid numbers are way higher in the area than they were then. The numbers tell the hard truth - it just isn't the time.The biggest thing I felt when I thought about jetting off to the West Coast and Mexico in two days wasn't excitement, or happiness, or even pre-trip jitters, but the heavy weight of anxiety.As my would-be-travel buddy told me when I called to tell him that I wasn't going to head to the airport after all, I had to listen to how I felt to make my decision.""You're not going to want to be out here if you're going to be anxious the whole time,"" he told me. ""It's just not worth it.""*As much as I've already established that I love handing out unsolicited advice.The truth is, as much social policing as there's going on these days, it's really no one's job but your own to decide what you feel is safe, socially responsible, and, in general, ""the right thing to do"". Yes, they can convince you, but you're the one that has to make the final decision as to whether or not to get your booty on that plane. Also, it almost entirely depends on your situation - your reason to travel, where you're going, who you'll be seeing etc.The CDC said so, the New York Times reported so, and my gut was screaming ""don't go"".For you, I'd say take every fact you can into consideration, call your Mommas, Pappas, friends, and lovers, and keep that ear perked for what your gut might be twisting in knots to tell you.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2620/1*LvslCMFomPYDQjYTr6sjWQ.png,https://medium.com/curious/i-canceled-my-trip-to-mexico-de77a331767b,travel,63034605cf948cacea0cfd3f2264bf0fe1e1433d9315e4304d4e10b4
Santa Teresa Problems.,"They're going to coat the road with molasses. That will help the dust, explain the expats who don't pay taxes. That will help the dust.Store owners and bartenders dump buckets of water in front. People wear goggles. Wash your eyes out unless you want a sty that lasts for three months.Girls from Argentina sip maté from metal straws. A monkey growls in a nearby tree. ""I'm trying not to look at its balls,"" says an American. ""But it's so hard. They look painfully heavy.""I dance on the beach. I find a friend who hasn't had internet for days. I tell her about the attempted coup. She rolls a cigarette and asks when the beaches are closing.There are restrictions today. Will they be enforced? We are not supposed to be on the beach after 2 p.m., but the cops just seem to be concerned about confiscating weed.Get to the tide pools soon - You have to go during low tide. Surf during high tide, tide pools during low tide, sleep and eat in-between.The ice cream store is out of my favorite flavor. There's a boy who tried to grab my ass. He comes by on his motorbike. His feelings seem hurt and the only thing that will stop the guilt and pain is if I have sex with him and allow him to ignore me so he feels he came out ahead.There are so many men who try to make you feel guilty for not fucking them, like fucking is charity work you should want to perform out of the goodness of your heart.There's a man who lives at the hostel. He delivers food. He's always on standby. That means he's always swinging in a hammock and waiting for his phone to go off.A barefoot man tries to start his dirtbike. He cannot. ""Show it some love,"" I say. He laughs. It clicks and sputters. He starts to glide down the dirt road, something catches, and it starts.Some girls are in thongs and little else.

The surfers don't care. They'll either be surfing or napping. The remote workers and trying to figure out who has a backup generator. The local who does laundry simply tells her customers that their towels and sheets will be done in two days.The remote workers cannot do that.

The Magic Hour,"It is the magic hour on Linwood Drive. The golden light still lingers in the trees while the mommies and daddy wait for the daddies and mommy to come home. The children play on the street where the heat escapes the pavement in pleasant waves.There is the grapefruit tree in the Bingham's yard - its scent so wonderful that everyone is always surprised when the fruit itself is a disappointment. And finally (at last!) Edie's pitcher of sangria, plum purple and swimming with fruit.It's five o'clock somewhere someone always says, this time maybe Celia, who has dressed for the occasion, a yellow sheath and a pedicure to boot. It's five o'clock here, retorts Georgia and they laugh and toast and breathe deeply.Reinforcements will arrive soon for some of them, hopefully with takeout and maybe some Netflix once the kids are asleep. Play hard, calls Stephen in anticipation of this, but he doesn't need to worry. Because there's freeze tag and hide and go seek and some other complicated game the twins have started which above all requires absolute obedience of their every command.Go sit in the jail, Lila tells Felix and Toby and they follow her extended finger into the Sweet viburnum without complaint. Emma! Lila! Quit bossing everyone around, Edie says. Little tyrants. The others know that she doesn't care. If she did, her daughters wouldn't be the cherub-faced terrors they are, destined for the life of a litigator, or a dominatrix.No sense worrying about them today though. Not with the pale pink sky, the sangria soaked fruit in the bottom of their glasses. Becca sucks an orange slice with near perfect contentment. The baby is soundly asleep - finally - and Anna Beth is not crying or pouting or generally making a spectacle of herself so that the others would rather run headlong into the boogeyman than spend time with her.So yes, she will have another one and no, she's not worried about breastfeeding. Maybe it will make Larkin sleep when she's actually supposed to instead of turning her mother into a zombie from the inside out.It gets better, Celia says and they all agree, just to be agreeable, because now Georgia has appeared with a couple of bottles of wine that she and Stuart brought back from Napa. The grass is a spongy carpet between their toes. Steven pulls his old skateboard from the garage and flies around the cul-de-sac, helmet be damned, chasing Mark and Susie on their bikes.Why do I have to wear a helmet, Susie whines, just before she falls, and Steven says, that's why, and everybody laughs until they realize that Susie is crying, really crying, and Steven is forced to stop and play father, It's OK and don't be such a cry baby and a little blood never hurt anybody.Let me dash in for a band-aid, Georgia says and then pantomimes running so that they are all in on the joke. They all can't be gym rats like Celia. Who has the time? Then again, maybe Celia feels like she has to. Ben is so handsome. It's not fair the way a man ages.A cooler breeze, the first star in the night sky, or is it a planet? Becca can never remember. Steven comes out of his house with beer, home-brewed with a friend of his, as well as a boom box. Old school, he says.Is this what you do in your spare time? Edie jokes, eyeing the amber liquid alive with unknown particles, and when he counters, What? Are you chicken? They all laugh. House husband is what they are thinking. Marjorie doing so well and traveling all the time and him unemployed since the layoff. They each take a bottle and when Van Morrison pipes through the speakers, they dance.And why not? The velvet dark is almost upon them. Edie and Georgia can't stop laughing because they both want to lead and Steven spins Becca around and around, her head thrown back in forgetting or remembering or some combination of the two.For a while the children stop in their play and stare and then Emma grabs Lila and Grace settles for Anna Beth because Mark and Susie are busy pouring a Sprite on an anthill. When Crazy Love starts, Edie and Becca sway arm in arm and Steven takes Celia by the waist. Georgia cradles Felix in her arms and breathes him in deeply.They are all completely, blissfully transported, so much so that almost no one sees how closely Steven holds Celia, how he looks upon her breasts spread before him on the dip, until Mark is on his back, yelling. Don't you kiss my mother again.And there is silence before everyone talks at once while they process what they have heard but not suspected. Don't and kiss and mother and most importantly, again. They need water and aspirin and the privacy of home.Time to pack it in, calls Edie, too cheerfully, and Becca's insides clench because the baby is up, probably for the night. Goodbye, goodbye, goodnight they all say, even Celia to Steven although once inside she will not speak a word to Mark for the rest of the night so that he eats alone, ashamed, in front of the TV.It is Susie who finally remembers Toby still hiding in the bushes, now dark and thrumming with insects, tear tracks the only clean thing on his face. Don't tell your mother, Steven says but this is something Susie already knows.Like she knows now that sometimes daddies dance with other mommies and it's no big deal. Just before they all came inside, she snuck the last swallow of someone's wine. It was not what she expected but sweet all the same, a secret of her own, still on her tongue.All rights reserved © Betsy Denson",https://miro.medium.com/max/4002/1*HJMTMdXtHYc9e5INP0a29Q.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-magic-hour-497522d4d696,fiction,48895008096e5b6a52aa42d01974fb61c2edcfa106c9cbdcfe09fc09

The Remains,"Cigarette smoke recalled better times. Were he a childless bachelor again, Amin could spend a lifetime at that nameless street, inhaling secondhand smoke and reminiscing about Hasan.Hasan would smoke in the same manner: always anchored with one foot to the wall behind him. The only difference was that, unlike the stranger before Amin now, Hasan would rather fidget with a lighter than a smartphone, amused by how, with one, seamless motion of the thumb, man could summon fire.""Isn't it interesting?"" he asked.""I suppose so. I just never really thought about it,"" Amin replied.""Suppose?"" Hasan repeated, ""Friend, I know you don't smoke, but at least think. This substance - if we can call it that - fills your stomach. Fire is food. Fire is industry. It's Dhaka. It's New York. Fire is finance and economy. And yet, all of us today can call it and bid adieu as we please."" Hasan lifted his thumb from the lighter's button to illustrate.After an hour-long exam about search and sort algorithms, Amin wondered how his classmate could muster the energy for poetry.""Ever consider switching your major to literature?"" he asked.""Hah, don't tempt me!"" Hasan laughed. He inhaled once more and released a wisp of smoke, trailing which were the words, ""I'll need to give something up if I want to leave this fucking city.""""And go to America?"" Amin asked.""Sure. Anywhere that'll take me.""Hasan's desire to leave Dhaka couldn't be motivated by money; the rich, he said, were prone to worse tragedies than the poor, citing Shakespearean plays.Amin, who had no intention to abandon his family for adventures abroad, watched Hasan labor for reasons unspoken. Through university, Hasan's lectures became less abstract and more grounded in current events and business. Ramblings about fire were replaced by findings on LinkedIn - about bigger and better ways to outshine one's colleagues.""Why don't you intern?"" Hasan once asked. ""Don't you want to work?""""Well, I'm not sure. I'd just rather focus on what I have going on for the time being and save work for when it comes,"" Amin replied.""Amin, my friend, you need to keep your eye on the game - keep yourself relevant. No one's going to hire a clumsy fresher waiting for the right time to ripen.""Internships were Hasan's obsession in his third year of university. Maps of Bangladesh and Dhaka spanned his dormitory wall, adorned with lists of companies hiring. Signifying trainlines were trails of orange highlighting meandering through the country - a reference for interviews and, should things go well, the daily commute. Such geographical details were perhaps excessive, but they yielded success nevertheless; interviews and daily commutes were plentiful.After graduation, the walls of Hasan's apartment reflected a similar reverence for geography; yet the various maps of Bangladesh and Dhaka were now replaced by those of England, Canada, and the United States.""I hear you'll need a driver's license to live in Silicon Valley,"" Amin said, admiring an intricate road map of California.""America's a weird place. So big, so rich, yet no public transport,"" Hasan said.""Hopefully the food's nice. They say the women are at least,"" Amin said, chuckling at his imagination of blonde, bikini-clad women walking the streets. Of course, for a man arranged to be married by the end of the year, blondes and bikinis were far-fetched fantasies to Amin. Yet, he was sure the charms of California were within reach for Hasan and his free spirit.""I see women are on your mind lately. Not a surprise, though,"" Hasan said.""They're not on yours?"" Amin asked, encroaching on territory undiscussed in their college life.Hasan didn't entertain the topic. Instead, his face was buried in a book about graph algorithms. Accustomed to Hasan's aloofness, Amin imagined his friend's mind lost, as it often was, in thoughts of space-time complexity - a place without love and sex.A place without love and sex - was that not Dhaka to Hasan everyday? When he received the call, Amin realized it had to be so.""It was a mess,"" said Farhad.Farhad had been a former classmate who lived nearby Hasan. Obligation forced him to make the call.""I won't tell you the details - I just can't. Don't turn on the news either. Please,"" he said.""I ju - I just don't understand,"" Amin said, his voice muffled by a relentless urge to sob.""But, you do know, don't you?"" Farhad said. ""Hasan was gay.""Amin didn't know. As he mourned Hasan, he couldn't care to know.""I know he was your friend. But, with all due respect, this is what happens to such people, Amin.""""This hitman,"" Farhad continued, ""on paper he might have been sent by a vengeful wife, but we all know he was sent by God. You were close to him, but please remember that. Keep yourself safe.""Keep yourself safe. As Amin watched the stranger stomp out his cigarette's blaze, those words of warning lingered in the remains. What could possibly endanger me now? Amin wondered. The only fire that could - he was no more.",https://miro.medium.com/max/7776/0*luKdo4QaCw-lwJoF,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-remains-f6549847122d,fiction,a0f67442514d537a5d3f241474441d41de379d2072a44bc7e8cf0296
The big paradox of productivity,"There is a lot of rhetoric around productivity, particularly during the current climate. Whether we lead designers, engineers or product people, we're all likely governed by the same overriding drive to nurture and maintain a ""productive"" workforce. This matra compels those in leadership roles to look beyond short-term hacks and quick fixes, in the search for more radical approaches to increasing our teams' productivity.Generally speaking, who wouldn't want their teams to be more productive? The benefits are fairly obvious. Achieving a higher state of productivity is likely to give organisations a competitive advantage, allowing them to bring ideas to market quicker than their competitors.Being more productive also has the virtue of allowing organisations to be highly responsive to the needs of their customers; making better decisions and getting value in customers' hands on a regular and steady cadence. Closing the metaphorical feedback loop.However, the language associated with a drive for productivity can and often is easily misconstrued as a message of speed. Go faster, do more, increase our output and achieve more with the same. I'd argue, however, that focus, not speed, is the biggest ally in our pursuit of productivity.Being productive isn't about doing more, it's about making our current efforts count - maximising the impact of every endeavour.In the world of product, I believe the pursuit of speed is actually at odds with the sentiment of productivity. An overriding emphasis on speed can actually do more harm than good! Productivity isn't about constantly making compromises. It isn't about reducing the quality of work. Neither is it about measuring velocity, story points, lines of code written, screens prototyped and so on.Productivity is defined as:I'd draw special attention there to the word ""useful"". In a product context, this means creating something that adds real, demonstrable value to the customer and the business. A relentless pursuit of speed has little bearing on whether working faster actually derives any more value. The likelihood, in most cases, is that working faster will actually mean making poorer, ill-informed choices.This is the paradox of productivity.In the absence of focus, the consequence of speed is to increase risk, create waste and incur product debt. We turn every endeavour into a high stakes gamble, rather than do the due diligence of discovery. We end up shortcutting or altogether circumventing those practices that are designed to reduce risk, validate our ideas and reduce our reliance on assumptions, biases and the lure of our own hubris.Where the only and overriding concern is speed, we'll inevitably start to trade off on the rigour and robustness of our decision-making, as well as the quality and likely impact of our outputs.So, if focus is our biggest ally and we need to temper speed to obtain a state of healthy productivity, how do we, as leaders, drive and leverage focus?As leaders, one of our key responsibilities is to provide clarity and focus. This should be apparent both in terms of how we communicate with our teams, as well as our efforts to help them align and orientate around the work that really matters. Cutting through the noise of possibility to focus relentlessly on that which will have a meaningful impact.Our job is to help teams filter their conversations, to triage opportunities and to establish a strong causal link between their day-to-day work and outcomes they are trying to drive. Sometimes this will mean putting on the brakes; momentarily fending off that urge to be busy, to feed the machine and to keep the wheels of productivity turning.In some cases, the best route forward may be to pause, think, evaluate and decide; a sequence that oddly feels counter-productive. However, time allows us to reflect, to reassess our choices, and to make sure we're doing the right things, for the right people, for the right reasons. It allows us to carefully consider our options, establish a trajectory, and define what success looks like.As Mahatma Gandhi famously said:Fortunately, many organisations will have developed the systems and practices necessary to help modern product companies achieve focus; including:A mature and established approach to Product Discovery is critical to providing focus. Faced with a number of opportunities and ideas, discovery practices help product teams to narrow in on the most valuable problems to solve and relevant solutions to build; mitigating the risks of acting on our assumptions. The absence of discovery is not only a very expensive way to learn but overlooks the role of discovery in providing focus; establishing what to build, for whom and to what end.OKRs (or Objectives and Key Results) are a great tool for providing focus and alignment. OKRs allow product teams to explicitly connect their efforts to a wider set of cascading, outcome-focused objectives. These objectives and their associated measures (or key results) should serve as a filter; narrowing in on only those endeavours that can specifically be attributed to a team's current objectives. This allows teams and individuals to actively filter out anything that would otherwise be considered out of scope.Again, whether you are a leader in the design, engineering or product space, Product Thinking unites us in an approach and mindset towards the intentional act of Product Design. Product Thinking seeks to create an explicit connection between the goals and needs of a target market and your product offering; creating the core of a proposition that resonates and addresses customers' Jobs-to-be-Done. Product Thinking drives us to focus on the fundamentals of what's needed to achieve and maintain Product-Market Fit.So, to lead with focus, not only do we need to become comfortable with these tools and approaches, but we need to actively integrate them both as part of our design activities and wider product practices. We need to ensure those we lead can apply these tools to help shape their decisions, inform their product work and move forwards quickly, but most importantly with focus.To avoid the productivity paradox, we need to shift the conversation from one of speed to one of focus; where there is a shared and prevalent belief that focus is the leading indicator of productivity. We need to help reframe conversations around productivity to consider how we reduce waste and increase the impact of our work.Remember, productivity is not about going faster, It's about spending our efforts where it matters most.Cover image by upklay courtesy of www.freepik.com.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10000/1*FIeCiFyPzaMMBSDrlLV8UQ.jpeg,https://uxdesign.cc/the-big-paradox-of-productivity-8cde7ed9ed8a,productivity,a6c3141e36f125fa2ca677d27cfd1e76adaeab7552355133e506eed2
The Most Successful Superbowl Ad Was Never Aired and It Was Genius,"Skittles Case Study: The PlayOpening SceneThe curtains open to the Skittles Boardroom. The marketing team sits around a large table with a giant bowl of Skittles in the middle. There is a whiteboard with lots of ideas scrawled on it, many of which are crossed out.A stressed-out lady, Lisa, is pulling at her hair. She shouts, ""the Superbowl is fast approaching. We need a creative, innovative commercial to cut through the clutter. We need something different!""Gary, the intern, nods his head, ""it's like the Superbowl of advertising,"" he says with a huge smile. The room is silent.Brittany, the new head of creative, stands. ""I've got a crazy idea... so crazy that it just may work. Close your eyes and picture this...""Advertising during the Superbowl is a costly exercise. The rate for a 30-second spot this year is approximately $5.5 million. That's a lot to invest for such a short spot, and of course, it doesn't include the cost of producing the commercial. Several companies have been looking at inventive ways around this, but none compare to what Skittles did in 2019.Mars, the parent company of Skittles, and their advertising agency DDB Worldwide decided to ambush the USA's biggest sporting event. Instead of advertising during the game, they decided to run their commercial as a Broadway musical on the same day, leading up to the Superbowl.It would be a 30-minute live commercial viewed by theatergoers and never air on TV or online. The idea sounded crazy - so crazy it just might work.To make this a success, DDB needed to do it right. The first step was obtaining the help of a Broadway expert, Patrick Milling-Smith, winner of eight Tony Awards for production. The advertising team behind the campaign then attended almost every show running on Broadway and read hundreds of plays.They enlisted playwright and Pulitzer finalist Will Enol to write the musical. It needed to be of high quality to make the campaign a success. Finally, they employed a 17-member cast with Michael C. Hall of Dexter fame in the lead role.As word spread of the audacious project, Skittles the Musical started generating a buzz. Billboards appeared in Times Square advertising the musical, and tickets went online for sale. Priced similarly to a real Broadway show - up to $200 a ticket - it sold out in 72 hours (all proceeds went to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS and were matched by Skittles.) At a minute-per-minute cost, it was actually more expensive than the cost of top-tier seats for Hamilton.A week before the musical, a behind-the-scenes recording of the show's main musical number, 'Advertising Ruins Everything,' was released.(Warning: this song is a guaranteed earworm)It was soon followed by a cast recording of the full song list on Spotify. This was following all the marketing promotion of a regular musical.But it was a commercial.The advertising team behind the stunt wanted the theatrical experience to be as realistic as possible. They had vendors outside the theater selling 'unauthorized' knockoff Skittles Commercial: The Broadway Musical T-shirts at half the price of the 'official' T-shirts sold inside.Audience members were invited on stage before the show to visit the bodega, which was the production setting. They were allowed to peruse the shelves and attempt to make a purchase. There were standard household items, pet food, snacks, and lots of candy stocked on the shelves. The only thing anyone could actually buy - Skittles.It truly was an immersive experience.But it was a commercial.That was one of the musical's opening lines in what the New York Times described as ""metatheatrical to the max.""From the outset, the musical did not attempt to hide the fact that it was a marketing stunt aimed at promoting Skittles. They trolled the world of advertising and marketing, and the script was littered with self-deprecating humor.The plot centers upon Hall's anxiety upon the realization that participating in a musical advertisement could negatively impact his career. Throughout, he questions his decision to accept the role. His first song is This Might Have Been a Bad Idea. The main song, Advertising Ruins Everything (still in your head, isn't it?), features lyrics such as, ""it ruins the web, and it ruins TV, and it fills our inboxes with spam/And there's nothing we hate more than each time you pay for a targeted ad on Instagram.""While making fun of the whole experience, the musical was an entertaining production, and people started sharing their experience on social media with the hashtags #SkittlesTheMusical and #AdvertisingRuinsEverything.Who would have ever thought that the New York Times would write about an advertising campaign in the Arts section? Yet the show got glowing reviews from theatre critics in The New York Times and The Washington Post. Many media outlets praised both the production and the advertising campaign. In all, the campaign was covered in more than 1,000 publications and news broadcasts.The musical got far more media coverage than a 'regular' Superbowl ad. It received more than 2.5 billion earned impressions - 25 times the viewership of the big game.Each year the best of Broadway compete for the ultimate prize in theatre - the Tony award. While Skittles sadly didn't win any Tonys, it did win the following:Cannes Lions 2019M&M Global Awards 2019Adweek Media Plan of the Year 2019AdClub Brave Brands Honoree 2019Skittles took a huge risk with this campaign. If it wasn't executed perfectly it could have been a mistake.The time and research they took to ensure they could produce a Broadway standard production paid off. You need commitment to an idea when it is as audacious as this one - attempting to disrupt the Superbowl, the biggest day in advertising.I can't recall any Superbowl ads from 2019, and I'm willing to bet you can't either. But Skittles the Musical will live on in marketing history.Let's hope more brands take risks like this.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1752/1*HQ1vTWIRSb21dG2jHLf2FA.png,https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-most-successful-superbowl-ad-was-never-aired-and-it-was-genius-b91c606e51ef,marketing,a24aab30a0c1174ef5e1c48b7863b4f661ea1e68bb70a37cdb148709
Tools for action,"The rise of Roam Research, the note-taking tool for networked thought, has given a home to researchers, power users, developers, students, creatives, and those interested in personal knowledge management. The strength of the community and the amount of time that users spend sharing and building custom layouts shows how interested a growing number of people are in better collecting and digesting their thoughts and actions digitally.What if users were given a tool to organize their thoughts and actions with the same amount of detail as a tool for thought that lets them organize their notes?For those who might not be familiar, here's how Roam works in a nutshell: Roam is a note-taking app that helps users organize and contextualize knowledge. Users create bidirectional links for each named entity (""real world"" objects, such as places, people, ideas, or events) in their notes, so they can see every reference to a named entity, as well as the context within which it was referenced. Roam features a toolkit of advanced commands to manipulate text the same way a statistician would master functions in Microsoft Excel. For example, a user can filter specific references to a named entity, embed code blocks and images into notes, embed references to text snippets between different notes, and even learn notes using spaced repetition.Users who become fully invested in organizing their knowledge and spend lots of time working with loads of data tend to get the most out of Roam. In particular, the Zettlekasten note-taking method has been popularized by #roamcult, which emphasizes constant note-taking to enlarge the number of connections between concepts and help one build knowledge. This system requires a lot of hands-on work but has helped many, especially knowledge workers, organize their work. It has also emphasized writing as an important part of the creative process for any discipline, especially product design, one that is so subjective.While a tool for thought (namely Roam) helps produce a rich graph of contextualized notes and, if properly followed, can help users produce better ideas/learn more, notes generally aren't the only part of a user's workflow, even if the user is a knowledge worker, simply because of how many steps and applications typical workflows require. Even if a knowledge worker's only other app interaction is searching Google, a database, or a website, a knowledge worker still makes multiple decisions and inquiries that lead them to either augment the search query, read a particular website/data entry/article, or click a link. This non-linear search process called berrypicking is one that most people follow as they search the web, but is one that is highly utilized by knowledge workers, who surface multiple sources, search results, and webpages to collect the context necessary to augment the search query, find the right results, or come to certain conclusions/form certain hypotheses.On top of this, Roam's interface doesn't allow users to seamlessly contextualize their graph and make it portable across apps and devices. Roam isn't built to connect linked references in other apps, export parts of the graph to other apps in engaging formats, or explore how logic expands overtime or the domain of a subject. A knowledge worker(or other power users) could be much more productive and make better use of contextualized information if they had a language to organize the rest of their workflow with the same degree of specificity and the same access to context as in Roam. Other professions have advanced tools that they use to thoroughly examine the information and quickly make use of it, so why can't knowledge workers?Here are a few examples of tools that can be crafted for creatives to help them experience the quantum leaps in their productivity, creativity, and cognition as they work, the same way Roam has for knowledge workers:Other creative disciplines have advanced software they can use. Knowledge workers can use Roam, a software engineer can use an IDE, a video editor can use advanced editing software, a music producer can use a DAW, the list goes on and on. All of these tools have steep learning curves but offer rich languages for building creative material and, over time, creatives experience exponential increases in their productivity, just as one sees exponential increases in memory as they expand their Roam graph and their usage of the spaced repetition system. Interface designers, however, are stuck to vector-based software programs, such as Figma, Sketch, and Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop/XD.While these programs are easy to use and allow designers to streamline certain parts of their workflow, motion design features are limited, as are design system features, which seem too primitive and assume that a feature has to be implemented a certain way regardless of the context, which doesn't offer much room for exploration. Some tools, such as Framer and Facebook Origami, attempt to create languages to prototype interactions or further customize interface designs, but overall, designers are stuck using primitive vector-based systems that enforce a very ""static"" style of design and make it harder to use design software as a legitimate tool in a project or its tech stack, or just help the designer best express themself.We have now had the tools to input and find knowledge, but aren't equipped with languages we can use to better explore information and track not only how information evolves and is logically related, but also how knowledge accretes as we digest information across multiple contexts. In the same way that programmers learn new languages and have plugins in their code editors that automate certain tasks and contextualize functions, we need a more interactive and rich medium to explore and visualize online information. What if each website had a GraphQL style playground to explore how key topics are connected and what they mean?In a world where knowledge is power, we need to be able to make sense of the information at multiple levels, from our perspective to the one's around us to those we don't even agree with. If information is public and verified by logic instead of rhetoric, then languages for data exploration(and eventually publishing) can also become barometers for societal truth. And once we become better at finding and making sense of information, these tools can even help us remember what we've explored(similar to Andy Matuschak's mnemonic medium), track our progress, and track how what we've learned ties to other disciplines. What if a language for data exploration was able to, say, tell you which concepts you were one step away from mastering? What if it was also able to help you visualize relationships between concepts, view events as timelines of multimedia content, or even ""choose your own adventure"" through content?Tools for thought and action, namely note-taking tools and browsers, haven't yet been built with full multiplayer features, despite collaboration being key to digital gardening, programming, design, academia, and other disciplines. Are there ways to implement multiplayer into specific tools to enable powerful sync/async work? Many collaborative workspace tools attempt to create a structure for an entire project/organization, and then allow users to edit documents at the same time - ""Google Docs style"". I'd like to see this model reimagined to better fit specific use cases. One product that does this that I love is MakeSpace, a spatial video app for collaborative browsing, note-taking, and multimedia sharing.If 2020 has shown us anything, it's that we need to rethink how tech enables us to work and think together. Making sense of information on our own is only one piece of the puzzle. Tools for thought and action are more powerful when we use them with others.While I can't say that the perfect tool for action exists, I hope that I can be a part of the solution. I have spent the past 2.5 years doing extensive research and development to determine the novel interactions and technologies that will allow users to contextualize information and work across a suite of apps, tools, and interface hierarchies. To begin turning my hypotheses into a tool for action, I am launching a series of tools built on graphs, which will then turn into a larger tool for action.To find out when my tools for action launch, follow me on Twitter @Dylan_Steck",https://miro.medium.com/max/3328/1*_26-jNal0zzBRQ6nn-C1eg.png,https://uxdesign.cc/tools-for-action-6475cf3343f1,productivity,a55acab575b5bc1cfe85d777afad48b14c1d9cddadfba93efee3a1b9
The Mystery of the Missing Medical Student,"Brian Shaffer walked into a bar and was never seen again. Nearly 15 years later, his disappearance remains one of Ohio's biggest mysteries.March 31, 2006 was a Friday, and the first night of spring break for the Ohio State University community. All the bars and restaurants near campus were packed. Brian Shaffer, a 27-year-old medical student, was one of the many students who headed out to celebrate the end of the quarter. He and his friend, Clint Florence, began their night at the Ugly Tuna Saloona, in the South Campus Gateway complex. Known for terrible service but decent entertainment and alcohol, it attracted many OSU students due to its convenient location. Many nights, students would be packed shoulder-to-shoulder throughout the room, taking advantage of cheap drink specials and live music.Brian had an apartment on King Avenue, about a half mile southwest of the South Campus Gateway. It was only a 10-minute walk, so he left his car at home that Friday night and met up with his friend Clint around 9:15pm at the Ugly Tuna Saloona. They stayed there for about two hours, then walked to the North Shore Tavern and had a couple drinks there. Around 11:40pm, they walked to Brothers Bar and Grill, where they ran into Clint's friend Meredith Reed. After a couple shots, they decided to end the night in the same place they started it, at the Ugly Tuna. The trio was caught on surveillance camera walking across the courtyard and headed for the Ugly Tuna. At 1:15am they can be seen on the escalator heading up to the bar.At 1:55am, Brian is seen on surveillance stepping out of the bar and talking to two women Clint was acquainted with, Amber Ruic and Brighton Zatko. They can be seen having a short conversation near the top of the escalator, then Brian headed back toward the bar and the women left.Last call at the Ugly Tuna was at 2:00am, but the bar was open until 2:30am to give patrons time to finish up their drinks before leaving. Clint and Meredith finished their drinks and got ready to leave, but were unable to find Brian. They stood around for a few minutes, watching as the crowded bar emptied out, there was still no sign of him. The bar only had one room, and Brian definitely wasn't in it. The only other place he could be was the bathroom, but Clint checked it and he wasn't there, either. Figuring he had somehow slipped past them and was waiting outside, they headed out of the bar. The two of them can be seen on surveillance footage at 2:09am, riding the escalator down to the street level while trying to call Brian on his cell phone. All calls went straight to voicemail. After a few tries, Meredith left a short message, asking ""Where the hell are you?"" It was a question many more people would ask in the coming days, because Brian was never seen again.Alexis Waggoner, Brian's girlfriend, was the first person to suspect something was wrong. Like Brian, she was a second-year medical student at OSU, but she hadn't gone out to celebrate the end of the quarter like he did. Instead, she left right after classes ended to make the drive to her hometown of Toledo. Elly, her beloved family dog, wasn't doing well and she wanted to be able to say goodbye to her. She planned to return to Columbus on Sunday, and she and Brian were scheduled to fly to Miami on Monday. Brian had bought the tickets months ago, and they were looking forward to spending some time in the Florida sun. Brian had hinted to friends and family that he was going to be proposing to Alexis in Miami, and he was quite excited about it. Alexis tried to call Brian early Saturday afternoon to update him on Elly, but her call went straight to voicemail. She wasn't particularly concerned at first; she knew he had been out drinking the night before and figured he was simply sleeping off the late night. When she couldn't reach him that evening, she began to worry. By midnight, she was starting to panic.Randy Shaffer last saw his son early Friday evening, when the two of them met for dinner at an Outback Steakhouse in Reynoldsburg, about 20 minutes away from campus. Brian told his dad that he was excited about going out with some friends that night to celebrate the fact that exams were over. Randy noticed that Brian looked exhausted after several all-night study sessions that week, and didn't think going out drinking was a good idea. He kept his opinion to himself, though; Brian - and the rest of his family - hadn't had many reasons to celebrate lately. Just 25 days earlier, Brian's mom had lost her battle with a rare form of bone cancer.Alexis called Randy on Sunday with the news that none of Brian's friends had seen him since Friday night. When Randy told her that Brian had not shown up for his planned visit on Saturday, Alexis knew there was definitely something wrong. She was still in Toledo, but decided to head back to Columbus immediately. The two-and-a-half-hour drive between her home and campus seemed to take much longer than it had when she made it on Friday.The apartment Alexis shared with her younger brother was close to Brian's; all she had to do was look out her back door and she could see his. Once back in Columbus, she bypassed her apartment and went straight to Brian's. Unlocking the door, she did a quick walkthrough and confirmed that he wasn't there. The apartment looked neat and orderly like it usually did, and nothing appeared to be missing. His cell phone charger was still plugged into the wall, and his eyeglasses were in the spot on the bookshelf where he normally kept them. The fact that these items were in the apartment made Alexis worry even more. If Brian had planned on going somewhere for any length of time, he would have taken them with him. Wherever he was, he hadn't driven himself, as his Honda Accord was still parked in its usual spot. Unsure of what she should do, Alexis planted herself on the couch and stared at the door, praying for Brian to come through it. The door did open eventually, but it wasn't Brian. It was his brother, Derek, who had gotten a call from his father asking him to check on his brother.Derek last spoke to Brian early Friday evening. Brian had called to see if Derek wanted to meet up with him that night for a few drinks, but Derek already had plans. He was taking his girlfriend to a show at a Columbus comedy club, but told Brian he might be able to meet up with him when it was over. By the time the show had finished, though, both Derek and his girlfriend were tired and just wanted to go home. Now he wondered if he was going to regret his decision to not catch up with him Friday night.Randy's next-door neighbor was a police detective, and she warned Randy that police likely weren't going to do anything until Brian had been out of contact for at least 48 hours, so Randy was somewhat prepared for the lackadaisical response when he reported Brian missing. However, he certainly wasn't going to sit around and wait for police to do something; Randy, Derek, Alexis, and Randy's neighbor began their own search early Sunday evening. After talking to Clint, they knew that Brian's last confirmed location was the Ugly Tuna Saloona, so they decided to start there. They looked through the bar and some of the other businesses in the area, checked in dumpsters, and spoke to people on the street. They called all the hospitals in the area and even checked with the county jail. Hours later, they still had no idea where Brian was, but they were pretty sure he wasn't in the immediate area. Deflated, the group gave up the search for the night.No one slept well that night. There was a sense of anticipation as Brian's family and friends waited to see if he would show up in time to catch the plane to Miami. When he didn't, everyone knew the situation was dire. Brian had been so excited about the trip, there was no way he would voluntarily miss it. Randy, Derek, and Alexis had missing person flyers printed and began plastering the OSU campus with them.Detectives didn't have much to go on. There was no activity on Brian's credit cards or cell phone, and his car and other personal belongings were untouched. But the fact that he had gone missing in Columbus meant detectives had one thing going for them: numerous surveillance cameras. It was impossible to go far in the city without being captured by at least one of them. They obtained the video from the cameras at the Ugly Tuna first. While there were no cameras inside the bar, there were two right outside at the top of the escalator. At the very least, they would be able to see if Brian was alone or with someone when he left the bar.As they watched the video, investigators were able to confirm much of what Clint and Meredith told them. They saw all three of them leave the parking garage, cross the courtyard, and take the escalator up to the bar at 1:15am. At 1:55am, they saw Brian walk out of the bar and have a short conversation with two women that were standing right outside the doors, then he turned around and went back into the bar alone. Then, at 2:09am, Meredith and Clint could be seen leaving the bar and getting on the escalator. Eventually, the entire bar emptied out and the lights went off, but Brian never appeared. Figuring they must have missed him, the investigators replayed the video starting from the point where Brian went back into the bar at 1:55am. They slowed the video down and scrutinized each person who came out. Once again, they saw no sign of Brian.Before they went over the surveillance tape, there wasn't anything that set his case apart from any of the other missing adult cases across the country. The fact that he seemingly went into a bar and never came out launched the case into national news. It's been a mainstay on unsolved mystery websites for years, and everyone seems to have a different opinion on what happened that night. Rumors started to fly almost immediately after Brian disappeared, and investigators had the unenviable task or sorting fact from fiction.Before the end of the day on Monday, there was $5000 in reward money available for information on Brian's whereabouts. Ohio Crimestoppers was offering $2000 and his medical school put up $3000. The reward fund would continue to grow each day, and by the end of the week it would be up to $13,000.On Tuesday, police went door-to-door in the neighborhoods surrounding the South Campus Gateway. Armed with pictures of Brian and information about the reward being offered, they asked for people to contact them if they saw anything at all unusual the night Brian went missing. Search dogs were brought in to scour the Ugly Tuna and the area around it, including the construction site. They found nothing of interest. Investigators started to wonder if they couldn't find Brian because he had taken off and didn't want to be found. Randy refused to consider it a possibility.Four days after Brian went missing, a potential sighting of him raised the hopes of investigators and his family. Someone called to report seeing a man they believed to be Brian in an alley behind a Columbus convenience store, where he had apparently bought a sandwich. The person who saw him was so convinced it was the missing man that he called out to him and told him that everyone was looking for him. The man had no reaction and didn't even look up from his sandwich. Detectives immediately got the footage from the store's security cameras, but once they watched it they concluded that although the man on film looked like Brian, it wasn't him.Two weeks after the disappearance, the reward for information had grown to $25,500. Randy had buttons made with Brian's picture and a phone number to call with any information. He figured they would be more durable than missing person flyers, though he was still posting those as well.Three weeks after Brian went missing, a group of volunteers began searching the area surrounding parts of the Olentangy River. Brian would not have had any reason to be near the river the night he vanished - it was about 0.6 miles from his apartment in the opposite direction of the Ugly Tuna - but they feared someone might have harmed him and then dumped his body there. A group of two dozen people combed through both the brush around the river and the bike path alongside it, but failed to find anything related to Brian.Alexis felt like she was living in limbo, spending all her free time searching for her missing boyfriend while trying to come to terms with the fact that he might never return. She still called his cellphone on a daily basis; she knew he wasn't going to answer, but the familiar sound of his voice on his recorded greeting was comforting. She would sit and look out at Brian's apartment across the alley, praying that he would miraculously reappear as suddenly as he had vanished.Months went by with no movement on the case. Randy refused to give up the search for his son, and spent hundreds of hours searching areas where a body might be hidden. When a psychic told him that Brian was submerged in water near a concrete bridge post, he went out and bought a pair of fishing waders and spent weeks at the river, checking methodically by each bridge post he found. He would place late-night calls to Det. Hurst, sometimes looking for answers, other times because he felt the need to reach out to someone. The detective always answered his calls and was in awe of his strength.Although police continued to investigate, by September it was pretty clear that Brian's case had gone cold. Most of his friends and family members started trying to rebuild their lives without him, but his father remained consumed by his disappearance. He spent every free second looking for Brian. He continued to hand out buttons with Brian's picture, flyers, and posters. He listened to psychics and followed up on what they told him, no matter how far-fetched it seemed. With no solid leads to go on, he was willing to consider anything. He lobbied for changes in how missing adult cases were handled by police departments, and he attended rallies and searches for other missing persons in the area. He would make frequent calls to Detective Hurst, determined to keep the investigation moving forward. As months turned to years, Randy sometimes felt like he was alone in his fight to find his son, but his determination never wavered.By September 2008, Brian had been missing for two-and-a-half-years, and it seemed like many people had forgotten about the handsome medical student. The campus, once plastered in missing person posters, had moved on; with each new class of students, the tragedy moved further into the past. Randy, however, was still just as committed. He had helped bring about change in how missing adult cases were investigated, but still had no idea what happened to his son. On September 14th, central Ohio was under a severe storm warning, as strong windstorms blasted through the region. Preparing for the inevitable power outage and resulting damage, Randy headed out to his shed for some tools around 6:00pm. He never made it back to the house; he was still in his backyard when the wind caused a neighbor's tree to come crashing down. Randy was hit directly in the head, and died instantly. His neighbors found him early the next morning after he failed to show up for work.Randy's obituary and funeral service information were posted online by the funeral home, and friends and family were able to leave comments in an online guestbook. A few days after Randy died, someone posted a short message: ""Dad, I love you, Brian."" Their location was listed as the U.S. Virgin Islands. It immediately caught the attention of everyone who visited the website. Police were suspicious, but contacted authorities in the Virgin Islands and asked them to look into the claim while they waited to get information about where the post had actually originated. A few days later, they announced that the posting had been nothing more than a cruel hoax, posted from a public computer in a Franklin County, Ohio library.Brian's case is still considered an open and active investigation, and police still get occasional tips about it, but there has been little movement on the case in years. The fact that Brian is not on video leaving the bar is the primary reason why the case has remained in the national news for so long. Despite being profiled on several television shows and analyzed on dozens of true crime websites, the mystery of what happened to Brian that night remains unsolved.Brian Shaffer has been missing since April 1, 2006. At the time of his disappearance, he was 27 years old, 6'2"", and weighed around 170 pounds, with brown hair and hazel eyes. He has a black fleck in his left iris, and a tattoo of the stick figure from Pearl Jam's Alive cover on his right shoulder. He normally wore wire-framed eyeglasses, but did not have them with him when he disappeared. When he was last seen, he was wearing jeans, a long-sleeved white shirt, a green striped polo, and white Adidas sneakers.

Legs,"When the jury foreman stiffly pronounced him guilty, the 33-year-old defendant went to his knees, grimacing as he shifted his weight from one knee to the other to lessen the pangs from the marble court floor.The judge frowned. ""Stay standing!"" Then, ""The defendant shall remain standing.""The convict shut his eyes, dropped his chin to his chest, and stayed on his knees. A court counselor bent down and spoke softly at the convicted man's ear.The convict didn't budge.Was he pleading for clemency?""Stand up like a man!"" someone shouted from the gallery.""Order!"" said the judge, furrowing his brows. ""No outbursts."" He had raised his gavel and now put it back to its place. He nodded to the bailiffs.Two large court bailiffs stood on either side of the convict. They cuffed his hands in front of him. The convict clasped his hands tightly. Each bailiff took an arm and lifted the man off his knees by those two handles. They struggled to carry him. Like that, he was delivered to a police van, driven to a prison, and carried to an empty cell.Prison officials and inmates stood and gawked at the oddity. It was entertainment to witness the unusual comportment of the new inmate, where prisoners and staff alike follow proscribed routines. Was the new inmate cowardly or brave? The bystanders tossed those concepts around in their heads. Was he on his knees to pray for forgiveness? Was the odd display to show he was turning a new leaf? Was the man born with intractable knees?An hour later, the warden approached the new inmate's cell. The convict was kneeling, facing his cot, elbows resting on a thin mattress. He ignored questions. He continued to kneel.A prison chaplain was hopeful but couldn't get The Kneeler to talk. A prison counselor was summoned. Was The Kneeler suicidal? Two guards removed razors and eating utensils from the inmate's cell. The prison consulted a psychiatrist. The convict was not suicidal. The kneeling behavior was self-inflicted bodily harm. Not religiosity. It was for this prisoner a sort of hunger strike, the psychiatrist concluded. Guards returned the inmate's razor and eating utensils.When a meal was delivered from a noisy pushcart, the convict waddled slowly on his knees to take a tray through an opening in the door. Baked pasta with beans, warm on the surface, cold in the center. Salad with red dressing. Half cup of milk. A bread roll. The convict twinged as he shuffled back to his cot. One knee ahead of the other, hands gripping the food tray. At his cot, he sat on his heels and placed his tray on the mattress. He consumed his meal, moved the tray to the floor, knelt up straight again, bent over his cot, and rested his elbows on the thin mattress.In the days that followed, the self-possessed convict ordered books from the prison library and opened the books on his cot. He rested his elbows on the thin mattress of his cot and occasionally put his weight on his elbows to relieve his knees.Before the first week was up, holes opened at the knees of his prison uniform. Swollen red knees peeked through the knee holes. A prison medic closed the holes with iron-on patches and bandaged the convict's knees. The Kneeler moved his mattress to the floor and knelt on it for more protection. That didn't last long. The mattress provided very minimal relief, and moving it back and forth from the cot to the floor to the cot irritated his knees.A week into his sentence, shower time. The convict made his way to the shower room, leaning deeply to the left and then to the right on his slow and painful way down the prison corridor. Entering the shower room naked and on his knees and he started a mini-riot. Bars of soap flew past him.""Hey, man. Get outta here.""""You ain't come'n' in here while we here.""""Get your own shower room.""""Come in here when you and me is alone, man. Ha-ha-ha.""Two weeks on, the inmate had shredded the knees of his prison uniform again. Kneeling at his cot, he shifted to the left and to the right on his knees to relieve the ache. His knees were red, and a discharge was collecting on one of them. At night, sleep was fitful. Nobody imagined he would take his odd behavior this far. A guard brought The Kneeler a pair of kneepads from the prison gardening shed, as well as a cellmate for The Kneeler. The cellmate was incredulous at first. Then he laughed at The Kneeler like he was a joke.The next day, the cellmate refused his meals and demanded to be moved, and he took The Kneeler's kneepads with him. He was reassigned a cell with an ordinary, surly inmate whom he told what he said he had learned about The Kneeler, and stories got around in the prison yard. The Kneeler had shot a cop with the cop's gun. No, he'd tried to get a cop's gun. No, he'd gone to his place of employment and shot his boss. The truth was The Kneeler had been disrespected by a cop, and he punched him out for it - not killed him. But he'd had his hands around the cop's neck when he was pulled off of him.The Kneeler had testified in court that the cop had abused him. Abused him verbally. The cop had called to him when The Kneeler emerged from a convenience store. The cop shouted from the window of a patrol car.""Hey, come over here,"" the cop said and put his hand outside the patrol car window palm up, curled his fingers, and motioned to The Kneeler with his forefinger. ""Come here!""The Kneeler approached the car slowly and cautiously.""Let's go! What's the matter? Your legs don't work?""""You got a problem with that?""In court, The Kneeler served as his own defense - after his negative experience with lawyers at two previous court appearances. ""Verbal abuse"" was his defense. That's what his wife had pleaded to get out of her marriage. Verbal abuse should be a defense for aggravated assault as well. That's what The Kneeler believed.Late at night a month into his sentence, the inmate directly across the corridor from The Kneeler swore he'd witnessed The Kneeler levitating. That spooked him out. The next day he reported the event and was taken to the warden's office to be interviewed and allowed to view a blurry and heavily pixilated closed-circuit videotape.""You see he's standing,"" the warden told him. ""Not levitating.""The inmate refused to believe it. ""He doesn't stand. He can't stand.""A guard returned him to his cell, and the inmate spread the word. The Kneeler had levitated. The Kneeler had become thin and pale, and that gave credence to the levitation rumor. Inmates slowed when they walked past his cell to get a better look at him, kneeling at his cot with a book between his elbows, bare knees on the concrete floor.The Kneeler had avoided the exercise yard, but some time into his confinement, he agreed to participate in wheelchair basketball with two other disabled inmates, who nicknamed him ""Legs."" The Kneeler's two paraplegic wheelchair-mates were empathetic.""Hey, Legs, you ain't gonna ever be able to walk again. Why you doin' this to yourself, man?""""Legs"" liked the convenience of the wheelchair, and one was folded up in his cell, but he did not replace kneeling with sitting. Over time, he could no longer straighten his legs, and his leg muscles began to atrophy. The prison warden and the inmate's mother and sister encouraged him to immediately change his crazy behavior. The Kneeler could no longer stand - even with the aid of a walker - if he wanted to.At a prison health exam, a physician recommended that The Kneeler have his knees and legs examined by a specialist. An orthopedic surgeon would know if The Kneeler could revert to a healthy condition and the real use of his legs. The prison warden suggested The Kneeler have his head examined, too.The Kneeler resisted. The prison physician told him what the alternative was. He'd never walk again. That was not persuasive. The warden made the exam compulsory.""Get the exam or lose library privileges.""""This is who I am,"" the inmate argued. ""Why don't people accept me for who I am?""He appealed to a human rights organization, which advised him to submit to the exam. Finally, he relented.The Kneeler rode in a prison van to a nearby hospital. In a brightly lit exam room, a nurse prepped the inmate's knees for an orthopedic surgeon. The doctor entered the room and stood and looked down at the inmate's knees, and glanced at the X-rays. Without touching the inmate or his legs, the doctor faced him and stared at his face for several moments.""I don't have good news for you. Sooner or later, I will have to amputate your legs above your knees.""On the return to the prison, the van driver passed by neighborhood scenes familiar to The Kneeler. People on sitting on ride mowers. Children disembarking from school busses. Elderly walking dogs. Things like that.The doctor's report came back to the prison quickly, and the warden urged the inmate's mother to visit her son and discuss the surgeon's report with him and the warden. After a long drive across three states, The Kneeler's mother and sister arrived at the prison for only their second visit since The Kneeler had been incarcerated four months before.The Kneeler's mother and sister waited in the prison infirmary. The Kneeler was delivered to the room in a wheelchair, and not too happy about that. The infirmary physician followed him.The Kneeler had changed, his mother said. She barely recognized her son. He had become gaunt, and his face seemed frozen in a grimacing expression. She leaned toward him and tried to get through to him. The prison had put him on drugs, she insisted.""It's not too late to change your life,"" she told her son.""It is,"" The Kneeler replied.""No, it's not too late. It will be your next challenge. You have always liked challenges. Bring yourself back. Back to good health.""""I've got disciples here. I cannot ignore their views.""""Disciples?""""Young guys who look up to me for what I am doing.""The Kneeler's sister looked on. ""Look up to you?""""I just know. They look up to me in a certain way - for certain reasons.""The Kneeler's mother pleaded with him.""I'm sure other inmates are looking forward to getting out of here. You'll never get out of here. Even if they opened the gates for you today, your legs will keep you incarcerated,"" The Kneeler's mother said.The infrequent visit from The Kneeler's family did not resolve anything.""This is going to be your legacy,"" his mother told her son. With that, she turned and left the prison infirmary with her daughter. On the way to the prison visitor's exit, the two said nothing. When they got into the car, the inmate's mother turned to her daughter in the driver's seat and said it again. ""This is going to be his legacy.""For more nonconformist stories, read nonconformist-mag.com",https://miro.medium.com/max/2200/1*Eu2ouUAUX69y6fROSL42LA.jpeg,https://medium.com/the-nonconformist/legs-860571da70bf,fiction,ac9f264584d16d5fa848971553923e366aa95bfdf7bcaaa858b946af
Affiliate Marketing: Creating a Salesforce or Side Income,"Marketing can be a costly investment for businesses. Significant investments into advertising can be an elevated risk if you do not know the return.Wouldn't it be great if someone else better at marketing took up that risk and funded the marketing?You could pay them a small commission fee for each sale.You can also earn money selling other businesses' products, without the risk of needing to invest in a business and creating products yourself.This process is called affiliate marketing.This article explores affiliate marketing, how it works, and the benefits it provides.Affiliate marketing is an endorsement-based advertising strategy that earns promoters (affiliates) money when internet users act on that marketing.Based on a revenue-sharing model, vendors (merchant) offer a financial incentive such as a commission, through an affiliate program. Affiliates earn a piece of the profit for each sale by creating marketing content to try redirect customers through a customer URL to the merchant's product.Affiliates can make money promoting products and services and earn an income, without actually having any of their own.For the merchant, affiliates invest their own time and money into marketing your products or services, expanding their reach to their target audience.According to Mediakix, affiliate marketing spending increases every year in the USA, with around a 10% yearly increase in affiliate marketing spending.Affiliate marketing involves four different parties:From a marketing point of view, there are two components: the merchant who has produced the product or service for sale and the affiliate marketer who promotes it.With a traditional business model, the seller bears the risk that profit exceeds the overall marketing costs. However, an affiliate takes on the promotion efforts and then earns a piece of the profit from each sale they make. Usually, via a predefined commission, sales are tracked via personalised affiliate links.For the affiliate, they need to be good at marketing. It works similarly to somebody employed in sales on commission, such as real estate agents, to incentivise their performance.It is a massive benefit to the merchant to have a purely commissioned sales force and predictable marketing costs.On the other hand, affiliates can create a revenue stream without investing in inventory or infrastructure.The merchant is also known as the seller, vendor, or retailer. They are the party who created the product to market - it could be a physical object or a service. They could be a sole trader or a large corporation.After creating a product or service, the firm does not have to be actively involved in marketing. They have others do the promotion, in exchange for a commission on sales.Also known as the content creator or the publisher, the affiliates try to create appealing marketing to attract customers to the merchant's website. They create content for the products to share on social media, blogs, and websites.Affiliates often already have an audience or following on social media, so they choose products in their niche that meet their audience's needs. For example, If I had built an audience posting content about fitness and health, I would not become an affiliate marketer for a candy company.Often, affiliate marketing networks manage merchant/affiliate relationships. There are two fundamental relationships: the first is with the affiliate, and the second is with the merchant. The network works as an intermediary between the merchant and the affiliate.Affiliate marketing networks such as Linkshare, Commission Junction, and Clickbank facilitate tracking sales transactions, payments, and product delivery. Their technology tracks all the activities and manages the commissions and the issuance of payments to affiliates.These networks serve as a database for affiliates to choose products or services to promote.Networks make participation easy for both the merchant and the affiliate by managing the application process.Amazon also has an affiliate network (Amazon Associates Affiliates Program) to promote consumer products, such as books and toys, sold on their platform.The consumer (or customer) needs to purchase for this relationship to work. If they do not purchase, there is no revenue, and affiliates do not receive a commission if consumers don't buy the product - the seller and the affiliate share in the profits.Affiliate marketing is beneficial to both the merchant and the affiliate. The relationship spreads the responsibilities of marketing, leveraging various individuals' abilities for a more effective marketing strategy.For the affiliate, it is an inexpensive method of making money with little overheads. It allows digital marketers to make money as free agents for a variety of merchants. The affiliate gets a share of the profit and the merchant benefits from predictable marketing costs as a percentage of sales.Affiliates receive a commission payment from the merchant, depending on predefined consumer actions. These include pay per click - redirect of a consumer, such as a click-out to their online shop for a lead; or they might pay per sale if a transaction takes place.The retail price includes the affiliate's share of the profit, so there is no extra fee placed on the customer for sale through affiliates. Affiliate marketing company or networks create customised affiliate URLs for each affiliate, to track their sales.Assume you already have a product or service to sell and there is a market for it. Merchants find affiliates, often through an affiliate network, to promote their product or service.The difficult part for the merchant is finding an affiliate who already has an engaged audience that matches their target market.The commission amount positively affects the number of leads. The affiliate will work harder on their marketing. For digital products, commission rates can be 50% or even higher because they are easily replicable.Affiliate marketers find a product or numerous products that they think are worth promoting.Websites such as Gumroad help affiliates find merchants to partner with and allow them to collect commissions.If an affiliate marketer starts without having a following, they could begin by reviewing products on a YouTube channel or blogging with product reviews and comparisons in their chosen niche. Part of this strategy involves trying to build your contact list by incentivising people to join your mailing list. When an affiliate has an income, using pay per click advertising will help scale up faster growth.Merchants should provide their affiliates with various advertising media to suit different applications and keep fresh in the marketplace and improve the affiliates' results.There are several marketing tools that an affiliate marketer can use. Firstly, targeted marketing should reach the people most likely to be a customer. If you are selling a B2B service, for example, do not use TikTok. Use the methods most likely to reach them. It could be through social media, blogging, email marketing, or paid advertising.If you have chosen a product in a niche where you already have an extensive email database or a large social media following, those are the most logical places to start.It could be a banner on a blog article on your website you wrote to compare products in that category that sends potential buyers to the merchant's website.You might develop a whole website dedicated to the merchant's products.You could use search engine optimisation through having sufficiently exciting content to get an adequate number of natural hits.Studies indicate (See Olbrich, Schultz, & Bormann, 2019) that affiliates' social media activities positively affect the number of ad impressions.Through social media, affiliates can regularly engage with existing customers and reach new ones through providing meaningful content. Leave links in your email to view social media content that may be valuable to them and have buttons at the bottom of the email to your accounts.There may be a captive audience on platforms you never even considered, such as Pinterest. So at least have an account on the major social media platforms and repurpose the marketing content you already have, to suit the users.Pinterest content will be different from Instagram content, for example.Once an affiliate is making money via organic (non-paid) lead generation, they can then take the next step and pay for advertising, to drive even more traffic to their affiliate sites.However, it is essential to know and improve your numbers through analysis and optimising ads. Firms should analyse the analytics such as price paid for each click, conversion rates after clicking through to the website from ads, and the average commission. These figures dictate how profitable their advertising is.In sum, if you sell products and services online but are struggling to get many results from your marketing, affiliate marketing could be an avenue for you to approach.Equally, if you want to start a side income, affiliate marketing could be a good option. If you are already blogging, affiliate marketing can complement your blog strategy.Affiliate marketing works on a revenue-sharing model, where affiliates market products or services for other companies online, receiving a commission on each sale or other deliverable.Thank you for reading.

How Habit Streaks Can Help Change Your Life For the Better,"I've experimented with various techniques over the years to build good habits. Given I'm nowhere near perfection, let's say not all methods worked well. I've since then discovered the power of habit streaks. I'm a fan, and I reckon you'd be too if you saw these results.I started the year trying to get into a habit of closing all three rings (for move, exercise, and stand) on my Apple watch for 30 continuous days. Before this endeavor, my longest stretch had been eight days - so I figured a 30-day habit streak would make me feel accomplished.I got through that milestone relatively easily and went on to hit the 200-day milestone. That seemed like a big deal then until I hit the 366-day milestone - holywhoppinguacamole - a whole year!I know I probably sound overly excited. And for what?It's not like I invented a vaccine (the only kind of achievement that genuinely matters these days) or won an Olympic medal. But, I managed to break through a self-imposed barrier inside my own mind.Without a doubt, the lesson that will stay with me forever after this one-year ring-closing-streak is this: Incredible, hard to imagine things can happen through the power of tiny positive habits.So how do we create these consistent habits?There are a few options, but I'd like to focus specifically on habit streaks.In my experience, no other technique comes even close in terms of guaranteeing successful habits.Before I discuss any further, I'd like to emphasize that this discussion is about building positive habits. The same technique can be used in reverse to break negative habits, but I'll get to that at the end.Habit streaks are when you develop a streak: a continuous chain of repeating a task over a long period.For instance, if you want to be better informed, you may choose a goal of reading for 30 minutes every day. A streak is when you devote 30 minutes EVERY DAY to reading regardless of how you feel, how busy you are, or what the weather is.You can keep such streaks going for days, weeks, months in a row, or even years. Somewhere down the line, reading will become an automatic habit, something you simply do every day like eating and sleeping.A well-known proponent of habit streaking is Jerry Seinfeld of the eponymous show. Seinfeld calls it the ""Don't break the chain"" technique.Seinfeld famously wrote every day regardless of how he felt, whether or not he was inspired. On a printed calendar, he'd mark each day he wrote with a big red X. Soon, a chain of X's formed on the calendar. The growing chain became his motivation. Even when stuck in a slump, just seeing the chain of Xs would be enough to get him motivated to write because he didn't want to break the chain.Similarly, seeing a chain of closed rings was sufficient motivation for me (or a guilt trip, if you're a glass-half-empty person) to not break the flow.I kept this practice up for enough days in a row, and at some point, closing the three rings became a daily habit. It is part of my routine now. Has been for a year.Compared to other habit formation techniques, I find habit streaks work very well for a multitude of reasons.But here are my top five:1. Avoids procrastinationWhen you have to do something every day, you just go ahead and do it. You take away the option of postponing your action to another day.This kind of forced behavior, unpleasant though it may sound, is a blessing in disguise. Instead of spending your time dreaming up creative excuses, you just get stuff done and over with.2. Takes the pressure offDaily results matter less when you are engaged in an activity every day.For instance, if you only run once a week, it can erode your confidence if you happen to have a bad run. However, when you run daily, a lousy day is easy to overlook since you can start the next day afresh.3. Improves your craftAs a general rule, barring a few exceptions, the more time you spend honing your craft, the better you'll get at it. Habit streaking guarantees that you'll spend time refining your skills.If you've recently learned to drive but only take the car out once a week for 30 minutes, you are bound to encounter anxiety on the road. On the other hand, if you drive every day for 30 minutes, you will be a better, more confident driver soon.4. Builds confidenceJust knowing you've committed to and accomplished something, however trivial (3-ring streaks, for instance), is a major self-confidence booster.There are few areas in life we get to dictate how what, and when things will happen.5. Gets you organizedEven if you aren't the most organized person on the planet, just having to keep up a habit streak will force you to plan your days better. And that skill will trickle into other areas of your life.If your goal is to exercise for 20 minutes every day, you'll learn soon to schedule those 20 minutes earlier in the day, so you're not blindsided when you look at your watch and notice it's already 11.15 p.m.Habit streaks and poor planning are antithetical to each other. Only one will survive in a battle. Hopefully, it's the habit.I've already written quite extensively about this in my previous post here - 11 Lessons on Grit, so I won't repeat them.Here are five standout lessons, based on my experience, for anyone attempting to start a habit streak.I kept my move goal at an achievable level and didn't aim for the sky. Apple watch's algorithm kept prodding me every week to increase my move goal.I was juggling several activities this year and knew my limitations in terms of time and energy. So, I found a challenging-enough baseline level and didn't change the goal as the year progressed.Additionally, I aimed for a habit streak of 30 days at a time. I cannot stress how important this is. Had I started this project hoping to close three rings for a whole year, I almost certainly would have given up much earlier.It can be overwhelming when you set lofty goals when it comes to habit formation. I equate this to the feeling you get on mile 2 of a marathon. If you start thinking about the 25 miles left to run, it's going to weigh you down. The trick is to keep your focus on the short term. Eventually, you'll get to the 26th mile, but thinking about it every step of the way can be mentally draining.I made exercise a non-negotiable part of my day. I'd say about 95% of the time, I managed to get my 30 minutes of exercise done in the morning when I had more control over my day. This meant waking up at 4 a.m. sometimes, but it was a small price to pay for the subsequent relief I felt through the day.The words discipline and willpower are over-rated. Find a way to develop a fool-proof system to get your task done earlier in the day, if possible. Consistently, at the same time, every day is the best way to go. Make this activity non-negotiable.Twenty-one days for habit change is a made-up number. Depending on the habit, it may take longer. That said, the first 60 or so days were the hardest for me.I've tried other habit routines in the past but have failed because I didn't persist enough in the first few days when the going got tough.So, prepare yourself for your inner voice to keep telling you it's not worth the change those first 60 or so days. This is simply your brain on resistance.Don't be shy, in the early days, to treat yourself to a reward for completing your habit. Positive reinforcements help with habit building.I'm guilty of this. I've attempted in the past to add too many new habits too soon. That resulted in me getting nowhere. I whittled my list way down this year and was able to achieve so much more. Quality over quantity!The common wisdom is that you need to be lucky to keep habit streaks going. I beg to differ. Luck plays a teeny-tiny part, but, in reality, you have way more leeway in creating your own luck than you admit to yourself.In my case, there were countless days when the weather was too hot /too cold /too rainy, or I had too much going on at work or home. I absolutely had more than my share of legitimate excuses I could have used. But I chose not to use those because ultimately, who was I kidding?You get an extra sense of accomplishment when you brave a challenging situation to keep up your habit streaks. Cherish the challenges. They help build better humans.Ultimately every streak has to end. It just has to. And that's okay.It's healthy and natural to end your habit streaks and move on to an improved, better habit once you get to your goal.Think of it like a child mastering the alphabet. It's great when they get to a point where they can read and write all the letters from A to Z. That takes a lot of effort and practice. But then, they need to move on to words and sentences. Staying on at the level of the alphabet forever isn't helpful.So, don't get too attached to the number of Xs on your habit chain once you've mastered a habit. If you genuinely don't see any value carrying on, then it's time to break the chain. Otherwise, you'll stay within your comfort zone, and that's not conducive to growth.Habit streaking is just a tool. It is possible to use the tool to build healthy, positive habits and, on the flip side, strengthen and reinforce negative habits.That said, you can harness the power of habit streaking to remove negative habits by working to create a streak of non-performance, i.e., NOT performing the harmful habit.Quitting smoking is a classic example of this. Use the power of habit streaks by marking an X for each day you don't smoke. By increasing the number of days in a row you don't smoke, you're de-addicting to the harmful habit.When the tech industry realized there was a monetization opportunity to motivate people to start habit streaks, they developed apps to track streaks. You can absolutely use some of these apps if you choose to.Otherwise, simply use the old-school Seinfeld-method of using a calendar and red sharpie to mark your Xs.In my opinion, the only mandatory requirement of whatever tracking system you use is its visibility. You should be able to visually see the progress you are making every day, ideally first thing in the morning and at various times during the day. Not to stress yourself but to let your subconscious know that this endeavor matters to you.As the habit chain starts to grow to a reasonable length, it develops superpowers of motivation. It can get you out of whatever slump you feel.We rarely commit to doing something day in and day out for a whole year (other than eating and sleeping). But when we do, it opens our minds and hearts up to other possible achievements.Forming a great habit does not require rocket science. It requires commitment and dedication.Habit streaking can be used as a crutch to build such commitment and dedication. This tool works for a legend like Seinfeld. Even an ordinary, non-legend like me has been able to use it well. It's your turn now.Go forth and streak. In the best way possible!",https://miro.medium.com/max/2160/0*fkbEotfe-3zYaQdm.jpg,https://medium.com/the-ascent/how-habit-streaks-can-help-change-your-life-for-the-better-a194b1a22980,productivity,b1e85bc13a360772c057b27355d1cc5dd240a853721729b68e5eb5c0

A Winter Walk in The Woods,"Liz enjoys living in solitude outside of a large state forest preserve. When she isn't working shifts at a nearby hospital she enjoys driving out to the local trails to run or hike. This feeds her need to explore. One of her favorite things to do is to go for a short hike with her husky, Max, in fresh snow.The time alone in the woods with fresh snow provides Liz with the opportunity to reflect and the crisp air and snow awaken her senses.Luckily for Liz, it snowed the night before and blanketed the trails with a fresh coating of 3-inches of snow. The perfect early winter conditions to bring Max out and enjoy a leisurely hike with your dog.Liz picks a trail system she has visited and hiked numerous times before. When Liz arrives with Max there is no one in sight so she knows the trails will be deserted. The wildness will be entirely hers if even just for a short while. Liz heads out and before long reaches the end of the trail Liz enjoys a view from a ledge with Max before heading back.When Liz returns to the lot there is one car in the lot, a nondescript Chevy from the early 2000s. That's odd because there was nobody in sight along the trail on the way back and Liz was almost certain she would have noticed extra footprints.Curiosity gets the best of Liz. After putting her pack in her own car she decides to walk around to investigate the mystery of the other hiker. These outlying trails are not used very often except by those looking for some solitude. Liz doesn't want to startle anyone but curiosity is eating at her.It's not long before Liz notices that the owner of the Chevy did hike out on that same outlying trail but followed her and Max's tracks in the snow. The extra pair of footprints was barely noticeable. After about ten minutes into investigating the trail, the tracks suddenly take a sharp turn to the left. They head off into the woods. Well, this explains why no one was within sight on the way back, Liz thinks to herself.Liz thinks maybe the person decided to take a quick break, possibly to relieve themselves, before backtracking. She then remembers the car was still in the parking lot when she arrived so this is not probable. There are no tracks leading out either and from here it looks like there are actually two sets of tracks leading out into the woods! The tracks continue and just disappear into the distance of the woods.Curiosity has fully absorbed Liz's imagination at this point and she decides to also step off the trail. Liz heads into the woods for about ten feet. Max, the ever happy husky, does not seem to like this idea. After scanning the landscape, Liz realizes she is on an unmarked herd path. There are no discernible blazes, but it is clear there is a path. Even more intrigued, Liz realizes that there are no advantages to sneaking up on two people in the woods so she makes her way back to her own car. The thought that she had been following two unknown people and had no idea of what she was going to do when she found them sends shivers down her back. Liz walks a little faster.Once Liz reaches her car she puts Max in the back, takes off her pack, retrieves her trail map. From looking at the map it's apparent there is no trail listed off of the primary hiking trail. The map just shows a forest for at least a mile.Liz is tempted to stick around, partially out of curiosity, and also to make sure BOTH people emerge from the forest. If not for her own safety, Liz needs to get going to prepare for a shift at work. This will be quite a story - Liz and her colleagues will have no trouble passing their hours of work filling in the potential details behind Liz's mystery of what two strangers were doing on a secret forest trail in the winter. The truth is likely boring but the possibilities are limitless.",,https://psiloveyou.xyz/a-winter-walk-in-the-woods-91929180a640,fiction,b8dcac478706fa87defec253ae9aed82c2779ffb112252a97201aa61
Why I Refuse to Travel With a Gun,"One question that commonly arises in thru-hiking and vandwelling communities is: ""should I bring a gun with me?""The ensuing debate tends to split along conservative/liberal lines, as one might expect.Some people would never leave home without a gun. It gives them peace of mind to know they always have the option to use a firearm in case some person, or animal, threatens their safety.I can see the logic behind that. If that's what helps you feel safe enough to travel, so be it. Maybe someday you'll be really glad you had it. More power to you.In my personal experience of nearly 7 years on the road and the trail, I've never remotely wished I had a gun. I do understand there is some white male privilege at play here: it's easier for me to feel safe by default, especially when I'm hitchhiking or camping alone, because I'm less likely to be assaulted. However, I do know lots of women who live similar lifestyles without a gun.Speaking only for myself and my own situation, I would never travel with a gun, and here are 4 reasons why.1.I don't carry a gun in the city, and the places I travel are generally safer than the city.Some people think if you go into the woods, bears will try to eat you and crazed axe murderers will butcher you in your sleep.The reality is nothing like that.I spent 7 full months hiking the PCT and I saw maybe 4-6 bears. All of them sprinted in the opposite direction when they saw me. I believe I saw one cougar, at night, and if it wanted to eat me it would have done so - gun or not.The people you meet in wild places are typically reasonable; they're out there to enjoy the same things you are. Generally speaking, if some bloodthirsty maniac wants to kill people, they aren't going to go through the trouble of driving hours out into a remote place, hiding out, and hoping someone eventually wanders into their trap. They're just going to go to a populated place and kill someone who's easy to find.Of course, predators (animal and human) do exist in the wild. But attacks are rare. They make for dramatic news stories, so they strike fear in the public mind, but realistically you're probably in greater danger in the city.2.I will accept a slight risk of eventual danger if it improves the quality of my everyday life.I prefer to live in a world where I can assume the people around me will not attack me. I've trusted many strangers and never regretted it. I think having a positive attitude about the people around me, instead of fearing them, is a self-fulfilling prophecy in a way.Yes, I am aware that someday I might encounter a truly unhinged person, and I might be injured or killed, and the outcome may be different if I have a gun.We make risk/benefit tradeoffs all the time in life, and this is a calculated risk I'm willing to take. I think it's very unlikely I would ever be harmed in a way only a gun could prevent. The continual benefit of never dealing with the hassle or stress of gun ownership is enough to offset the risk of assault, in my estimation.Another reason not to take a gun on a long backpacking trip is its weight. You might think a few extra pounds is worth it, but when you're hiking 15-20 miles a day with thousands of feet of elevation gain, you quickly come to resent every ounce of unnecessary weight - and once you realize you're safer in the wilderness than you were back home, you'll see just how extraneous a gun is.3.Using a gun is portrayed as a ""tough guy"" thing, but it's the laziest, weakest, and most harmful way to solve most problems.Pointing a gun is easy. You know what's hard, but ultimately more effective? Developing the skills of empathy, situational awareness, and de-escalation.I see some people making (hopefully) empty threats of using guns to solve problems. ""Don't let your dog onto my property or I'll shoot it."" ""Nothing in this house is worth your life."" ""Shoot first, ask questions later.""This strikes me as a primitive, reckless attitude. Do we really need to threaten people's lives in order to maintain our affairs? That sounds like a sign of weakness, not strength.If someone crosses your boundary, you'll be in a situation where you have to choose between taking a life and being exposed as a phony. That's a position I'd prefer not to find myself in.Relying on the power to kill is a poor substitute for the skills of an experienced traveler or outdoorsperson, and it can lend a dangerous sense of false security. A wise traveler develops a keen intuition about sketchy situations and learns how to quietly extract themselves without drawing attention. They learn how to defuse people and maintain peace; they solve problems in creative, nuanced ways.Overall, it's safer to notice and avoid hairy situations in the first place than it is to carelessly enter them with the assurance of a gun. Most of what needs to be done to stay safe happens long before you would ever think to use a weapon.4.I don't want to live with blood on my hands, even if it's in self-defense.If someone was threatening me, and I shot and killed them, I don't think I would ever stop wondering: was it truly necessary for them to die? What would the outcome have been if I didn't use lethal force?I know killing in self-defense is legally justified and I wouldn't go to prison. My reluctance has more to do with the fact that the idea of killing a person is repulsive to me in general.I believe most ""bad"" people are products of their environment; theft and violence are often acts of desperation. I pity any person who would want to attack me, because that's got to be a miserable way to live. I don't see anybody as a pure ""enemy"". None of us asked to be born and we're all struggling through life together.No matter how evil someone seems, I would prefer if they find help and healing rather than die a violent death. I don't want to be the person who decides it's their time to die. No part of it would be redeeming or exciting for me.This isn't to say I would never try to defend myself, as I'm sure the survival instinct would kick in and I don't think there's anything wrong with fighting back. I'm just saying: lethal self-defense may be legal, but it doesn't sit well with my personal value system. It's not something I want to have the option to do easily.If it comes down to it, and I die from a violent attack that could have been prevented with a gun: so be it. It's a risk I'm willing to take. This is just one of a large number of things that can kill a person with no warning.Sometimes it's better to accept risks than to cling to some illusion of control that actually makes you more stressed out and fragile.The things that end up killing most Americans are unsensational. Heart disease, cancer, diabetes. Instead of worrying about being attacked, I'd rather direct that energy into living a healthy lifestyle, which is something I can actually control and is much more likely to keep me happy and healthy into old age.Click here to sign up for my mailing list and be notified right away when I publish future articles.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10944/0*7J9gQbE2jTKnFIPj,https://medium.com/curious/why-i-refuse-to-travel-with-a-gun-706ddb1933bb,travel,b8f1c780b5b1d518f1a57683e781afbd6f50afb7198c7bb70ad511e1
Discovering the Cruise Port of Livorno,"We sailed into Livorno under a blazing Mediterranean sun. Sailing these waters is like sailing into the past - long stretches of barren coastline, little villages marked with their groves of olives and grapes, the sails of small boats dotting the water. It is travelling the works of Homer, and the history of legend.This area has been occupied since Neolithic times, with pieces of copper, ceramics and carved bones found in nearby caves. The Romans named the cove Liburna, in reference to a ship used by their navy. The town has been owned by Pisa, Milan, Genoa and Florence. Under the Medici, the port expanded, and two Medici fortresses still dominate the port: the Fortezza Nuovo and the Fortezza Vecchia (Cosmio I had a palace built within the Fortress Vecchia). By the end of the 17th C had become a major trading port -Livorno is now apparently the second largest shipping port in Tuscany, but little work seemed to get done. On a side note, the Italian Communist Party was founded here in 1921.A bus took us to the centre of town, stopping at the Comune di Livorno (or Town Hall). Already the day was hot, and the queues outside the Tourist Information ridiculously long; many would-be explorers sat in the few spots in the shade, fanning themselves with guide-books and maps. So, we simply wandered, as gently as the heat allowed.The narrow Via del Porticcolo beckoned, which leads to the Via Borra, and so to the area of Livorno called either Little Venice or New Venice (Venice Nuovo). The Via Borra traverses a small island, lined with the houses of the nobility and important merchant families of the 17th and 18th C. It runs across the Ponte di Marmo, a delightful bridge with marble parapets and covered with inscriptions left by Livornese boatmen for their loved ones.Little Venice was designed by Medici architects in an effort to create the prefect city. The canals once linked the trading warehouses with the ships of the port. Most of the buildings date from the same time, giving a uniformity to design rarely seen in an Italian town. Wider than the canals of Venice, they are now filled with fishing boats and little outboards. Many of the streets are small winding lanes and, like Venice, it's a great place to wander with no destination in mind, other than a morning coffee.Where the Via Borra becomes the Via San Marco stands the Chiesa Santa Caterina. Like many Tuscan churches, it has a façade of rough stone, but the octagonal façade is quite unusual. Founded by the Dominicans in 1720, it was not mentioned in any guide-books, but a door stood open. What an amazing find! A few hours away by bus is Florence, packed with tourists; here we were the only people in the empty church. The Chiesa Santa Caterina was empty, light, and spacious, with side chapels opening off the central corridor. Being empty, there is plenty of room to step back and admire the detailing and the numerous trompe l'oil used to give depth to the church.To one side, unmarked, I found a Coronation of the Virgin, once attributed to the School of Giotto but now considered to be by Vasari. Originally published in 1550, Vasari's The Lives of The Artists remains essential reading for anyone interested in this period of art. Often called the father of art history, he was the first to use the term Renaissance in print.Vasari designed the Vasari corridor in Florence and painted some of the frescoes adorning the Duomo's cupola, plus some on the walls of the Palazzo Vecchio. He also designed the loggia of the Uffizi, which opens onto the Arno.Continuing along the Scali del Pontino and Scali delle Cantine, we left Little Venice and reached the Piazza della Repubblica. On the way, we dallied in some local markets. From the Piazza della Republica the Via Grande runs past the Cathedral of St. Francis of Assisi. Completely destroyed by Allied bombing in 1943, its reconstruction was not completed until 1952. Hidden in a corner I found is a small The Suffering of Christ by Fra Angelico. One of my favourite renaissance artists, Angelico's works in Florence's San Marco remain an ethereal wonder.Sailing out of port we dined off cherries and plums bought in a market, along with some local prosecco, redolent of apple. As the sun set behind the hills it set the water ablaze. A stunning end to a day filled with unexpected delight.If you enjoy my writing, please visit my blog Wise Men Fish Here , where (if you feel like contributing to my coffers) you can also buy my photos and my latest ebook of poetry, Songs of a Sad Summer.

The Rising Smoke Of My Past,"Even though it was an unknown number and it had been four years since I left Delhi, the moment I picked up the call and heard a faint whisper of someone breathing, I knew it was her.Realizing that, I froze.I was sitting with my wife in the lounge, and my two kids were sitting on the floor beside the table, with colourful Lego blocks scattered about them.""Hello, who is it?"" I said anyway as I saw my wife looking at me, curious in her own ways about the call.""You changed your number,"" she said slowly, ""because of me, right?""I shifted the phone to my left hand, not sure what to say. The easy way was to cut the call. But I just couldn't bring myself to do that.There was a pause at the other end, though I could still hear the slow rhythm of her breathing. I nodded my head a couple of times, just to give an impression that I was listening.I cocked my head slightly toward my wife.She had stopped looking at me, her eyes now back to the magazine she was holding limply in her hands.I pressed the phone harder against my ear to ensure that whatever she says now doesn't leak out of the space between my ear and the phone.But there was no sound. None at all.I waited for her to say something. Say anything as the silence was roaring in my ears now.""Okay!"" I blurted out just to fill the silence.A slightest of the sounds at the other end, a snicker, and suddenly I was back in time, four years in the past, nested in the bed with her, my body melting into hers as she arched and moaned and writhed in my hands.I let out a shudder.""You okay, honey?""I looked at my wife. She had put the magazine down and was leaning in my direction.I tried to smile, but my heart was pumping wildly in my chest now, and my face has must have given away my anxiety for she had gotten up from the couch and was coming towards me.And then the courage I had not been able to muster until then came, and my fingers found the red button and disconnected the call.I put the phone back at my ears and blurted out, ""Hello! Hello! Hello!"" in quick succession at the hollow silence that remained after she was gone.""Who was it?"" my wife asked.""Some shitty prankster,"" I said at once.""Why? What did he say?""""He said - "" I gulped once. ""He said that you were in some accident, and I need to come down there.""""What!"" she threw her head back and laughed. ""These people!"" And she laughed again.It was only when I heard her laughing like that, laughing in a way which makes her eyes twinkle and entire face lights up, that I finally began to calm down.She didn't suspect; she didn't suspect at all.That night after the dinner, after we had put the kids to bed and after she and I had had sex, and she lay calmly sleeping behind me, I stayed awake, looking at the murky darkness of the night air above me, fighting the old sensations that had long been buried, as they rose again, exhuming the dead body of my past, giving shape to the worst of my fears.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8672/0*1jC5WKwnXjpnrgo8,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-rising-smoke-of-my-past-1149f912e37e,fiction,b704e0330847130e54204aeb8d2dd4f64802988b8cf96fe4884e4f26
How I Survived The Storms of 2020 as a Full-Time Traveler,"2020 was a grim year for travelers.Whether you were seeking some well-deserved holidays, planning new adventures, or living a digital nomad lifestyle, the past twelve months were disappointing at best.For people in the tourism industry, it was even worse.According to an August 2020 policy brief from the United Nations, the industry could lose up to 100 million jobs and 1 trillion dollars in revenue. Worse still, 2020 will have a dramatic effect on some of the world's least-developed countries - many of which are heavily reliant on foreign visitors.Personally, my digital nomad lifestyle got a forced break. On the road for the entirety of 2019, my journey ground to a sudden halt in February 2020.Throughout the next three months, I lost over half of my freelance clients, most of my photography gigs, and 70% of my income.Times looked bleak.Luckily, the tide soon turned. Around mid-May, European countries started to lift their restrictions, reopen their borders, and welcome back travelers. There was a general hint of optimism in the air.After three stationary months, I packed my bags once again and hit the road. I traveled nonstop between May and November, cruising around the Balkans and Southern Europe.Traveling was more complicated than before, but I managed to succeed as a digital nomad in 2020.Nevertheless, digital nomadism was far from plain sailing in 2020.To this day, lots of countries around the world remain shut - and many people assert the claim that no one should travel during a Pandemic.That's easy to say when you can stay home for an entire year and still enjoy regular paychecks. I can't. A vast proportion of my income is reliant on travel. As a travel photographer, I don't have a choice.As such, it took until October before my income was back to pre-COVID levels. Many lost freelance clients, however, never returned.As a self-employed content creator, I got very little from the government. Couple that with economic downturns in some of the markets I depend upon - like stock photography and tourism cooperations - and you might understand why I can't just sit around and wait.However, 2020 also had its upsides.During the first half of the year, diversification was on the agenda. By broadening my horizons, learning novel skills, and looking into new projects, I built four additional income streams in 2020.As such, 2020 was a whirlwind with many negatives but also lots of positives.On this basis, here is how I survived the storms of 2020 as a full-time traveler.In March 2020, when most of the world went into lockdown, I was in my hometown - Luxembourg-City - preparing for six months in Asia.A year before, my digital nomad odyssey had begun. In early 2019, I said farewell to my well-paid job in the finance sector, packed my bags, and set off to travel the world full-time. Through smart prioritization, hard work, and countless trial and error lessons, I made the lifestyle work. I built various online businesses and achieved financial independence after a year of traveling through Asia and Latin America.In December 2019, I met up with my family in an Austrian skiing resort. One night at a well-known après-ski bar, I said the following to my brother:I've made it. I work for myself now, and I can travel the world full-time. That's all I ever wanted.Little did I know that the following months would bring me back to square one. Ironically, the bar where we celebrated that night would become an infamous COVID-19 hotspot in the coming weeks.January and February were the ""calm before the storm."" There was some talk about a virus in China, but no one took it seriously. It didn't look like my Asia trip would be in jeopardy.Fast forward to mid-March, and the whole world was in lockdown. My Asia trip got canceled, and my income took a nosedive.A mere four months earlier, I had been celebrating my success as a digital nomad - convinced that 2020 would bring even grander adventures.The shocks of March provided several powerful lessons:One of my favorite books of 2020 was Matthew McConaughey's fantastic autobiography Greenlights.When it comes to navigating personal crises, the Academy Award winner writes the following:In the spring of 2020, similar steps helped me out of a dark hole.The global crisis had decimated my income and taken away my passion. I had financial woes - not knowing whether my business would go under - and mental troubles. I was facing an existential crisis.After reading an entire library of books about Stoicism and practicing stillness in everyday life, I realized that it was time to assess the damage and pick up the pieces.I reorganized the problem by analyzing what kind of income streams were unlikely to return any time soon. I then stabilized the situation by focusing on the remaining clients and slowing my life down.Finally, I organized a response. I drew up plans to diversify and worked on solutions to travel safely during the Pandemic. After a tough month of crisis management, I responded.The month of April became a life-changer, both for my business and my digital nomad lifestyle.I started taking Medium seriously and launched a newsletter on my blog. I had countless Skype calls with professionals in the tourism industry - eagerly planning future collaborations. I also started a new Instagram page for my travels and re-orientated my photography. In short, I diversified.By mid-May, Europe was on a reopening trajectory. Tourism is a vital industry, and closed borders are not a sustainable option.With a renewed zeal for adventure, diversified income streams, and some sense of normality, I left Luxembourg and restarted my digital nomad lifestyle.I started digital nomadism 2.0 in Germany and Austria as they were among the first reopen.The measures were stringent, but most travel attractions were open. Bars had to close early, there were no events, and you had to wear masks everywhere. For me, it was just another set of restrictions. I will never use the hideous term ""new normal.""In June, I continued to Slovenia and Croatia. It was on the Austro-Slovenian border that I got my first taste of the chaos that would characterize 2020 travel.On the bus, the Slovenian border police asked for my passport. In normal times, there are no border controls between Austria and Slovenia as both countries are members of the Schengen Treaty.You are not allowed into Slovenia. Your country is on the red list. You need to turn back to Austria.Are you kidding me? I thought I had checked all the entry requirements.I took out my phone and showed them the list of ""green"" European countries - the ones that were allowed to visit Slovenia. Luxembourg and Austria were on the list.The officers took my passport and called their superiors. As it turned out, Luxembourg had been added to the list a few days before. They weren't aware of that. One week later, after I had left Slovenia for Croatia, my country was off the list again. A window of opportunity, I suppose.My brief Slovenian border episode became a small drop in an ocean of travel bureaucracy and incomprehensible entry regulations.The European Commission published some guidelines throughout 2020, but as always, countries went their own ways. For young Europeans - who are used to crossing borders on a whim without even taking their passport - it was a nightmare.Nevertheless, travel was possible, and there were also lots of advantages.It was my fourth time in Croatia, and the experience was incomparable to most summers - when millions of tourists flock to the alluring Balkan nation. The cities were empty, the beach resorts were half-empty, and I had the Plitvice Lakes National Park - one of the most stunning natural sights in all of Europe - to myself.The same applied to Italy. I managed to finish off the last two Italian regions that I hadn't visited before - Sicily and Calabria - and spent six weeks traveling around the rest of the country.Having been to Italy almost every year, I can safely say that there has never been a better time to visit the Colosseum, Leonardo Da Vinci's Last Supper, or Apulia's beach resorts. It was marvelous.After that, I headed to Portugal, where I spent two months improving my Portuguese and working on new projects. Much like Italy and Croatia, the lack of crowds was unprecedented, and the tourism-loving country welcomed foreigners with open arms.Italy and Portugal had barely any restrictions, and for a short period, I forgot that COVID even existed. Yes, you had to wear a mask in supermarkets and on trains, but other than that, nothing had changed.At the end of September, I headed to my next nomad base: Athens, Greece.My arrival in Greece coincided with COVID spikes all over Europe. Upon arriving at Athens Airport, an unfriendly airport official barked out orders at the passengers. Straight toward the testing center!Everyone got tested at the airport. Passengers didn't have a choice. On the official website, it said that they would randomly select passengers for testing. In my case, the random selection included an entire plane of 200 travelers.It was my fifth test and came back negative, like the previous four. I had taken three in Luxembourg and one in Portugal, but this one was different.A positive result would have meant two weeks in a Greek quarantine facility. There was no information about the facilities online.Don't get me wrong. I didn't have a problem with the test itself. After all, I was entering Greece, and I needed to play by their rules. However, the supposedly random selection and the lack of information about subsequent procedures made it a bit sketchy.The testing in Greece was just one of the many aspects that made traveling in 2020 an uncertain affair.I nonetheless had a brilliant time in Greece and left just before they entered their second full-scale lockdown.By November, most of Europe was in some sort of lockdown again. I first spent a few weeks in a chalet in Slovakia and then returned to Luxembourg, where I rented a room for two months.It was another break from my digital nomad lifestyle, but this time it was well-planned and intentional.I could have gone to other parts of the world where restrictions are non-existent, but I decided to take a break. 2020 taught me the value of slowing down - both as a traveler and entrepreneur.So, how would I recap my digital nomad year 2020?If I had to describe it in one word, it would be uncertainty.In 2019, I booked a plane to Bangkok two days before leaving. I did the same for Montevideo and Istanbul. I didn't have the slightest worry that something could go wrong.In 2020, I needed to check five different websites before booking anything. Is the country open to foreigners? Who is allowed to enter? Do I need a PCR test? Is there some weird form that I have to download? And what are other conditions?Consequently, as a digital nomad, planning became even more difficult. Many attractions remained closed, creating a hindrance for the necessary balancing act between work and adventure.However, we shouldn't complain about bureaucracy and closed nightclubs.Those of us who can travel are still in a privileged position. I only visited one new country in 2020, the microstate of San Marino, compared to 12 in 2019. Nevertheless, most people would consider my year lucky.Worse still, to this day, lots of people bombard me with accusatory lines like: ""you still travel the world while others lose family members. You are irresponsible. Nobody should promote travel when thousands of people die every day.""Telling people that I was in a dark spot at the beginning of the year usually doesn't change their opinion. In that same vein, explaining that I had to rebuild my professional life from scratch does little more.That's why the two primary lessons of being a digital nomad in 2020 were the following:As far as travel and digital nomadism go, the first months of 2020 will probably be more of the same. The vaccines are here, but it will take months before we'll feel their impact on a global scale.Nevertheless, the world is as open as it's ever been - at least since March 2020. I am leaving Europe in early January and plan to travel to new countries before returning home for the vaccine.But if there's anything I've learned from being a digital nomad in 2020, it's that things can change rapidly. That's why I don't plan much in advance and spend a lot of time in each nomad base.Now to the million-dollar question: should you become a digital nomad in 2021?Ask yourself whether you can live with the current uncertainties surrounding travel. If you want lots of adventurous experiences with spontaneous expeditions, it might not be the best time.Digital nomadism is about making a living on the road while seeking thrilling adventures. Right now, the ""making a living on the road"" part is challenging. The ""seeking thrilling adventures"" part, on the other hand, is next to impossible.In contrast, if you already have ample income streams and simply want to change locations and work remotely to broaden your horizons, now is as good a time as any to become a digital nomad.Finally, I'll end with an ancient Chinese proverb:Yes, it was easier to become a digital nomad in 2019, 2018, or 2017.However, the situation - both in the world and in your personal life - will never be perfect. Now might not be the best time to embark on a digital nomad adventure, but it's the second-best time. Because the past is gone and the future is uncertain.The more you know, the better you travel!",https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/1*JFs6I2SSkRzh3952AGnCOQ.jpeg,https://medium.com/world-travelers-blog/how-i-survived-the-storms-of-2020-as-a-full-time-traveler-da8da22b6e3d,travel,b73470b165adcb19dd2c081db7becdf3d3a9aa7bdeaeeff58e22b2bf
A woman wrote a modern-day version of the 'Green Book' to make travel more inclusive,"Martinique Lewis created a modern-day version of the ""Green Book"" that highlights Black culture and Black-owned businesses around the world.By Sophie-Claire HoellerIn 1936, Victor Hugo Green, a Black postal worker from New York, created ""The Negro Motorist Green Book,"" a guide for local Black travelers to find restaurants, shops, and hotels in which they'd be free from the discrimination rampant during the Jim Crow-era. A year later, due to overwhelming demand, a national version was published.In 2020, Martinique Lewis created a modern-day adaptation called ""The ABC Travel Green Book"" that lists Black-owned businesses around the world, as well as events, festivals, and tours pertaining to Black culture.""You're going to always experience anxiety [as a Black traveler] because there's always going to be racism,"" she told Insider, adding that it doesn't matter whether the racism is overt or not.She explained that this is one of the things the ""ABC Travel Green Book"" deals with. The self-published directory outlines her own experiences in certain places, details whether there have been any hate crimes lately, and whether these places have a Black community.""Black people have anxiety about safety,"" she said. ""The same racism we experience right here in our own country, we experience it more here, but we can experience it when we go abroad, too.""Lewis, now a diversity in travel consultant, worked in fashion until late 2017. Once she noticed a lack of diversity in the travel industry, however, and the fact that travel publications, tourism bureaus, and travel companies weren't doing anything to attract Black travelers, she couldn't unsee it.She decided she wanted to help the travel industry change and that it had the financial incentive to do so. Lewis said she wanted to ""make them understand how much the Black consumer, the Black traveler, spends."" African Americans spent $63 billion on the US travel and tourism economy in 2018 alone, according to a report by Mandala Research - and that's just the US.She adds that around the time she noticed the lack of representation, she also noticed Black travel communities starting to pop up online, which she said affected where Black travelers went.""We were literally planning our travel itineraries based off of what we saw on social media,"" she said.She quit her job and used her savings to preach the importance of diversity and inclusion at various conferences around the world, beseeching companies to do more for travelers of color.Frustrated by a lack of action, she started making report cards for the industry, giving well-known travel brands letter grades for their diversity and inclusion efforts across various metrics. This garnered some buzz, she said, and brands started hiring her to do internal training and influencer trips.She first heard about the original ""Green Book"" while working at Nomadness Travel Tribe, which Lewis describes as ""as the oldest Black travel movement in America.""Something clicked.""I kept thinking, god, I have to do something like this. Because as a traveler, I was finding these communities of Black people in places that you would have never thought they would be,"" she said, adding that she wanted to share these unique experiences she was having with others.Amsterdam is what really got her into the idea of creating a modern-day version, as she said she was surprised to find the Dutch city home to a huge Black community.""It's all just Black history, there are all these Black restaurants, there's a Black hospital, there are Black cafés. There's a group dedicated to Black women who come to Amsterdam,"" she said.""Researching it was rigorous,"" she said of the nearly two years it took her to put the book together. ""These are things you can't find on Google, you can't find on Yelp. There's no way to identify what the Black-owned businesses are if you don't know word-of-mouth or you haven't been there yourself.""Close to giving up, she credits Blackout Tuesday on June 2, when people posted Black squares on their social media feeds to protest racism and police brutality, with re-energizing her to finish the book.She said that companies started reaching out to her wanting to talk about diversity, and while the timing annoyed her (""Now, all of a sudden, you want to talk about Black-owned businesses?"") she said she felt that the book could be a resource for allies as well.""What I was trying to do with the Green Book is help people with their itinerary to be able to patronize Black-owned businesses, to be able to support and celebrate Black culture in places where they didn't think it would normally be,"" Lewis said. ""I want people, if they have a love for travel, to take this book and explore these communities, so they learn something new.""She credits her frustration with brands she claimed have rarely worked with Black people, addressed Black people, or really depicted Black people in any significant way who were suddenly advertising Black Lives Matter after Blackout Tuesday with the impetus behind the Black Travel Alliance, which she founded a week later.""It is not OK for our trauma to be your trend in this moment,"" she said.According to Lewis, the alliance aims to show the industry ""You have to do better and there's somebody here now who's going to hold you accountable for who you said that you are."" Amplification, alliance, and accountability are listed as the pillars of the alliance's community on its website.She said it also provides resources for members and helps with job placement (""building up African-American leaders in the tourism space""), works with brands on diversity and inclusivity, and is working on research projects that take an in-depth look at the Black travel community, emerging trends within it, and how much money Black travelers spend worldwide - a first of its kind, according to Lewis.""I want people to say it and mean it, I don't want people to just do it because it's trending,"" she said. ""I would like to see brands just do better.""Lewis believes that the pandemic has shed light on the inequalities of travel and is hopeful for its future. She predicts that post-pandemic, when destinations launch recovery campaigns, these will be a lot more inclusive and diverse than ever before as a result.""I think now people just have better knowledge and are willing to move forward in making sure that everybody is a part of [travel]. So I'm excited to see it actually,"" she said.For more great stories, visit Insider's homepage.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2600/0*UZuUC2ZrHRNhvyYt,https://medium.com/insider/meet-the-woman-making-travel-more-inclusive-5763bcd6d76d,travel,be8119ddf2465be6c499245feb415ca5be7c15729f66ecb896d66ad7

A Quick Thought on Focus: Learn to Say No to Other Good Ideas,"What does it mean to focus on your work?Regardless of what kind of work it might be, when it comes to sparking ideas, working with them, and infusing creativity in the process, what does focus look like?Steve Jobs had a powerful outlook on the subject:It isn't that you won't have other good ideas, but what you do with the one great idea that really explodes inside your soul, that catches fire and doesn't stop burning.Focusing on such an idea as that means learning how to recognize it before it takes hold and learning how to recognize it among all the other good ideas.What if focus meant stripping away the non-essential stuff, learning to say no to the hundred other good ideas.

Vixen: A Short Shapeshifting Story,"Rob stood at the bar trying not to feel insecure. This wasn't his scene. He was good looking enough-brown hair, stubble beard, fit body-but he didn't have that ephemeral ""it"" that made women want him. He'd had girlfriends but, the chemistry had never been strong enough to make things last. He was at this trendy bar with his buddy Mitch, who had shamed him into coming.The night was playing out as predicted. Mitch was on the floor dancing and schmoozing, but Rob couldn't find the energy. He sighed and stared at the remnants of foam floating in his beer. When he raised his eyes, he saw her.She sat on the other side of the rectangular-shaped bar. She watched him. No fear, no aggression, no obvious seduction. She just watched him, like his mother's cat used to do. He glanced behind him to make sure that he was the target of her gaze. When he looked back, she still watched. She had beautiful red hair-fluffy with a slight curl at the ends that rested below her shoulders. The lights of the bar glinted off it. He kept his eyes on hers and walked towards her. Her gaze never left him.As he drew closer he saw that her eyes were amber and outlined in black eyeliner, like a pinup from the 50s. She wore a black sleeveless dress. Her skin had a light tan and glowed with fitness and health.His mind grasped for one-liners or small talk but words failed him. He looked into her eyes and a strange feeling of home washed over him. The one place where you could be yourself and know you were loved.She smiled with beautiful white teeth and held out her hand with a bent wrist, as though she were a lady of old and he were to kiss it. He nearly did. But, instead, he took it and rubbed his thumb over the top of it. Her skin felt smooth and soft. Her manicured nails were painted black. He bit his lip, imagining how they would look caressing his chest. He looked up and met her gaze. Her eyes had dilated, as if reading his thoughts.He inhaled her scent. He vaguely recognized her perfume, it had an earthy, woody scent that sent a jolt to his manhood.He wondered if he had felt the light lick of her tongue on his cheek or just imagined it because her slow, breathy voice drove all rational thoughts from his mind.He realized he still held her hand so he gently pulled her to standing. She picked up the large black tote bag that hung on the back of her seat and followed him. It took no time at all to lead her out of the club and get into a taxi conveniently waiting at the curb. After giving his address to the driver, Rob turned to the woman.The oddness of her compliment left his mind as he kissed her, his hand slipping through her hair to cradle the back of her head. Her lips were wet and soft. As their kiss deepened it seemed as though he stood outside of himself and marveled at how perfectly they fit together. No teeth scraping or awkward rhythms in their kiss. They both instinctively knew what the other wanted and the kiss seemed to go on and on, transitioning from soft and tentative to firm and breathless with rising passion.By the time they reached his apartment their fire burned. Rob closed the front door and leaned her against the wall, pressing his body against her. He cupped her chin in his hands and devoured her kisses. Her hands traveled all over his body, feeling his muscles and kneading them with gentle pinches. His arm bumped her large tote bag as his hands slid down her body. He started to take it off her shoulder. She grabbed it fiercely and struggled to get away from him.He didn't understand how things could go south so quickly. All passion had left her and she stood, clutching her bag and edging towards the door. He raised his hands in surrender and backed away from her. His internal voice repeating its mantra: You always screw things up with women. You will be alone forever.He shook his head to clear the voice. He headed towards the kitchen to put more distance between them.She no longer looked scared. Her tote bag hung from her hand, an inch above the floor. Her shoulders were relaxed. She stared at him, the way she had at the bar earlier that night.Her tote dropped to the ground. She stalked towards him. Her hair was tangled in a sexy mess from his hands and her lips wet and swollen from his kisses.Once she reached him she placed her hands on his pecs and then slid them up onto his shoulders. She stepped closer. One hand kneaded the back of his neck and the other threading through his hair. She pulled him into a kiss, the aggressor. His body responded immediately, effectively shutting up his thoughts of surprise before they could ruin the moment. She clawed at the buttons on his shirt, and he reached up to pull it off his head. She tugged at the end of his belt and unbuckled it before scratching his stomach in her rush to pull off his Levis.He felt a moment of-was it fear? But quickly pushed that feeling aside. He backed up towards his bedroom, kissing her and untying the belt of her wraparound dress. They stood beside the bed naked and looked at each other, chests heaving with excitement.Then she pounced. There was no other word for the beautiful leap she made onto the bed and onto his body. Her warmth, silky skin, long hair, and earthy scent overtook his senses. He closed his eyes to savor them. Then she was kissing him again and, as he rolled her onto her back, she made the sweetest little noises of delight.All he wanted to do was give her pleasure. He slid down to her feet and sucked on her toes, also painted black, he noted. She watched him with her amber eyes, half-closed in desire. He kissed his way up her calves, leaving a hand to caress her feet and gently massage her ankle. She moaned. Up her legs he traveled and she spread her legs willingly. All his life he had wanted a partner like this. A woman who would let him adore her body and not pull back into a shell of body shame.Her hands moved all over his body: caressing, squeezing his muscles, grabbing his hips to pull them closer-delighting in the feel of him as much as he did with her. By the time he finally entered her he'd lost count of how often she had found release. She wrapped her legs and arms around him and he looked into her eyes. She felt warm and wet and willing. He paused as the senses washed over him. He had never felt so wanted.They made love for over an hour and he marveled at his ability to not give in to his own body demanding release. All he wanted was to make this magic, this connection, last as long as humanly possible.When he finally couldn't take it he plunged into her, lost in his own body and hearing her release with him. When they finished he lay on top of her, nuzzling her neck and drowning in her softness, her scent, her essence as he caught his breath.Then he lay on his back with her tucked under his arm, her hand caressing his chest hair.Rob had to go to work the next day, and he left her sleeping in his bed. He put a note on the kitchen counter, next to the coffee, asking her to write down her phone number before she left.But she didn't leave. Rob came home at 5:30 p.m. and saw her standing at the stove stirring a pot that smelled like a delicious stew. A tingle of relief went through him, and he couldn't hide his smile as he walked towards her.She watched him, in that way he loved and pressed her body against him when he hugged her from behind. She turned off the stove and guided him to the bedroom. As if the night before had only been practice, their lovemaking reached an even higher level. Their eye contact and familiarity with each other let them reach a spiritual connection that Rob had never experienced. Time didn't exist. All that existed was that moment, their bodies and the never ending delight they found in pleasing each other.When they were finished and laying together in the afterglow, Rob realized that the bed was made with clean sheets, and the dirty clothes from his hamper were clean and neatly folded and stacked upon his dresser. He hugged her shoulder, loving how it felt to have her head resting upon his chest.Yes. Forever. His heart shouted and it almost reached his lips before his rational mind jumped in to make its case.Are you crazy? You don't even know this woman. Doesn't she have a job? You met her in a bar and now you are going to let her freeload off of you?His heart argued back. I support myself already so having her here isn't much of an expense. Home-cooked meals, clean house, a gorgeous woman ready and willing in my bed? Why would I let this go? I'll never have a lover like this again. She wants me.But it seemed to satisfy her and she gave a happy sigh and rested her head on his chest again.Pandora's box, said his rational mind. Then he felt her hand caressing his leg. He looked into her amber eyes with her red hair falling around her face and her sexy smile.. . .The pair settled into an easy rhythm. Every day, Zorra cleaned the house and cooked a delicious dinner. Foods from his childhood-soups, stews, casseroles and pies. He didn't give her money for groceries, but she kept his refrigerator full. Every night she made love with him, sometimes it was playful and filled with wrestling and laughter. Sometimes it was quick and satisfying. But most often it was that slow, spiritual union that he'd never experienced with any other woman.She didn't elaborate and somehow Rob knew she didn't want him to question her further.Maybe there is a clue in her tote bag. His mind prodded him. More and more his thoughts traveled to that forbidden bag. You promised, his heart chided. He stood up and cleared the table.But, instead of using the one in the hall, he headed to the bedroom. He paused behind the door, trying to look into the tote without touching it.He caught a whiff of musk. He stepped back and could no longer smell it. What is in there? He wondered, but as he stood there he saw Zorra peek her head around the door.She pounced on the bed and looked over her shoulder at him. The tote bag was quickly forgotten.But the bag loomed in his mind. He came home from work in the afternoon, hoping she would be out and he could look inside of it. She wasn't home, and the bag was gone. He drove around the neighborhood. He went to the local park and looked around hoping to see what she did during the day, but he couldn't find her.That evening, when he returned home he went into the bedroom to change clothes and spied the bag hanging on the door. He didn't even need to walk close to it before the smell of musk hit him.She turned and the look in her eyes frightened Rob. They held accusations and betrayal. His heart knew that look and begged him to leave the bag alone.They ate a silent dinner and he knew better then to try and make love. She lay far on her side of the bed, her body curled around herself. He lay on his back and stared at the bag.He could smell it. The musk of a wild animal-like when he visited the foxes in the zoo. When he was a kid he'd stand in front of the cage, his nose pressed between the thin wires and sniff. He had loved that smell. Until he did that on a school field trip and the other kids had seen him. ""Look at Rob! He likes stinky things because he's stinky. Gross."" Their voices still rang in his head sometimes. It bothered him that he let it bother him.He'd learned then to hide his pleasure in wild earthy things. He avoided the zoo and farms and stables. He became the proper urban male, seeking his entertainment in cultural events like concerts and theater. It was easy to avoid the wild in the City, and he rarely had a reason to leave it.He inhaled a deep breath in the silent room. The smell was overwhelming. How could Zorra pretend she noticed nothing? He started to get out of bed, determined to look in the bag. Zorra rolled towards him and grabbed his arm. Startled, he looked at her and saw the pleading in her eyes. He jerked his arm free from her hold and marched for the bag, his shoulders back and his resolve strong.He took it off the hook and ignored the yelp of fear he heard from the bed.He reached his hand in and touched fur.It was a red fox pelt. The smell of musk overwhelmed him. He looked at it in confusion and then at Zorra. She got out of the bed and crept over to him.She pulled the fox pelt from his hand and pushed it into her tote. Slinging it over her shoulder, she looked at Rob with glittering eyes.She stalked out the front door. It shut with a slam that closed off a portal to another world.You will be alone forever. And his heart knew it was true.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8544/1*dN4p28oJalKZB2w-ksuVsw.jpeg,https://medium.com/mythic-writes/vixen-a-short-shapeshifting-story-58cc3bc76886,fiction,c10e5bc13f12b5ebd95b56a402aedc735a0009240af058cb8e0ce367
9 Easy Tips To Make Your Blog Post More Readable,"A lot of us have a blog nowadays. While some of us might not have too much of an issue getting visitors to read the actual content, quite a lot of us are struggling to get people to actually read what we have written after so much research and hard work. The first step to doing that is to understand how to make your blog more readable.As writers, a lot of us only consider what we write.What we forget to consider is how our audience reads and what they want.Apart from the quality of our content, what are the little things that better their experience of reading on our blog?Based on my personal experience of blogging for almost 10 years, here are nine easy tips to make your blog more readable.This would be my first and foremost point.Use a lot of H2 and H3 sub-headings in your blog post.This creates sections of text instead of making your blog post seem like an academic research paper.Also, multiple sub-headings make your content seem more organized. It gives the reader a better user experience in terms of being able to skim content, but at the same time get the gist of what you have written.You'll have to forget the rule of English writing that you learned in school for this.Break your paragraphs into the smallest length possible, even if it means a paragraph has just one sentence.Just take a look above at how most of my paragraphs look. Almost none of them have more than three sentences. This makes it easier to scan and read.The human mind usually reads the first and last sentences of a paragraph when skim reading. But if there are only 1-2 sentences in each paragraph, then there's a higher chance of the reader actually reading the whole thing.Now that you have decided to keep your paragraphs short, let's take it up a notch.Make your sentences as short as possible. Use more periods (full-stops) than commas.This helps create more white space in your presentation and obviously helps with making your blog more readable.One of the easiest ways to write short sentences is to create bullet points.It keeps your sentences short and crisp.We all love reading lists as compared to normal blocks of text. No wonder listicle blog posts perform better than others.By now you know how important it is to make your content skimmable while ensuring that the reader takes away as much information as possible.Bold words/phrases do just that. It brings the attention of the reader to that set of word(s).Make sure you use this facility sparingly. If you just put everything in bold, you lose the whole point of why you are doing it in the first place.No matter how short or long your blog post, make sure you have a good mix of visuals included.By visuals, I don't just mean images. It can be videos, GIFs, charts, tables, etc. Anything that adds to the visual element of presentation.Your reader will definitely thank you for including something other than just a bunch of text.There are reasons why we don't write documents in comic sans or joker man.The readability goes down to zero and you also make sure that the reader never comes to your blog ever again.Going for a fancy font is a very novice mistake. When in doubt, just go with the default font your CMS provides, or just go with decent web font.Unless you are out to write Shakespearean literature, it is better to stick to the simplest of words.Irrespective of how educated your target audience might be, writing in plain language is the easiest to read.This way, not only are you opening up your writing to a larger audience, but you are also making sure that the existing audience has an easy journey while reading your content.Almost always use dark grey text on a white background.Anything else, just say no to. Even white text on a black background is strenuous to the eyes.For example, please never use yellow text on a purple background or something equally wild.",https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/0*XdDvHxNSC9NV5bL9.jpg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/9-easy-tips-to-make-your-blog-more-readable-f7ab9f34a99f,marketing,c53dbbb38d679a87f4e322115f3233c8b4ceac5310193caae8f90bf5
How Quitting Drinking Has Made Travel SO Much Better,"Anyone who knows me and my wife knows that we love to travel. This was one of our favorites drinking past-times. There is nothing that invites drinking without shame for three straight days than a trip to somewhere you've never been.I had my drinking routine down to a science also.Hit the airport up about 90 minutes to two hours before the flight to make sure I was good and sauced up before the plane took off.Next, I would drink one or maybe two rum and cokes on the plane to not lose that buzz and then proceed to drink basically from the time I landed to the time I left for the flight home.Vacations and traveling are the reasons that most people give themselves the license to drink more than they usually do, and I was no exception.I mean...what else do you do for a VACATION?It almost seems like drinking and vacations are synonymous. Can you really do one without the other?The answer is a resounding YES.Not only can you do it, but what I've learned in the past two years is that it has made traveling for me and my wife much better for a number of reasons.Alcohol is already one of the biggest money sucks of anything you will ever do in life.As shared in the Three HIDDEN Positive Financial Effects of Quitting Drinking, the amount of money that you will save from not drinking is enormous.Think about that.On a trip in which I was probably already spending $1500-2000, I would easily be in the $500-750 range on just alcohol. Now, instead of adding this surcharge to each of our trips, we are able to save that money for investment purposes for our future or use it to take even more vacations during the course of the year.Huge win.Since COVID put a bit of a kibosh on most international travel, we went on a Thanksgiving cross-country driving trip instead of our usual international one this year.Therefore, instead of traveling overseas for 10 days, we drove from Atlanta, GA to Austin, TX to visit my brother and visit a few cities on the way there and the way back.We hit up New Orleans, Houston, Little Rock, and Nashville.When we were drinking, the only thing we would plan for each city would be to make sure we found a bar to hit up during the day to play pool and drink. We might hit up a restaurant or two from time to time, but the majority of our time was spent in a pool hall drinking in a different city.As shared in, Why You Don't Need to An Alcoholic to Have a Drinking Problem, one of the issues I had was that if something didn't involve alcohol, I didn't want to do it.Therefore, a lot of the activities, like food and city tours, as well as cultural cooking classes, just didn't appeal to me because I couldn't drink as much as I would've liked during it.Now, I'm always super excited about those opportunities to learn new things and see a different side of a city that I wouldn't have ever experienced before.For me, this is the one that is probably the most precious.Before, when my wife and I traveled, we would have nights in which we figured we had fun according to our Instagram or Snapchat documentation, but I couldn't 100% say that I actually remembered any of it.Now that we're alcohol-conscious, I cherish the memories that we make each and every day, especially when we travel.And while the experience of seeing all the different pools halls and bars of the world was an interesting experience before, I'm excited that we are now able to truly take advantage of how much more the world has to offer instead.Thanks so much for reading.If you enjoyed reading, learned anything interesting, or know anyone who should read this, please feel free to recommend or write a response. I'm always excited to hear from others and learn.If interested in learning about how alcohol affects your life and ways to quit/moderate, please feel free to follow my Medium publication, AINYF, and/or join my newsletter group below for information and updates.Also, if looking for a social group that can help with your journey for alcohol-consciousness, please check out my mate, Janet Gourand, at World Without Wine, where she has a lot of great content to help.Thanks for reading again, as always, and remember...You never lose the battle until you stop fighting...",https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/1*KxKYIa_g5FW4iQ-c3FsuFQ.png,https://medium.com/ainyf-alcohol-is-not-your-friend/how-quitting-drinking-has-made-travel-so-much-better-eca0c16ee2b,travel,c544adb81d5af874032a83304fd7be73257219a82f6caec4ef17a24a
Weird and Macabre London,"My trip to Europe in the summer of 2019 was my first stab at truly traveling alone (save for a few days in Hamburg with my dad), and it was the first time I'd put together an itinerary myself.I'd be flying into London and would have two days and one night there before flying to Hamburg - not a lot of time. But after weeks of online searches and playing with alternate itineraries, I had a plan.No, I wouldn't make it to every place I would have liked to, but I'd be doing a lot of walking, crisscrossing the city to stop at every strange place I could fit into less than 48 hours.I arrived at Heathrow Airport early the first morning and took the train toward the center of London, passing what looked to my uneducated eye like the countryside - cute cottages and everything I associate with UK crime dramas.Soon enough though, I was in the city.My first stop was at the Natural History Museum at South Kensington, although, by the time I'd gotten there, I couldn't remember why I'd put it on my list...Nonetheless, I journeyed through some of my favorite exhibit areas, namely, the history of early man, the dinosaurs, and other prehistoric life. There were some cool things on display, but in truth, I got antsy quickly.Luckily, I then stumbled upon the attached Darwin Centre and remembered that this had been my intended destination all along. (I was more than a bit tired and addled from the overnight flight from New York.)The Darwin Centre is this giant concrete 'cocoon' that houses not only the museum's plant and insect collections but is also ""where scientists extract, process, sequence and analyse the DNA of plants and insects.""You ride up to the top of the cocoon in an elevator with a view of the main Victorian-era museum, and then walk a wide spiral path down to the bottom, passing each displayed collection and the windows behind which scientists work.I think bugs are sort of cool. They're these weird, generally tiny aliens that live alongside us here on earth. (Imagine if those things were just a bit bigger...) Fish, especially those that live deep in the ocean, strike me much the same way.The Darwin Centre was cool, but I made my way through it quickly - quicker than I felt like I 'should.'It was a nice little stop, but I didn't need all that much time. I couldn't help but come to the conclusion that I was and am done with these sorts of natural history museums for a while. (Can we just admit that they're all pretty similar?)My next stop was an entirely different kind of museum: The Postal Museum.No, I'm not a stamp collector, and yes, the idea of a museum on the history of some postal service sounds boring but I promise, it really was a cool stop.The museum itself houses 500 years of British postal history with all the antiques and displays you might expect, but the real draw is riding the 'Mail Rail.'This tiny little passenger train takes you past the ""unchanged station platforms"" and through the tiny railway tunnels ""that once kept the mail coursing through London for 22 hours every day.""As you ride the small train, videos covering the history of this old underground postal system are projected onto the tunnel walls. I loved it.After my postal stop, I took another train and walked to the Royal London Hospital Museum in Whitechapel, which is housed in the crypt of a nineteenth-century church.It wasn't a very big museum or particularly a must-see, but everyday artifacts from the past are always interesting, and I for one think medical history is endlessly fascinating.One of the museum's highlights is the skeleton of Joseph Merrick, the 'Elephant Man,' which is always on display. (I think I'll refrain from commenting on the appropriateness of this and leave that for you to decide.)Another big draw is the museum's showcase on forensic medicine that includes original material on the Whitechapel murders committed by 'Jack the Ripper.'Speaking of which, because I was staying nearby in Whitechapel, I was able to stop at one of the sites of the aforementioned murders on my way to drop things off at the Airbnb.Of course, there wasn't anything to actually see there, and I was certain the construction workers nearby thought I was nuts. Or lost. Or both.After stopping at the Airbnb and changing into something nicer, I needed a snack, and there was no way I was not going to go to a place called the Cereal Killer Cafe.I got a marshmallow cereal with ice cream and marshmallow milk, and it was perfectly deliciously childish.Unfortunately, the funky cafes (there were two in London) have closed this year thanks to COVID, but the owners do hope to reopen, and you can apparently still shop from them online.From the cafe, I walked to the V&A Museum of Childhood, which ""cares for the nation's National Collection of Childhood [with its] 33,000 objects and 61 archival collections that span 400 years, from 1600 to the present day.""Let's be honest, I had hoped it would all be a little odder, but once I was there, it became clear that kids were a big portion of the target audience. Ah well.Still, they did have toys from my childhood, and yes, there were several strange and disturbing dolls.After the (mostly boring) toys, I walked to The Last Tuesday Society, a darkly atmospheric cocktail bar and curiosity shop.My cocktail was unbelievably good, and the oddities just down the stairs in Wynd's Museum of Curiosities were exactly what I wanted to spend my evening being amused by.Hello, ""skeletons and scientific abnormalities, erotica and 'celebrity waste', shrunken heads and exotic souvenirs.""As you'll see below, there were at least two mummified 'mermaids' and something I think was meant to be a preserved alien.This was my favorite stop of the day, and yes, I will be visiting all possible curiosity shops in the future, particularly those with attached cocktail bars.On my second and last day in London, I wanted to do as much as possible before heading to the airport to fly to Hamburg.But first, I was bound for my most highly anticipated stop - the True Crime Museum in Hastings, a bit South of London.Although I spent no time in Hastings besides at the museum, by all appearances it was a very cute seaside town that I wouldn't mind visiting again.Okay, so the True Crime Museum wasn't as big as I had hoped. Still, it had cool exhibits and was absolutely worth the visit.Yes, it was morbid. No doubt some people would question the appropriateness of display prison-made weapons, a lethal injection bed, the bathtub someone was killed in, and so on.I am not one of those people.I visited each of the exhibits on forensics, gangsters, specific killers, 'Jack the Ripper,' and so on, and then I sat in the ""cinema cave,"" to watch clips from interviews with some of the most notorious serial killers in history.I'm hoping, given the current popularity of true crime that they'll eventually expand their museum for my future visiting pleasure.From Hastings, I caught a train back into the center of London, and my first stop back in the city was in some ways the earlier history version of my previous true crime destination.The Clink Prison, now a museum, dates all the way back to 1144. It was the oldest and most notorious prison in England and is where calling prison 'the clink' comes from.I wouldn't call The Clink Prison Museum a must-see attraction, but it was relatively interesting as a walk through horrible criminal 'justice' history and as a showcase of all sorts of old torture devices.(Don't worry; I didn't include any torture device pictures here.)From the Clink, the walk to my final London attraction took me by Borough Market and past London Bridge, which I must say is the most boring bridge I have ever seen.My last stop in London was the London Mithraeum, the remains of a Roman Temple of Mithras found in the early 1950s during post-war construction.It's now housed in a large modern space, along with a number of other artifacts, right where it was originally found.One of the highlights of a visit is ""the immersive, multisensory experience,"" a sound and light show meant to make you feel like you're visiting the temple as it once was.Someone who's interested in Mithraism, the Roman mystery religion, would surely love the place. My dad would probably be into it.Admittedly, it isn't something I'd go out of my way to see, but as an on-my-way to stop to the train back to the airport, it worked out well.One of the underappreciated aspects of traveling solo is not just the ability to go do and see whatever you feel like, but also the requirement that you figure out what that might be.As I planned my trip, I was consistently torn between what I felt I was 'supposed' to do and what I wanted to do, and I often had a hard time distinguishing between the two.If I were to plan some sort of trip today, I think I'd find it a little bit easier, in part because of having had to make the choices on this one.At the end of the day, this trip to London wasn't just a good time. It also gave me valuable insights into how I like to travel and what I'm really into.(I think we can tell I'm all about hitting those strange, historical, and potentially morbid stops. I'm also going to be constantly in motion!)Sign up for our new newsletter to stay informed with up-to-date curations from our editors:👇",https://miro.medium.com/max/8064/1*WCqrxb2peSt2ijw9MXa1qw.jpeg,https://medium.com/world-travelers-blog/weird-and-macabre-london-e1527f2ff510,travel,c51134c4510a67d3fc3078bbf09ee5496ed98f217451165630a575ef

Three White Women Erased 200 Years of Chinese Culture With Their $425 Neon Mahjong Sets,"Click. Click. Click.That's the sound of Chinese tradition being played across generations, a game that grandkids can play with their grandparents. A game passed down from their ancestors and their ancestors before them. The swooshing of the tiles on the velvety green table is mesmerizing, as are the hands doing the swooshing.Mahjong is a Chinese game. But more importantly, it's a game filled with Chinese heritage and culture. Not many games have stood the test of time like Mahjong. Created in the 1800s and originating from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), it's an elegant game of tradition, cycles, and strategy.As players stack, discard and collect tiles for their sets, there is a certain ebb and flow to the game, and one can't help but be mesmerized by the poetic nature of the game. The game appears rather quick-paced and there isn't time to think - but if you're well versed, you know that the game is about give and take. You can't be afraid to take what you need but you also need to know when to give.The tiles themselves have significant meaning, each etched and painted just right. The tiles have stood the test of time, remaining relatively unchanged for centuries, even when different countries adapted the game to their own cultures.That is until three white women from Dallas decided the tiles that originated from the Qing Dynasty weren't good enough for them.The Mahjong Line was created by three white women in Dallas in November of 2020. In the short two months since their grand opening, they have faced national backlash and even received threats. They have been accused of cultural appropriation, referred to as racist, colonizers, and modern-day versions of Columbus.The last time I checked, their original About Us page was taken down and replaced with a half-hearted apology. They have since shut down their comments section and their Facebook page has been deleted.Mahjong tiles have been redesigned over and over to suit the taste of other cultures, so how did The Mahjong Line manage to upset an entire race with their vision to modernize the tiles?While Mahjong is inherently a Chinese game - the American variation of Mahjong (also referred to as Mah Jongg) was adapted for America when Joseph Park Babcock introduced it to the United States in the 1920s. The American version uniquely differs from the Chinese version but the tiles used have remained largely unchanged from the original.It's important to point out that The Mahjong Line's intention was to modernize American Mah Jongg, not Chinese Mahjong.The design and symbolism of each Mahjong tile have important significance to the Chinese culture. The designs and colors are bold and meaningful. Typically, only three colors are used - red for luck, blue for the sky, and green for the earth. Each character and symbol is etched and painted on an ivory white tile.The founders of The Mahjong Line decided the traditional white tiles were too monochromatic and didn't ""come close to mirroring their style and personality."" They decided that the tiles needed a refresh to entice and modernize the game for new players.The Mahjong Line has five sets of designs, which you can choose based on a quick seven-question quiz (I'm a Minimal Gal myself).The Minimal Line: Neon Purple ReleaseThe Minimal Line: Kelly Green ReleaseThe Minimal Line: Ceylon Blue ReleaseThe Botanical Line: Paris Pink ReleaseThe Cheeky Line: Skylight Blue ReleaseThe tiles vastly differed from the Chinese originals. Rather than painted on ivory white tiles, the vibrancy of each stroke, symbol, and character was lost in garishly neon backdrops.The redesigns did not go over well.The Mahjong Line's were priced astronomically high, ranging from $325 to $425. One quick browse on Amazon of the most featured Mahjong sets indicates a price of $100 to $200, some even less. If their purpose was to introduce American Mahjong to new players and make it more accessible, they missed the mark with the price alone.Thousands of people have lost their jobs and the entire world is currently in an economic downfall. Nobody is going to buy a $425 Mahjong set when they can spend that money on rent and keep a roof over their heads for at least one more month.Whether it's the American version, the Japanese version, or otherwise, Mahjong is inherently Chinese. When you're trying to sell something that you have no cultural background in, the right thing to do is to pay homage to its origins. A deep history into the game wasn't necessary, a simple acknowledgment that Mahjong originated from China probably would have been good enough. Most times, it's enough that we're seen.The Mahjong Line didn't do that.Instead, they erased China's origins from the game entirely. There was no mention of China or the Qing Dynasty but rather they focused on the American history of Mahjong. Given that their intent was to bring back American Mah Jongg, the erasure of China's history could have been ignored if they didn't go on to insult it.The Mahjong Line's website, redesign of the tiles, and pricing strategy were problematic but they were not the reasons for the backlash and accusations of cultural appropriation - it was their copy.Since the launch of The Mahjong Line, the only copy on their website is their apology. Fortunately, we have Twitter as our archival resource.Here are snippets of their original website copy.And one from Paper City magazine:Intentional or not, every word in their copy insulted the aesthetics of the Chinese tiles.Mahjong tiles have been reinvented, redesigned, and transformed into cards. The Japanese have several designs of their own.Their entire story and business idea revolved around insulting and belittling the Chinese origin of Mahjong - boring, confusing, embarrassing, and out of date.It wasn't just the fact that they erased the very origin of the game they loved, it was the fact that they felt the need to condemn it to make their product look better. Every word in their copy had an air of superiority in it. So while their purpose may have been driven from a place of appreciation, their story and words stemmed from a place of appropriation.After initially being called out, The Mahjong Line added a throwaway line to acknowledge Mahjong's Chinese origins. It was even more insulting than the erasure of it in the first place.After this abominable excuse of a fix and even further ridicule from the public and news media, they've taken down all copy and replaced it with a sorry-not-sorry apology.They've shut down comments even when they said they were open to criticism. It doesn't seem like they'll be opening them up any time soon.Across all news platforms and social media, one thing was apparent - the three women who founded the company are white.The reference to their whiteness and lack of Chinese heritage may have been for more clicks but the question remains - does it matter that they were white? If the founders were of Chinese, Black, or of Hispanic descent, with the same copy and design, would they have been accused of cultural appropriation? Would we refer to them as daring innovators instead of privileged and racist?Mahjong has been reinvented and modified to suit American players before and now The Mahjong Line wanted to reinvent it to suit millennials. Was that so wrong because they happened to be white?While it could be perceived that white people have a superiority complex and this was yet another example of white-washing another culture's tradition, I don't believe race is an issue in this case. Race is always an emotionally charged subject regardless of which cultures are involved. I personally don't care that these were three white women trying to redesign Mahjong tiles. I care that, in order to sell their business idea, they felt the need to insult the culture that created it.Theresa Christine Johnson said it best in her article, Cultural Appropriation Through Blanding: Where The Mahjong Line Went Wrong:The reinvention of something that has a rich and historical past is brave and innovative if done properly. Prepare to face a bombardment of accusations and backlash if done wrong.The Mahjong Line could have been successful if they spent some time researching the origins of the product they were trying to change, hired cultural experts, and have professional (and culturally sensitive)copywriters edit their website (although they might have).This isn't a story about three white women trying to redesign Mahjong tiles. It's about three women insulting another culture's origins to make a buck (or in this case, $425).Their words indicated nothing but embarrassment and disrespect for the Chinese culture. If you have no cultural heritage or experience in the product or idea you're trying to change, the way to success isn't to erase or insult the culture that your product is trying to emulate.The way to successfully redesign a product that is rich in culture and history is to do some research and hire a damn good copywriter.",https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*TLOBy0rsOgECC8cw,https://medium.com/better-marketing/three-white-women-erased-200-years-of-chinese-culture-with-their-425-neon-mahjong-sets-a9dde5ee6e6a,marketing,ca7fcb4cd84d11e273a0f93cbeadd2ffffde94d953589a8931c01961
4 Mental Habits of Highly Productive People,"Becoming more productive isn't about more productivity hacks or yet another time management framework.In fact, those things are usually distractions from adressing the real issues with productivity. Because here's what most people trying to be more productive miss:In particular, it's your mental habits that will determine your ability to consistently stay focused and do your best work.If you're ready to get serious about becoming more productive, work to cultivate these four mental habits.Energy is the currency of motivation.Most of the productivity and habit building advice you hear offers tips and tricks for better time management. With promises of making you more efficient in your work, they suggest all sorts of techniques and strategies for carving up and dividing your day to manage your time better.But here's the thing:You can have all the time in the world but if you're doing things that drain you of energy, you're not going to feel motivated.Luckily, the reverse is true: Even if your time is extremely limited, you can accomplish a tremendous amount with enough energy and enthusiasm.So forget about managing your time and learn how to manage your energy instead:A forcing function is a mechanism that forces you to take some kind of action. It's the antidote to inconsistent willpower or motivation.When a pop-up takes over your screen and asks if you want to save 50% on this month's newest styles, it forces you into one of two decisions - click the big green ""YES"" button or spend 3 minutes hunting for the tiny, barely-visible ""x"" to close out of the popup.Marketers and salespeople use forcing functions all the time to increase the odds that a potential customer becomes an actual customer. But forcing functions can be just as useful for personal productivity.Suppose I really wanted to get this article done by Monday, but I kept procrastinating on writing it. I could write a check for $100 and make it out to my buddy Todd, telling him that if I hadn't emailed him a completed draft of this article by Monday at 5:00 pm, he should immediately cash the check and buy himself something.That's a forcing function. By putting $100 dollars on the line, I'm forcing (or at least strongly encouraging) myself to follow through on my goals instead of getting distracted by short-term desires.They have the humility to realize that distractions are prevalent, motivation sometimes wanes, and in general, we're all a lot less disciplined than we'd like to be. So, instead of hoping for the best, they assume the worst and plan accordingly.Here are a few good examples of forcing functions you can use to improve your productivity:For better or for worse, the people we surround ourselves with impact us greatly. Highly motivated people use this to their advantage.In small, everyday interactions, you probably realize how much impact other people can have on your levels of motivation:But there's a bigger principle here:If you have to consistently interact with energy-draining people, you can't expect to feel energetic and enthusiastic on a regular basis. But, if you habitually interact with energy-giving people, you can't help but have some of their enthusiasm and motivation rub off on you.So be thoughtful about the people you choose to spend your time with:There's no better way to kill your motivation than beating yourself up after a failure or setback.People with chronically low motivation almost always have a habit of being harsh and judgmental with themselves after failures and mistakes:But being a jerk to yourself doesn't motivate you to do anything but be more of a jerk to yourself.Luckily, the reverse is also true:Highly motivated people aren't merely good at giving themselves energy and motivation - they're also skilled at maintaining their motivation, even in the face of setbacks.And the best way to preserve your energy and motivation in the face of failure or mistakes is to practice a little self-compassion:If you want to be consistently productive at a high level, you need to build the right mindset and mental habits:Thanks for reading,- Nick",https://miro.medium.com/max/8712/1*TCOV3hl_ak6PRo1DTWmaKA.jpeg,https://medium.com/personal-growth/4-mental-habits-of-highly-productive-people-cd37c474f6cc,productivity,d07cdb13fed822a898ab3a71d83c6bc6ef79db6bb9464fcc1a540feb
How Do I Push Myself to Learn New Things Everyday?,"Our brain is like a muscle, you should always train it in order to make it stronger. Learning is a part of this process, it makes the brain active and energized. As a human being, you need to always spend some of your daily time learning new things. I know it's not easy to be disciplined and motivated every day. However, if you know your goals and your purpose in life, you will definitely try to push yourself into learning and make it a habit because it has a lot of benefits and it's related to your success.In this article, I will share with you some of the tips that I follow to push myself into learning every day. Let's get right into it.In my situation, I knew that learning is the only way to improve myself. It helps me to achieve my goals and has a lot of benefits to my personality. Last year, I started learning web development to become a web developer. So I had to learn some technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many more. Without learning every day, my goal of becoming a web developer cannot happen, especially when the web development industry is changing a lot and new technologies are coming. So I will have to learn them in order to be updated.What I wanted to say here is that you should have a strong reason or goal if you want to push yourself into the habit of learning every day. In my case, it was my goal of becoming a web developer which requires learning a lot. Also, I knew the benefits of learning and the impact it will keep on my personality.I try to organize myself by planning times of learning throughout the day. I always think of the bad aspect of useless stuff such as playing video games or watching movies all the time, which will never get me to my goals. So try to keep yourself far from distractions as much as you can.I also encourage you to make the place where you learn, more organized and far from tools of distraction such as your phone for example. This will increase your productivity and make you more energized.The extra hours in the morning have a lot to offer, particularly if you're looking to improve your lifestyle. You can put that morning time into learning, early rising also boosts your creativity, productivity, and mindset during the day, so no task feels daunting.I encourage you to have a morning routine where you learn new things for the day. I do that and it has a lot of benefits for my mental and physical health. You can get more done while others are sleeping, that's what successful people do.One of the tips to get things done is by trying to reward yourself. I do it almost every day, I try to reward myself if I get things done. For example, if I learned something new related to my field, I will have the ability to play a video game. This encourages me to get more things done in order to reward myself a lot. It's a good strategy to try if you want to push yourself to do your daily tasks.Learning new things has its own sets of perks which brings success and helps you become a better version of yourself. So think about your goals before trying to spend your time on useless stuff.Thank you for reading this article, I hope you found it useful.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8480/0*l5NEzGUhb_jBCAkd,https://medium.com/dev-genius/how-do-i-push-myself-to-learn-new-things-everyday-9051d8255d51,productivity,d45d917558a2597b53d067718bf4edd3e86b327b42917516256d2add
Run for Your Life,"Today...""Dani, wake up!"" I shook her shoulder. Her makeshift bed of leaves and pine needles rustled underneath. The forest cast an ominous pitch black, too late at night for fireflies, too early for even the slightest hint of dawn.The growling and hissing were getting louder, closer. We needed to hurry.""What? What happened?"" Her words sounded raspy and lost. I couldn't see her face in the darkness.My heart pounded, threatening to shatter a rib. I swiveled my head toward the advancing din, then back to Dani. ""We have to go now. Leave everything. I - """"I hear them, too."" She gasped and bolted up. ""They found us.""I grabbed her trembling hand, and we sprinted away from the sound.Yesterday morning...Dr. Zimmer smiled at Dani and me from behind his expansive mahogany desk. ""Do you have any questions?""Dani and I shook our heads. I had no questions. I only wished to fall asleep quickly and slumber through the night, something I'd never done in my thirty-nine years. Dani, too. We were two peas in an insomniac's pod. ""We're ready.""""This is a breakthrough,"" Zimmer said. ""You're lucky to be among the first hundred to receive the cure. The company won't be able to gear up for mass production for another year, so the first individuals who get the treatment all live within a short drive from their Bangor headquarters. From tonight forward, your insomnia will be no more.""""It's just one shot?"" Dani asked. She ran her finger along the edges of the pamphlet Dr. Zimmer had provided us.""Yes. We're modifying a single gene with an RNA-encoded virus, so it only requires one dose.""""And the side effects?""""None, unless you consider a good night's sleep a side effect. I'm giving myself a shot, too. Frankly, I can't wait to get off Ambien.""The virus inserts an ordinary house cat's gene, the gene that gives cats the ability to sleep anywhere, anytime. Cats' genetic code was published in 2007; it took twenty years to research and develop this cure."" Zimmer flattened his palms together, tilted his head, and pressed them to his cheek, pantomiming sleep. ""Cats are the world's best sleepers.""Zimmer brought over a tray of three syringes with Lightz Pharmaceuticals stamped in blue, wiped our arms with alcohol swabs, and injected Dani and me. He did the same to himself.""What do we need to do?"" Dani asked.""Nothing. When you want to sleep, pull your blanket up and close your eyes.""""People actually fall asleep that easily?""""They do. And you will, too.""Today...Simultaneously, we clicked on our flashlights. It would do no good if Dani or I collided with a tree and one of us had to carry the other. I wasn't worried we'd give our location away. If we could hear them, they'd already zeroed in on us, and besides, they could see in the dark, and we couldn't. Judging from the volume, there were hundreds.We zigzagged around oak and pine trees, ducking to avoid low-hanging branches and shifting our gaze from in front of us to below, so we didn't trip on a rock or root. Before leaving our house, I hadn't had time to retrieve my compass, so for all I knew we could have been circling back to our doom.I shivered in the chilled October air.Several trees away, an owl hooted. I envied creatures that could fly.Our only hope was to outrun them. We were built for marathons; they for sprints. If we could keep ahead, they'd eventually tire or become bored. The question was, how long would that take?My left foot landed on a dry twig that snapped loudly. We ran faster.Surviving meant staying on the move, hiding in the woods, sleeping in shifts, hoping that we didn't wake to each other's screams as their razor-sharp claws and teeth shredded us.Baleful hissing filled the still air.I detected the burnt-egg stink of a paper mill. We altered course toward it. The racket would work in our favor, assuming we made it there. The din of wood chippers and electric saws would provide acoustic camouflage, and the predators might even be afraid of the noise. The stench could mask our scent, too. The paper mill was both our best, and only, hope.""Is it far?"" Dani asked, her words slurred. I shined my flashlight at her droopy eyes.""I don't know."" I wrapped my arm around her waist and bore most of her weight. Our advance slowed. Dani looked like she was in danger of falling asleep.""Will we make it?"" She leaned into me.Lying takes energy, of which I had little left. ""I'm not sure,"" I said.Dani snored, standing up while we continued toward the paper mill. We stumbled forward toward the mill like children tied together in a three-legged race.Last night...My phone's Fur Elise ringtone roused me from a sound sleep at 2:15 a.m., a time I would previously have been staring at the ceiling. But I was fast asleep, thanks to Lightz's creation.""Who's there?""Zimmer spoke with staccato urgency. ""Get out! Run! They're coming.""""Who's coming?""""They're about to break into my house.""""I don't understand.""""Cats. It's the gene! They see us as intruder cats who have invaded their territory.""",https://miro.medium.com/max/6912/1*F44bllXfQB1QCT-V1LqLJw.jpeg,https://medium.com/parson-and-the-chanticleer/run-for-your-life-1bbf76dc49ba,fiction,d174ecec9984ef6a510a44511ea842f2e948a49de1f5a11df42bf133
Did 'Death of the Outsider' Undermine Daud's Character?,"From a veteran assassin to an unsung saviour of the Empire, Daud, the conflicted anti-hero of the Dishonored franchise (2012-2017), stands out as the series' most complex and enthralling character.However, his inclusion and role in the final DLC, Dishonored: Death of the Outsider raises concerns pertaining to whether this somehow undermined the cathartic resolution to his redemption storyline achieved during the first game and its subsequent DLCs.Daud was first introduced in Dishonored as a ruthless and highly-skilled mercenary heading a band of assassins known as the Whalers, typically hired by members of Dunwall's scheming aristocracy.However, Daud's character fundamentally changes once he assassinates Empress Jessamine Kaldwin and kidnaps her daughter, Emily, a treasonous act that acted as the catalyst for the Empire's plunge into disorder and tyranny.As the above passage indicates, Daud felt immensely responsible for his role in the murder of an innocent woman and in sparking the near-fatal collapse of the Empire, even embarking on a perilous quest to save the new Empress Emily from a further heinous plot to steal the throne.The next time the player meets Daud is 15 years later in DOTO after he has returned to Dunwall from exile a bitter and dying old man. This time around he's hellbent on retrieving a fabled sacred weapon he intends to use to kill the series' enigmatic Machiavellian deity, the Outsider, a figure charged with ruling over a vast existential purgatory called the Void.Daud curses the Outsider, the 'black-eyed bastard,' as the true being responsible for all the evils to befall the world, only gifting people with his Mark, including himself, to enable them to enact his own twisted agenda on the world.This radical departure from Daud's earlier reconciliation with his past actions signifies that he either never changed or was not capable of great change to begin with.If anything, he reverted to his previous volatile behaviour by triggering another possible doomsday scenario following his successful defeat of the Outsider, leaving the fate of the universe hanging in the balance more than ever before.Although Daud convinced himself of the legitimacy of his mission, he evidently regressed from accepting full ownership to deflecting responsibility for his actions by reducing his own status to that of another mere victim, or 'puppet' of the Outsider.His noble undertaking to slay the Outsider subsequently resembles little more than a misguided crusade for heroism, a narcissistic ploy conceived by an idle killer to shift the blame and absolve himself of his past transgressions.This controversial evolution, or rather, devolution of Daud's character ultimately echoes the recurring theme of the series, concerning the freedom of choice.Daud's sole justification for killing the Outsider rests on his belief that the Outsider bestows his powers to select people in order to tempt them into leading a destructive and criminal existence.However, considering that characters such as Corvo and Emily use their gifts to fight corruption and restore order to the Empire, this largely discredits Daud's argument that all people are blameless, unknowing playing pieces in the Outsider's grand plan.After all, it was the Outsider who approached Daud following his murder of the Empress, offering him the name of Emily's would-be killer so that he could find and defeat her, redeeming himself for killing Emily's mother in the process, before further informing him that he could still shape how his story would end.While the Outsider is an untrustworthy figure, Daud's entire basis for resenting him rests largely on a stubborn refusal to confront his own sins and morbid passion for killing, rather than to free others from the Outsider's corrupting influence.Whether a conscious decision to explore the character in an alternative manner or simply a gratuitous gesture to please the fanbase, Daud's inclusion and portrayal in DOTO is undoubtedly problematic.It denies players the full satisfaction of Daud's redemption and self-discovery story arc established during earlier games by implicating him as an inherently flawed character, which he may well be. Nevertheless, this exposure and return to his old ways make Daud's most notable character transformation feel trivial and arbitrary in retrospect.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*4qQgcHiJ_77YgH7AGLOulw.png,https://medium.com/super-jump/did-death-of-the-outsider-undermine-daud-s-character-c55db43428ab,fiction,d191f39823446aa855861997553f432fbc0da8eff41856fb79c2fed3
"How I Made $5,000 in One Week From Ghostwriting","After years of writing in my journal and my notes app, I finally decided to take my writing seriously. I had done a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering, but always knew I wanted to do something creative. A master's in film didn't help me as much, I was feeling discouraged so I set out to do some research.How can I make enough money to avoid my parents being disappointed in my choice to not pursue engineering as a career? Is there a way to make writing more lucrative? There were quite a few options that came up, one of which was ghostwriting.Ghostwriting can be incredibly hard to get into. I am a self-published author of two books, but even with that, it's hard to get into the industry without a certain level of experience. That is until I came across a site called Upwork.Many of you might have heard of it, and if you haven't and are looking for a place to make money from ghostwriting books, this is a good place to start. At first, I was a bit skeptical, as there were quite a few ""too good to be true"" jobs, but you can choose which ones are verified by the site which makes things a lot easier.I spent a few hours searching for jobs I knew I could write. At this point, I had absolutely no ghostwriting experience. I paid around $3 to buy ""connects,"" which are like coins for applying for jobs. I applied for some jobs, the applications took me on average five minutes to complete, and hoped for the best.Here are some tips for applying:This will allow you to tailor your application to the job and dramatically increase your chances. Some clients add words like Banana 123, just to make sure the applicants have read through the job details. Make sure to address every single one of their requirements.When an advertiser receives your application, they are only able to see the first few lines. They receive many applications, especially if the job is for $5,000 and above. They might decide to open your application but only if you write something in the first line that's impossible to ignore. It could be something silly, a joke, but the first line must grab their attention.After adding in eye-catching first lines, make sure the next lines are polite. Tell them why you enjoy this kind of writing and why you'd be a better candidate than any of the other applicants.Please, thank you, and have a good day really does go a long way. Even if you don't have any experience, showing enthusiasm for the subject and being very willing to take directions can make a big difference.The advertiser would find it easier to communicate with someone polite, than someone rude and abrupt. Sometimes they prefer inexperienced writers as these writers are adaptable, and can follow directions easily.While it might be easy to ask for $20,000 for a 20,000-word book, it's usually better to meet in the middle. The job advertiser will have a budget specified for the job. If it's $5,000- $7,000, I'd recommend going for $6,000, although $5,000 with a very good proposal would further increase your chances.I did all of the above for all my applications, and about seven hours later I heard back from a job advertiser! I had been using Upwork for less than 48 hours! It was for a self-help book and the advertisement was $5,000-$7,000. I went for the lower end of the scale.She liked my opening line and my proposal so much that she gave me the job immediately. She also activated my milestone after two days which meant I got paid before finishing the book. Upwork does take a small service fee but I was excited to have made so much money in such a short period of time, and from what I love doing!The book was around 10,000 words. It took me a week to write and she was very happy with it. I now have an established working relationship with her.Ghostwriting and making money can be tough, but it's all about how you market yourself. If you do this well, your chances will dramatically increase. You'll make long-lasting connections, and you'll be making money in no time.",https://miro.medium.com/max/8000/1*bdnLd0sFs20QyvfD581v6A.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-i-made-5-000-in-one-week-from-ghostwriting-89799d3437f9,marketing,d463a5b2f47127092faa1b79a825ac6467fc89e7bcdd16db0fdf1243
"A Love Letter to Washington, D.C.","I felt a deep sadness on Wednesday when rioters attacked the Capitol. Sadness for the country, sadness for my fellow citizens, and sadness for the city that I love.I first visited Washington, D.C. when I was in 8th grade for the stereotypical tourist trip. I think maybe I initially wanted to adopt the aloof, unimpressed, too-cool-for-school teenager demeanor, but I just freaking loved it and quickly abandoned that charade. I loved the museums, the monuments, the history, and the light. Have you noticed how light and clean the city is compared to many other big cities? Eventually I figured out that the light comes from the wide streets, the wide sidewalks, and the height limits on buildings. But that light has never failed to strike me.I returned when I was 18 for college. I refused to attend a university with the typical college campus. I adored that the George Washington University campus blended into the city - the possibility of disappearing into the hustle and bustle of daily life was very appealing. I still find the anonymity of the city to be delightful, but I also started to identify the smallness of the city.You can walk from one side of the city to another relatively easily. It's not that big and even as an eighteen year-old I felt like I could get my arms around it. I learned about the fun local restaurant spots, the secret holes-in-the-wall, the metro lines and stops to avoid, the best bus lines, and the good parks. I spent countless nights in college walking up and down the mall. The monuments and the mall are extraordinary in all seasons, but my favorite is the winter - especially in the snow. There is nothing like the silence and solitude on the paths on either side of the reflecting pool in the middle of a blizzard.Did you know that the best time to visit the Lincoln is mid-week, in winter, at night? There are always people there, it's a universal rule I think, but that's when it's quietest. Did you know that during summer nights, bats patrol the skies above the reflecting pool protecting tourists from mosquitoes? Did you know that in October, just before the first real frost, giant, truly terrifying spiders build webs across the wreaths above the pillars in the World War II monuments? You won't see them during the day, you have to go at night. Then you won't sleep for a week.There is a natural comradery of D.C. locals - either born and raised, or adopted Washingtonians - especially in their shared annoyance with tourists. April - July are the worst. You can't walk down sidewalks without having to step around groups decked out in the Washington, D.C., FBI, CIA, or American Flag sweatshirts and hats that are available for purchase on every corner. You can tell who is a local by how they use escalators. Unless you want to get yelled at, please, please walk on the left, stand on the right. Don't block commuters trying to get to work, especially during rush hour.And yet, there is something truly magical that so many people want to see the sights in my backyard. After many years of landing at National Airport, I learned which side of the plane to look out of to see the Washington Monument. If you are lucky enough to get the right flight plan, flying right next to the monument is nothing short of extraordinary. I get chills every time.Driving up the GW Parkway in Virginia is one of the most beautiful drives. The views of the Capitol, the Lincoln, the Jefferson, and the Washington Monuments is the stuff postcards were designed to capture. Especially in the spring, when the dogwoods and tulips are in bloom. It almost looks fake.I've left the city again and again. I get annoyed with the suffocating summers, or I start to get twitchy and want to explore someplace new. But I keep coming back. Again, and again, and again. I've lived here longer as an adult than anywhere else. It's home.I'm very aware that the city often falls short of this lofty vision. Homelessness is a constant problem, exacerbated by the increasing gentrification within the city limits. The gentrification is an issue within itself, as it displaces families, erases local history and culture, and pushes out the individuals that have lived in the city for generations. Segregation is still alive and well. The city is expensive, theater culture has been slow to develop, and the lack of statehood is wildly unfair. There is a certain swampiness of the political culture and a vibe that can be nauseating at times.But I love that it has so much potential. These extraordinary symbols of democratic values flank the mall and stand as bookends to the city, reminding all citizens and visitors of what the country could be and should be. The opening line of the U.S. Constitution states, ""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union..."" This line doesn't mean that the Union was perfect when it was created, but rather that there should be an ongoing effort to make it better. That's what Washington, D.C. means to me.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2130/1*C3YTZ_fO4qWq7t6Zkct3Bw.jpeg,https://lmchervinsky.medium.com/a-love-letter-to-washington-d-c-801db30567d4,travel,d04197041ffd25dbf727cef80d3c28e814a96999c5c3b6389e463edb
3 Reasons Adversity Enhances Your Success and How You Can Use It to Achieve More,"Think about the words we use to describe continued achievement. Upward movement. Increased momentum. Forward progress. What these phrases have in common is that they can all be applied to science - and success.Consider Newton's first law of motion. It states that ""an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.""I've never been a science gal (teaching literature has been my life's work), but the lesson I interpret from this law is that doing the things you normally do, such as mindlessly performing daily routines and using the same ""trusty"" toolbox of strategies over and over again, makes you an ""object at rest."" Not a good thing if you're looking to attain the ""upward movement"" you want in your area of focus.Let's say you're not at rest. You are an ""object in motion,"" moving along ""at the same speed and in the same direction"" as always. If you're already accomplishing a lot, then your ""same direction"" is a good one. But what about moving in this positive direction ""at the same speed"" as always? Is that a good thing? I'm pretty sure it is if your success is skyrocketing at the speed of light, and if this is you, don't change a thing. Stop reading. You've found the secret to unparalleled progress.However, if you are reading this article, I'm assuming your direction or speed towards your goals is not exactly what you're hoping for. So the question is, how do you change this?You need the ""unbalanced force"" Newton mentions, the one he states is the only thing that forces you into movement and changes your direction, speed, or both. The problem is the phrase ""unbalanced force"" is scary. We crave balance. It makes us feel safe. Secure. Comfortable. Unfortunately, it also keeps us ""at rest."" The fact is we need this imbalance to move us in the right direction at the increased pace we desire.And this ""unbalanced force"" we need to achieve more is known by a common name: adversity. Failure. Stagnation. Disappointment. Sadly enough, these three things are only a few of the many ways life slaps us in the face. But the ""good news"" is the ""unbalanced force"" of adversity is everywhere.We experience it in some way every single day, whether it's a failed project, a rejected proposal, a financial crisis, or a personal or professional conflict. The reality is our world will never truly be free of some form of adversity.So perhaps we should consider Newton's law as a metaphor for life, one worthy of greater consideration. We should embrace this imbalance he speaks of and makes it work for us, not against us. If we use adversity to our advantage, it can make us more powerful than ever before.And yes, it's hard to do this. When struggles surround us, we want to quit. We want to hide, so we can be ""at rest"" again. But giving in to these thoughts is the most poisonous form of self-sabotage.Steven Covey, the famed author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, states ""just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition - such as lifting weights - we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity.""So those of you like me who want success have some serious weightlifting to do. We have to use the ""opposition"" and pressure of adversity to become stronger individuals, people whose potential to reach our greatest aspirations is multiplied. And the truth is by refusing to run from the pressure adversity exerts on us we can drastically increase our forward movement towards our dreamsHere's why and how.If we remain steadfast and undeterred, continuing to work on our goals in spite of the obstacles we face, our belief in our own power to overcome trouble increases. Think of the boldest, most dramatic life changes you've embarked on. I'll wager that many of them came after you persevered and managed to overcome some conflict in your life.For example, think of people who have survived tragedies, life-threatening illnesses, or near-death experiences. Their ability to endure and move past these situations have made them embrace life in an exponentially more positive way.One notable example is the famed filmmaker Oliver Stone. Stone's first novel was spurned by publishers, and when he eventually found a publisher, the novel failed to find success. He then moved to Vietnam to teach English, and soon after, he enlisted in the United States Army to fight in the Vietnam War. His bravery in combat earned him two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star.After the war, Stone enrolled in cinema school and worked under legendary director Martin Scorsese. The combination of the traumatic life experiences he gained in war and the ability to endure its unfathomable horrors gave him both the material and fortitude to produce award-winning movies such as Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July.The more you fight back against the hurdles life throws your way, the more success you will be capable of. This is due to the fact that with each barrier you move past, the feeling of ""I did this. I can do ________too"" increases. As a result, you are more courageous and resilient when the next stumbling block presents itself. And courage and resilience are the backbone of growth, productivity, and prosperity.So accept that there will be continuous hardships towards the destinations you are working towards and make a commitment to yourself to be undaunted by this fact. Know that eventually, your persistence will pay off, and when it does (even in small ways), the byproducts of this struggle will be self-assurance, tenacity, and a growing ability to take the risks required to achieve your goals.When we face extremely important situations where our body, financial status, psychological health, or loved ones are at risk of harm, we are forced to act. None of us want to see ourselves, the things we have worked for, or the people we care about suffer.As a result, our mind is flooded with thoughts. What did we do wrong that created these complications? How can we avoid doing them again? What immediate measures or ""damage control"" can we undertake to lessen the consequences of our previous actions?By asking ourselves these questions, we gain new insights that will help us improve our present and future circumstances. Entrepreneur agrees, stating that ""adversity is a great teacher."" And being a teacher myself, I can assure you knowledge is one of the quickest ways to go further faster.The publication gives examples of some valuable questions our struggles and failures reward us with. When we encounter difficult situations or setbacks, we begin to ponder many things: our planning and preparations, our execution, and our efforts concerning the reasons for our misfortunes. As a result of this deliberation, we then seek solutions through more introspection, the counsel of others, and other sources of knowledge we feel may help us resolve the issue at hand.When the solution to our difficulties is found, we make a deliberate decision to never again make the same bad choices. This habit of continuously examining the error of our ways and changing our courses of action is the fundamental strategy the world's most successful people use to acquire phenomenal accomplishments.American author Robert Collier summarizes the benefits of adversity in its connection to success when he states, ""In every adversity there lies the seed of an equivalent advantage. In every defeat is a lesson showing you how to win the victory next time.""When you encounter problems that hinder your happiness or the fulfillment of your wishes, analyze the problems themselves. Find the origins of your troubles and work from there. For example, what was the first misstep? What thoughts or actions led you to make this mistake? Are there actions that occurred after the initial mistake that made the problem increase in magnitude? If the problem is inescapable, what are ways you can best minimize its backlash? In the future, what actions and mindsets must you implement to make sure the errors do not repeat themselves?Understand that in most of these situations, you will not have all the answers you seek. So consults experts or people who have faced the same dilemmas. Find books on the subject. Do online research. Make a plan and then commit to it so the likelihood of repeated mistakes is minimized or erased.If we study the way we've overcome past failures or hardships in life, a common pattern usually emerges, a repeated trait, plan, or action that allowed us to rise above our challenges.This common trait could be risk-taking, researching, utilizing repeated contacts or resources for help, or any other number of things. Look back at your own history of adversity and ask yourself what recurring things you did well that helped you overcome the trials you faced. Your talents are unique, and utilizing your strongest personal traits is the easiest way to prevail over the present and future hardships that threaten to derail your success.Leaderonomics cites the advice of Robert Caplan, author of the book What You're Really Meant to Do: A Roadmap for Reaching Your True Potential, who states most people are ignorant of their own strengths and that ""people should take ownership of assessing themselves"" in order to become more successful.Realize that there is no one ""right"" way for everyone to triumph over hardship. However, there is a right way for you to fight your battles and that is to use the weapons you are most skilled with. If you are analytical, sitting down with the facts and finding answers in a logical and methodical way may work best for you. If you are creative, brainstorming innovative ways or approaches to difficulties may help you find the best course of action to take. If you have great people skills, utilizing the people around you may be the way to most effectively resolve troublesome situations.If you are unsure of exactly what your strengths may be, there are many tests that can help you figure out the answer. For example, this free test is one that can help you decipher your greatest assets.Author Roy T. Bennett states the value of adversity best when he says ""Your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life. Keep going. Tough situations build strong people in the end.""And though we certainly don't relish the thought of another struggle coming our way, at least we know it can bring about something positive. After all, we don't want to be ""objects at rest."" We want to be in motion, moving confidently, and wisely towards the life we envision. Adversity gives us that ability, even if there are a few tears in the process.",,https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/3-reasons-adversity-enhances-your-success-and-how-you-can-use-it-to-achieve-more-7704f332ef5,productivity,de0e1b418a218a355a164ec992e85055f85df68d9078fc2e23a0f527
3 Ways Leaders Can Facilitate Social Opportunities While Working Remotely,"I met four of my best friends at work. This wasn't by design. It just sort of happened after spending half of our waking hours working alongside one another. And, although we don't work together currently, our connection - and our group chat - remains as alive as it was back when we did.Research tells us that having best friends at work is a great thing for us and for our companies. Gallup found that women who strongly agree they have a best friend at work are more than twice as likely to be engaged compared with the women who say otherwise, and we know that higher levels of engagement lead to a slew of desirable outcomes for organizations.My work friendships were built slowly over time through small touchpoints that snowballed into meaningful connections. Without these touchpoints, Gallup says:The occasional afternoon walk to a coffee shop helped me power through my day, but it also gave me a chance to vent about the frustrating meeting I had just come from.Our team huddle equipped me with the information I needed to do my job, but it also gave me a chance to linger around afterward to hear about everyone's weekends.Lunch with a colleague gave me a respite before embarking on a busy afternoon, but it also allowed me to forge a relationship with the person sitting across from me.The result of all this was that even on my toughest days, I wasn't tempted to look for jobs elsewhere because I knew the only way I would get to work with this group of people was to stay put.I can't help but wonder what impact remote work will have on the friendships yet to be made in the absence of chance encounters like these, and I don't think the same organic connections will spontaneously happen without leaders putting some thought into it.Here are three ways today's leaders can set the stage for their teams to forge meaningful friendships at work, even while working remotely.I can almost hear the nay-sayers as I type this. My team is just too busy for that. Give me a break - no, they're not. If it's important, you'll find time for it.Remember the coffee breaks, hallway gossip, and watercooler talk that transpired when we all physically worked together? None of those things are happening now, and they all took time. You can afford to have your team spend an hour or two a month intentionally not working.It won't be for naught, either. The interactions that contributed most to my work friendships were the seemingly unproductive moments spent together at work.Those were the moments where the meaningful connections were built, and those connections were what powered us to be more productive when we were working.In Nine Lies About Work, Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall discuss the impact that learning together as a team has on the team's overall level of trust, a key element of any relationship.Goodall explains how he brought this practice to life at his company, Cisco, through the Power of Teams program.The specific learning topics are less important to this approach. The point:Let's face it - sometimes employees just need to vent to their co-workers without their boss listening in. Sometimes they might even need to vent to their co-workers about their boss. That's OK.Feeling safe enough to share your frustrations with someone you trust is an important part of a friendship, and it's safe to assume that not everyone feels comfortable doing that with the person who writes their review in the virtual room.Leaders need to know when to excuse themselves so that their people can show up as their authentic selves and real connections between team members can be formed.",https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/1*tWwS_KrTXtmMadzkKiz1Lg.jpeg,https://medium.com/better-humans/3-ways-leaders-can-facilitate-social-opportunities-while-working-remotely-c011c5f78a9b,productivity,df1c9ac988020416e7fc8eca2ac891660b174eaf0eda8a9afa1c5c56
15 Productivity Hacks that Have Become Irrelevant (Thanks COVID),"While COVID-19 has affected each and every one of them differently, there's also no denying that it's completely turned productivity inside out. Most notably, the productivity hacks that have been promoted for years are no longer effective. In fact, most of these strategies aren't even realistic anymore and we have to adjust.While I'm not hating on traditional productivity techniques, the new reality is that they are outdated and must be adapted. For example, these popular productivity hacks just aren't cutting any longer following COVID-19.I'm sure that you've come across this adage a million times. In fact, this has been championed by some of the most productive and successful people throughout time. Everyone from Ben Franklin, Tim Cook, Michelle Obama, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson are morning birds.To be fair, there is merit to being an early riser. ""It's been said that morning birds are more proactive, consistent, and aren't rushing out the door,"" Deanna Ritchie wrote in a previous Calendar article. ""What's more, it's a pretty good time to exercise or find your muse. And, because the world is still sleeping, you're more productive.""""Here's the problem with that,"" adds Deanna. ""Not everyone is an early riser."" And, you can blame genetics for this.""Biological differences between early birds and night owls exist,"" Robert Matchock, associate professor of psychology at Penn State Altoona, told Fast Company. ""The hormone melatonin, whose rise makes the body feel less alert, decreases later in the morning for night owls."" Larks also ""have a higher core body temperature in the afternoon, which can be a sign of increased energy at that time,"" he added.So, instead of forcing yourself to wake up at some ungodly hour, follow your own circadian rhythm. Now that you aren't fighting against yourself, you can plan your schedule when you're at your best.And, since you may be homeschooling your kids, there's another way that this could work in your favor as well. If you're a night owl, you can focus on your most important work when the kids go to bed. That means you can be with them during the day while still being productive during your peak hours.Yet another common productivity hack promoted by successful individuals is having a morning routine. Look, I totally get it. These habits can supercharge your day since they can set the tone for the day.But, let's be real here. Not all morning routines are created equal. Case in point, the hour-long morning routine of Tim Ferriss.""In an ideal world, we'd all start our mornings like Tim Ferriss,"" notes Audrey Goodson Kingo for Working Mother. ""The podcaster, investor and productivity expert told Business Insider he begins his day with a 'very clearly defined' 60-minute morning routine that includes precisely 22 minutes of meditation, drinking tea (preferably oolong), journaling and working out (on a Peloton or doing acroyoga).""Ferriss calls it the ""recipe"" needed to ""set up"" the rest of his day. While I have nothing against it, it's just not realistic for everyone, in particular parents.""Over here in the real world, most working parents begin their day soothing grumpy children and yapping pets while chugging a giant cup of coffee,"" states Kingo. ""Our 'recipes' typically involve pouring cereal in a bowl.""If you can, definitely try to have some sort of morning routine. But, make sure that you keep it simple enough so that it's realistic. Most parents recommend prepping at much as you can the night before so that you do have the time to squeeze in some physical activity, journaling, and definitely getting the coffee percolating.""I understand why this sounds like a good tip: Reading and responding to email could derail your entire morning and set you back (you know when your 15 minutes of reviewing emails turn into 45 - and suddenly, you're late for work,"" writes Emmy Award-winning television producer and founder of ListProducer.com Paula Rizzo. ""But, in so many industries, it can be difficult to ignore what has been going on overnight - even for a few hours.""""Translation: This tip just isn't realistic in your fast-paced life,"" continues Rizzo. ""In fact, it might actually cause additional anxiety before you even get into the office.""To fix this, Rizzo says to go ahead and check your email in the morning. However, ""don't respond unless it will take you less than a minute."" For messages that only require a ""yes"" or ""no"" or ""that can be forwarded to someone who can take care of it for you is fine,"" she adds.""But anything that requires research or a longer response is off-limits. Mark that message as ""unread,"" and ""go back to it later when you have more time,"" adds Rizzo. ""Better yet, add it to your to-do list so you'll be sure to check on it later.""""Scrolling through and skimming emails first thing in the morning is a good use of time even when you can't respond right away. Letting them marinate before firing off a response can be invaluable.""The frog concept was popularized by author Brian Tracey. For the uninitiated, it doesn't mean literally eating frogs - which I don't find all that appetizing. Instead, it's tackling your most important or challenging task bright and early.I totally get the appeal here. Most of us tend to be most alert and energetic in the morning. Besides, once this is no longer hanging over your head, it feels like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders.But, as already mentioned, not everyone is a morning person. Again, as opposed to forcing yourself to work when you aren't at your peak is counterproductive. As such, it's a better idea to schedule your ""frogs"" during your golden hours.Additionally, even if you are a morning person, there's a solid chance that you've had to adjust your schedule. For example, let's say you currently have kids at home, and you need to help them with schoolwork. It's not possible to ""eat frogs"" at the same time, meaning you'll have to chomp them down when you can.Research from Kevin Kruse has found that millionaires don't rely on to-do-lists. I know. Shocking.The first reason he found was that they don't account for time. ""When we have a long list of tasks, we tend to tackle those that can be completed quickly in a few minutes, leaving the longer items left undone,"" he writes in Forbes. ""Research from the company iDoneThis indicates that 41% of all to-do list items are never completed!""Secondly, ""a to-do list doesn't distinguish between urgent and important. Once again, our impulse is to fight the urgent and ignore the important. (Are you overdue for your next colonoscopy or mammogram?)""And, finally, ""to-do lists contribute to stress,"" Kruse states. ""In what's known in psychology as the Zeigarnik effect, unfinished tasks contribute to intrusive, uncontrolled thoughts. It's no wonder we feel so overwhelmed in the day, but fight insomnia at night.""Rather than using lists, they live and die by their calendar. How? They add their priorities to their calendar before anything else.I should add, though, that there's absolutely nothing wrong with jotting down reminders. The occasional braindump ensures that you won't forget anything while clearing your head. However, committing to only lists may not be as effective as scheduling.In all seriousness, I'm a fan of the Pomodoro Technique. After all, it encourages me to take frequent breaks throughout the day to keep me fresh. Moreover, it has benefits like improving planning and dealing with distractions and interruptions.The problem is that it's essentially a time tyrant. How so? Because you're supposed to work in 25-minutes and then take a break.Some people don't like that level of regimentation. More problematic, though, is that it interrupts your flow. That just means that if you're fully immersed in a task, you have to stop and take a break when the timer goes off.To solve this predicament, try a modified version called the Flowtime Technique. Created by Zoë Read-Biven, here's how it works.That's pretty much it. The jest is that you're tracking your time while also identifying common distractions. Also, it still encourages you to take breaks, but whenever you need them.Full transparency here. When done properly, outsourcing and delegating tasks can be timesavers. But that's only if you know how to clearly communicate your expectations and have people that you trust.Furthermore, you still need to carve out time to monitor the task. And, most importantly, you also need to know what exactly to delegate and to whom.If you're missing any of the above, outsourcing and delegating properly won't be effective. In fact, they may end up costing you more time - i.e., identifying the right person for the right job and having to correct their mistakes.There's another consideration here. Since a majority of us have had to tighten our belts, we may not have the budget to hire freelancers, contractors, or even maintain a full-time team. As such, a better option might be to automate tasks like scheduling, posting to social media, responding to email, billing, and customer service.Multitasking is a myth. Or, so you've been told.In reality, what this refers to is a task-switching, where you're bouncing your attention from one thing to another. In this care, it's not possible and can even have consequences like hindering your productivity and lowering your IQBut what about doing two things at once? Well, some of us can totally pull that off. And it might even be a good thing. Studies have found that multitasking can improve your performance by sharpening multisensory integration.Additionally, multitasking can ""deepen"" your time. ""There's a nice form of multitasking, which I tend to think of more as 'alignment,'"" says Laura Vanderkam, author of What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast; ""This means deepening time, not fragmenting it.""An example of this would be when you workout with a friend. ""You're running, but you're also talking and nurturing your relationship at the same time. That's good multitasking,"" she says.The catch? Multitasking on tasks that don't conflict with each other. ""In other words, you can multitask as long as you're doing two things that don't tax the same parts of your brain,"" explains Peter Bregman in a Forbes article. ""Email while on a conference call? Bad idea. But exercise and commuting? It's a perfect multitasking marriage.""Obvious, right? How can you possibly focus when you're surrounded by noise? Besides, science has shown that you'll get more done when it's quiet.Of course, can you actually be in an environment where it's completely silent? Most likely not. I mean, just as I'm writing this, my dog barked because she heard the mail truck, and my neighbor has been running his leaf blower wild. Even if I head noise-canceling headphones,s higher-pitched random noises, like voices, can still come through.At the same time, there are advantages to listening to music and background noise.""Overall, research shows that listening to music and background noise can offer various benefits, including improved cognitive performance, improved task performance, improved concentration, increased energy levels, and improved mood,"" write the folks over at Effectivilogy. ""These benefits mean that listening to music or background noise can be highly beneficial in a variety of circumstances, especially since it is often relatively easy to set them up.""The caveat is that we all respond differently to music and background noise. You may work best listening to classical music, while others prefer video game tunes. I suggest trying out focus@will. It will curate a personalized playlist to improve your focus.For those who were fortunate enough to have a home office, the transition to working from home hasn't been as trying. But, if you don't have the space for a home office? No worries. You can still be productive.In another Calendar post, Max Palmer shares how this is possible by:If you're really limited on space because you're in a small apartment or sharing tablespace with your family, get creative. For instance, you could clean out a closet and make a cozy office in there.I guarantee that when you're new to working from home that this is the most common piece of advice that you come across. Science has also found that what you wear to work matters. But, to be honest, you really don't need research to prove this.Just think about the times that you do dress up. You probably feel like a million bucks. And, it can also help you mentally shift into work mode.However, these are unprecedented times. We're grieving the loss of the world we used to know - and love. And, we're all struggling right now.Despite what conventional wisdom has previously said, the new reality is that you can wear whatever you damn feel like.I think in a rebuttal to an L.A. Times piece entitled Enough With the WFH Sweatpants. Dress Like the Adult You're Getting Paid to Be, Esquire's Ben Boskovich, put it best. ""Whether dressing like you're headed to the office makes you feel better or not is up to you. Not me, and not a deputy fashion director who wants you to wear jeans.""As long as you're still being a pro and getting things done, wear what you want. Of course, use some common sense as well. If you have a video call, throw on an appropriate outfit instead of your cozy, yet raggedy, bathrobe.Procrastination has a bad reputation. And, for good reason.Putting things off can cause you to fall behind or even stress you out. That can damage your credibility and overall well being. It can also cause you to miss out on opportunities and put a strain on your relationships.But, believe it or not. Procrastination can actually be good for you. In fact, it may even be able to improve your productivity and happiness.How so? Well, here are six reasons, according to Susanna Newsonen, MAPP:I don't think that any of us want to experience negative emotions like anxiety, stress, or hopelessness. Not only is that detrimental to your health, but it also influences your productivity. And, while there are small ways to lift your spirits, like going for a walk or talking to a friend, forcing yourself can be just as bad.Back in 2017, research from UC Berkeley found that trying to force yourself doesn't work. Mainly because resisting negative emotions leads to feeling more psychologically stressed. More interesting was that those who do accept these feelings reported fewer mood disorder symptoms.""It turns out that how we approach our own negative emotional reactions is really important for our overall well-being,"" said study lead author Brett Ford, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. ""People who accept these emotions without judging or trying to change them can cope with their stress more successfully.""That couldn't be any more relevant than right now. During the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists have recommended that we don't ignore difficult feelings. Instead, we need to acknowledge them and reach out for help.""It's fun to get on the app and layout your tasks and set goals, but if you get too into planning, that's a waste of time,"" explains Stephanie Wells, founder of Formidable Forms, over at Inc. ""A simple calendar or to-do list is best to quickly plan out your schedule and get things done.""From my experience, many productivity apps also have a learning curve. That means you need to make a time investment in figuring out the work. Moreover, these tools are so robust that they can be overwhelming and you'll probably spend more time organizing than doing.For years, it was advised that we strive for work-life balance. Here's the truth, though. Balance doesn't exist.I feel that most of us realized this as we began working remotely. It would be great if you could clock-in at 9 a.m. and work a full day. But, you have to walk the dog, keep up with household chores, and take care of the kids. And, even when you call it a day, you may still have to respond to emails or wrap-up the tasks you didn't finish earlier.A better approach is work-life integration.According to UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, work-life integration is ""an approach that creates more synergies between all areas that define 'life': work, home/family, community, personal well-being, and health."" In other words, instead of setting hard boundaries and compartmentalizing, you connect work and life.Examples could be bringing your dog to work, having a conference call when your kids are playing in the backyard, or inviting a friend to tag along when running errands. How is this possible in a post-COVID world? Well, stick to a schedule and routine, but also be flexible. But, above all, it's admitting that you're not perfect and that you should also put your priorities first.15 Productivity Hacks that Have Become Irrelevant (Thanks COVID) was originally published on Calendar by John Rampton.",,https://medium.com/calendar/15-productivity-hacks-that-have-become-irrelevant-thanks-covid-c927d25de8db,productivity,e0e509938db5b193da14c0d4779bc9cfe2fafd6c900c222cc082f87d
"Life, Death, and a House","There's not a one of us that can escape our complicated family histories. They're all different, unique, and filled with both tragedy and joy. In Giant Sparrow's 2017 game, What Remains of Edith Finch, the exploration into a family's tragic and mortal past is treated like an art form of itself, the stories of each member of the Finch family unfolding in curated dramas that make up the tapestry of the whole.Akin to other walking simulators such as Gone Home, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture or Giant Sparrow's previous game, The Unfinished Swan, What Remains of Edith Finch is extremely narrative forward, the gameplay serving to motivate the player from one set piece to the next. The individual stories of the family members are scattered throughout the Finch house, which is itself a marvelous museum-like labyrinth, a tiered mansion evocative of the Pink Palace from Neil Gaiman's Coraline. We play as Edith who has come home after years of being away, as she puts together the pieces of her past in order to fill a journal that might dictate the history of her eccentric and tragic family.Unlike many other entries in the walking simulator ""genre,"" Edith Finch smartly tells the tale of each enshrined family member through a series of surprisingly different gameplay mechanics - some of the stories are even done through different graphical styles and mediums, such as a slide show or comic book (a certain ""Halloween"" segment is especially satisfying). As the stories are presented and finished from the perspective of each family member, Edith comes to term with the image of her family as a whole, observing them as important and interesting parts of who she is as a person.Similar to other narrative forward games that have followed this style over the years, What Remains of Edith Finch should be attempted in one single sitting, if possible. While it is a video game, the narrative is meant to be absorbed more like an interactive film, with each layer of the story coming together swiftly. I finished the game in a little under two hours, and the entirety of the experience left me pondering my own family, future, and meaning.This is a game about death. A game about how overcoming the concept of a generational curse might affect the behaviors, choices, and mental states of a family whose closeness was contentious and sometimes toxic. Edith's exploration of her family's generational home and property is done so with the mentality that she is unearthing her past for the sake of all those that lived before her, honoring each of them in the same way that they are honored within the museum-like landscape of the Finch home. Every single family member segment is unique, compelling, and thoughtful - the game's narration comes together in such a succinct and poignant way that you will be thinking about it for long after.Giant Sparrow received many accolades for this title, all well deserved. Set against the backdrop of Orcas Island, Washington, the imagery is as beautiful as it is haunting. There is a fairy-tale like quality in the way all of the Finch family member's stories come together, even if most of them are gruesome to some degree. Remember, this is a game about death, and it will end up making you ponder your own life, and your place in the lives of those whom you love the most.As the credits roll, and the perspective slowly pans back from the multilayered lives of those who lived and died in the Finch house, I was astounded by how beautifully Giant Sparrow was able to convey the pain and tragedy of family, and how sometimes the curses we grow up believing in can perhaps be blessings for those we leave behind.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*ddcY5US8nMZQtgyLQvVU5Q.png,https://medium.com/super-jump/life-death-and-a-house-89e27dffcd0f,fiction,e2a6e0ac6cde1ff71defaaa016db2910d4191be2ec761d41aa536069
How I Created a System to Fit My Writer's Lifestyle,"I knew I needed to change my ""system"" when I was becoming more stressed and less fulfilled. As a writer, I felt like there were never enough hours in the day to do everything. I wanted to do too much, and I wanted to do it now. I was piling so much on my plate and stretching myself far too thin. It was important for me to write each day. However, so many things often got in the way of my daily word count goal. When doing everything became impossible, I became discouraged, which created a negative cycle.The thing is: there simply aren't enough hours in the day to do everything I want. Once I admitted that, I realized I needed to change my system to better fit my writer's lifestyle.I began by writing down a list of everything I wanted to do. And I mean everything: from long-term goals like publishing a book to short-term goals like refreshing my portfolio.Once I did this, I noticed a trend: many tasks I wanted to do took some time to complete. Most of them were projects that went through various stages of completion, and others required ongoing, never-ending maintenance. In the past, I have always set goals for the day, but would beat myself up if I didn't complete them all. That's when I realized my expectations for myself were unrealistic. I needed to start thinking in terms of days instead of hours.After accepting the fact that there simply aren't enough hours in the day, I gave myself permission to take more time.I started with my bullet journal. Instead of having a daily to-do list, I began a running weekly Master Task List. There, I wrote down everything I wanted to complete by the end of the week, instead of the day. Then, as I prepared for each day ahead, I cherrypicked the tasks I was up to tackling.This gave me the flexibility of only selecting tasks based on my mental health and availability. If some days were unpredictably busier than usual, I didn't have to feel bad if I couldn't get to a certain task because I still had the rest of the week to complete it.When I ran a digital fashion magazine in my early 20s, I created a Content Calendar to help me prepare features a month or two in advance. A Content Calendar is just what it sounds like: it's a calendar (I use a weekly format) where you can plan out what content will go live each day. At Cliché Magazine, my team and I had a week when we brainstormed content ideas for the following month. Then, we decided when each feature would go live. That way, we had a better idea of how much time we had to reach the deadline.While I've often prepped blog posts a week in advance, rarely have I planned content a month out. However, working a month in advance again has given me much more time to prepare thoughtful content without feeling rushed. I'm still getting the same amount of writing done, but now I'm much more prepared and less stressed out.Discovering the apps Ulysses and Trello changed my life this past year.Ulysses, which replaced Pages and Microsoft Word for me, is my favorite writing processor app purely for its easy organization and customization. Here, I can keep track of all my different projects all in one place without opening various windows in my Documents.Trello's kanban-style design makes it even easier for me to implement my Content Calendar. Here is where I schedule tasks for the week or the month, arranged by stages of completion.For example, I have one Trello board called January 2021 Content with the following lists: To Write, Creating an Outline, Writing Draft, Taking Photos, Editing, Promo Copy, Scheduled, then finally, Published. I start by placing a blog title idea in the To Write column, then drag and drop it along the columns as it nears completion.Both apps help me visualize the various moving stages of my writing, and I can't recommend them enough.Once my writing projects are complete, I schedule them in advance. This way, they are all ready to go come their publish date and I can shift my focus to my next project. There is also much more freedom and flexibility when scheduling content in advance, especially when needing to make last-minute switches or changes. I schedule all blog posts to go live on WordPress, then finally, I schedule their corresponding social media posts to go up on Buffer.My writing projects have gone much smoother ever since.Megan Portorreal is a professional writer, editor, and creative in the New York City area.

Be Quick or Be Dead,"The men of the 3rd Battalion 26th Marines Kilo Company needed this, a night of singing, dancing, laughing, drinking, smoking, and drooling - not necessarily in that order - as the Donut Holes put on a show at base camp that did exactly what it was intended to do: Lift the spirits of the disgruntled men fighting this despicable war.Patrick and his pals had enjoyed some down time in the past week, and the short break was capped off with an appearance by four members of the Red Cross Supplemental Recreational Activities Overseas program, the Donut Holes, or Donut Dollies as the men called them.They were single, female college graduates who signed up to do their part to assist the war effort by going to Vietnam and giving the soldiers a thrill by parading around in their short, tight miniskirts as the men hooted and hollered. They sang and danced, played games like charades and musical chairs, or just talked to individuals who needed a soothing ear. Their shows did not compare in entertainment value to the USO productions that featured Hollywood stars and starlets, but they were more personal because the young ladies mingled with the men and learned a little about them before moving on to the next base camp.Patrick was entranced by one of the Dollies, a redhead from Nashville named Peggy whose perfume smelled like a rose garden and whose green eyes and perfect breasts caused a stir in his fatigues. He had gawked at her almost the entire time and was able to spend about 10 minutes alone with her after the show, just shooting the shit and trying not to get caught glancing down at her pair of prized possessions.Like everyone else that night, Patrick fell asleep with a smile on his face, only to be rousted in the pre-dawn hours and informed that they were about to embark on an unavoidably dangerous mission, one that had even their fearless commanding officer apprehensive. As Sergeant Major Hound Dog Harriman laid out what company command was asking them to do, Patrick bowed his head, closed his eyes, and cursed the God that his Catholic parents made him believe was really up there looking out for him. ""They're throwing us into the shit today,"" Hound Dog said, ""and I ain't gonna lie to you boys, this is a fucked up mess. Those tits you saw last night might be the last tits some of you will ever see. You get some breakfast, and I want every one of you to write home just in case. I ain't fucking kidding. I seen a lot here, but this ain't good. But we got no choice.""There was a murmuring among the men who were all staring wide-eyed back at this Rock of Gibraltar figure because Hound Dog rarely admitted or showed concern. This guy was the ultimate survivor, a hardened warrior, already on his fourth tour and moving up in rank because the men in Hound Dog's family believed they were put on this earth to do one thing: Fight wars.If there wasn't a war to fight, they didn't know what to do with themselves, and this went back to the Civil War when his great, great grandfather fought for the Union and was a hero in the Battle of Gettysburg as he helped beat back the charge of the Confederates at Cemetery Ridge. About 50,000 men lost their lives in those three days at Gettysburg, but not John Robert Harriman.Patrick saw the uneasiness in Hound Dog's eyes as he explained the mission, and he thought back to the last time his Sergeant gave off this vibe a few months back during Operation Mameluke Trust when Kilo got ambushed and lost five men in a matter of seconds. That day a phrase often recited by the troops rang true: In Vietnam there were only two types of Marines - the quick, and the dead. It seemed like that might get put to the test again during this mission.The 3/26 Kilo were tasked with providing security for the main supply route, National Route #1, from the Hai Van Pass at the southern boundary of Thua Thien Province, north to Phu Loc Village. None of this meant much to Patrick because all of these villages and provinces looked the same to him. But when Hound Dog went over the particular coordinates and pointed them out on the map, everyone snapped to attention because they recognized this was a hot zone of hostile activity, a place where the VC and NVA had inflicted heavy American casualties.They knew how important that stretch of road was to get the motor convoys through, and it had to be kept clear at all cost. The enemy knew this, too, and over the past several weeks there had been almost daily skirmishes in the region, the firefights growing in intensity as the enemy fortified its positions in the surrounding hills.The Marines were always ready for a fight no matter how mundane the mission may have seemed, but there would be nothing mundane about this. Hound Dog made them perfectly aware that there was going to be a fight, and the best they could do was to react quickly when it started, hope they could hunker down without anyone perishing, and then rise to the challenge with all their might to secure the road. In other words, be quick or be dead. One thing was certain: This was not going to be a good day. Patrick could only hope it wasn't going to be his last day.When Hound Dog finished his briefing, corpsman Dan Lamorello, the company medic, headed to the supply tent to load up, and he asked Patrick to give him a hand.""Doc, I'm scared,"" Patrick said. ""This seems like lambs being led to the slaughter.""""This whole fucking war is lambs to the slaughter, McDonald,"" Lamorello said as he grabbed extra rolls of gauze and vials of morphine and stuffed them into his bag, then collared Patrick by the scruff of his neck and told him, ""You're a Marine. You do what you're trained to do and you'll be fine.""When chow was finished, Patrick walked over to the tent he shared with five others, sat on his cot, and did what Hound Dog had demanded. He wrote his death letter.After Patrick handed his letter to Hound Dog, the Sergeant gave it back and told him he forgot to stamp it. That meant he hadn't written the word ""free"" on the envelope where the stamp would normally go, one of the only perks the soldiers received while they were in country: Free mail service from Uncle Sam back home.""I wish more things in life were free,"" Patrick said as he wrote the word and gave the envelope back to Hound Dog.Patrick then began packing for the mission. When he was finished at the supply shed, he did a quick inventory: M-16 rifle in working order; three bandoleers of ammo to strap over his shoulders and across his chest; a pistol belt complete with two pouches to hold four hand grenades, with a smoke grenade and a canteen of water attached to the strap; a ruck sack to carry extra ammo and smoke grenades; a couple flares; a small fold-up shovel for digging fox holes; two days' worth of C-Rats in cans; a rain poncho; extra socks; a toothbrush; cigarettes; and a pen and note paper. About 50 pounds in all to lug around in the stifling jungle heat. Boy scout camp for killers, Patrick liked to say.Two hours after Hound Dog stored the letters in a canvas bag and shoved them under his cot, the men of Kilo company were on their way into the shit. Literally, for Patrick, as it turned out. The C-123 transport planes had dumped thousands of gallons of Agent Orange into the mountainside along their route in the preceding weeks, and the powerful defoliant had started to kill the vegetation and forest, but not enough yet to deprive the enemy of the proper cover it required to execute their ambushes.About two clicks into this journey to the unknown, Patrick began to catch strong whiffs of the stuff, and his mind drifted back to some of the conversations among the guys smarter than him who swore that someday, being exposed to Agent Orange would cause serious health issues for the soldiers. But that was a worry for another day. Today, the focus when Patrick looked up at those chemically covered hills was spotting any movement by the enemy that would tip off Kilo to a coming firefight.It was early afternoon, about three hours on the trail under an unrelenting sun, and the men were starting to feel the effects of the heat, and the fear, and Hound Dog was scouting for a covered area to stop and take a break. But then Patrick noticed something that looked suspicious off to his left maybe 20 yards away up a slight incline, barely visible in the foliage, and he alerted Hound Dog who was about 10 yards ahead of him.""Sergeant,"" Patrick said, trying his best not to speak too loudly.Hound Dog turned around, and Patrick pointed to what looked like some kind of man-made structure. Hound Dog put up his fist to halt the march, and then motioned with his head for Patrick to go up and check it out as every man went silent and crouched down.Patrick slipped through the brush, stepped over some rocks, ever mindful of those deadly Bouncing Betty mines, and came upon a slightly cleared out space which he immediately identified. There were four bamboo poles stuck into the ground with palm fronds positioned on top and on the sides, and in the middle there were two basketball-sized holes dug out.""Gook shitter,"" Patrick said, again using a muffled voice.Hound Dog nodded, and pointed to the ground, meaning that he wanted Patrick to get down on his knees and take a whiff to see if it was active. Patrick did, and the rancid smell made him feel like puking right there. No doubt it was active, and this was not good because that meant the gooks were somewhere close, probably ready to strike at any moment.Patrick stood up, his face contorted from the foul odor, and gave a thumbs up and a nod to Hound Dog that indeed it had been recently used. And just then, out of nowhere it seemed, came the first explosion with it the first two dead Marines on this mission. Al McAfee from Butte, Montana, and Billy Wilson from Tucson, Arizona were standing side by side maybe 100 feet from the latrine, looking at Patrick as he confirmed that danger was likely imminent, and they were torn to shreds by a rocket-propelled grenade, the fucking Russians' gift to the NVA. They died instantly.Within a split second came AK-47 artillery fire, and the men of Kilo began hitting the deck, several filled with lead and screaming in agony. Patrick took cover in the disgusting shitter and that gave him a chance to scope where the enemy was attacking from. Hound Dog was doing the same down below, but it was difficult to do with your head down trying to avoid getting blown to pieces. Patrick located the muzzle flashes through the thick vegetation, got up on his knees with his M-16 set to automatic and began spilling rounds into the distance, hoping to hit something. The other men who were not yet wounded gained their bearings and began firing as well, but the gooks had established their line and knew exactly how they wanted to attack and clearly had the upper hand.Pinned down with no escape, all Kilo Company could do was dig in, return fire, and hope they wouldn't be drawing their last breath in the coming minutes or seconds. Hound Dog yelled into the PRC-25 radio for Tactical Air Command support, and after giving the coordinates he said he'd be sending up red smoke grenades in a few minutes to mark Kilo's exact position. TAC was ready to swoop in because it knew it would likely be needed, and after he was told help would arrive in about two or three minutes, Hound Dog yelled, ""Roger that, over,"" and handed the radio back to Lance Corporal Johnny Cannon from Ames, Iowa, who was always on Hound Dog's hip.""What the hell are we gonna do, Sergeant,"" a terrified Cannon yelled over the din.""We're gonna kill as many as we can before they kill us,"" Hound Dog said, and he wasn't kidding.The roar of war was all around as Hound Dog tried to plot his response. He could see the NVA had them flanked to the North and West and were trying to push them into a sparsely vegetated area to the east. Hound Dog knew that was a death wish if he moved the men that way; they had to stay put and wait for TAC to firebomb the shit out of these fuckers.Hound Dog scanned the snake line of men that stretched about 50 yards behind him and began barking his orders. He motioned to Gunnery Sergeant Eugene Mills from Los Angeles and Staff Sergeant Milo Davidson from Fargo, North Dakota to take aim with their M-60s at a position about 60 yards to the west, and he instructed Private First Class Mike Orlowski from Tampa to fire his M-79 grenade launcher toward the North flank. He looked up to where Patrick was taking cover in the latrine, and yelled, ""Get some fire out there"" so Hound Dog could move down the line to communicate with more of the men.Patrick gave him a thumbs up, and on Hound Dog's signal, Patrick began providing cover as his crazy commanding officer got on his feet and, in a crouched position, scurried through the gates of hell with Cannon right behind him. Hound Dog made it to his first position just as Patrick had to stop to load the next bandoleer.Hound Dog shouted instructions to PFC Joe DeLuca of Rochester, New York, then looked up at Patrick to see if he was ready, and Patrick was. Hound Dog began moving to the next position when the unthinkable happened. In all the chaos, Hound Dog didn't see the trip wire in his path that was attached to a booby-trapped hand grenade. The captain's right foot stepped on the wire, and the grenade that was maybe five feet to his right detonated. The blast tore into Hound Dog's torso, chest, and neck, a devastating direct hit that would have killed most men instantly. Such as Jimmy Cannon, who took shrapnel that tore a hole into his neck and nearly severed his head.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2048/1*oWhULpgxQgnkOvUSFFWJ8A.jpeg,https://medium.com/the-junction/be-quick-or-be-dead-38d43c6b8f83,fiction,e65d5952244ed31d214b328f42880ae8670f2b93a9187df417a56afe
How To Create Your Most Productive Workspace Ever,"If you hate your workspace, you are not going to get anything done. Likewise, if you love your workspace, you are going to be extremely productive. There is no in-between on this.People might tell you that where you work doesn't matter, but I think those people are in denial. After all, we are seeing how this plays out every day with people who work from home. Many people who love working from home have a workspace they love. While others, who prefer being in an office setting tend to enjoy the way their desk, office, or cubicle is set up.I have found this to be true in my own life too.Over the years, I have worked in offices with open workspaces, cubicles, and individual offices. Other jobs have allowed me to work from home where I have worked in a designated den/office space, living room, or even our laundry room.Some of the jobs I have had put me to work in event spaces, coffee shops, and out of my car. Its space has positive characteristics and negative ones too.Yet, our workspace matters a great deal.According to studies, your physical workspace matters a great deal to how much work you get done and your overall wellbeing. If you are working in a space that is not conducive to work and even lacks proper natural light you may miss out on getting a lot done.When I last worked in a cubicle setting, I worked in the middle of high-walled cubicles in a building with very minimal natural light. In fact, my cubicle was placed in a location where I never saw a window unless I got up to go to the breakroom. This was one of the more difficult settings for me and for a long time, I didn't know why.While on the other hand, with my current job, I work from home 100% of the time, and currently work in our laundry room. However, I have a ton of natural light in this room and therefore complete a lot of work throughout the day.While natural light is super important, other things like your desk, placement of supplies, cleanliness of space, and the ability to close out distraction matters too.So, how do we set up an optimal space so we can get things done?First and foremost, you need to understand something, your space might be different than mine. While I might give suggestions as to what you could add to your space, these steps should help you better understand what you need and then help you to create the space you need to be the most productive.No matter what you are doing, make sure that the space you are going to be parked out for extended amounts of time is comfortable. You need to have a good, ergonomic set up for your desk and chair. In this article from Life Hacker they give the following ergo checks:While this is for a sitting desk, I have a standing desk so you want to make sure that your computer screens follow these guidelines as well as your keyboard keeping the right comfortable height for typing.There is three main sense I am talking about here: sight, smell, touch. What you see, smell, and feel in your workspace matters a great deal because they can determine whether you will be distracted or whether you will be able to focus. Here are a few tips for setting up your workspace:The way you experience your environment impacts the way you interact with it and your work. This is why you need to be mindful of the way you see it, smell it, and feel it under your hands and feet. The more this is tailored to you, the more you will like your workspace, the more you will get done.While the sound is part of your senses, this one gets a space all to itself. Why? Because you have a lot of control over the noises that interrupt your work or might help you get more things done throughout the day. Here are three ways to control the noise that contributes to your productivity.Clearly, noise can be both positive and negative when it comes to your workspace and getting things done. That is why it is very important that you tailor this part of your workspace specifically to you.Where you keep things is just as important as these other areas because your organization will help you quickly transition from task to task. Now, most of my work is completely digital, however, I always keep a notepad and pens at hand in case I need to jot down a quick note. However, here are a few other things to think about:No matter what you need it should never be far away and it should be easy to access. The key is the ease of use and access so you can keep getting things done with minimal distraction or interruption.Whether you stop for a quick walk, a cup of coffee, or a snack, you need to have this prepared ahead of time. Now, this doesn't have to be overly complicated, but it matters to know where you will take your breaks. Will you do it in your workspace? Or will you leave your workspace?If you stay in your workspace, you will need to plan out how you will take a break so you won't be enticed to work while resting. Because this isn't really resting if you are working too.Likewise, if you will leave your workspace for a break, make sure you give yourself the best chance to rest. Don't leave your space just to do household chores or work on something else. Make sure that your breaks are breaks so you can step back into getting things done when it's time to get back to work.Your workspace is the most important part of your daily productivity because you spend some much time there. If it isn't conducive to getting things done, then you won't be productive. However, if you set it up to help you focus on the move from task to task, you can experience a ton of success.No matter what your situation, make it work for you.Don't just copy what others do or what you're told to do or even what the experts say. Since your workspace is your space, it needs to be focused on what will help you get the most done every single day.How do you set up your workspace? Describe it or put a picture into the responses? What is your favorite part of your workspace?Learn how to maximize your day by maximizing your morning with your e-mail course!",https://miro.medium.com/max/11792/0*_ZPMPES2dHh_d-wT,https://medium.com/the-innovation/how-to-create-your-most-productive-workspace-ever-791cb28c3c6a,productivity,e90bbaa81ba853d6c198438871dd670946039d65482d31e56d102b2d
I Met A Syrian Who Lost Everything Because of War,"Imagine this. You come from a country where girls don't step outside the house after it's dark. Going to a different country all alone is absolutely out of the question.But you have this urge to travel the world. To explore. To feel how people around the world live.

Meet strangers from across the world, make friends, make memories.You have minor social anxiety and going to people and being a conversation starter isn't your forte.There are so many things which worry you - safety, money, new people, a new place.

We have a taxi and a date away one click away if I want.But what is a better way to explore a city than to meet a local?I have Couchsurfed previously in Stockholm where I had a local take me to underground cafes and local spots which I wouldn't have easily found on my own.But meeting somebody without a profile picture is absurd and calling trouble upon yourself, isn't it? And yet, yours truly swiped right.Now, there was this profile (let's call him Mr. A) which had all the red flags:And one green flag:My gut was so sure about meeting this stranger. I absolutely had to meet him. Regardless of not knowing what he looks like or who he is, I had to see him.Mr. A was a short man of about 5 feet 5 inches. He was bald, build alright, and met me with a warm smile.Mr. A, in person, was full of green flags.We spoke for about two hours while staring at the river in front of us. The locals were around us, some French teenagers listening to music and couples sitting arm in arm. Here we were, with our feet hanging down as we had a long conversation with many walls of silence.Little did I know that this conversation will change me. Forever. Here are some excerpts from what we spoke about, and I'm hopeful they will make you ponder.Mr. A covered stories of Syrian refugees. He was a videographer for a famous news channel.People he interviewed came from two scenarios:Their only hope is to spot land when they spend their days on a raft. Now tell me, is life really so hard or do we just enjoy whining about it?Mr. A and his relatives lost their home because of the usual blasts, he claimed. I feel chills down my spine each time somebody normalises bomb blasts, and this wasn't the first time because so did an Afghani man I met in Austria. But that's a story for another time.His family is doing fine and are hopeful that things will get okay. He brightened up when he spoke about his family because it's a blessing for all of them to be together.I love and value my family, but I hardly think of how much they mean to me. Without them, no amount of money I make or the career I lead holds any value. It took somebody else's story of a torn home to remind me this, that's the real problem here.This man had his house shattered and lost a huge part of his family. He supports his younger siblings to study because his education suffered.His circumstances made it extremely difficult for him to turn his life around, but he kept going.No amount of excuses that I've ever made felt worth it when I spoke to him. This man has had his whole world crushed but stands smiling, optimistic about what lies ahead.What's your excuse?I met Mr. A in June 2018, that's 2.5 years ago. But my conversation with him gave me lessons I still carry with me today.",,https://medium.com/the-ascent/i-met-a-syrian-who-lost-everything-because-of-war-46f3fd709eb7,travel,ef17258f7558a703922181f643b5ce9d7166bfa1226612f4763d442e
Cruise to Oblivion: A Triple Disappearance on Lake Michigan,"Three young women left to spend a day at the beach, and vanished without a trace. Police have been baffled by the case for more than half a century.Summers in Chicago tend to be very hot and muggy, and the summer of 1966 was no exception. Looking for a way to beat the oppressive heat, three young women decided to spend Saturday, July 2nd at Indiana Dunes State Park. Eager to get the holiday weekend started, 21-year-old Ann Miller left her house early that morning to pick up her two friends. Her first stop was 19-year-old Patricia Blough's house. Patty had been watching for the familiar sight of Ann's 1955 Buick and she ran out the door as soon as Ann pulled up to her house. She yelled a quick goodbye to her mother, telling her that she would be back early. Renee Bruhl, the third girl of the trio, was married and needed to be home in time to cook dinner for her husband, so Patty told her mother to expect her home around 5:00pm. The two girls made the short drive to the west side of Chicago to pick up 19-year-old Renee, and by 8:00am they left the city and headed for the Dunes.They arrived at the park around 10:00am. The beach was packed with people looking forward to enjoying the long holiday weekend, but the girls took little notice of the crowd. They spread their blanket out about 100 yards away from the shore, choosing a spot close to a few poplar trees that would provide a little bit of shade from the relentless sun. Though it was still early, the temperature had already topped 90 degrees and would continue to climb for the next few hours. The girls stripped down to their bathing suits and settled themselves on the blanket, content to just relax and soak in the atmosphere for a while.Like Ann, Patty, and Renee, Mike Yankalasa and Frances Cicero also lived in Chicago. The teenage couple had also decided to join the crowd at the Dunes that Saturday, and they had staked out a spot in the sand that was close to where the three girls were. Around noon, they watched as the trio got up and began to make the 100-yard walk to the water's edge. Although the teenagers hadn't really been paying much attention to the girls, they couldn't help but notice that they had left all of their belongings - purses, wallets, a radio, and everything else they had brought - unattended on their beach blanket. They assumed the girls were just going to take a quick dip in the water to cool off and then come right back.Mike and Frances continued to lay out in their little spot of sand, idly watching the crowds of people sunbathing and swimming. It was common to see small boats pulling up close to the shoreline, almost all of them piloted by good looking young men. These men would hone in on a group of pretty women, maneuver closer, and try to entice them to take a boat ride. The teenage couple watched in amusement as three young men pulled their boat close to where Ann, Patty, and Renee were, and though they couldn't hear any snippets of conversation from where they were sitting, it was obvious that the men were trying to talk them into getting on their boat. The women must not have been impressed, and the men soon gave up and went off in search of more amiable targets.It wasn't long before a man in a smaller boat moved in towards the three girls, and Mike and Frances exchanged amused glances. The three women sure seemed to be popular with the guys. Their amusement quickly turned to surprise, though, as they watched the three girls climb up into the boat. Once they had settled in, the boat sailed off to the west and the teenagers lost sight of it.As the sun began to set, the crowd on the beach finally started to thin out. Crowds of tired, sunburned people made their way to the parking lot and tried to remember where they had left their cars. Mike and Frances joined the crowd heading for the parking lot, but as they got closer to where they had been sitting earlier in the day, they saw something that made them stop in their tracks. Obviously, the three women hadn't made it back from their boat ride yet. Their beach blanket and all their belongings were still in the exact spot where they had left them so many hours earlier.The teens flagged down park ranger Bud Conner and told him about the three women who had left on a boat around noon and not come back for their things. They had no idea who the women were, but they were able to describe them as well as the boat they had seen them getting into. Bud had been a park ranger for years, and he was used to dealing with situations like this. The women had probably decided to go on an afternoon picnic that had turned into a moonlit cruise.Bud thanked the teenagers and told them he would put everything in the park office so that it would be safe until the women returned. Picking the blanket up by its corners, he checked to make sure that nothing had been missed and then carried everything to the Park Superintendent William Svetic's office. It certainly wasn't the first time someone had left something behind on the beach. They would probably get a call from the women in the morning, and they would be pleased to know that their possessions were safe.Sunday was another busy day at the Dunes. The holiday weekend was in full swing, and the park rangers had their hands full dealing with the crowd of people. Monday was July 4th, and the rangers arrived that morning expecting another busy and crowded day at the state park. William had just unlocked his office when he got a phone call from a man who identified himself as Harold Blough. He told the park superintendent that he was trying to locate his daughter. She had gone to the Dunes on Saturday with two friends but had never come home. He was trying to determine if there had been an accident or anything else that might explain what had happened to the three young women. William had forgotten all about the belongings that Bud had brought to the office on Saturday night, but as he was speaking with Harold he checked and saw that the blanket was still in his office. A quick check confirmed that the car keys found on the blanket were to a 1955 Buick that was still sitting in the parking lot, but the women were nowhere to be found. It was only 8:50am, but it was clear this wasn't going to be a routine day at the park. Suspecting he was dealing with something far more serious than some forgotten belongings, William called the Indiana State Police.Indiana State Trooper Harry Young was the first officer on the scene. The first thing he did was call in the license plate number of the Buick. It didn't take long for him to determine that there had been a missing person report filed on the owner of the Buick and two of her friends, all of whom had been missing since Saturday. Sergeant Edward Burke, a state police detective, was the next officer to arrive at the scene. He inventoried all the items that the women had left on the beach, as well as those that were still in the car. In addition to leaving their purses and wallets behind, it soon became clear that the women had left their clothing and shoes behind as well. Wherever the women went, they were barefoot and clad only in their bathing suits.The first 48 hours of an investigation are always the most critical, but police had already lost those crucial first hours. Search parties began the grueling task of going over every inch of the 2180-acre park. It was one of the most extensive manhunts the state of Indiana had ever seen. In addition to the beach and the lake, there were many wooded areas and open fields in the state park. With no way of knowing if the women had gone missing on the lake or after they were brought back to shore, police searched each section of the park.It didn't take long for the media to pick up on the story of the three missing girls, and their pictures made the front page of newspapers around the country. While the publicity helped to generate many tips, most involved purported sightings of the women that police were unable to confirm. Boaters who had been on the lake that Saturday told investigators that they had seen the women in water up to their chins, and police wondered if perhaps the women had just gone out too far and had drowned. But all three women were strong swimmers, and it was hard to imagine that three people would have been able to drown without any of the lifeguards on duty noticing a thing.Detectives got their first break in the case when a man came forward and told them he had been shooting home videos at the lake the day the women had gone missing. Although he didn't remember seeing the trio, he told police that they were welcome to go through his videos if they thought it would help in the investigation. Police took him up on his offer, hoping that the videos would help them in their search for the boat that the women had gotten on. They were lucky; the video showed three women getting onto a small white boat that had a distinctive three-hulled design. Although it was hard to make out their faces on the video, the three women were wearing swimsuits that matched the descriptions of what Ann, Renee, and Patty had been wearing, and the male that was piloting the boat matched the description given by witnesses. The boat could be seen heading to the west before it disappeared from the video.Some witnesses told police the small boat had dropped the women off at a beach to the west of where they left all their belongings. An attorney and his wife were certain they had seen the women getting something to eat and wandering around the dunes before being picked up by a cabin cruiser with three men aboard.After a week of intensive searching, officials were confident that the women were not anywhere in the state park. Every inch of the park had been searched without finding any trace of the women. They were also certain that the women hadn't drowned, as their bodies would have surfaced by that point. Once they had ruled out accidental drowning, police were left with two main theories about what might have happened. Either the women had run into foul play after accepting a boat ride with an unknown person, or they had staged had their own disappearance. Their families insisted that there was no way the young women would have voluntarily walked away from their families, but police weren't so sure. As the focus of the investigation shifted to the personal lives of the three women, investigators grew more convinced that they were dealing with a voluntary disappearance.Renee and Patty had been classmates and friends for years. They got to know Ann because she and Patty both boarded their horses at the Tricolor Stables in Palatine, Illinois. The three women had bonded over their mutual love of horses and would often ride together. On the surface, their horseback riding seemed to be a wholesome pastime, but detectives soon learned it had some sinister undertones. Tricolor Stables was owned by George Jayne. Both George and his half-brother Silas Jayne had been involved in various fraudulent activities and police were quite familiar with the pair. Police were certain that Silas had orchestrated the murder of three young boys in 1955, but they were never able to come up with the evidence needed to charge him and they suspected that George had helped him cover it up.While they may have been involved in mutual criminal activities, George and Silas were not close and there was a long-standing feud between the two of them. In June of 1965, an incident at Tricolor Stables illustrated just how serious the feud had become. George's Cadillac was blocking the entrance to the stables, and a young woman named Cheryl Ann Rude had been sent out to move it. As soon as she started the engine, the car blew up. There was no doubt that George had been the intended target, and he was sure that Silas had been behind the bombing. The incident made him so paranoid that he devised a way to start a car while standing outside the passenger side door. After Ann, Patty, and Renee went missing, there were whispers that perhaps one or more of the women had witnessed the car bomb being planted and they were killed because of it. But the bombing incident had taken place more than a year before the women went missing, and it seems unlikely that someone would have waited that long before ensuring their silence.A couple of months before the women vanished, Patty came home with an extremely bruised and swollen face. She told her family that she had an accident while horseback riding, but it was obvious to her friends that the injury had come from a fist, not a fall. When her friends asked her about it, she told them that she was having trouble with some ""horse syndicate"" people. She didn't elaborate, but her friends were sure that at least one of the Jayne brothers was to blame. Perhaps the women realized that they were in over their heads and believed that disappearing was the safest course of action.Dick Wylie was a reporter in Chicago when the women went missing, and he covered the disappearance extensively. Although he went on to become a police officer in Florida, he returned to Chicago after he retired and spent years researching this case. Dick believed that at least one of the women had arranged to have an illegal abortion done on that day, only to have something go horribly wrong. According to Dick, there was a husband and wife team who operated an illegal abortion mill on a houseboat somewhere in the waters of Lake Michigan. Their nephew would supposedly pick up women in a small boat to shuttle them to the larger boat where abortions were performed. Dick believed a botched abortion resulted in the death of one of the women, and the other two may have been killed so that there would be no witnesses. Yet the fact that the women left all their belongings on the beach makes this theory seem unlikely.It's possible the women did stage their own disappearance, and there were some credible sightings of them in Michigan after they went missing. If the women disappeared voluntarily, it would explain why they had left all of their belongings on the beach - they wanted people to think that they were dead. None of their relatives believed this was the case, but they also didn't know about some of the things that had been going on in the women's lives. They were aware that the women liked to go horseback riding together and would often meet at Tricolor Stables, but they had no idea about any of the criminal activity that was going on there. The girls were young when they started going to the stables, and they may have found some of the criminal undertones to be quite exciting at first. Eventually they would have heard rumors about the heavy criminal activity that the men were involved in; allegations of drug use, murder, and the killing of show horses for insurance money would have been hard to ignore. Patty had been roughed up on at least one occasion. Could this have been the catalyst that led to the women deciding they needed to escape somehow? It's certainly a possibility.Renee appeared to be happily married, but detectives had made an interesting discovery when they were inventorying the items she had left behind in her purse. In a letter addressed to her husband, Renee wrote that she was unhappy in her marriage and was contemplating getting a divorce. She accused her husband of spending far too much time building hot rod cars with his friends and not paying any attention to her. Her husband told investigators that he didn't think they had been having any marital problems and he was confused by the letter. Her family was also unaware of any problems in the relationship.Perhaps the best argument against the women staging their own disappearance is the fact that none of them ever contacted anyone in their families. Adults go voluntarily missing all the time, but it's extremely rare for them to never be heard from again. If the women felt that events going on in their lives that summer necessitated them running away, it's reasonable to assume that they would have reached out to their relatives once those issues had been taken care of. George Jayne was shot to death in 1970, and Silas was found guilty of conspiracy in his brother's murder and sent to prison. If the women had disappeared in an attempt to hide from the brothers, they likely would have come out of hiding once both brothers were out of the picture.It's also possible that the horse industry and its criminal connections had absolutely nothing to do with the disappearance of the three women. Although it would still be several years before Ted Bundy would capture the attention of the nation and make serial killers a household name, such killers did exist and there's always a chance that the women were unfortunate enough to cross paths with one. The man who was piloting the boat that picked the women up has never been identified, and it's unknown if he had anything to do with the disappearance or not. So many years have passed that it's possible there is no one still alive today that knows just what happened to the three women. Unless the bodies of the women are found or the killer decides to come forward, the truth may never be discovered.The women are still listed as missing persons, although police know that it is highly unlikely that any of them are still alive. The case file is still reviewed periodically, and investigators remain hopeful that they will one day learn just what happened on that hot summer day more than 50 years ago to turn a routine trip to the beach into one of Indiana's most baffling missing person cases.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2100/1*R5tSoElPlOCyDye3U1af7w.jpeg,https://medium.com/@jennbaxter_69070/cruise-to-oblivion-a-triple-disappearance-on-lake-michigan-fdb3693ea0c,fiction,f3a0237f0367ff255c0b0302992f33b9f8507a0b612064e49ad7ef75
Offline Reporting is for Chumps,"I talk to brands around the world every day. Big brands. Multibillion-dollar brands. Often it is in the context of some adtech or martech business challenge. One of my first questions is usually: ""Where's the data?""Today, most brands have contractual ownership of their data. What sort of data?In the past, much of this data was owned by the ad agency of record. Other data sets might have been owned by the publisher or media owner. Today, it is a common contractual practice to have the entity cutting all the checks (the brand) remain the owner of all the data. Although, that ownership shift took the better part of a decade to achieve.After I confirm that the brand owns the data, I typically say, ""Ok great! Can we have a look?""That's where things get awkward.There's often a chuckle or some darting stares across the conference room table (back when in-person meetings were a thing) followed by, ""Oh...uh...you'll have to ask the agency.""Just because you have a contract that says you technically own your marketing data does not mean you control it. It definitely does not mean you are getting value from it.If you do not have explicit ownership of your brand's campaign data in all of your contracts...OMG. What are you waiting for?!Just last week, the ANA released new Master Services Agreement templates (free access) and resources for ad tech and martech procurement. Also, the ANA standard contract templates for brands and agencies include language to ensure proper data ownership.Control of your brand's data does not mean that you are getting a single penny of value from it. The data exhaust coming off of all your campaigns is one of the most valuable assets your marketing department has. Is all that data goodness sitting in a virtual drawer, collecting dust? Probably.The primary reasons brands do not focus more time, energy, and resource on managing marketing data are:Remember when digital or new media was a cute little gig given to the intern to handle? No one took it seriously. Marketing crumbs were thrown at it just so the CMO could claim they were innovative. Now, the digital intern is the CMO.That's where we are right now with marketing data. The individuals that crack the code and generate millions of dollars in value using data that's otherwise just sitting around will become the marketing gods of the decade.In other newsletters, I've discussed the critical importance of first-party customer data. Owning, controlling, and creating value from marketing data includes the first-party goodies and all of the other data exhaust that comes from your campaigns. Those are the tea leaves, so to speak.For the purposes of this discussion, we will set first-party data assets aside and focus on data resulting from in-market communications.Our goal for today is to gather as much of your marketing data as possible, get control of the source, and apply a base level of reporting capability on top of it. This is the first, most basic step to get you started, but expect it to take at least six months if you also have a day job with other responsibilities.To accomplish this, you need to go hunting. A full-blown, wide-scale audit is in order. You need to turn over every stone internally, at your agencies, and within your directly owned tech platforms to get a full picture of what is out there. This is a prerequisite for all data management related work in the future. The goal is to generate an inventory or manifest of all campaign data and related brand data.Next, you need to understand what each data set contains, how it is constructed, and how the data is organized. To do this, you'll need to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty.For example, do you know what data your ad server collects? I promise you it is more than impressions, clicks, and conversions. Most ad servers have a row in a log or database for each impression with about 100 attributes and metrics for each. Your job is to understand what metrics are currently used versus what might be valuable to explore going forward.Also, you need to get a sense of how portable the data is. Can you easily move it to an external reporting tool? Is there an API? Are there data logs?Once you have a sense of what data is available, where it currently lives, and have thought up a couple of use cases, you will need to begin joining the data sets. Here is where new vendors come into the picture. You will likely need to create what is broadly known as a data lake. Note: This is where you'll probably need to phone a friend. You'll need a data architecture subject matter expert if you do not already have one.Unless you are a quant or have some level of data science experience, this area will be very foreign. That's ok. Just know that this is the central collection and processing point for all of your marketing data. It is where all the raw data finds its way home to you, where it belongs.One of the most basic services built on top of your snazzy new data lake is a reporting service. The reporting service gets presented to you, the end-user, in the form of a data visualization like those generated by Business Intelligence tools (BI tools).Some example vendors providing these services include (not exhaustive):Note: I do not endorse any of these vendors. This is just a sample of the more popular choices you'll find in the market.Once you have your source data in hand, explorable and extractable by a basic BI tool, your mind will be unlocked. If done correctly, you'll never go back to the dark days of offline reporting again.If the main way you consume or experience your campaign results is via Powerpoint reports created by someone else, stop it. Reports delivered to you via PPT, PDF, XLS, whiteboard, or crayon should be a thing of the past. The only appropriate use of Powerpoint for the delivery of campaign performance results is on a giant screen in a conference room or on stage at a trade show.Most of your campaign analysis needs (85% +) can and should be delivered in a live BI tool of some sort. Why?In short, you should have direct, near real-time access to the totality of your campaign data, including ownership and control of the underlying source data.Straight talk: this is hard work. However, it is 110% worth it and will be table stakes sooner than you realize. That means you'll have the strategic edge over your competitors (and your colleagues).Run, don't walk towards completing these five steps:🥇Ari wrote the most read AdExchanger post of 2020.

"Jin Sakai, Ramza Beoulve, and Invisible Revolutionaries","What does it mean to be a class hero? One that fades from memory, not to be a martyr or a legend but instead act as a catalyst for greater change?In video games, we often play as grand, swashbuckling heroes - characters who are larger than life because of their supernatural abilities, endless ammunition, gigantic swords, or the cadre of gods at their disposal. While the games that these characters inhabit don't always have stories that follow the logic of the gameplay (no Phoenix Down Aerith, sorry) the plot that surrounds them is still greater than anything any one of us will experience in our normal lives. Despite my greatest and most fevered wants, I will never ride an airship or fight toe to toe with a dragon god.It's a rarer thing when video game plots follow the designs of (relatively) normal people looking to make a change. While this definition of ""normal"" can be easily poked and prodded (I will also never have the sword skill of Jin Sakai or the magick of Ramza Beoulve), these class revolutionaries did not set out on some grand scheme of saving the world from a plunging meteor or a nuclear fallout. Instead, these are heroes who inspired the people around them, who took up a cause when no one else would, despite the overwhelming struggle.We live in a world of constant social and political turmoil, one that we regularly escape from by playing video games. While it's fun to exist as these larger than life characters, it's a refreshing change of pace when a video game plot has more to say beyond '""save the world and kill a god."" Final Fantasy Tactics impressed upon my youthful mind the same incredible ideologies and class conscious struggles that Ghost of Tsushima did recently, and both of these games follow selfless protagonists who risk everything in order to make a better life for their friends and countrymen. Their similarities run deep, and they mirror a political standing in their games that is incredibly important to all of our lives: stand tall against fascism, protect those you love, and fight for your home.Jin Sakai and Ramza Beoulve are both men who come from means but are struck down by the circumstances surrounding them. Jin grew up in Omi Village, was heir to the Sakai samurai clan, and fought with honor for the shogunate and Imperial Empire of Japan. Ramza grew up as the youngest son of the honorable House Beoulve, attending the prestigious academy of Gariland in order to become a squire and knight that would one day represent the needs of his House and country. Jin and Ramza both came from means, and it wasn't until they lost everything that their eyes were opened to the corruption around them.While Jin Sakai initially takes to war by preventing the siege of the Mongols upon Tsushima Island, his heroic rise as the Ghost makes the shogunate and the Imperial Empire of Japan nervous, which forces the hand of his liberal Uncle Lord Shimura. The Ghost is a legend, a war cry of the peasant class, a hero of the people who will stand against any injustice. Similarly, Ramza Beoulve seeks to rout his country of the Corpse Brigade, a band of brigands who are pillaging and ransoming the lands of his brother, Dycedarg. It is during Ramza's earnest attempt at proving he is more than just a bastard that he comes toe to toe with the truth behind the kidnappings and pillaging, and how the current ills of the peasant class have been caused by the corrupt greed of the nobility after abandoning the homeless veterans of the Fifty Years' War.Jin Sakai and Ramza Beoulve both comprise a particular brand of hero that prizes moral authority over all else, heroes who view their truths as straight and narrow, who fight not for coin or means or land but because sticking up for the meager is within the moral right. They both become peasant heroes, shadowy figures that the lowborn class can openly celebrate. Jin and Ramza are both headaches for the nobility in their respective games, each protagonist fed up with the corruption of the ruling class and how, despite their endless struggles, protecting their homelands is meaningless if the rot is deep within.As his incredible deeds give rise to the legends of the Ghost, Jin Sakai is viewed as a potential problem for the shogunate, because they are afraid of what he represents for those of the working class of Japan: the working poor, the farmers, the blacksmiths, those whose family names will never become honorable estates. The Ghost is more than a man, he is a titanic hero whose deeds represent the will of the oppressed. Jin Sakai does far more than simply drive the Mongols away from Tsushima Island - he inspires an entire generation to rise up against oppression. Near the end of the game, Jin Sakai's uncle Lord Shimura comes to him with an unfortunate demand - he must lay down the mantle of the Ghost forever, or be excommunicated from the samurai class.Jin Sakai must forsake the samurai code, because it belongs to the unfortunate few who value such ideologies above the plights of real people. Governments and laws should exist only for those they have sworn to protect. Platitudes have no meaning if they cannot save the most vulnerable. In their final exchange, when Lord Shimura and Jin must back their beliefs with their blades, Jin tells his uncle just exactly how he feels about the brittle samurai code:Similarly, Ramza realizes that his brothers' corruption is more than just a lie about the Corpse Brigade and their place in the coming War of the Lions. House Beoulve is corrupt, utilizing the war for its own ends in order to manipulate a place of prestige in greater Ivalice. Not only did Dycedarg plan the kidnapping of the Marquis and seek to undermine the lowborn rebellion, but it is discovered late in the game that he actually poisoned his own father in order to take over House Beoulve in his stead. Ramza denounces his Beoulve name, takes up his mother's maiden title, and becomes a heretic of the church. He is through and through a man of the people, not fighting for the crown, the dukes, or his own House. Ramza only cares about uncovering the truth, protecting those he loves, and standing for moral righteousness.As we've seen from our own real world history, the evolution from ignorance to understanding is a path taken by many revolutionaries. It is during one important, life-changing moment early in the game that Ramza is faced with his own harsh reality:Both of these iconoclasts tell an important story that stretches far beyond any singular historical event or video game. Class consciousness - and the struggle of rich versus poor, the haves and the have nots - is a problem at the very core of every society that's rooted in capitalism or caste. Human beings want to believe that they are more than their birth, more than their money, more than the circumstances that they are surrounded by.One of the most important aspects of both Jin and Ramza are that their greatest accomplishments are not managed alone, but supported by their comrades. Neither of them are immune to betrayal (whether it be Lord Shimura or Delita Heiral), but even the most challenging moments did not stop either character from seeking out the wisdom of those around them. The true Ghost is an amalgamation of the many people across Tsushima Island that sought to grow his legend. Jin Sakai believed in the power of his comrades, and invested his time, blood, and energy into the struggles of others because he knew the exchange would make him stronger. The comrades that Sakai found across the island gathered him a retinue of proficient allies.Ramza's quest across Ivalice and the regions of his homeland gained him a group of similar ne'er-do-wells that comprised a party of skill, means, and efficiency. The struggle of his efforts was not one built alone, but made because of the good will he presented to those who shared his moral passions. Similarly to Jin Sakai, Ramza's efforts culminate in a literal army of comrades who supported his point of view and fought to the death because they believed in his cause.For Jin Sakai, there will never be another Komoda Beach. For Ramza Beoulve, there will never be another Tietra. These moments of sacrifice, these losses have built upon them the importance of fighting with belief, with meaning. Jin must face the awful truth that it was not just the Mongols who killed the samurai that day, but the toxic idea of the code of honor that betrayed him and everyone around him, a code that cares not for people, but for empire. Ramza, when the crossbow bolt flies and takes Delita's innocent sister from the world, is shown without doubt that the nobility sees them not as people, but as chattel.Despite fighting hard for the causes they believe in, both Ramza and Jin are branded as traitors, as heretics. They are stripped of everything they once loved and pushed into the obscurity of history. This is the effectiveness of narrative control, of ""History is written by the victors"" (a quote that, ironically enough, is attributed to Winston Churchill but actually of unknown origin). Both the bastard Ramza and Clan Sakai are ripped from history, erased by those with means who wish to snuff out the fires of rebellion and revolution. Ghost of Tsushima ends with an unfortunate stand-off between Jin and his uncle, where he might abandon his name entirely for the Ghost; Final Fantasy Tactics ends with Ramza riding off into an unknown future, his name erased from the history books. Despite the attempts of the ruling class, the echoes of their causes are long felt, their stamp on the world not one of celebration or iconography but of struggle. The Ghost and Ramza fought to make the world a better place, and at that they succeeded.It's not only important to stand up for the poor, huddled masses - it's imperative. When Jin Sakai and Ramza Beoulve are confronted by the realities and cruelties of privilege, they cast it away in favor of fighting for what is right. To say that video games are not (or should not be) political decries the very nature of the art form, a medium that has the ability to present revolutionary characters and ideas in a new creative way.It's rare that we see heroes of this caliber in the gaming lexicon. Rebels of class and circumstance who risk everything - down to their very names and identities - because they believe so strongly in doing what is right and stamping out the evils of the powerful. Our own world is filled with revolutionaries, people who fought against their government, their state, and the unjust laws of their time. While it's easy enough for us to be distracted by the otherworld of gaming, Ramza Beoulve and Jin Sakai are reminders of what is actually at stake and what matters. I applaud the scenario writers and game developers who take chances on characters that inspire others, whose revolutionary actions create waves throughout time and history and add to the momentum of what we are currently seeing in our own lifetimes.Jin Sakai and Ramza Beoulve may be invisible in their respective games, but to us, they are titanic reminders of what can be accomplished by resisting privilege and oppression, by fighting for what is right, and by standing up for those who cannot fight for themselves.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*nYSD1ChJ7DFSOoLNXj9jEw.png,https://medium.com/super-jump/jin-sakai-ramza-beoulve-and-invisible-revolutionaries-df9bae9b4164,fiction,f5d6a764313032f15c8a345b0368351333807775101fb84a1da8525a
The Tinder Chronicles: The Guy Who Rode a Unicycle,"In his Tinder profile picture, Terry was balanced on a unicycle - with a parrot perched on his shoulder. Of course I swiped right; this was a guy who looked like he had an interesting story. I was tired of the same old ""Let's get drinks and talk about bland topics"" dates. I wanted something different.Terry was definitely different.We met at Piedmont Park, where Terry had suggested we could ride bikes. That sounded like fun to me, so I put on a cute outfit and arrived early, in the off-chance that parking would be an issue.I was standing under the shade of a large tree when I first spotted Terry. Really, there was no mistaking the boy.Terry was coming toward me, a huge grin plastered on his face - as he pumped his legs on his unicycle.""Hi, Viggy!"" He had to nearly shout to make himself heard - because this wasn't a normal unicycle. He was perched on a cycle that was at least five feet tall. When he reached me, he threaded his fingers through one of the tree's low-hanging branches and came to a wobbly stop.I had been so distracted by his dramatic entrance that it wasn't until I heard a squawky ""Viggy! Viggy!"" that I realized his beloved parrot was, of course, perched on his shoulder.""Wow,"" I said, craning my neck to get a look at Terry and his parrot.""His name is Julius,"" he said.As if on cue, Julius squawked, ""No shit, Sherlock!""I recoiled in surprise. ""You taught him to swear?""Even at such a great height, I could see Terry blush. Sheepishly, he said, ""Julius has been with me since I was a kid, when I was...fairly immature.""""Oh boy,"" I said, laughing. My movements jostled the sunglasses perched atop my head, and they fell to the ground with a clack.""Fuck!"" Julius yelled, earning horrified and disapproving looks from a few nearby strangers.Terry only shrugged, which made Julius ruffle his wings and readjust his feet on Terry's shoulder.""So, um,"" I said, bending to pick up my sunglasses, ""Are you going to come down from there?""""Once I'm up, I stay up,"" he said. ""I thought you were bringing your own bike?""""I don't have one,"" I said. ""I thought we were renting bikes?""""That's bullshit!"" Julius yelled, startling me yet again.Terry laughed uncomfortably. ""I guess we can just walk, then? Or, I mean, you can walk, and I'll cycle next to you.""""Oh,"" I said, already feeling less excited about Terry. ""Okay.""I stepped out from under the shade of the tree and started walking slowly along the path. After a bit of swearing from both Terry and Julius, the unicycle squeaked onto the pavement next to me, and we were off.""So,"" I said, nearly having to shout just so Terry could hear me all the way up in the clouds, ""what do you do for a living?""""It's not that interesting,"" he said, reaching into his pocket with one hand. ""I work at Katz's Deli downtown during the day, but at night, I'm a performer with the Atlanta Circus.""Ah, now it all made sense. The unicycle, the parrot, the unwavering commitment to the act. I could see it all.Without waiting for a response, he said, ""Oh, I almost forgot. This was on special today because it's going bad soon, and I thought you might like some?"" He pulled his hand out of his pocket and tilted his palm, sending a sweaty stack of ham slices raining down onto my head. ""Oops, sorry about that!""""Fuck that shit!"" Julius squawked.The ham was already starting to smell, and I feared I wouldn't be able to get the stench out of my hair for quite awhile. ""Um, thanks? I'm a vegetarian, though.""""Oh. Whoopsie!""I was in the process of picking the rotten chunks of ham out of my carefully coiffed hair, trying not to make a big deal out of it, when several things happened in rapid succession.First, I heard Terry scream, ""No, Julius! No!""Next, I felt Julius' little clawed feet alight in my hair, where he proceeded to peck at my scalp, foraging for the ham, no doubt. I started yelling and batting my head, letting go of my calm demeanor completely.Then, I heard a rickety metal clacking, and Terry was sprawled out on the pavement by my side.""Unnhhhh,"" he said, before trying awkwardly to push himself up. ""Julius, stop!""Despite his grasp of inappropriate language, Julius was not a well-trained parrot. He was still pecking at my head in a frenzy. Unintentionally, I had started to jog around, fanning my head to no avail. Just when I thought I'd have to find a really creative way to explain my bare scalp to my hairdresser, I finally caught hold of Julius' little claw and managed to pull him off of my head.""Let me go, bitch! Let me go, skank! This is bullshit!"" he squawked, flapping his wings uncontrollably. Terry was still somewhere behind me, struggling to remount his unicycle.""Okay, we're done here,"" I said, and took a deep breath. I readied myself, and then I released Julius while simultaneously taking off in a sprint. I held my arms over my head as tightly as possible, and didn't stop running until I was back at my car.What I had feared ended up coming true - my hair smelled like Terry's discount ham for weeks.",https://miro.medium.com/max/6334/0*DU1ULR22E2KhGEvR,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-tinder-chronicles-the-guy-who-rode-a-unicycle-2ca9906cb7d3,fiction,f9bfd1dd2345cc161b245a1db3518379eda3969581e193b20daed057

How To Get Unstuck,"By Stephanie HarrisonYou know what to do, but you can't make yourself do it.You know that if you took that leap, things would be so much better - but the leap is too big and scary.You sit down each day with the resolve to do the big thing, but at the end of every day, it is still unchecked on your to-do list.Getting stuck is an inevitable part of living a New Happy life. It isn't a moral failing or something wrong with you: it's just something normal that happens when you are pursuing your dreams. Because if there is one thing that your brain doesn't like, it's feeling scared. It will do whatever it takes to stop you from taking the step into the scary unknown. If you want to live your true potential, it's essential that you learn the skill of coaxing yourself into coming out of the safe, cozy cave and into the daylight to make stuff happen.Here are the three steps that will help you to get unstuck.When you are stuck, your brain is running two completely conflicting programs. The first program, run by our primitive brain, senses imminent danger and is screaming at us to not take a single step further. When this program is in control, you tend to either stare hopelessly at your task, procrastinate endlessly, or simply give up before you get started.The second part of our brain, run by our more evolved selves, is begging us to please, please, please, just open the email and send it, start the poem, or make the call. It's reminding you that you decided on this goal for a reason and that you really want to achieve it because it will make you happier. It also loves to berate you, telling you that you're flawed and stupid and horrible because you can't just do the thing.The primitive program and the evolved program are battling it out in an arm wrestle fight for control. Usually, neither one wins, and deadlocked, you end up doing nothing for days and months and years, torn between stopping and starting.To trick your brain, you need to shrink the task that your evolved self has set your primitive self. Big tasks that represent extreme vulnerability and require big courage like ""Write a book"" or ""Start a company"" are way too much for the primitive program to cope with. They trigger instant five-alarm alerts. Instead, you have to shrink the big dream into separate tasks that are much more palatable, ones that your primitive brain might not even realize ladder up into the bigger dream. ""Write a book"" turns into ""write 100 words each day."" ""Start a company"" turns into ""buy a domain name today."" This allows you to gently coax your primitive program into doing what your evolved program wants to.Sometimes we get stuck because we have developed an external locus of control, which is the belief that external circumstances have control over your life, and what you do doesn't really matter. If you have an external locus of control, you might catch yourself engaging in self-talk like ""nothing I do really matters,"" ""this is never going to change,"" or ""no matter how hard I try, I won't succeed."" (To learn a lot more about your locus of control, check out our new book, which teaches you how to reclaim control in the pandemic!)If your conflicting brain programs have been locked in an arm-wrestle for a while, you'll likely develop an external locus of control. When times are hard, like these ones, it's even easier to start to believe that your life isn't your responsibility. Why bother acting? Nothing matters. Your lack of activity then results in no progress or changes, making you feel even more stuck. It's a vicious cycle.You have to reclaim a sense of agency by exercising control over your life in some way. My favorite way to do this is to make some really weird choices that shake up this mindset. Here are a few examples:If you normally walk or drive a specific route to work, take a completely different oneIf you usually have yogurt and granola for weekday breakfast, make yourself a full-on bacon and eggs breakfastIf you always flop on the couch when you get home, flop on the floor and do 20 pushups insteadAny small, strange choice jostles your mindset just enough to see that, in fact, you are always making choices, not acting is still a choice, and you've just gotten mired in a pattern of making choices that make you feel stuck.Through our relationships with other people, we can find the security and safety that inspires us to take big, bold risks. If we believe that we have enough support - and critically, that that support will still be there no matter what happens with the risk - we can release ourselves from our self-imposed prisons. I love how New Happy member Steph described this:""My friends often have different perspectives than me and provide great words of wisdom on how I can reframe the situation and become more action-oriented (rather than dwell on a situation). Knowing that I can take action on the situation and make it better, rather than being a victim, helps me feel less stuck.""Who in your life makes you feel safe and secure? Who can you share your dreams with? Who unconditionally supports your biggest, boldest ideas? These are your essential sources of support when you're stuck. Here are a few ways you can lean on them to get unstuck:The next time you find yourself stuck, try out one of these strategies. The more that you use them, the more you'll discover that getting unstuck is simply a skill that, like anything else, can be developed and strengthened.Here's to you moving past roadblocks with record speed!-The story was previously published on The Good Men Project.-Stephanie Harrison is the founder & CEO of The New Happy, a platform and community changing the way the world thinks about happiness.

The Devil You Know,"Fiona knows how to talk to the police. Step one, of course, is to tell them she wasn't in the room when it happened. Tell them she was upstairs in a room directly above her kitchen ceiling. Tell them she had no idea there was anything amiss until she walked downstairs to find her boyfriend on the kitchen floor, blood gushing out of his forehead and stretching out into long red lines between the metal tiles.""So, you didn't hear any noise?"" the officer asks. ""You didn't hear anyone walk in or out the front door? No screams, no nothing?""She shakes her head. She tells him she was in the upstairs bathroom, which has an overhead fan that must've drowned out any outside noise. Fiona almost says she was taking a shower, but she won't get away with that. Her hair's dry.Step two - just as important - is to make it clear she doesn't approve of any of this.""I'm appalled that he would do such a thing,"" Fiona says, when they ask if she knew he was planning to remove his chip. ""It's so... unpatriotic, you know? He must not have been thinking clearly. He must not've been..."" She trails off, the suddenness of his death washing over her. Adam had been wide awake in the seconds before he died. Grimacing, but otherwise alright. He'd sat in the chair by the kitchen table, gripping the armrest tight as she cut into his temple. Fiona had used a surgical knife as well as an injected anesthetic beforehand, which didn't help as much as it usually did.""And you think he did this all by himself?"" the officer asks. He's not watching her face as he questions her; he's looking at the app on his phone, the app that tells him what her own chip - registered Fiona Curad 481-51-6234 - picks up. If the chip notices any spikes in her heart rate, her blood pressure, what have you, it'll give her away.""I don't know anyone else who could've helped him,"" she says. ""If he told me what he was planning, I would've turned him in.""The officer looks up at her and nods. Her chip didn't betray her, it seems.""A couple more things,"" he says. ""Do you live alone?""She gives a short, pained laugh. ""I do now, I guess.""""Are you affiliated with any political party?""She gives the safest response. ""No, I don't really follow politics.""""Alright. Do you think you have any idea as to what his motives were? Was it a typical suicide, or some sort of protest thing?""""I have no idea. There were no signs or anything. His job was going fine, our relationship's been going well, I thought. He just seemed completely normal. I'm sorry, I know that's not helpful, but...""She trails off again. Adam's last words come back to her suddenly, hitting her hard, as if she's hearing it again for the first time. He'd said, as her surgical knife dug deeper into his skin, ""You're lucky I'm a masochist."" Fiona had laughed at this, and when she laughed her hand trembled slightly, and apparently that was all it took. The metal of the knife hit the chip, and the chip went ahead and sent a thousand or so volts straight through his body.She'd been wearing rubber gloves just in case this sort of thing happened. When the shock went through him, his head jerked forward, pushing the knife further in. She'd screamed at this point and let go of the handle, and could only watch as the convulsions sent him falling back with his chair, the knife sliding out of him and skidding across the floor. She only had a few moments to spare, so she opened up the door to the basement and threw her gloves down the stairs, then took all the other supplies and shoved them back into the cabinet below the sink. The police were at the door within a minute.""One last question,"" the officer says. ""Are you aware that lying to the police about a matter such as this is, in and of itself, an offense punishable by up to five years in prison?""Step three of talking to the police - and this one is the most important - is to stay polite. Never explicitly refuse them the benefit of the doubt.""Of course,"" Fiona says. She even smiles apologetically. ""I'm sorry if I'm not speaking coherently right now, I'm still really shaken up, but I would never knowingly lie to an officer.""""Good to know,"" he says, and for the first time in the conversation, Fiona makes an effort to look at him, to really commit his appearance to memory. Officer Cohen. He's younger than she thought he was a few seconds ago - looks only a few years out of high school. The way they keep lowering the prerequisites to be a cop, soon some of them will actually be high school students. He's thin and has tired eyes, and he's a good head taller than her. He scratches the stubble on his neck as he responds. ""I'm sorry for your loss.""""Thanks,"" she says, and that's the end of it. Adam's body is carried away, the mess of the floor is cleaned up, and that leaves Fiona alone in what is now only her house. She sits in the chair where Adam died and, finally alone, lets herself mourn.Officer Sean Cohen doesn't really feel like a police officer, and he's still sort of amazed that people treat him like one. The worst part is giving tickets. When he was on highway patrol duty six months back, every time he had to fine people he kept expecting the driver to mouth off to him. If one of them had said 'come on, man, you're really going to give me a ticket?' Sean probably would find himself apologizing and backing off.But nobody did, of course, because everyone he fined knew exactly what they did and knew there was no lie they could say to exonerate themselves. If you drive over the speed limit, the chip records it. If you drive intoxicated, the chip records it. There's little need for detectives anymore, because there's nothing you can deduce that the chip won't tell you.Sean sits in the passenger seat as his partner drives them back to the precinct, taking a look at Fiona's chip data and wondering what to do with it.If citizens knew just how advanced chip technology has gotten, they'd never try to lie to the police again. The chip doesn't just monitor heart-rate - it analyzes brain activity, blood pressure, and makes its own conclusions on the cop's behalf. It can't tell you exactly what someone's thinking, but it can tell you what they're feeling with 95% accuracy. And when Fiona said she had no idea what happened, the app on Sean's phone read 'LYING' in big red letters.But Sean hadn't said anything. His partner had been the one examining the body while he talked to Fiona, so Sean's the only one in the world who's seen the proof of the woman's lie. Most likely scenario: she and her boyfriend were planning on fleeing the country, and the plan went horribly wrong.""We can just keep this as a suicide,"" Sean says to his partner. ""No need to start an investigation.""""Seems pretty suspicious to me,"" the partner says, but doesn't push it further. He smiles slightly and keeps his eyes on the road. It's a poor neighborhood, but there's no graffiti on the buildings, no broken windows or any excessive litter on the ground.Sean thinks back to Fiona, who'd been fighting back real tears and real tremors throughout their conversation. The grief was real, that's for sure, and if she'd been born a couple years earlier, her chip probably wouldn't be advanced enough to give her complicity away. Sean would've dismissed her as nothing more interesting than a regular victim.But he doesn't want to think too much about Fiona anymore, with her dead boyfriend, and the sheer amount of confidence she must've had to lie to a cop's face, to a cop's phone. She should be handcuffed in the back of the car right now, not sitting in her house.No matter. While his partner drones on about his wife, Sean takes out the chip tracker on his police-issued phone and puts in the name of the guy from the hook-up app: Joey. He doesn't know Joey's last name. He knows Joey's face, his body type, and his age. A last name was never listed on his profile.When not many results come up, Sean types in 'Joseph', and there he is: the third name down shows a driver's license of a young man with a crew cut and a five o'clock shadow. He's smiling in the picture, even though you're not supposed to do that for ID photos. Just the sight of his face sends a nervous, excited tingle in Sean's arms, in his legs.Joseph Accuri, that was his full name. At nineteen he was a little younger than Sean, but from their conversation last night he seemed older, so much more comfortable in his own skin. Chatting through the app last night, Joey said he'd been with several other guys before, and Sean asked him if he was worried his parents would find out. ""They stopped monitoring my chip when I turned eighteen,"" he messaged back. ""They're old fashioned like that.""""Lucky,"" Sean responded. He turned twenty-two last month, and despite moving away from home last year, he's never been able to shake the feeling that his parents are watching his every move.The chip, after all, told them everything. As a kid it would tell them when he was sleeping and when he was pretending to be. It would tell them if he was really sick or if he was faking it to get out of school. The chips tracked his movements every day and his parents would be able to tell exactly where he was and what he was doing at any point. If he ever dared to do drugs, the chip would detect it. If he ever told a lie, the chip would detect it. He remembered the first time he'd masturbated when he was eleven years old and didn't quite understand what was going to happen. A classmate told him that when your thing got hard you were supposed to stroke it up and down until white stuff came out, and that's exactly what Sean did, alone in his bedroom when he was supposed to be studying. The classmate hadn't said anything about his heart rate, though. Sean's pants were still down around his ankles and he was just starting to clean himself off with a napkin when his father burst through the door, yelling at the top of his lungs. WE DO NOT DO THAT IN THIS FAMILY.""Cohen."" His partner snaps his fingers at him. ""Cohen, come on.""The car has pulled into the precinct parking lot, and his partner stands with one foot still in the car, looking down at him with annoyed concern. Sean nods and opens the passenger door.Back in Fiona's fourth-grade health class, they explained it like this: kids used to go missing all the time. There were all sorts of creeps out there who would snatch up children, take advantage of them, kill them, and get away with it. When they told them this a kid in her class piped up, ""Why couldn't they just track these guys down?""""They couldn't,"" the teacher said.""Why couldn't they?""""Because they didn't have chips.""Turns out, back then if anything happened to you, that was it. You were gone forever. Maybe they'd find you, but odds were you'd be dead by the time they did.""Things got really bad,"" the teacher explained. It got to the point where parents were afraid to let their kids play outside. Parents and teachers would always have to keep an eye on them, and kids wouldn't get to go out and explore and be kids like they used to.The solution was simple. People didn't like it at first, but 'progress is never recognized as progress at the time.' At first the tracking chips were voluntary, and then it became national policy to insert them into babies' heads at birth. This way there was no pain involved - no pain you'd remember, anyway - and the kids would be safe for the rest of their lives. Some people didn't like this - 'there's always someone who doesn't like something' - but by the time Fiona was born, nobody thought twice.In the beginning these chips had been big and clunky, about a penny long and half-a-penny wide. Now the chips are the size of a tiny little bead. If you hold one in your hand it can easily slip between your fingers. God forbid it lands in a carpet, it'll be gone forever.After the cops leave and her house is empty, Fiona takes the chair Adam died in and drags it by the cabinet under the sink. She steps on the seat and reaches all the way to the back of the top shelf to pick up the burner phone. The phone knows who she needs to call when she turns it on.Carrie answers almost immediately. ""How'd it go?""""Bad,"" she says. She almost laughs at her simplicity. ""The chip electrocuted him. I had to hide everything. Cops think it was a suicide though; they don't suspect me. Well, they didn't arrest me or anything.""""Oh, Fiona, I'm so sorry,"" she says. After the socially appropriate pause, she continues: ""Are you sure they don't suspect you, though? The cops in this neighborhood aren't exactly trustworthy.""""I'm certain,"" she says. ""Don't worry about it.""Her relationship with Carrie goes like this: somebody needs to go off the grid, so they contact her, who contacts Fiona, who helps them remove the chip from their head. Usually it's simple: she cuts it out quickly, and within two seconds she places the chip inside one of the black-market cube-sized containers - they call them hosts. These hosts can imitate the conditions of the human body, tricking the chip into thinking it's still in the original person's head. At the police station, where they monitor the chips, this procedure comes across as a standard blip in the system, something that apparently happens all the time. It took decades for the underground resistance to develop this technology.The caveat is that the host can only imitate the conditions of the body at rest. To try to mimic the blood pressure and heart-rate changes that occur throughout the day is too advanced for them to handle yet. Which means that the moment the chip is taken out of someone, it's time for them to get the hell out of the country as soon as possible. Either that or accept that their life here will be entirely underground. Hospitals, airports, trains, buses - you can't get in them if you're a citizen without a chip. You have to have a chip if you value your freedom.After the phone call with Carrie, Fiona picks up her standard personal phone, and pauses. Now would be the time to notify Adam's family of what happened. She'll have to call his parents first - his mother will probably pick up the phone - and explain that their son killed himself trying to get his chip out.They won't believe her. They'll start asking questions, and soon it'll get to the point where they'll wonder just how the hell this managed to happen without her knowing. How could she not be a willing accomplice? And of course, all the other fights they've had will come back to haunt her. Adam talked to his parents about everything, after all; they must know how often they've fought in the past few years. They must have an idea of why there hadn't been a proposal yet, how Fiona wanted children and Adam didn't, how Fiona would drink a little bit too much too early in the night and Adam would make some snide comment - 'yeah you shouldn't be a mom' - and Fiona would snap at him, try to make him explain just what exactly he fucking meant by that, but Adam would close down and not want to talk about it. He never wanted to talk about anything.She needs to make the phone call though. If she wants to seem innocent, she has to do what an innocent person would do and start calling the friends and family of the deceased.She holds the phone in her hand but nothing happens. The phone doesn't know who she wants to call.Sean's roommate and his friends are on VR in the living room when he gets home from work. He walks past them into the kitchen, grabs a six pack of beer from the fridge and heads to his room. As he plugs in his phone for an insta-charge, he downs one can. As he turns on the hook-up app, he starts sipping on another.Joey is already online. ""How are you?"" he sends, almost immediately.""Feeling good,"" he messages back. It feels wrong once he sends it, but there's nothing he can do about that.Joey's response is nearly immediate, no hesitation. ""Still good for tonight?""""Yeah, I can be there at nine.""""Nice,"" Joey says, and sends him his address. It's the same address from the police files, just two blocks away. You can never trust people online - Sean keeps expecting he'll walk into Joey's apartment to find his own parents sitting on the couch, waiting for him with their arms crossed. But at the very least, he knows Joey's telling the truth about his apartment. He lives where he says he lives. He feels comfortable giving away his address, whereas Sean would never dare give him his. Not yet, at least.Sean checks the time, double-checks it. He's got an hour before he's expected to leave. He finishes his second beer and starts taking off his uniform. Before taking a shower he spends a few minutes pacing around his room in his underwear, sipping through the third can. He rubs his hands through his hair and mutters reassurances to himself.This is what I want. He's going to have sex with another guy, and it's going to be totally fine, natural even, nothing he should be ashamed of. No one from work will know, his parents will never find out, and even if they do who cares?More than anything he just needs someone to touch him. Nobody's ever caressed his face or kissed him on the forehead or rested their head on his shoulder. When he sent a face pic of himself last night, Joey called him cute. When was the last time anyone said something like that to him?When he goes to take a shower, he brings the fourth beer into the bathroom with him.The sky outside is dark now, and Fiona still hasn't called anyone. She places the phone down on the table and rests her head in her hands. She still sits in the chair where she killed Adam - how can she call her family and tell them she had nothing to do with it?She considers her next-door neighbors, and whether the police will ever question them. They must've heard her and Adam fighting at times, and Fiona still remembers the mortifying moment when one of her neighbors, a small old lady who'd been born in pre-chip days, knocked on their front door in the middle of an argument and asked with genuine concern, ""Is everything okay?""Eventually someone'll piece together Fiona's place in this, and soon after they'll wonder if the slip in the knife was truly an accident. Maybe Carrie will even question the same thing too. After all, Fiona performs these surgeries once or twice a week and has never once messed up until now, when she had a knife on the temple of a man she both loved and hated, who constantly belittled her role within the resistance but could still always make her laugh, who took his frustrations with his work out on her but always made up for it later. It was impossible to be mad at him for more than a day or two, and this morning she didn't think she was mad at him.Granted, he was leaving her forever, but she wasn't mad. They'd both agreed it was the right thing to do. Adam was losing his job - it hadn't been explicitly stated, but he'd seen the writing on the wall and knew he only had a month or so left before layoffs hit him. And they both knew this relationship was coming to an end. Fiona wanted kids and he didn't. Adam wanted to leave this country and she didn't. And after months of ridiculing her role as the resistance's on-call underpaid surgeon - ""they're just using you, they'll probably throw you under the bus the moment they find someone more qualified"" - she couldn't help but resent how he now wanted her to do the procedure on him. Fiona called Carrie and asked her to provide Adam safe passage out of the country, and Carrie had reluctantly agreed.Fiona keeps staring at the phone on the table. She tells herself it's understandable for someone in her position to not call straight away, for her to be too distraught to start planning for a funeral the night of her boyfriend's death. Sure, he wasn't technically her boyfriend at the time of his death - their relationship had been all but over the moment he decided he wanted to leave the country - but nobody needs to know that.Sean drinks the rest of the beer before leaving, and as he makes the walk over to Joey's apartment he resents how little the beer affects him. He expects to feel tipsy, at least a little buzzed if nothing else, but when he gets to the building to find Joey waiting by the entrance, as agreed, he still feels sober.""Hey,"" Joey says when Sean gets within talking distance. He looks exactly like his profile pic, except smaller somehow, less intimidating. He's wearing a hoodie and sweatpants and he's slouching a little bit, but otherwise there's no deception here that Sean can pick up. Every question Sean asked him, every pic Joey sent, seems to have been honest.""Hey,"" Sean says. They don't shake hands, that would be too formal for what this is. They don't do anything, really; Joey smiles and then walks to the entrance to the apartment lobby, lets the scanner detect and identify his chip, and opens the door.They don't talk on the elevator ride up. Sean almost says something a couple of times, but stops himself. There's no small talk he can make that won't sound fake, forced. The only thing he wants to ask is what they're going to do together, what is expected of Sean. He understands the basics, of course, but he wants a rundown of what exactly is going to happen. But he can't talk about that, so they spend the elevator ride and the walk to Joey's door in complete silence. Sean accidentally shoulders the elevator wall as he's walking out, but doesn't acknowledge it.He follows Joey into his apartment, past a living area where two other guys are watching TV. Nobody says hi to Sean, nobody seems to notice him, but surely they still see him going into Joey's room and Joey closing the door behind him.""Those your roommates?"" he asks as the door behind them.""Yeah.""""They know you're gay?""""Probably,"" he says. ""I mean if they haven't figured it out by now..."" He smiles at the floor and takes off his hoodie, revealing a plain white t-shirt underneath. Sean can make out the shape of his nipples showing through the fabric.Sean takes off his own jacket, the zipper feeling unusually stiff as he pulls it down. The sleeves try to cling to his arms as he pulls the jacket off completely.Joey takes a seat on his bed, the blankets and sheets all shoved up against the wall, and gestures for him to sit down next to him. Quietly, Sean does. And then they sit there, their knees touching, and Joey looks at him nervously, expectantly, so for the first time in his life Sean leans in for the kiss.He thought making out would be intuitive, but it isn't. He tries to move his lips the way people do in movies, but it feels clumsy and dry, embarrassing. He stops for a moment, blushes. ""I'm sorry,"" he says. The implications of this, the fact that even something as simple as this will always be weird and awkward, starts to dawn on him. ""I've never done this before...""But Joey doesn't laugh at him or get annoyed. He's still smiling, looking at Sean with kind, knowing eyes. This was a big part of why Sean chose him out of all the other profiles to talk to - not because he was good looking or his particular type - just because he seemed nice.Joey kisses him back this time and after another few seconds Sean gets the hang of it. A rhythm's established and things feel a little better. He could feel Joey's tongue in his mouth, and that's fine. The stubble around Joey's mouth starts to chafe his lips a little, and that's fine too.This goes on for probably two or three minutes, but it feels longer. At no point does anyone burst through the door. After a while Sean's aware of what he should do: lean him forward so that Joey's with his back on the bed and Sean's on top of him. This doesn't happen though, because it feels like way too bold a move. Sean's comfortable here, and if Joey wants to lean him back he'll go along with it.After a certain point Joey pulls away. ""Should we... take off our shirts?""When fantasizing about this moment Sean's always assumed that no one would have to ask this question, that they'd be going at it furiously and they'd be taking each other's clothes off without even having to speak. Instead, Joey has to suggest it out loud, and in utter silence they both take off their shirts and look at each other.Joey's clean-shaven under his shirt, and he's got a little bit of that lower stomach fat that Sean himself is trying to lose. Below Joey's belly button, his penis is stiff and pressing up under his sweatpants.Sean's own penis is soft, dormant. Again in his fantasies he's always assumed he'd have a boner in an instant, that by the time they had their clothes off he'd have to concentrate to avoid coming prematurely. But no: even as they go back to making out, even as he feels up Joey and Joey feels him, he doesn't grow an inch.Joey starts kissing his neck, his shoulder. Sean considers doing the same to him but again it feels too bold of a move, even though he knows it isn't. He starts thinking about what his dad would say if he could see him now. By this point, his dad probably wouldn't even yell at him or guilt him; he'd probably just laugh, or sigh and shake his head at how pathetic this is. Not only are you a pervert; you're a pervert with a limp dick. He can't even sin correctly.Joey pulls away and asks him with a shy, excited voice, ""What do you want to do now?""Sean can't answer. Again, this isn't how he's pictured this. By this point he should be so heated up that he wouldn't even have to explain what he wants and what he doesn't want. They should be taking off each other's clothes in a passionate frenzy, not quietly taking their own shirts off. There are a lot of things Sean thought he'd want to do, but right now asking for it - saying it out loud - seems impossible. An erection seems impossible for him right now, and they're both painfully aware of it.Sean looks away from Joey and, for the first time that night, takes a real look around the room. There's a desk near the corner with a bunch of books and papers on it. What type of books, Sean can't tell. What was on the papers, Sean can't tell. The wall is covered with posters of movies Sean has never seen, of bands Sean isn't familiar with.Sean tries to answer Joey's question with something assertive, but all he manages to say when he turns back around to Joey is, ""Can we just... try again? Some other time?"" Sean's still got his pants and his shoes on, but feels completely naked as he asks.For a moment he thinks Joey's going to snap at him for wasting his time, ('Seriously? Are you fucking kidding me?') but he never does. He nods and says, ""Yeah, no problem,"" without a hint of anger, as if he doesn't feel inconvenienced, or led on, or disappointed.They put their shirts and jackets back on and Joey leads him out of the apartment. They make some small talk on the way out, none of which Sean can recall by the time he makes it to the elevator.They say goodbye as the doors close and Sean, alone in the elevator, leans his head against the wall and grips the railing. He somehow makes it out of the building without bumping into anything.The burner phone rings. It's Carrie.Fiona exhales when she recognizes the number. She still hasn't called anyone about Adam's death and now, for at least a minute or two, she won't have to.""Hello?"" says Fiona.""Hey,"" says Carrie, and just from the tone Fiona knows this isn't good. ""We've got some bad news.""Fiona waits for her to continue, rubbing her free hand against the edge of her table. Something with the cops, it has to be. The officers have picked up on her lying. Maybe they've left a bug in the home. Somehow they picked up on Fiona's connection to Carrie and now everyone'll be going to jail.""We're going to have to let you go,"" Carrie says. ""From our organization, I mean. We've found another surgeon - he's an actual, licensed surgeon - so it's not necessary for you to risk your life for us anymore.""Fiona processes the news, and the way that Carrie says it so it sounds like this is a good thing, as if she's lifting a weight off Fiona's shoulders. ""I don't mind risking my life for this,"" she says. ""And if this surgeon is ever sick or unavailable, I'm willing to fill in for him. In fact, maybe I can train with him, y'know? He could help me so I don't make this kind of mistake again, and then you won't have to rely on just one person.""Carrie sighs, and Fiona feels a grim sort of satisfaction at the sound. Carrie knows she won't be able to lie to her now.""I'm sorry, Fiona. There was a vote, and they've decided you're too big of a liability. I mean, you killed a person. I know it was an accident and I don't blame you, but it was in your house, and the cops have definitive proof you were in your home when it happened.""""I told you, the cops don't suspect me. If they did they wouldn't have let me go.""""There are plenty of reasons why they wouldn't arrest you on the spot,"" she says, and Fiona knows she's right. ""They've probably put you on a watchlist. There's probably a guy at the station tracking your every move in real time. They're waiting for you to feel a false sense of security, to think you're safe enough to go back to whatever criminal activity they suspect you of doing.""As she talks Fiona keeps opening her mouth and closing it when she can't find anything to say. It doesn't matter that it was a freak accident, it doesn't matter what the cops did or that Adam is dead. The fact is that it happened, and now Fiona is contaminated. None of Carrie's people could ever be around her again without smelling that cop odor all over her.Carrie continues, ""We're not abandoning you, y'know. The deal stays open.""""What deal?"" Fiona says, because she needs to say something. She already knows what the deal is.""We can still take your chip out and take you out of the country. We're still willing to do that.""""I don't want that.""Carrie snaps at her. ""Why not? You've helped so many people get out to a better place, why wouldn't you want to follow them? Do you enjoy living the way you do, where everything you do and feel can be observed by some undertrained asshole with a badge? You can start a new life. Go to someplace better. As long as you stay here you will never have any real freedom. Get out while you can.""Fiona shakes her head as if Carrie can see her. She's afraid if she tries to talk, she'll cry, but she talks anyway and manages to get the words out. ""Can you give me time to think it over?""""You shouldn't have to think this over.""Her voice breaks completely: ""Can you give me time?""She sighs again, and as Fiona struggles to regain her composure, Carrie says with an exhausted tone: ""If you decide to do it, call me by tomorrow at noon. Otherwise, throw that phone away and don't call me again.""Sean wanders through the city. He doesn't know where he's going; he just goes.He wonders what Joey is thinking right now. Hopefully, Joey's shrugged the whole encounter off and doesn't take it personally. Surely Sean isn't the first person to bail from a hook-up like this, but it must've stung a little to see him suddenly take off.Maybe Joey's seen his type, though. Guys who wuss out and leave. It's honestly a little comforting to think he's a type, one of the many guys in the world who don't know what they want and are too afraid to find out. Was Sean even gay? He's spent the past few years slowly accepting that he is, and in one night that sense of gradually encroaching certainty has vanished completely.He walks past a group of drunk, careless twenty-somethings, talking aimlessly to each other with a familiarity Sean's never had. He tries to imagine himself having sex with any of them and can't. Even as they pass by each other they're all too far away.He ends up at a bus stop bench in a quiet part of town. There are no apartments here, only tiny houses all squeezed close together. Most of the lights are off, and the street itself is completely empty. The only sound is the crickets, the wind, and the car engines from the main road, far away.Sean sits down and thinks back to what he's just been through. He edits the scene in his mind, inserting little changes in places where he should've done something differently. In his head he doesn't mess up the first kiss and he knows exactly what to do with his hands. He'd expected this night to be some kind of turning point, as if hooking up with some random guy on an app would give him clarity. Instead he's out in the cold a long walk from home, and he has no idea who he is.Fiona still hasn't called Adam's friends and family. Depending on the choice she makes, after all, she might not have to. All she has to do is leave the country. Throw her job, her friends and her home away in order to achieve some wonderful concept of freedom in some place she's never been.She realizes with a sudden clarity that she's been sitting at her kitchen table for several hours now. The antique analog clock on the wall's been ticking the whole time and she hasn't registered the sound in hours. She hasn't eaten or gone to the bathroom since two or three in the afternoon, and now the world outside the windows is cold and dark.When she stands up it feels miraculous, like she hasn't realized she could leave the chair until just now. She goes to the bathroom, then when she comes out she pours herself a glass of water. Somehow she isn't hungry yet.She finishes the glass of water and looks at her reflection in the window above the sink. The woman has bags under her eyes and her hair is a frazzled mess, but she still looks kind of good. Fiona's favorite part about herself is the fact that she's always looked young; this was a hassle in her early twenties when she was constantly mistaken for a minor, but nowadays it's nice to look in the mirror and see a young woman's face looking back at her. She's always felt older than she looked, but right now her face is a good fit.Something catches Fiona's eye, something in the window.She squints, looking past her own reflection, and sees a man sitting at the bus stop across the street. There won't be a bus coming on that route until four in the morning.She almost leans forward but stops herself - with the kitchen light on, the only way she'd be able to see him clearly is if she pressed her whole face against the window, and then, of course, she'll have given herself away.She turns off all the lights on the main floor and walks upstairs. She turns on the hallway light and her bedroom light, then walks back downstairs. She creeps through the dark, quiet kitchen and leans up against the window. She can see clearly into the street outside.The cop from today. Officer Cohen.He's just sitting there outside her house in normal civilian clothes, all alone. Fiona stares at him for a long time, the analog clock ticking loudly above her. She expects him to have his phone out, to be studying her heart rate and observing her location, but instead he doesn't seem to be looking at anything. Sometimes his mouth moves like he's talking to someone, but there's no one else there.Officer Cohen's dressed in regular jeans and a light jacket, the type of outfit you'd expect from someone hoping to stay unnoticed. Fiona keeps expecting him to look at her house, to maybe look up at her lit-up bedroom window for signs of movement, but he never does. He isn't looking at anything, really. Now he's staring at the ground, completely still.It's dark, but under the streetlights she feels like she can read his whole face, and he does not look like someone spying on another person. After a certain point he shakes his head, mutters something, looks down the road to his left and says something else, then goes back to looking at the ground.Fiona doesn't know how much time passes, but after a certain point when Officer Cohen still hasn't moved, she goes to put on some sneakers and find herself a jacket. She opens her front door with the full understanding that this can be a trap; after all, she's heard plenty of stories of the policemen going beyond the law, stories of sadistic officers electrocuting civilians from miles away. Apparently somewhere in the police precinct there's a database that can connect to anyone's chip and, in the case of terrorism or suspected terrorism, there's an option to kill a civilian with the click of a button. So there was that one cop who got revenge on his ex-wife by electrocuting her while she was driving on the highway, hoping that the following car crash would misdirect any investigators. There was one officer who just went nuts and, after locking himself alone in the room somehow, just started electrocuting as many people as he could before people barged in. He'd gone by alphabetical order, and in five minutes nearly two hundred people had dropped dead like Adam had, randomly across the country, all with surnames starting with 'A'. The deaths were so spread out that it was hard for anyone to find the connection at first.Those are just rumors, though, that Carrie told her about. They've never been reported on any of the news channels Fiona watches. And besides, there's nothing suspicious or illegal about her, a concerned citizen, checking in on a man who's been sitting outside her house for god knows how long. If this is some sort of police trick, it'll be good to get him to see her as more than just a suspect.She steps outside and, hands in her jacket pockets, quietly approaches the distracted officer. ""Are you alright?""The man - although he's barely a man, age-wise - startles at the sound of her, and for a moment he looks so panicked and confused that Fiona feels like the aggressor. He recognizes her face, then he looks at her house and frowns.""Oh,"" he says, shaking his head. ""I didn't realize this was... I'm sorry. I hope I didn't scare you or anything.""""Don't worry about it."" She tries out a comforting smile, and after an awkward pause she gestures to the bus sign. ""There's not gonna be another bus here for like five hours, y'know.""Cohen laughs shakily. ""I know. I was just thinking.""Fiona nods, analyzing his voice for any signs of dishonesty. The story itself sounds ridiculous - the idea that he's just so happened to wander to the bus stop across from her house and sit there for a long time - but there's no malice in his voice. Against her better judgement she says, ""Want to go inside? I could you make some coffee or... something. You've got to be getting cold by now.""""It's fine,"" he says. ""The cold's actually kind of nice.""Fiona considers this, taking a look around the neighborhood as if she can see the cold in the air. It is kind of nice, honestly. The little pricks of pain from the wind on her face remind her that she's wide awake, that this may very well be her last night standing outside in this neighborhood.Cohen speaks up. ""Can I ask you something?"" When Fiona nods, he continues hesitantly, ""Growing up, how strict were your parents? About your chip, I mean. How often did they check it?""""I don't know,"" she says, although those are just filler words. She's still trying to figure out if this is some sort of trick, if maybe he already knows the correct answer to the question and is waiting to see if she'll lie to him. She decides to take the risk: ""I don't think they were that strict. Like when I was in high school and I stayed over a friend's house for the night, they claimed they would check in on my chip to make sure I wouldn't go someplace I wasn't supposed to. But I don't think they did. Like, sometimes we would be drinking beer, and I know that the chips can detect alcohol so they'd know I'd been drinking, but they never gave me any shit for that. I guess they figure I needed a little bit of freedom in my life, some space to do stupid things like all teenagers do. I guess as long as I got home in one piece they knew I could take care of myself...""She stops at this point when she realizes he's crying. Halfway through her answer he'd been swallowing a lot, and then he looked away from her, grimacing, and by the time she trails off he's letting out little half-suppressed sobs. He covers his eyes with a hand and breaks down completely, as Fiona tries to figure out what to do.""What did I say?"" she says, but he's in no state to answer. It looks like he's trying so hard to compose himself but he can't quite do it. Fiona sits down next to him and, taking a moment to appreciate the absurdity of the situation, puts a hand on his shoulder. ""Come on, now,"" she says, softly. She lets him rest his head on her shoulder and they sit there for a while as she caresses his hair, saying ""it's okay,"" over and over again. She's saying it to herself as much as to him.Sean stops crying eventually, and lifts her head off Fiona's shoulder, wiping his eyes. ""I'm sorry,"" he says. He doesn't know what came over him.""It's okay,"" she says, and somehow she seems to mean it. They sit there on the bench for a while in silence, until Sean recovers to the point where he can talk to her normally.""You don't have to worry about anyone investigating you,"" he says. Before she can respond he explains, ""I made sure they put his death as a suicide, a clear-cut case.""Fiona watches him as he talks, and takes a moment looking at her hands before answering. ""That's good.""There's not a lot of innocence in the way she says this. Sean almost leaves the topic alone, but something in her tone makes her think she wants more details, so he gives her some. ""I knew you were lying. The chip gave you away immediately. But it definitely seemed like an accident and you looked like you were really upset, so I decided to let it slide. And again, I swear I didn't realize this was your house.""But Sean himself isn't sure about that last part. On some level he must've known, right? The whole process of leaving Joey's apartment felt like sleepwalking, so maybe he was acting on some subconscious desire to see Fiona again, to see this woman who seemed so uniquely sure of herself when he'd met her that morning.Fiona doesn't seem to care about that, though. ""So, there's no chance that the case might ever be reopened again, right?""He almost tries to assure her there's none, but he hesitates. ""Well, it's possible someone else might open it. My partner thought it warranted investigation, but I told him to let it go. He could re-open it if he wants to, but he probably won't."" After another moment's pause he adds: ""And I suppose if any of your boyfriend's family members find the event suspicious, they could request to have it investigated. Do you think there's a chance that might happen?""Fiona shook her head, grimacing. ""It's a possibility someone might suspect something, but I don't think they'll go that far. After all, if it's not a suicide, what's the most likely other outcome? He tried to flee the country. And for his family, there's no greater shame than that.""""Same in mine,"" Sean says. He smiles at the idea of his parents finding out their son had fled, at the embarrassment they'd feel at having to explain themselves to their friends and family. A nice little stain on their records as parents for all the world to see.They sit there a little longer. Some cars drive by, and somebody's cat walks across the other sidewalk, but there are still no pedestrians. The lights in the other houses start going out, one at a time.""Hypothetically speaking,"" Fiona says, after a long bout of comfortable silence, ""If you had the opportunity to leave here for good, would you?"" She doesn't have to specify what 'here' means.It's a dangerous question. Sean tries to imagine a life outside of this place, one where he's not a cop, where he doesn't have a guaranteed job waiting for him. And despite it all, his job isn't bad. People give him respect when he walks past them, and in a crisis they always assume he knows what he's doing. When he's in a uniform he doesn't look or feel like a lost child. And besides, he might want to see Joey again, once he figures out exactly how he feels about him.""Probably not,"" he says. ""I don't even know what I'd do someplace else.""Fiona seems to consider his words, gazing at her house across the street. After another moment, Sean asks, ""What about you? You think you'll ever try to leave?""Fiona doesn't answer right away. They watch as a young woman jogs down the sidewalk across the street. The jogger's short, barely five feet tall, and she's running by herself with her headphones on in the middle of the night on a dark street that, apart from her and Sean, is completely empty. A long time ago, she wouldn't be doing that. Back then it'd be too dangerous for a young woman to go jogging alone in the middle of the night, especially in a badly lit neighborhood like this. She could've been attacked or kidnapped or killed, and the perpetrator probably would've gotten away with it. But this woman jogs down the sidewalk and turns a corner without any trouble. She doesn't seem scared at all.""No,"" Fiona says, sadly. ""I'm not going anywhere.""",,https://mattblack42.medium.com/the-devil-you-know-274c91247b7b,fiction,f59147e8e50a6ce37d8e80d45c7a7fca50464da85062f460fdfc7620
The Backwards Balloon,"The way I see it, Jimmy begins, is that we all have a choice in life to either suck in the appropriate information we need to make us happy or to just let our passions seep out and leave us deflated, like a balloon. Jimmy then lets the air escape out of his prop balloon.Jimmy seems to always have balloons around his apartment to use during the demonstration of his backwards balloon theory. It's our third date and my third time seeing this show. I've attempted to have some sort of get-to-know-you conversation with Jimmy but so far he hasn't taken a breath.Jimmy keeps talking, enjoying the sound of his own voice. He hasn't looked up from his balloon. I could probably walk out and he wouldn't notice.The thing is, I might even like what he's saying and maybe even agree with him. If only he'd pause and ask my opinion. If only he didn't talk over me when I tried to interject. But he can't. He's too focused on teaching me something.I toss a Frito into my mouth and pop open another Heineken as I settle in and feign fascination by his stellar observations.Of course, Jimmy continues, it would be a lot easier to totally comprehend all of this if balloons actually worked this way. If a balloon could magically be filled by having a hole in it, I could demonstrate that one must have an open mind in order to suck in all that is good the world. But never so open that you lose yourself and allow your strengths to seep out.That's when I doze off.Jimmy's out of Fritos and I'm just not in the mood to learn the secrets of the Universe from Bozo and his balloons.→ The Über Annie-link to all the Annie-links ←",https://miro.medium.com/max/4402/1*GK9ldLBoGIZVf6-rAFUTmA.jpeg,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-backwards-balloon-55e53b167b82,fiction,fa384baa7e69c710102cfc4e808144ad8cf00a7b15606ef1791dce72
The Swim,,,https://caitlin-furio.medium.com/the-swim-670891385e74,travel,faac3fbd58cc6a52abccecd6e57156c78cd6d8092db805bfd7c0baeb
Migration,"Cousin Sunny showed them to us at the dinner table, jerking at the neckline of her tie-dye tank top, flashing us the scars that underlined her chest, her nipples bolded with pearl piercings. She'd gone to Taiwan to get them done, and she came back a month later with suitcases full of dried squid and nipples that dribbled egg yolk into our palms. Cousin Sunny was six years older than me, her mother dead years ago from drinking pesticide, and when she first came to live with us, we slept together on the same mattress, her shoulder blades sharpening themselves against mine. We were familied by friction: every night I kneaded her dreams into a shape she could swallow. She used to have nightmares and wet the mattress every night, dressing me in her piss, but she never told me what the dreams were about. Every night I swaddled myself in saran wrap and slept on the edge of the mattress, waking up when she bayed in her sleep, the way hounds do when they've seen something shot. She fetched me the hem of her nightshirt and gnawed it to ribbons. The bedwetting ended when she was fourteen, but by then the mattress was steeped dark as tea, and I slept on the ground instead. She still had nightmares, but instead of wetting herself, she'd trained herself to bite down on the inside of her elbow, puncturing the soft skin there like a bladder. My mother shook her head and bandaged the crook of her arm, saying that Sunny was going to bleed herself out like pork, but I said nothing. Back when she moved in, I missed the nights when I slept alone on my mattress, and my mother said I was selfish, that Sunny and I were sistered now, and if I wanted to complain I could help her bleach the sheets and hang them from the branches of the neighbor's lime tree.When Sunny turned nineteen, she got a boyfriend. He was twenty-three and co-owned his father's restaurant, the one on the corner where they sold blood tofu by the pound, though the blood turned out to be fake: it was saltwater dyed red and congealed with gelatin. Despite the blood tofu scandal, and the fact that the boyfriend's dick was the width of a chopstick - according to Sunny - she claimed to love him. I know I love him, she told me once, because I would entirely eat him. That's what love is, she told me. You love someone so much you eat them the whole day and carry them forever in your intestines. It's called companionship, she said. I told her it was called cannibalism, but she told me that I was too young to know these things, and besides, I was clearly a lesbian, considering the way I slurped my congee so loudly, slapping my tongue against the surface, denting my spoon flat as a coin.Sunny left that summer to follow the boyfriend to Taipei, where he was going to meet with a duck-blood supplier. He wanted to make honest blood tofu. My mother drove her to the airport and made her promise that she wouldn't get pregnant. She brought things for Sunny to take onto the flight, but they had to be thrown away in the security line: a sheathed fruitknife, a tin of rat poison, a tub of horse oil. Sunny did not come back pregnant, but the breasts were sudden enough to silence my mother, who finished skinning a silver pear and sat down again. Above us, the ceiling fan stuttered, dicing the flies alive. Wings littered our laps, a winter lace. This is the wrong lighting, Sunny said, I'll show you again in the morning. In the morning, in front of the bathroom sink, I watched Sunny drain her breasts. She said the implants were migrating. I get infected easily, she told me, and swabbed the pus beneath her breasts with a tissue, showing me the thickness of it, enough egg whites for a wedding cake, she said to me laughing. What kind of implants are they, I said, saline? Silicon? And Sunny said she didn't know what they stocked in there, only that it was cheap. At night she rolled over onto her stomach and I heard her breasts crackle beneath her like eggshell, and I wondered what was incubating in her blood. I'll probably get so infected they'll have to cut off my head to keep it from spreading to my brain, Sunny said. Do you remember, ha, when a fishbone threaded through my tongue and it got so swollen I couldn't say anything for a week? Yeah, I said to Sunny, I wouldn't mind if that happened again. Sunny laughed and turned back to the mirror. She batted her breasts, swinging them like bells, their shadows curtaining our shared window. With a silver safety pin, she pierced the bottom of her left breast and tweaked it like a lemon. Some kind of yolk rivered out, pooling in the sink, rinsed down like beads. I asked Sunny how it was possible for her implants to migrate - isn't that what birds did during winter? Sunny laughed and said that was her favorite part about being back in Taiwan, how there was no winter, how nothing needed to seek heat. The heat originated from inside you, and there was no way to shy from your own skin. Over there, she said, your blood lives closer to the surface of your body. Your bones bob up and you have to beat them down again.I'm supposed to inject them with chickenblood, Sunny said, that's what the surgeon said. I asked what happened to her boyfriend, and why didn't he go out and buy some blood for her. Sunny sheathed her breasts in her tank top and sighed and said, he stayed there. That's what men do. They migrate and don't come back. We laughed, and her breasts buoyed up to the neckline of her shirt. Gross, I said, it's like they're growing wings. They're floating. Sunny pressed them to her chest with her palms and said, that's the problem with new body parts. They don't listen to gravity until they're grown up. For breakfast, Sunny and I ate the dried squid she'd brought back in her suitcase, sitting cross-legged on the carpet of our bedroom and chewing with our least-weakened teeth. I asked Sunny what she'd done on the island, and she said she'd ditched her boyfriend on the second day, the day before the surgery, and gone back to our mothers' hometown. I wanted to say, don't you mean your mother?, but I remembered what my mother said, that I should never remind her that my aunt was dead, and especially that she drank pesticide, or that she was not married when she had cousin Sunny, or that she had breasts no bigger than fists, or that she ate raw scallions every day because someone told her that would make her smart.Sunny told me that our mothers' hometown was the last place on the entire island to get electricity. Before that, they burned fat. Sunny propped her breasts in her palms and said, I guess if we ever lose electricity again we could burn these! They'd last a decade! See, I did it for the good of the family! I laughed, and Sunny said it was a green place with geese and ducks, shit everywhere, but the good kind, the kind of shit that clings to the tongue like black sugar, that is harvested straight from the night sky, the stars left behind like scars. In that town, Sunny said, everyone is Indigenous and shares their profits equally. The way we should, Sunny said, if we were still a tribe. We would share land, too, she said, and we wouldn't have to pay rent. And we could go anywhere in the world because we'd have the town to come back to, the river like coiled around our wrists like copper wire, the ducks and their green-green sweet shit. Where would we go? I asked Sunny, and she said, south where the fat-ass geese go! I laughed. I said that despite all I'd heard about birds flying south, I didn't see any birds around here, not even the pigeons and crows that used to pluck at the carcasses of stray cats like playing an instrument, eulogizing the body as they swallowed it. Hunger was our only accompaniment.It's our damn neighbors, Sunny said, those Tsings. It was two summers ago when the Tsings bought a pair of finches for their oldest daughter, a girl who was always being shunted from piano recitals to ink-painting classes and was mummified in velvet and pantyhose. Fake velvet, my mother said. I used to sew those kinds of dresses at the factory and let me tell you, it's just nylon and furry shit. The Tsings didn't realize that because one of the birds was male and the other was female, by the end of summer they had hundreds of finches, a colony of razored wings and orange cheeks. They started releasing the finches from their windows, and Sunny and I used to try to catch them mid-air like confetti, tiny finches the size of our fingerprints. The problem was that zebra finches were not native to our environment, and we started finding their carcasses everywhere, on the street and in the gutters or on top of my mother's 1993 Lexus that she drove every day to the press-on nail factory. If we left the windows open, we found finches floundering in our sinks or eating the oiled hair clotted in our hairbrushes or shitting on our mattresses or pecking nests into the soggy plaster of our walls. Sunny and I had to run around zapping them with an electric flyswatter, and even that was not enough to cull the population. There were a few albino finches that my mother trapped in a colander and attempted to sell to the church as doves-for-hire, good for funerals and weddings alike, but they were too small to be released as ornaments. We scraped finches off our windshield, off our windows, but the corpses were too boney to be eaten, and there was no blood left in their bodies to coagulate into tofu.That was the same summer that the other birds disappeared. Crows and pigeons and ducks and geese were voted out of the sky, but cousin Sunny and I couldn't decide why. I said it was because the finches were crowding out even the clouds, and the other species were tired of their flight paths getting perforated by thousands of little bullet-birds. Sunny said that the larger birds ate the finches and got poisoned and died, because that was what the Tsings did: they fed poison to their flock in an attempt to cull it, but instead, the finches escaped and were sipped into the bellies of other species. I said that there just wasn't enough territory to share among them, not enough sky to submerge them all, but Sunny said I was thinking like an American, not like our tribe, so I speculated nothing else. She said that the air in our lungs was no one's property, and that's why we always had to give it back.I missed the ducks and geese the most: newspapers said we weren't supposed to feed them, but Sunny and I used to chase them behind the train tracks, where the creek shriveled like a salted slug and trash hung from the trees like tinsel. We fed them everything we could tow from the mud. A plastic rape whistle, a soda can tab, a quarter-machine ring, a tampon wrapper. Sunny flung a shard of beer glass at one of the white-backed geese, but I told her we weren't supposed to rupture them. The newspapers said that feeding the geese and ducks was banned because if they got too big, they wouldn't be able to fly south in the winter, but Sunny said there wasn't anything bad about that: if we were glued to this ground, they should be too. Nothing in this world should have wings, she told me. We should all be subjected to the same gravity.Sunny's breasts migrated south to her belly button. They were like the sand bags I watched daily on the Taiwanese news channel: this was the summer our mothers' hometown was flooded skyhigh for months. Sunny was the one who stole the TV set from an ex-boyfriend who used to punch her breasts. Actually, Sunny said, my breasts look the same as they did then. I don't know why he punched only my boobs. I thought they'd slop off my chest. I told him he should punch my stomach, because then at least maybe I'd throw up and lose some weight. How do my hips look? She stood up in front of the TV screen, flicking the light off her bare thighs. I said she looked fine. My mother said that Sunny wasn't pretty, but she had the kind of face that was bordering beauty - you could see it if she stood to your left or right - while my face was dead-on ugly. After she said that, Sunny and I spent nights in front of the mirror, swiveling our faces, bulging our cheeks out, trying to identify which features diverged us from the movie kind of beauty: Sunny said she had an asymmetrical face and nipples. I said I had a chin like a red turtle-cake.Sunny and I sat on the sofa, listening to the reporter say that our mothers' hometown had lost electricity again. The screen was cracked bad, and the image of the town was blistered like a burnt finger, but we could see the dirt roads breaching their veins, bleeding down the mountain's face. In the sky, the water looked solid as a palm, slapping down on the town and dissolving its slate walls, the white wells, the tin houses leaned against breadfruit trees. This is not what I imagined a flood would look like, I said sideways to Sunny. What did you think it would look like? she said. I don't know, I said, I thought the water would be clean. But this is just mud. Sunny laughed and said this was a typhoon, not some biblical watercolor. You ever been in one? I said of course not. Mud can eat you, she said. It has a mouth. It glides onto you nice and then slips off your skin and wears it for you. Mud glazed the TV screen and dried over it, and after that, we couldn't see what was happening anymore, except that the villages were rafting down the mountain, all of their sandbags spent. The sacks floated after them like a fleet of ducks.Because there was no more birdwatching in the city, I spied on Sunny's bruise-blurred breasts instead. She was undressing with her back to me, sitting on the mattress, when she turned to the side and I saw the seams of her chest. I remembered she once tried to pierce one of my nipples with a scissor blade, saying it wouldn't hurt at all, but I told her what my mother said: that a woman's breasts belong to her like plucked pears, that they will go bad if the skin is broken, that they are born soft for a baby's gnaw. Sunny laughed at me that night, and then in the morning she said I was lucky, to have a mother who said shit like that, and someday if I was lucky my breasts might grow to be the size of freshwater pearls. I kicked her in the thigh, but Sunny kept laughing.We stopped watching the flood, but only because we lost the signal and whenever we turned the TV on, we could only hear rain clinking down like earrings. I asked Sunny if it was possible to co-own a disaster, to divvy up the destruction. What the hell are you talking about, she asked me. I said, remember when you told me that all profits are shared among the people? So are all the ruins shared too? What about deaths, are those shared too? Do they mourn together? Sunny didn't answer me. I realized that we had never mourned on her mother's death date, that my mother let it raft by us every summer, that I never even asked what day it'd happened, the pesticide, the swallowing, Sunny flying to us and homing on my mattress. Sunny kneed the TV until the screen shivered, the image graining into sugar. I'll go get the vacuum, she said, even though we didn't have one. I don't know about what you asked, she said while walking away from me. I think some things we own alone.That night, Sunny kicked me awake, punting me off the mattress. I woke face-down on the carpet, spitting the hair that was flossing my teeth. You're eating your braid again, she said, stop it. I spat again and sat up. Sunny was standing by the window, opening the pane that was silvered with bird-poop stains. I used to think that the stains were stars, that somehow our window was a telescope, enlarging the night so that we could see its pores, the good grease of its light. I thought we were neighbors to the moon. But it was Sunny who told me it was just shit.In the gravy-thick moonlight, Sunny stripped off her tank top. Her breasts swung out, feathered with hair that looked white in this light. Stop, I said, someone will see you, but I was the only one in the room. There were bruises on her breasts, tiny as if they'd been made by rain or pecked by a beak, and I wondered if I'd been batting them in my sleep, elbowing her like I used to. But all I dreamed about now was the flood on TV, how they showed a shot of birds slathering the screen, fleeing the trees that were trying to hold their heads above the water. Where do they go, I'd asked Sunny, and she said I shouldn't be worried about the damn birds. They had the sky to house them, and nothing could ever flood that high. It was the people I should worry about. You're right, I said, and didn't ask anymore.The window gaped open. Sunny stood bare-chested in front of it, and from the side I could see the threads beneath her breasts, the zippers studding her skin. She reached beneath each breast, fondling for a seam, and unclasped herself like a coin purse. Opened from the bottom, her breasts let out light, flashing their gems of fat. Inside, I could hear something flapping. Her breasts writhed in the dim light, clenching like fists. You can come out now, Sunny said. It's time. Yolk webbed her fingers, flooding gold down her belly. Sunny turned to me and said today was the day her mother died. I stood up and walked to the window, standing beside her, and watched as blue-black birds edged out of her breasts, threading out the window, struggling to free their gummed-up wings as they knifed into the night. They hummed inside me like eggs, she told me, and I was afraid I was going to break them too bad. But look how I've pinned them to a beginning. Look, she said, and I did. Her newborn birds slicked up the sky. I listened with all my blood, asking where they were going and if they could carry us. Beside me, Sunny unknotted her breasts and let them sway in the night air, wind ruffling the loose scarves of her skin, raising them into wings.K-Ming Chang/ 張欣明 is a Kundiman fellow, a Lambda Literary Award finalist, and a National Book Foundation 5 Under 35 honoree.

The Best Time to Declutter Is Right Before Taking a Trip,"It begins in the back of your closet. After removing a shirt from its hanger, you shake off the dust and hold it up to the light.You're packing for a trip. The flight leaves tomorrow morning. The weather at your destination is mild, and this long sleeve shirt would be perfect--in theory.There's just something about it that's not quite right. Maybe it's the fabric. Maybe it's the color.But if you're not going to wear it now, when did you plan on wearing it?Never.Your decision not to pack it is a referendum on that shirt. On paper, it's a perfect, casual, long-sleeve shirt. In practice, there are more than five-or ten-long-sleeve shirts you'd pack in its place. When that one shirt doesn't make it into your luggage, then that's all the answers you need.And that's why the best time to declutter is right before taking a trip.My only suitcase is carry-on sized. Therefore, anything I pack has to be well-thought-out. I end up packing a sort of capsule wardrobe - essential, functional, and each piece matches with the others.Being so, this has always been a good time to figure out what in my closet is the opposite of that: nonessential, nonfunctional, and noncooperative.In other words, when packing for a trip, I figure out what doesn't work for me.Here are some examples:To be clear, I don't purge a huge pile of items every time. That's great if you do, but don't get discouraged if you don't. Most times I only declutter one or two things. I think of this as ""marinating"" your minimalism-otherwise known as ""taking it slow.""Minimalism has always been a one-day-at-a-time process for me.And each time, I get stuck on something. I hit a wall and can't decide. That's why I pack another item or two to make a decision while I'm on my vacation.A trip works as a great trial period for something you're not sure about. It's an optimal time to do some testing.Up until the last few years, I rarely decluttered because of decision fatigue. In the midst of my chaotic schedule, the last thing I wanted to do was decide if I should keep a pair of shoes or not.On a vacation though, I have more energy to spare. And less decisions to make overall. More so, if I see an item paired with other essentials I've packed, then that makes the ""keep or toss"" decision easier because it's isolated from the rest of my clutter.Here are some examples of items I trialed:For clothes I'm uncertain about keeping, I'll pack them within the capsule wardrobe because - theoretically - they should work with the other items. If a piece feels scratchy, doesn't fit right, or I have a ""blah"" feeling about wearing it, then I feel free to leave it at the nearest donation bin.Again, I only pack one or maybe two items I'm unsure about. Remember, decision fatigue is real. Pace yourself.Decluttering begins at the bottom of the drawer. Usually, when packing, we grab the stuff we use every day. We skim off the top. Instead, we should give thought to items that haven't seen the light of day-at least not recently.After all, stuff sits at the back of the closet because it's at the back of our minds. Now is the time to consciously excavate.You can develop the habit of decluttering if you connect it to other routines. And here, packing just makes the most sense. It makes the ""keep or toss"" decision easier. When packing, you're already asking the question, ""what do I need?""In the end, you may as well kill two birds with one stone and declutter that which you don't need.",,https://medium.com/curious/the-best-time-to-declutter-is-right-before-taking-a-trip-764f6796743,travel,fc06035ddac44a43af8fcad05fc9b069b1b75a3a01dce0afbb5d94e6
For the Sake of Their Kids Education: Iznik,"Since having a stroke in December of 2018, Adem Öner let his wife Pırlanta Öner take the reins of their restaurant Iznik which they opened in 1989. While he is still mostly resting at his home in Islington, he agreed to meet me at his restaurant on the bustling streets of Highbury - right across from Mrs Lovell's Greengrocer and La Fromagerie. Öner was waiting for me at the back table near the kitchen, his cane next to him. I walked to the back noticing the magenta brick walls that surprisingly worked with the rest of the decoration that included an abundance of mosaic lamps, a photo of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, portraits of Sultans from the Ottoman Empire, evil eyes and Iznik tiles.His wife was prepping the kitchen for lunch and Öner eagerly started telling me his story without me asking a question to start with. His life, similar to Öner, was one of hardship. The difference, however, was that while Öner's life back in Turkey was difficult, Öner's life in London had proven to be more challenging. He was born in Ordu, the port city on the Black Sea coast of Turkey. He immigrated to the capital, Ankara, when he was 9 because his father was murdered in prison due to a vendetta that he did not go into detail as tears started streaming down his face. His mom, scared that they could be next decided it would be the safest idea to go to the capital and stay with family. He stayed in Ankara for 25 years, studied economy and finance and worked at the General Directorate of Highways in Ankara. He met his wife, Pırlanta, at an engagement party.They were happy. Öner was getting paid a respectable amount and his wife, who could not work in Turkey because she was a Cypriot, was finishing her degree in math. However, after a while his mother started treating Öner's wife badly. He told me with some sadness in his voice that although his mother was an amazing person, after he got married, she turned into a different person. He described her behavior as ""​tatsız​,"" without flavor or tasteless. His father-in-law decided that the best solution would be to move abroad, so they sold everything they had in Turkey. He recalls that they arrived in London with 300 pounds and that it was a difficult journey with their 10-month old son. They arrived as tourists and sought solace in their family members who lived here.However conditions were rough. Although he was a college graduate, he needed to work at very low-paying jobs and worked illegally in the beginning. He told me that it was extremely jarring - the fear of getting caught was a daily worry. He always believed that with language classes and some luck he would get to stay, saying ""​Kervan yolda düzülür""​ which is an idiom that means you can face things as they come first as Öner was scammed. While he thought he was applying for a visa, his money was taken, the government learned about his status and he was deported. Through connections in Turkey, he was appointed to the Turkish Embassy in London and he finally had ""immunity,"" as he puts it. He tells me how he did not have to follow traffic rules because he had a diplomatic license plate - he quickly tells me that he always abides by them but if he wanted to break them, he could. Things were looking up for Öner, his two sons were going to private school at Highgate and his wife was working in a sewing factory.Iznik used to be a greasy spoon that Öner tells me people would not walk past by - they would cross the street. The place was on sale by an Italian man that he describes as ""sticky, unreliable, fraudulent and slippery like soap."" They bought it because it was in horrible condition but cheap. The reason they opened a restaurant was so they could afford living in London and make sure their kids get the good education they deserve. He started out by serving British fare but the people living around the neighborhood pushed him to serve Turkish food.So they switched the menu to traditional Turkish food. They call the restaurant Iznik because ""it is a very important location both for our culture and Christian culture."" One of his dreams after opening up the restaurant was to host one of the Sabancı's, a very prominent and rooted family in Turkey, and feed them ​mantı. His dream became a reality when Şevket Sabancı, his wife Hayırlı Sabancı and his friends came for a meal one day. He served them mantı, which was a brave choice because the family is from the mantı​ capital of Turkey, Kayseri.After he got a liquor license, the restaurant became very popular especially among foreigners - Öner tells me that Turks rarely come to this restaurant. While after his stroke, business has been a little slow, he is confident that things will start to pick up again. When I ask him if it was all worth it, I notice tears streaming down his face again. It is clear how difficult it has been for Öner and his family to leave their country and start a new life in London. No matter how much time passes, the longing he has for Turkey stings the same.",https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/1*ADVbH7ys3lh0v4iK7ZaCZQ.png,https://medium.com/curious/for-the-sake-of-their-kids-education-iznik-3b90dff58529,travel,feb75851f6707c9c65a0738dfab93e8ad226618236509d044a891e97
10 Things Nobody Told Me About Japan,"10 months ago my husband, daughter and I moved to Tokyo from London, for a temporary secondment with my work. After a long deliberation on whether we should do it or not, we thought: YOLO - you only live once! It will be good for our careers; our daughter will expand her worldview and learn Japanese; and it will be an adventure for us all!Announcing our decision to our family was the hardest part; lots of tears and feelings of apprehension and guilt, but having their support and 'blessing' was so cathartic. Moving houses was the second one: stressful as it is, the prospect of relocating to another continent makes it even more daunting (we were packing up to 2am the day before our travels, although we were quite organised along the way)! Last but not least, the actual transition to living abroad was very challenging: from sorting out residency papers to setting up a bank account, nothing was simple, easy or familiar; it was (and sometimes still is) a daily battle that almost always leaves you questioning - is this what I really want?Moving to Japan was certainly not a walk in the park, but it is worth it! Beyond all the turbulence and hardship we love it here!From world-class restaurants to fascinating sumo wrestling tournaments, from beautiful cherry-blossom watching spots to carefully-crafted gardens, there is a plethora of places to explore and things to learn about this magnificent country. Classed as a quirky and innovative nation, Japan is the source of trend and invention (some useful, others... not so much) across the world, and has left its cultural fingerprint globally. It is renowned for its highly structured, disciplined and traditional society, which sets great importance on loyalty, politeness, personal responsibility and team work. There is also a complex web of social rules and traditions that is overwhelming for visitors and foreign residents too, most of which have been documented in several guides, formally and informally.But this post is about some subtle glimpses into Japan's hidden side, that unless you live here, you will never get to know!Standing patiently in a line is one of Britain's greatest prides, but what the Brits don't know is that the Japanese have taken it to a whole new level. The queuing etiquette is a means of showing respect to the group and is drilled into every schoolchild from an early age. It is then reinforced for every adult: people here are standing politely in lines to board on trains, be seated at a restaurant, get served at a shop or even take the perfect cherry-blossom shot!Japanese people seem to enjoy the anticipation that comes from standing in line (there is no apparent impatience) and in fact the wait is part of what gives a product or an experience its value - e.g. an 11 hour wait to meet Mickey Mouse is totally acceptable! As it happens, some retailers hire 'faux queuers' to pose as dedicated customers so they attract more crowds. And conversely, playing queue roulette is a thing here. ""You've got to be in it to win it""!A typical dialogue with a new acquaintance goes like this:In the beginning I thought it was more of an innocent query stemming from genuine curiosity or a sort of ice-breaker/small-talk, but as it was coming up again and again (and again) I now wonder if it has loaded subtext and is a way to stereotype you. This is how it comes across: ""if you can afford to live there you must be super rich, averagely rich, or, God forbid, middle class"".Talking with a stranger seems more like a scripted Q & A than a free-flowing dialogue... Another two examples of these nuance questions are: Where are you from? and What do you do for living?The months of June till July can be a wet affair in Japan and with the temperatures being high, wearing a raincoat is a no-no. So brollies come to the rescue! Although their price tag varies (and it is known how the Japanese love luxurious brands), the most popular ones are the cheapest ones (¥500 = approx. $5) that are easily obtainable from any convenience store and provide clear visibility through their transparent plastic covering to help you navigate through the busy streets of Tokyo.So far so good!But what do you do with your umbrella when you go indoors in a restaurant, mall or office? Or when you leave the house and forget your umbrella? Fear not! The Japanese have the solution!Even with the intense heat and humidity of the rainy season, it is not until the cicadas start screeching that people know: summer is here! While in Greece and other Mediterranean countries their song is somewhat relaxing, in Japan it is far from the case and the cicadas have a penchant for noise pollution.If there happen to be a few of them clinging to a tree outside your apartment, the noise can be almost deafening. NOT. KIDDING!Japanese use onomatopoeia to describe their (not so melodious) songs, including: gingin, washiwashi, tsukutsuku, kanakana, minmin-zemi (← the noisiest of them all!) and many more. Watch the Sound of Summer to get an idea!They are huge (7-10cm) but apart from the noise they cannot bite or harm you. But OMG some of them pretend to be dead on the ground, and if you happen to walk by, they become agitated and start flying around wildly.I was already aware that everyone in Japan is very honest and have read numerous cases where people forget something on the subway and then be reunited with it shortly after. But what struck me was people using their iPhone, or expensive handbags or even designer watches to reserve a table at a food hall while they place an order at the counter...I dare you do this in your country - it will be gone before you know it!Cultural shock normally brings up negative connotations; however, it does not always have to be that way. Sometimes a cultural shock is an observation or curious musing about something notable in another culture! My first cultural shock was on my first day in the office when I noticed that Japanese people sleep at work! Not at dedicated areas, but at their desk! They mostly make it obvious: after lunch time, they set a 30 minute alarm and take a little power nap. But other times, I would turn my head to speak to my colleague, at say 15:00, only to realise that he is asleep! Then again, attend a meeting (pre-COVID-19) and half the way through, a few people were 'resting' their eyes.Taking a nap at work is perceived as a sign of poor attitude in the UK (and in other Western countries) and may even cost you your job, but not in Japan! Sleeping ""while present"" is a sign of diligence and hard work ethics (i.e. sacrificing sleep for work). It is also an indication of status and confidence: it shows to your colleagues that you are indispensable to the company and can get away with resting in the arms of Morpheus for a while.Riding an elevator can be tricky! I wonder how it did not come up in my cultural induction training before I moved here... In most places around the world, there are no special rules; people just act based on common sense and consideration for others. Japan, on the other hand, has a clear riding etiquette in place that goes like this:As you can see the key ideas are respect and efficiency.A cat café is simply a business that takes care of cats, and allows patrons to play with them and find some ""catisfaction"" 😸 in a homely space, evoking the experience of being in one's apartment through the carefully staged use of furniture, lighting and background music. It is a concentrated niche that caters to a specific demographic of people; those who live in small apartments with restrictive housing codes and possibly alone; but let's not forget that cats are the country's favourite animal.Cat cafés are becoming an international phenomenon, but visiting them in Japan becomes a window into Japanese culture, as cats are loved and revered here and also lend themselves well to 'kawaii' (=cute) styling.PS: Before visiting a café, please make sure that they take the welfare and the rights of the felines seriously.Japan has long been all about the pursuit of perfection, so it should come as no surprise then that the same standards are directed towards fruit by producing some of the most delicious and unusual fruit in the world. From square watermelons and white strawberries, to enormous grapes and lime-looking satsumas, Japan's quest to create the perfect versions of fruit has yielded some amazing results! But when individual pieces of fruit are given personalised attention, they are accompanied with a very high price tag.These fruits are considered status symbols, normally gifted to others or even displayed as decoration. Indicatively I will mention: apples for £10 each, a small cart of 10 strawberries for £60, grapes for £100 and watermelons for £200 each... From time to time a news report will surface of somebody paying the price of a small car for a single melon!Coming from Greece originally I consider myself lucky to have tasted some of the sweetest watermelons, I was sceptical about these overpriced Japanese ones. So I tried once and I have to confess: It was the best one I have ever tasted!The Japanese L❤VE flowers. Particularly sakura, known as cherry blossom, which only blooms for a couple of weeks during April. People gather under the trees for hanami (→ flower viewing) parties just to admire the colours.This enthusiasm for pinkness is extreme. Every single brand releases a special cherry-blossom version of its product. From the Starbucks sakura flavoured Frappuccino to KitKats and Coca Cola ... we could go on for a while. Meteorologists try to predict when the cherry blossom will bloom, all hotels are fully booked 6 or more months in advance and there are streams of people at the parks trying to get the perfect shot with these delicate flowers!I have also fallen for sakura but I feel there is a tinge of sadness to the whole affair; the flowers last only for a week before floating off, making it the ultimate symbol of the importance of living in the present, coupled with the beautiful and fleeting nature of life.Japan is full to the brim of secret sights and surprises, and this list is by no means exhaustive. My family and I are enamoured with Japan because it retains and merges parts of the old world (see geisha culture) with the modern world! Because it is a tranquil place! Because it is exquisitely beautiful! And most importantly: because of its people!Thanks for reading!
