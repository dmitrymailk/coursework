"There is a lot of rhetoric around productivity, particularly during the current climate.",
"Generally speaking, who wouldn't want their teams to be more productive?",
"However, the language associated with a drive for productivity can and often is easily misconstrued as a message of speed.",
"Go faster, do more, increase our output and achieve more with the same.",
"I'd argue, however, that focus, not speed, is the biggest ally in our pursuit of productivity.",
"Being productive isn't about doing more, it's about making our current efforts count - maximising the impact of every endeavour.",
"In the world of product, I believe the pursuit of speed is actually at odds with the sentiment of productivity.",
An overriding emphasis on speed can actually do more harm than good!,

"I'd draw special attention there to the word ""useful"".",
"In a product context, this means creating something that adds real, demonstrable value to the customer and the business.",
A relentless pursuit of speed has little bearing on whether working faster actually derives any more value.,

And there's nothing we hate more than each time you pay for a targeted ad on Instagram.,
Who would have ever thought that the New York Times would write about an advertising campaign in the Arts section?,
Yet the show got glowing reviews from theatre critics in The New York Times and The Washington Post.,
"In all, the campaign was covered in more than 1,000 publications and news broadcasts.",
The musical got far more media coverage than a 'regular' Superbowl ad.,
It received more than 2.5 billion earned impressions - 25 times the viewership of the big game.,

"Nearly 15 years later, his disappearance remains one of Ohio's biggest mysteries.",
"March 31, 2006 was a Friday, and the first night of spring break for the Ohio State University community.",
"He and his friend, Clint Florence, began their night at the Ugly Tuna Saloona, in the South Campus Gateway complex.",
"Known for terrible service but decent entertainment and alcohol, it attracted many OSU students due to its convenient location.",
"Brian had an apartment on King Avenue, about a half mile southwest of the South Campus Gateway.",
"They stayed there for about two hours, then walked to the North Shore Tavern and had a couple drinks there.",
"Around 11:40pm, they walked to Brothers Bar and Grill, where they ran into Clint's friend Meredith Reed.",
"After a couple shots, they decided to end the night in the same place they started it, at the Ugly Tuna.",
The trio was caught on surveillance camera walking across the courtyard and headed for the Ugly Tuna.,
At 1:15am they can be seen on the escalator heading up to the bar.,
"Clint and Meredith finished their drinks and got ready to leave, but were unable to find Brian.",
"They stood around for a few minutes, watching as the crowded bar emptied out, there was still no sign of him.",
"The bar only had one room, and Brian definitely wasn't in it.",
"The only other place he could be was the bathroom, but Clint checked it and he wasn't there, either.",
"Figuring he had somehow slipped past them and was waiting outside, they headed out of the bar.",
"After a few tries, Meredith left a short message, asking ""Where the hell are you?",
"Alexis Waggoner, Brian's girlfriend, was the first person to suspect something was wrong.",
"Instead, she left right after classes ended to make the drive to her hometown of Toledo.",
"She planned to return to Columbus on Sunday, and she and Brian were scheduled to fly to Miami on Monday.",
"Brian had bought the tickets months ago, and they were looking forward to spending some time in the Florida sun.",
"Alexis tried to call Brian early Saturday afternoon to update him on Elly, but her call went straight to voicemail.",
"When she couldn't reach him that evening, she began to worry.",
"Just 25 days earlier, Brian's mom had lost her battle with a rare form of bone cancer.",
Alexis called Randy on Sunday with the news that none of Brian's friends had seen him since Friday night.,
"She was still in Toledo, but decided to head back to Columbus immediately.",
"Once back in Columbus, she bypassed her apartment and went straight to Brian's.",
"Unlocking the door, she did a quick walkthrough and confirmed that he wasn't there.",
"The apartment looked neat and orderly like it usually did, and nothing appeared to be missing.",
The fact that these items were in the apartment made Alexis worry even more.,
"If Brian had planned on going somewhere for any length of time, he would have taken them with him.",
"Wherever he was, he hadn't driven himself, as his Honda Accord was still parked in its usual spot.",
"It was his brother, Derek, who had gotten a call from his father asking him to check on his brother.",
"By the time the show had finished, though, both Derek and his girlfriend were tired and just wanted to go home.",
Now he wondered if he was going to regret his decision to not catch up with him Friday night.,
They called all the hospitals in the area and even checked with the county jail.,
"Brian had been so excited about the trip, there was no way he would voluntarily miss it.",
"Randy, Derek, and Alexis had missing person flyers printed and began plastering the OSU campus with them.",
"There was no activity on Brian's credit cards or cell phone, and his car and other personal belongings were untouched.",
But the fact that he had gone missing in Columbus meant detectives had one thing going for them: numerous surveillance cameras.,
It was impossible to go far in the city without being captured by at least one of them.,
They obtained the video from the cameras at the Ugly Tuna first.,
"While there were no cameras inside the bar, there were two right outside at the top of the escalator.",
"At the very least, they would be able to see if Brian was alone or with someone when he left the bar.",
"As they watched the video, investigators were able to confirm much of what Clint and Meredith told them.",
"Then, at 2:09am, Meredith and Clint could be seen leaving the bar and getting on the escalator.",
"Eventually, the entire bar emptied out and the lights went off, but Brian never appeared.",
They slowed the video down and scrutinized each person who came out.,
The fact that he seemingly went into a bar and never came out launched the case into national news.,
"Rumors started to fly almost immediately after Brian disappeared, and investigators had the unenviable task or sorting fact from fiction.",
"Before the end of the day on Monday, there was $5000 in reward money available for information on Brian's whereabouts.",
Ohio Crimestoppers was offering $2000 and his medical school put up $3000.,
"Search dogs were brought in to scour the Ugly Tuna and the area around it, including the construction site.",
Investigators started to wonder if they couldn't find Brian because he had taken off and didn't want to be found.,
"Four days after Brian went missing, a potential sighting of him raised the hopes of investigators and his family.",
The man had no reaction and didn't even look up from his sandwich.,
"Two weeks after the disappearance, the reward for information had grown to $25,500.",
Randy had buttons made with Brian's picture and a phone number to call with any information.,
"He figured they would be more durable than missing person flyers, though he was still posting those as well.",
"Three weeks after Brian went missing, a group of volunteers began searching the area surrounding parts of the Olentangy River.",
The detective always answered his calls and was in awe of his strength.,
"Although police continued to investigate, by September it was pretty clear that Brian's case had gone cold.",
"He continued to hand out buttons with Brian's picture, flyers, and posters.",
"He listened to psychics and followed up on what they told him, no matter how far-fetched it seemed.",
"With no solid leads to go on, he was willing to consider anything.",
"He would make frequent calls to Detective Hurst, determined to keep the investigation moving forward.",
"On September 14th, central Ohio was under a severe storm warning, as strong windstorms blasted through the region.",
"Preparing for the inevitable power outage and resulting damage, Randy headed out to his shed for some tools around 6:00pm.",
His neighbors found him early the next morning after he failed to show up for work.,
"A few days after Randy died, someone posted a short message: ""Dad, I love you, Brian.",
"He normally wore wire-framed eyeglasses, but did not have them with him when he disappeared.",
"If you have any information about Brian, please call the Columbus Police Department at 1-877-645-8477.",
A court counselor bent down and spoke softly at the convicted man's ear.,
He had raised his gavel and now put it back to its place.,
Each bailiff took an arm and lifted the man off his knees by those two handles.,
"Like that, he was delivered to a police van, driven to a prison, and carried to an empty cell.",
"It was entertainment to witness the unusual comportment of the new inmate, where prisoners and staff alike follow proscribed routines.",
Was the odd display to show he was turning a new leaf?,
"Was the man born with intractable knees?An hour later, the warden approached the new inmate's cell.",
"The convict was kneeling, facing his cot, elbows resting on a thin mattress.",
A prison chaplain was hopeful but couldn't get The Kneeler to talk.,
Two guards removed razors and eating utensils from the inmate's cell.,
"It was for this prisoner a sort of hunger strike, the psychiatrist concluded.",
"Baked pasta with beans, warm on the surface, cold in the center.",
"One knee ahead of the other, hands gripping the food tray.",
"At his cot, he sat on his heels and placed his tray on the mattress.",
He rested his elbows on the thin mattress of his cot and occasionally put his weight on his elbows to relieve his knees.,
"Before the first week was up, holes opened at the knees of his prison uniform.",
A prison medic closed the holes with iron-on patches and bandaged the convict's knees.,
The Kneeler moved his mattress to the floor and knelt on it for more protection.,
Entering the shower room naked and on his knees and he started a mini-riot.,
"Kneeling at his cot, he shifted to the left and to the right on his knees to relieve the ache.",
"His knees were red, and a discharge was collecting on one of them.",
"A guard brought The Kneeler a pair of kneepads from the prison gardening shed, as well as a cellmate for The Kneeler.",
"No, he'd gone to his place of employment and shot his boss.",
"The truth was The Kneeler had been disrespected by a cop, and he punched him out for it - not killed him.",
But he'd had his hands around the cop's neck when he was pulled off of him.,
The Kneeler had testified in court that the cop had abused him.,
The cop had called to him when The Kneeler emerged from a convenience store.,
That's what his wife had pleaded to get out of her marriage.,
"The Kneeler had become thin and pale, and that gave credence to the levitation rumor.",
"Over time, he could no longer straighten his legs, and his leg muscles began to atrophy.",
The prison warden and the inmate's mother and sister encouraged him to immediately change his crazy behavior.,
The Kneeler could no longer stand - even with the aid of a walker - if he wanted to.,
"At a prison health exam, a physician recommended that The Kneeler have his knees and legs examined by a specialist.",
An orthopedic surgeon would know if The Kneeler could revert to a healthy condition and the real use of his legs.,
"The prison warden suggested The Kneeler have his head examined, too.",
"In a brightly lit exam room, a nurse prepped the inmate's knees for an orthopedic surgeon.",
"The doctor entered the room and stood and looked down at the inmate's knees, and glanced at the X-rays.",
"Without touching the inmate or his legs, the doctor faced him and stared at his face for several moments.",
"Sooner or later, I will have to amputate your legs above your knees.",
"The Kneeler was delivered to the room in a wheelchair, and not too happy about that.",
"He had become gaunt, and his face seemed frozen in a grimacing expression.",
They look up to me in a certain way - for certain reasons.,
"Even if they opened the gates for you today, your legs will keep you incarcerated,"" The Kneeler's mother said.",
The infrequent visit from The Kneeler's family did not resolve anything.,
"With that, she turned and left the prison infirmary with her daughter.",
"On the way to the prison visitor's exit, the two said nothing.",
Significant investments into advertising can be an elevated risk if you do not know the return.,
"This article explores affiliate marketing, how it works, and the benefits it provides.",
"Affiliates can make money promoting products and services and earn an income, without actually having any of their own.",
"With a traditional business model, the seller bears the risk that profit exceeds the overall marketing costs.",
"However, an affiliate takes on the promotion efforts and then earns a piece of the profit from each sale they make.",
"Usually, via a predefined commission, sales are tracked via personalised affiliate links.",
"It works similarly to somebody employed in sales on commission, such as real estate agents, to incentivise their performance.",
It is a massive benefit to the merchant to have a purely commissioned sales force and predictable marketing costs.,
"On the other hand, affiliates can create a revenue stream without investing in inventory or infrastructure.",
"The merchant is also known as the seller, vendor, or retailer.",
They are the party who created the product to market - it could be a physical object or a service.,
"After creating a product or service, the firm does not have to be actively involved in marketing.",
"They have others do the promotion, in exchange for a commission on sales.",
"They create content for the products to share on social media, blogs, and websites.",
"There are two fundamental relationships: the first is with the affiliate, and the second is with the merchant.",
The network works as an intermediary between the merchant and the affiliate.,
"Affiliate marketing networks such as Linkshare, Commission Junction, and Clickbank facilitate tracking sales transactions, payments, and product delivery.",
Their technology tracks all the activities and manages the commissions and the issuance of payments to affiliates.,
These networks serve as a database for affiliates to choose products or services to promote.,
Networks make participation easy for both the merchant and the affiliate by managing the application process.,
"The relationship spreads the responsibilities of marketing, leveraging various individuals' abilities for a more effective marketing strategy.",
"For the affiliate, it is an inexpensive method of making money with little overheads.",
It allows digital marketers to make money as free agents for a variety of merchants.,
The affiliate gets a share of the profit and the merchant benefits from predictable marketing costs as a percentage of sales.,
"Affiliates receive a commission payment from the merchant, depending on predefined consumer actions.",
"Affiliate marketing company or networks create customised affiliate URLs for each affiliate, to track their sales.",
Assume you already have a product or service to sell and there is a market for it.,
"Merchants find affiliates, often through an affiliate network, to promote their product or service.",
The difficult part for the merchant is finding an affiliate who already has an engaged audience that matches their target market.,
"For digital products, commission rates can be 50% or even higher because they are easily replicable.",
Affiliate marketers find a product or numerous products that they think are worth promoting.,
Websites such as Gumroad help affiliates find merchants to partner with and allow them to collect commissions.,
Part of this strategy involves trying to build your contact list by incentivising people to join your mailing list.,
"When an affiliate has an income, using pay per click advertising will help scale up faster growth.",
"Firstly, targeted marketing should reach the people most likely to be a customer.",
"If you are selling a B2B service, for example, do not use TikTok.",
"It could be through social media, blogging, email marketing, or paid advertising.",
You might develop a whole website dedicated to the merchant's products.,
You could use search engine optimisation through having sufficiently exciting content to get an adequate number of natural hits.,
"Through social media, affiliates can regularly engage with existing customers and reach new ones through providing meaningful content.",
"There may be a captive audience on platforms you never even considered, such as Pinterest.",
"However, it is essential to know and improve your numbers through analysis and optimising ads.",
"Equally, if you want to start a side income, affiliate marketing could be a good option.",
"If you are already blogging, affiliate marketing can complement your blog strategy.",
I've experimented with various techniques over the years to build good habits.,
"Given I'm nowhere near perfection, let's say not all methods worked well.",
"I'm a fan, and I reckon you'd be too if you saw these results.",
I got through that milestone relatively easily and went on to hit the 200-day milestone.,
That seemed like a big deal then until I hit the 366-day milestone - holywhoppinguacamole -,
"But, I managed to break through a self-imposed barrier inside my own mind.",
"So how do we create these consistent habits?There are a few options, but I'd like to focus specifically on habit streaks.",
"In my experience, no other technique comes even close in terms of guaranteeing successful habits.",
"Before I discuss any further, I'd like to emphasize that this discussion is about building positive habits.",
"The same technique can be used in reverse to break negative habits, but I'll get to that at the end.",
Habit streaks are when you develop a streak: a continuous chain of repeating a task over a long period.,
"For instance, if you want to be better informed, you may choose a goal of reading for 30 minutes every day.",
"You can keep such streaks going for days, weeks, months in a row, or even years.",
"Somewhere down the line, reading will become an automatic habit, something you simply do every day like eating and sleeping.",
A well-known proponent of habit streaking is Jerry Seinfeld of the eponymous show.,
"Seinfeld calls it the ""Don't break the chain"" technique.",
"Seinfeld famously wrote every day regardless of how he felt, whether or not he was inspired.",
"Compared to other habit formation techniques, I find habit streaks work very well for a multitude of reasons.",
You take away the option of postponing your action to another day.,
"This kind of forced behavior, unpleasant though it may sound, is a blessing in disguise.",
"Instead of spending your time dreaming up creative excuses, you just get stuff done and over with.2.",
Takes the pressure offDaily results matter less when you are engaged in an activity every day.,
"However, when you run daily, a lousy day is easy to overlook since you can start the next day afresh.3.",
"There are few areas in life we get to dictate how what, and when things will happen.5.",
"Here are five standout lessons, based on my experience, for anyone attempting to start a habit streak.",
I kept my move goal at an achievable level and didn't aim for the sky.,
Apple watch's algorithm kept prodding me every week to increase my move goal.,
I was juggling several activities this year and knew my limitations in terms of time and energy.,
"So, I found a challenging-enough baseline level and didn't change the goal as the year progressed.",
"Additionally, I aimed for a habit streak of 30 days at a time.",
It can be overwhelming when you set lofty goals when it comes to habit formation.,
I equate this to the feeling you get on mile 2 of a marathon.,
"If you start thinking about the 25 miles left to run, it's going to weigh you down.",
"Eventually, you'll get to the 26th mile, but thinking about it every step of the way can be mentally draining.",
"Find a way to develop a fool-proof system to get your task done earlier in the day, if possible.",
"Consistently, at the same time, every day is the best way to go.",
Twenty-one days for habit change is a made-up number.,
"That said, the first 60 or so days were the hardest for me.",
"Don't be shy, in the early days, to treat yourself to a reward for completing your habit.",
I've attempted in the past to add too many new habits too soon.,
I whittled my list way down this year and was able to achieve so much more.,
Quality over quantity!The common wisdom is that you need to be lucky to keep habit streaks going.,
I absolutely had more than my share of legitimate excuses I could have used.,
It's great when they get to a point where they can read and write all the letters from A to Z.,
"But then, they need to move on to words and sentences.",
Staying on at the level of the alphabet forever isn't helpful.,
"So, don't get too attached to the number of Xs on your habit chain once you've mastered a habit.",
"If you genuinely don't see any value carrying on, then it's time to break the chain.",
"Otherwise, you'll stay within your comfort zone, and that's not conducive to growth.",
Use the power of habit streaks by marking an X for each day you don't smoke.,
"By increasing the number of days in a row you don't smoke, you're de-addicting to the harmful habit.",
You can absolutely use some of these apps if you choose to.,
"Otherwise, simply use the old-school Seinfeld-method of using a calendar and red sharpie to mark your Xs.",
"In my opinion, the only mandatory requirement of whatever tracking system you use is its visibility.",
Not to stress yourself but to let your subconscious know that this endeavor matters to you.,
"As the habit chain starts to grow to a reasonable length, it develops superpowers of motivation.",
"But when we do, it opens our minds and hearts up to other possible achievements.",
Habit streaking can be used as a crutch to build such commitment and dedication.,
"Even an ordinary, non-legend like me has been able to use it well.",
Liz enjoys living in solitude outside of a large state forest preserve.,
When she isn't working shifts at a nearby hospital she enjoys driving out to the local trails to run or hike.,
"One of her favorite things to do is to go for a short hike with her husky, Max, in fresh snow.",
"Luckily for Liz, it snowed the night before and blanketed the trails with a fresh coating of 3-inches of snow.",
The perfect early winter conditions to bring Max out and enjoy a leisurely hike with your dog.,
Liz picks a trail system she has visited and hiked numerous times before.,
The wildness will be entirely hers if even just for a short while.,
"When Liz returns to the lot there is one car in the lot, a nondescript Chevy from the early 2000s.",
After putting her pack in her own car she decides to walk around to investigate the mystery of the other hiker.,
These outlying trails are not used very often except by those looking for some solitude.,
Liz doesn't want to startle anyone but curiosity is eating at her.,
"After about ten minutes into investigating the trail, the tracks suddenly take a sharp turn to the left.",
"Well, this explains why no one was within sight on the way back, Liz thinks to herself.",
"Liz thinks maybe the person decided to take a quick break, possibly to relieve themselves, before backtracking.",
She then remembers the car was still in the parking lot when she arrived so this is not probable.,
The tracks continue and just disappear into the distance of the woods.,
Curiosity has fully absorbed Liz's imagination at this point and she decides to also step off the trail.,
"Max, the ever happy husky, does not seem to like this idea.",
"After scanning the landscape, Liz realizes she is on an unmarked herd path.",
"There are no discernible blazes, but it is clear there is a path.",
"Once Liz reaches her car she puts Max in the back, takes off her pack, retrieves her trail map.",
From looking at the map it's apparent there is no trail listed off of the primary hiking trail.,
"Liz is tempted to stick around, partially out of curiosity, and also to make sure BOTH people emerge from the forest.",
"If not for her own safety, Liz needs to get going to prepare for a shift at work.",
"If that's what helps you feel safe enough to travel, so be it.",
"However, I do know lots of women who live similar lifestyles without a gun.",
All of them sprinted in the opposite direction when they saw me.,
The people you meet in wild places are typically reasonable; they're out there to enjoy the same things you are.,
They're just going to go to a populated place and kill someone who's easy to find.,
I prefer to live in a world where I can assume the people around me will not attack me.,
I think it's very unlikely I would ever be harmed in a way only a gun could prevent.,
Another reason not to take a gun on a long backpacking trip is its weight.,
"Developing the skills of empathy, situational awareness, and de-escalation.",
Do we really need to threaten people's lives in order to maintain our affairs?,
That's a position I'd prefer not to find myself in.,
A wise traveler develops a keen intuition about sketchy situations and learns how to quietly extract themselves without drawing attention.,
"They learn how to defuse people and maintain peace; they solve problems in creative, nuanced ways.",
My reluctance has more to do with the fact that the idea of killing a person is repulsive to me in general.,
"I believe most ""bad"" people are products of their environment; theft and violence are often acts of desperation.",
"I pity any person who would want to attack me, because that's got to be a miserable way to live.",
None of us asked to be born and we're all struggling through life together.,
"No matter how evil someone seems, I would prefer if they find help and healing rather than die a violent death.",
I don't want to be the person who decides it's their time to die.,
It's not something I want to have the option to do easily.,
This is just one of a large number of things that can kill a person with no warning.,

The canals once linked the trading warehouses with the ships of the port.,
"Most of the buildings date from the same time, giving a uniformity to design rarely seen in an Italian town.",
"Wider than the canals of Venice, they are now filled with fishing boats and little outboards.",
Where the Via Borra becomes the Via San Marco stands the Chiesa Santa Caterina.,
"Like many Tuscan churches, it has a façade of rough stone, but the octagonal façade is quite unusual.",
"Founded by the Dominicans in 1720, it was not mentioned in any guide-books, but a door stood open.",
"A few hours away by bus is Florence, packed with tourists; here we were the only people in the empty church.",
"The Chiesa Santa Caterina was empty, light, and spacious, with side chapels opening off the central corridor.",
"Originally published in 1550, Vasari's The Lives of The Artists remains essential reading for anyone interested in this period of art.",
"Often called the father of art history, he was the first to use the term Renaissance in print.",
"He also designed the loggia of the Uffizi, which opens onto the Arno.",
"Continuing along the Scali del Pontino and Scali delle Cantine, we left Little Venice and reached the Piazza della Repubblica.",
From the Piazza della Republica the Via Grande runs past the Cathedral of St. Francis of Assisi.,
"Completely destroyed by Allied bombing in 1943, its reconstruction was not completed until 1952.",
I found is a small The Suffering of Christ by Fra Angelico.,
"One of my favourite renaissance artists, Angelico's works in Florence's San Marco remain an ethereal wonder.",
As the sun set behind the hills it set the water ablaze.,
"I said anyway as I saw my wife looking at me, curious in her own ways about the call.",
"There was a pause at the other end, though I could still hear the slow rhythm of her breathing.",
"I nodded my head a couple of times, just to give an impression that I was listening.",
"She had stopped looking at me, her eyes now back to the magazine she was holding limply in her hands.",
She had put the magazine down and was leaning in my direction.,
"I put the phone back at my ears and blurted out, ""Hello!",
"He said that you were in some accident, and I need to come down there.",
"Around mid-May, European countries started to lift their restrictions, reopen their borders, and welcome back travelers.",
"After three stationary months, I packed my bags once again and hit the road.",
"I traveled nonstop between May and November, cruising around the Balkans and Southern Europe.",
That's easy to say when you can stay home for an entire year and still enjoy regular paychecks.,
"As such, it took until October before my income was back to pre-COVID levels.",
"As a self-employed content creator, I got very little from the government.",
"During the first half of the year, diversification was on the agenda.",
"On this basis, here is how I survived the storms of 2020 as a full-time traveler.",
"Through smart prioritization, hard work, and countless trial and error lessons, I made the lifestyle work.",
I built various online businesses and achieved financial independence after a year of traveling through Asia and Latin America.,
"In December 2019, I met up with my family in an Austrian skiing resort.",
"One night at a well-known après-ski bar, I said the following to my brother:I've made it.",
"I work for myself now, and I can travel the world full-time.",
Little did I know that the following months would bring me back to square one.,
"Ironically, the bar where we celebrated that night would become an infamous COVID-19 hotspot in the coming weeks.",
It didn't look like my Asia trip would be in jeopardy.,
"Fast forward to mid-March, and the whole world was in lockdown.",
"My Asia trip got canceled, and my income took a nosedive.",
The shocks of March provided several powerful lessons:One of my favorite books of 2020 was Matthew McConaughey's fantastic autobiography Greenlights.,
The global crisis had decimated my income and taken away my passion.,
I had financial woes - not knowing whether my business would go under - and mental troubles.,
I reorganized the problem by analyzing what kind of income streams were unlikely to return any time soon.,
I then stabilized the situation by focusing on the remaining clients and slowing my life down.,
I drew up plans to diversify and worked on solutions to travel safely during the Pandemic.,
"The month of April became a life-changer, both for my business and my digital nomad lifestyle.",
I started taking Medium seriously and launched a newsletter on my blog.,
I had countless Skype calls with professionals in the tourism industry - eagerly planning future collaborations.,
I also started a new Instagram page for my travels and re-orientated my photography.,
"Tourism is a vital industry, and closed borders are not a sustainable option.",
I started digital nomadism 2.0 in Germany and Austria as they were among the first reopen.,
"Bars had to close early, there were no events, and you had to wear masks everywhere.",
It was on the Austro-Slovenian border that I got my first taste of the chaos that would characterize 2020 travel.,
"On the bus, the Slovenian border police asked for my passport.",
"In normal times, there are no border controls between Austria and Slovenia as both countries are members of the Schengen Treaty.",
"As it turned out, Luxembourg had been added to the list a few days before.",
"One week later, after I had left Slovenia for Croatia, my country was off the list again.",
My brief Slovenian border episode became a small drop in an ocean of travel bureaucracy and incomprehensible entry regulations.,
"The European Commission published some guidelines throughout 2020, but as always, countries went their own ways.",
For young Europeans - who are used to crossing borders on a whim without even taking their passport - it was a nightmare.,
"Nevertheless, travel was possible, and there were also lots of advantages.",
"After that, I headed to Portugal, where I spent two months improving my Portuguese and working on new projects.",
"Italy and Portugal had barely any restrictions, and for a short period, I forgot that COVID even existed.",
"Yes, you had to wear a mask in supermarkets and on trains, but other than that, nothing had changed.",
"At the end of September, I headed to my next nomad base: Athens, Greece.",
"Upon arriving at Athens Airport, an unfriendly airport official barked out orders at the passengers.",
"On the official website, it said that they would randomly select passengers for testing.",
"In my case, the random selection included an entire plane of 200 travelers.",
"It was my fifth test and came back negative, like the previous four.",
"I had taken three in Luxembourg and one in Portugal, but this one was different.",
A positive result would have meant two weeks in a Greek quarantine facility.,
"After all, I was entering Greece, and I needed to play by their rules.",
"However, the supposedly random selection and the lack of information about subsequent procedures made it a bit sketchy.",
The testing in Greece was just one of the many aspects that made traveling in 2020 an uncertain affair.,
I nonetheless had a brilliant time in Greece and left just before they entered their second full-scale lockdown.,
"By November, most of Europe was in some sort of lockdown again.",
"It was another break from my digital nomad lifestyle, but this time it was well-planned and intentional.",
"I had to describe it in one word, it would be uncertainty.",
"In 2019, I booked a plane to Bangkok two days before leaving.",
I didn't have the slightest worry that something could go wrong.,
"In 2020, I needed to check five different websites before booking anything.",
"And what are other conditions?Consequently, as a digital nomad, planning became even more difficult.",
"Many attractions remained closed, creating a hindrance for the necessary balancing act between work and adventure.",
Those of us who can travel are still in a privileged position.,
"I only visited one new country in 2020, the microstate of San Marino, compared to 12 in 2019.",
"In that same vein, explaining that I had to rebuild my professional life from scratch does little more.",
"The vaccines are here, but it will take months before we'll feel their impact on a global scale.",
"Nevertheless, the world is as open as it's ever been - at least since March 2020.",
I am leaving Europe in early January and plan to travel to new countries before returning home for the vaccine.,
"But if there's anything I've learned from being a digital nomad in 2020, it's that things can change rapidly.",
That's why I don't plan much in advance and spend a lot of time in each nomad base.,
"If you want lots of adventurous experiences with spontaneous expeditions, it might not be the best time.",
Digital nomadism is about making a living on the road while seeking thrilling adventures.,
"Right now, the ""making a living on the road"" part is challenging.",
"The ""seeking thrilling adventures"" part, on the other hand, is next to impossible.",
"Now might not be the best time to embark on a digital nomad adventure, but it's the second-best time.",
"A year later, due to overwhelming demand, a national version was published.",
"She explained that this is one of the things the ""ABC Travel Green Book"" deals with.",
She decided she wanted to help the travel industry change and that it had the financial incentive to do so.,
"Lewis said she wanted to ""make them understand how much the Black consumer, the Black traveler, spends.",
"This garnered some buzz, she said, and brands started hiring her to do internal training and influencer trips.",
"There's a group dedicated to Black women who come to Amsterdam,"" she said.",
"Amplification, alliance, and accountability are listed as the pillars of the alliance's community on its website.",
"Black travelers spend worldwide - a first of its kind, according to Lewis.",
"So I'm excited to see it actually,"" she said.",
"What does it mean to focus on your work?Regardless of what kind of work it might be,",
"What if focus meant stripping away the non-essential stuff, learning to say no to the hundred other good ideas.",
"He was at this trendy bar with his buddy Mitch, who had shamed him into coming.",
"Mitch was on the floor dancing and schmoozing, but Rob couldn't find the energy.",
He sighed and stared at the remnants of foam floating in his beer.,
She sat on the other side of the rectangular-shaped bar.,
"She just watched him, like his mother's cat used to do.",
He glanced behind him to make sure that he was the target of her gaze.,
She had beautiful red hair-fluffy with a slight curl at the ends that rested below her shoulders.,
"As he drew closer he saw that her eyes were amber and outlined in black eyeliner, like a pinup from the 50s.",
Her skin had a light tan and glowed with fitness and health.,
His mind grasped for one-liners or small talk but words failed him.,
He looked into her eyes and a strange feeling of home washed over him.,
The one place where you could be yourself and know you were loved.,
"But, instead, he took it and rubbed his thumb over the top of it.",
"He bit his lip, imagining how they would look caressing his chest.",
"He vaguely recognized her perfume, it had an earthy, woody scent that sent a jolt to his manhood.",
He realized he still held her hand so he gently pulled her to standing.,
She picked up the large black tote bag that hung on the back of her seat and followed him.,
It took no time at all to lead her out of the club and get into a taxi conveniently waiting at the curb.,
"After giving his address to the driver, Rob turned to the woman.",
As their kiss deepened it seemed as though he stood outside of himself and marveled at how perfectly they fit together.,
"Rob closed the front door and leaned her against the wall, pressing his body against her.",
"Her hands traveled all over his body, feeling his muscles and kneading them with gentle pinches.",
His arm bumped her large tote bag as his hands slid down her body.,
"All passion had left her and she stood, clutching her bag and edging towards the door.",
His internal voice repeating its mantra: You always screw things up with women.,
"Her tote bag hung from her hand, an inch above the floor.",
"She stared at him, the way she had at the bar earlier that night.",
Her hair was tangled in a sexy mess from his hands and her lips wet and swollen from his kisses.,
Once she reached him she placed her hands on his pecs and then slid them up onto his shoulders.,
One hand kneaded the back of his neck and the other threading through his hair.,
"His body responded immediately, effectively shutting up his thoughts of surprise before they could ruin the moment.",
"She clawed at the buttons on his shirt, and he reached up to pull it off his head.",
She tugged at the end of his belt and unbuckled it before scratching his stomach in her rush to pull off his Levis.,
"He backed up towards his bedroom, kissing her and untying the belt of her wraparound dress.",
"They stood beside the bed naked and looked at each other, chests heaving with excitement.",
There was no other word for the beautiful leap she made onto the bed and onto his body.,
"Her warmth, silky skin, long hair, and earthy scent overtook his senses.",
"He slid down to her feet and sucked on her toes, also painted black, he noted.",
"She watched him with her amber eyes, half-closed in desire.",
"He kissed his way up her calves, leaving a hand to caress her feet and gently massage her ankle.",
A woman who would let him adore her body and not pull back into a shell of body shame.,
By the time he finally entered her he'd lost count of how often she had found release.,
She wrapped her legs and arms around him and he looked into her eyes.,
"All he wanted was to make this magic, this connection, last as long as humanly possible.",
"When he finally couldn't take it he plunged into her, lost in his own body and hearing her release with him.",
"Then he lay on his back with her tucked under his arm, her hand caressing his chest hair.",
"Rob had to go to work the next day, and he left her sleeping in his bed.",
Rob came home at 5:30 p.m. and saw her standing at the stove stirring a pot that smelled like a delicious stew.,
"A tingle of relief went through him, and he couldn't hide his smile as he walked towards her.",
"She watched him, in that way he loved and pressed her body against him when he hugged her from behind.",
"As if the night before had only been practice, their lovemaking reached an even higher level.",
Their eye contact and familiarity with each other let them reach a spiritual connection that Rob had never experienced.,
"All that existed was that moment, their bodies and the never ending delight they found in pleasing each other.",
"He hugged her shoulder, loving how it felt to have her head resting upon his chest.",
His heart shouted and it almost reached his lips before his rational mind jumped in to make its case.,
You met her in a bar and now you are going to let her freeload off of you?His heart argued back.,
"Home-cooked meals, clean house, a gorgeous woman ready and willing in my bed?",
He looked into her amber eyes with her red hair falling around her face and her sexy smile.. .,
"Every day, Zorra cleaned the house and cooked a delicious dinner.",
"Foods from his childhood-soups, stews, casseroles and pies.",
"He didn't give her money for groceries, but she kept his refrigerator full.",
"Every night she made love with him, sometimes it was playful and filled with wrestling and laughter.",
"But most often it was that slow, spiritual union that he'd never experienced with any other woman.",
She didn't elaborate and somehow Rob knew she didn't want him to question her further.,
"But, instead of using the one in the hall, he headed to the bedroom.",
"He paused behind the door, trying to look into the tote without touching it.",
"He wondered, but as he stood there he saw Zorra peek her head around the door.",
She pounced on the bed and looked over her shoulder at him.,
"He came home from work in the afternoon, hoping she would be out and he could look inside of it.",
"That evening, when he returned home he went into the bedroom to change clothes and spied the bag hanging on the door.",
He didn't even need to walk close to it before the smell of musk hit him.,
His heart knew that look and begged him to leave the bag alone.,
They ate a silent dinner and he knew better then to try and make love.,
"She lay far on her side of the bed, her body curled around herself.",
The musk of a wild animal-like when he visited the foxes in the zoo.,
"When he was a kid he'd stand in front of the cage, his nose pressed between the thin wires and sniff.",
Until he did that on a school field trip and the other kids had seen him.,
He'd learned then to hide his pleasure in wild earthy things.,
"He became the proper urban male, seeking his entertainment in cultural events like concerts and theater.",
"It was easy to avoid the wild in the City, and he rarely had a reason to leave it.",
"He started to get out of bed, determined to look in the bag.",
"Startled, he looked at her and saw the pleading in her eyes.",
"He jerked his arm free from her hold and marched for the bag, his shoulders back and his resolve strong.",
He took it off the hook and ignored the yelp of fear he heard from the bed.,
She pulled the fox pelt from his hand and pushed it into her tote.,
"Slinging it over her shoulder, she looked at Rob with glittering eyes.",
It shut with a slam that closed off a portal to another world.,
The first step to doing that is to understand how to make your blog more readable.,
"As writers, a lot of us only consider what we write.",
What we forget to consider is how our audience reads and what they want.,
Use a lot of H2 and H3 sub-headings in your blog post.,
This creates sections of text instead of making your blog post seem like an academic research paper.,
"Also, multiple sub-headings make your content seem more organized.",
You'll have to forget the rule of English writing that you learned in school for this.,
"Break your paragraphs into the smallest length possible, even if it means a paragraph has just one sentence.",
Just take a look above at how most of my paragraphs look.,
The human mind usually reads the first and last sentences of a paragraph when skim reading.,
"Now that you have decided to keep your paragraphs short, let's take it up a notch.",
This helps create more white space in your presentation and obviously helps with making your blog more readable.,
One of the easiest ways to write short sentences is to create bullet points.,
We all love reading lists as compared to normal blocks of text.,
"If you just put everything in bold, you lose the whole point of why you are doing it in the first place.",
"No matter how short or long your blog post, make sure you have a good mix of visuals included.",
"It can be videos, GIFs, charts, tables, etc.",
Your reader will definitely thank you for including something other than just a bunch of text.,
There are reasons why we don't write documents in comic sans or joker man.,
The readability goes down to zero and you also make sure that the reader never comes to your blog ever again.,
"When in doubt, just go with the default font your CMS provides, or just go with decent web font.",
"Unless you are out to write Shakespearean literature, it is better to stick to the simplest of words.",
"Irrespective of how educated your target audience might be, writing in plain language is the easiest to read.",
Even white text on a black background is strenuous to the eyes.,
"For example, please never use yellow text on a purple background or something equally wild.",
Anyone who knows me and my wife knows that we love to travel.,
There is nothing that invites drinking without shame for three straight days than a trip to somewhere you've never been.,
Alcohol is already one of the biggest money sucks of anything you will ever do in life.,
"We hit up New Orleans, Houston, Little Rock, and Nashville.",
"For me, this is the one that is probably the most precious.",
"But after weeks of online searches and playing with alternate itineraries, I had a plan.",
"There were some cool things on display, but in truth, I got antsy quickly.",
"Luckily, I then stumbled upon the attached Darwin Centre and remembered that this had been my intended destination all along.",
"They're these weird, generally tiny aliens that live alongside us here on earth.",
"Fish, especially those that live deep in the ocean, strike me much the same way.",
"I got a marshmallow cereal with ice cream and marshmallow milk, and it was perfectly deliciously childish.",
"Still, they did have toys from my childhood, and yes, there were several strange and disturbing dolls.",
"Hello, ""skeletons and scientific abnormalities, erotica and 'celebrity waste', shrunken heads and exotic souvenirs.",
"Okay, so the True Crime Museum wasn't as big as I had hoped.",
"Still, it had cool exhibits and was absolutely worth the visit.",
"I'm hoping, given the current popularity of true crime that they'll eventually expand their museum for my future visiting pleasure.",
"The Clink Prison, now a museum, dates all the way back to 1144.",
It was the oldest and most notorious prison in England and is where calling prison ',
"Someone who's interested in Mithraism, the Roman mystery religion, would surely love the place.",
"At the end of the day, this trip to London wasn't just a good time.",
"That's the sound of Chinese tradition being played across generations, a game that grandkids can play with their grandparents.",
A game passed down from their ancestors and their ancestors before them.,
"The swooshing of the tiles on the velvety green table is mesmerizing, as are the hands doing the swooshing.",
"But more importantly, it's a game filled with Chinese heritage and culture.",
The game appears rather quick-paced and there isn't time to think -,
"The tiles themselves have significant meaning, each etched and painted just right.",
That is until three white women from Dallas decided the tiles that originated from the Qing Dynasty weren't good enough for them.,
The Mahjong Line was created by three white women in Dallas in November of 2020.,
"In the short two months since their grand opening, they have faced national backlash and even received threats.",
"They have been accused of cultural appropriation, referred to as racist, colonizers, and modern-day versions of Columbus.",
"The last time I checked, their original About Us page was taken down and replaced with a half-hearted apology.",
They have since shut down their comments section and their Facebook page has been deleted.,
The American version uniquely differs from the Chinese version but the tiles used have remained largely unchanged from the original.,
"It's important to point out that The Mahjong Line's intention was to modernize American Mah Jongg, not Chinese Mahjong.",
The design and symbolism of each Mahjong tile have important significance to the Chinese culture.,
"Typically, only three colors are used - red for luck, blue for the sky, and green for the earth.",
Each character and symbol is etched and painted on an ivory white tile.,
"The Mahjong Line's were priced astronomically high, ranging from $325 to $425.",
Thousands of people have lost their jobs and the entire world is currently in an economic downfall.,
"Whether it's the American version, the Japanese version, or otherwise, Mahjong is inherently Chinese.",
There was no mention of China or the Qing Dynasty but rather they focused on the American history of Mahjong.,
"Since the launch of The Mahjong Line, the only copy on their website is their apology.",
"And one from Paper City magazine:Intentional or not, every word in their copy insulted the aesthetics of the Chinese tiles.",
"Mahjong tiles have been reinvented, redesigned, and transformed into cards.",
Every word in their copy had an air of superiority in it.,
"After initially being called out, The Mahjong Line added a throwaway line to acknowledge Mahjong's Chinese origins.",
It was even more insulting than the erasure of it in the first place.,
They've shut down comments even when they said they were open to criticism.,
It doesn't seem like they'll be opening them up any time soon.,
"Across all news platforms and social media, one thing was apparent - the three women who founded the company are white.",
Race is always an emotionally charged subject regardless of which cultures are involved.,
I personally don't care that these were three white women trying to redesign Mahjong tiles.,
"I care that, in order to sell their business idea, they felt the need to insult the culture that created it.",
Wrong:The reinvention of something that has a rich and historical past is brave and innovative if done properly.,
Prepare to face a bombardment of accusations and backlash if done wrong.,
Becoming more productive isn't about more productivity hacks or yet another time management framework.,
"In fact, those things are usually distractions from adressing the real issues with productivity.",
"If you're ready to get serious about becoming more productive, work to cultivate these four mental habits.",
Most of the productivity and habit building advice you hear offers tips and tricks for better time management.,
Marketers and salespeople use forcing functions all the time to increase the odds that a potential customer becomes an actual customer.,
"Suppose I really wanted to get this article done by Monday, but I kept procrastinating on writing it.",
"So, instead of hoping for the best, they assume the worst and plan accordingly.",
But being a jerk to yourself doesn't motivate you to do anything but be more of a jerk to yourself.,
"Our brain is like a muscle, you should always train it in order to make it stronger.",
"Learning is a part of this process, it makes the brain active and energized.",
"As a human being, you need to always spend some of your daily time learning new things.",
I know it's not easy to be disciplined and motivated every day.,
"In this article, I will share with you some of the tips that I follow to push myself into learning every day.",
"In my situation, I knew that learning is the only way to improve myself.",
It helps me to achieve my goals and has a lot of benefits to my personality.,
"Last year, I started learning web development to become a web developer.",
"So I had to learn some technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many more.",
So I will have to learn them in order to be updated.,
"In my case, it was my goal of becoming a web developer which requires learning a lot.",
"Also, I knew the benefits of learning and the impact it will keep on my personality.",
I try to organize myself by planning times of learning throughout the day.,
So try to keep yourself far from distractions as much as you can.,
"The extra hours in the morning have a lot to offer, particularly if you're looking to improve your lifestyle.",
I encourage you to have a morning routine where you learn new things for the day.,
I do that and it has a lot of benefits for my mental and physical health.,
"You can get more done while others are sleeping, that's what successful people do.",
One of the tips to get things done is by trying to reward yourself.,
"I do it almost every day, I try to reward myself if I get things done.",
"For example, if I learned something new related to my field, I will have the ability to play a video game.",
This encourages me to get more things done in order to reward myself a lot.,
It's a good strategy to try if you want to push yourself to do your daily tasks.,
Learning new things has its own sets of perks which brings success and helps you become a better version of yourself.,
So think about your goals before trying to spend your time on useless stuff.,
"Thank you for reading this article, I hope you found it useful.",
"I swiveled my head toward the advancing din, then back to Dani.",
Zimmer smiled at Dani and me from behind his expansive mahogany desk.,
She ran her finger along the edges of the pamphlet Dr. Zimmer had provided us.,
"We're modifying a single gene with an RNA-encoded virus, so it only requires one dose.",
"Cats' genetic code was published in 2007; it took twenty years to research and develop this cure.""",
"Zimmer flattened his palms together, tilted his head, and pressed them to his cheek, pantomiming sleep.",
"When you want to sleep, pull your blanket up and close your eyes.",
It would do no good if Dani or I collided with a tree and one of us had to carry the other.,
"If we could keep ahead, they'd eventually tire or become bored.",
"The question was, how long would that take?My left foot landed on a dry twig that snapped loudly.",
"The racket would work in our favor, assuming we made it there.",
"The din of wood chippers and electric saws would provide acoustic camouflage, and the predators might even be afraid of the noise.",
"The paper mill was both our best, and only, hope.",
"Dani snored, standing up while we continued toward the paper mill.",
We stumbled forward toward the mill like children tied together in a three-legged race.,
"They see us as intruder cats who have invaded their territory.""",
"Nevertheless, this exposure and return to his old ways make Daud's most notable character transformation feel trivial and arbitrary in retrospect.",

"I had done a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering, but always knew I wanted to do something creative.",
How can I make enough money to avoid my parents being disappointed in my choice to not pursue engineering as a career?,
"There were quite a few options that came up, one of which was ghostwriting.",
"I paid around $3 to buy ""connects,"" which are like coins for applying for jobs.",
"I applied for some jobs, the applications took me on average five minutes to complete, and hoped for the best.",
Here are some tips for applying:This will allow you to tailor your application to the job and dramatically increase your chances.,
"Some clients add words like Banana 123, just to make sure the applicants have read through the job details.",
"When an advertiser receives your application, they are only able to see the first few lines.",
"They receive many applications, especially if the job is for $5,000 and above.",
They might decide to open your application but only if you write something in the first line that's impossible to ignore.,
"It could be something silly, a joke, but the first line must grab their attention.",
"After adding in eye-catching first lines, make sure the next lines are polite.",
Tell them why you enjoy this kind of writing and why you'd be a better candidate than any of the other applicants.,
"Please, thank you, and have a good day really does go a long way.",
"The advertiser would find it easier to communicate with someone polite, than someone rude and abrupt.",
"Sometimes they prefer inexperienced writers as these writers are adaptable, and can follow directions easily.",
"I did all of the above for all my applications, and about seven hours later I heard back from a job advertiser!",
"It was for a self-help book and the advertisement was $5,000-$7,000.",
She liked my opening line and my proposal so much that she gave me the job immediately.,
She also activated my milestone after two days which meant I got paid before finishing the book.,
"Ghostwriting and making money can be tough, but it's all about how you market yourself.",
"You'll make long-lasting connections, and you'll be making money in no time.",
I felt a deep sadness on Wednesday when rioters attacked the Capitol.,
"Sadness for the country, sadness for my fellow citizens, and sadness for the city that I love.",
"I first visited Washington, D.C. when I was in 8th grade for the stereotypical tourist trip.",
"I loved the museums, the monuments, the history, and the light.",
Have you noticed how light and clean the city is compared to many other big cities?,
"Eventually I figured out that the light comes from the wide streets, the wide sidewalks, and the height limits on buildings.",
"I still find the anonymity of the city to be delightful, but I also started to identify the smallness of the city.",
You can walk from one side of the city to another relatively easily.,
It's not that big and even as an eighteen year-old I felt like I could get my arms around it.,
I spent countless nights in college walking up and down the mall.,
"The monuments and the mall are extraordinary in all seasons, but my favorite is the winter - especially in the snow.",
"Did you know that the best time to visit the Lincoln is mid-week, in winter, at night?",
"There are always people there, it's a universal rule I think, but that's when it's quietest.",
"Did you know that during summer nights, bats patrol the skies above the reflecting pool protecting tourists from mosquitoes?",
"You won't see them during the day, you have to go at night.",
"D.C. locals - either born and raised, or adopted Washingtonians - especially in their shared annoyance with tourists.",
You can tell who is a local by how they use escalators.,
"Unless you want to get yelled at, please, please walk on the left, stand on the right.",
"Don't block commuters trying to get to work, especially during rush hour.",
"And yet, there is something truly magical that so many people want to see the sights in my backyard.",
"If you are lucky enough to get the right flight plan, flying right next to the monument is nothing short of extraordinary.",
Driving up the GW Parkway in Virginia is one of the most beautiful drives.,
"Especially in the spring, when the dogwoods and tulips are in bloom.",
"I get annoyed with the suffocating summers, or I start to get twitchy and want to explore someplace new.",
I'm very aware that the city often falls short of this lofty vision.,
"Homelessness is a constant problem, exacerbated by the increasing gentrification within the city limits.",
"The city is expensive, theater culture has been slow to develop, and the lack of statehood is wildly unfair.",
There is a certain swampiness of the political culture and a vibe that can be nauseating at times.,
What these phrases have in common is that they can all be applied to science - and success.,
"Not a good thing if you're looking to attain the ""upward movement"" you want in your area of focus.",
"If you're already accomplishing a lot, then your ""same direction"" is a good one.",
"But what about moving in this positive direction ""at the same speed"" as always?",
The fact is we need this imbalance to move us in the right direction at the increased pace we desire.,
"And this ""unbalanced force"" we need to achieve more is known by a common name: adversity.",
"Sadly enough, these three things are only a few of the many ways life slaps us in the face.",
"But the ""good news"" is the ""unbalanced force"" of adversity is everywhere.",
The reality is our world will never truly be free of some form of adversity.,
"So perhaps we should consider Newton's law as a metaphor for life, one worthy of greater consideration.",
"We should embrace this imbalance he speaks of and makes it work for us, not against us.",
"If we use adversity to our advantage, it can make us more powerful than ever before.",
"We want to hide, so we can be ""at rest"" again.",
But giving in to these thoughts is the most poisonous form of self-sabotage.,
"Think of the boldest, most dramatic life changes you've embarked on.",
I'll wager that many of them came after you persevered and managed to overcome some conflict in your life.,
"For example, think of people who have survived tragedies, life-threatening illnesses, or near-death experiences.",
Their ability to endure and move past these situations have made them embrace life in an exponentially more positive way.,
"Stone's first novel was spurned by publishers, and when he eventually found a publisher, the novel failed to find success.",
His bravery in combat earned him two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star.,
"After the war, Stone enrolled in cinema school and worked under legendary director Martin Scorsese.",
"The more you fight back against the hurdles life throws your way, the more success you will be capable of.",
"This is due to the fact that with each barrier you move past, the feeling of ""I did this.",
"As a result, you are more courageous and resilient when the next stumbling block presents itself.",
"And courage and resilience are the backbone of growth, productivity, and prosperity.",
"None of us want to see ourselves, the things we have worked for, or the people we care about suffer.",
"Entrepreneur agrees, stating that ""adversity is a great teacher.""",
"And being a teacher myself, I can assure you knowledge is one of the quickest ways to go further faster.",
The publication gives examples of some valuable questions our struggles and failures reward us with.,
"When the solution to our difficulties is found, we make a deliberate decision to never again make the same bad choices.",
In every defeat is a lesson showing you how to win the victory next time.,
Are there actions that occurred after the initial mistake that made the problem increase in magnitude?,
"If the problem is inescapable, what are ways you can best minimize its backlash?",
Make a plan and then commit to it so the likelihood of repeated mistakes is minimized or erased.,
"Realize that there is no one ""right"" way for everyone to triumph over hardship.",
"If you are creative, brainstorming innovative ways or approaches to difficulties may help you find the best course of action to take.",
"If you have great people skills, utilizing the people around you may be the way to most effectively resolve troublesome situations.",
"For example, this free test is one that can help you decipher your greatest assets.",
"After all, we don't want to be ""objects at rest.",
"Adversity gives us that ability, even if there are a few tears in the process.",
It just sort of happened after spending half of our waking hours working alongside one another.,
Research tells us that having best friends at work is a great thing for us and for our companies.,
My work friendships were built slowly over time through small touchpoints that snowballed into meaningful connections.,
I can almost hear the nay-sayers as I type this.,
"Remember the coffee breaks, hallway gossip, and watercooler talk that transpired when we all physically worked together?",
"None of those things are happening now, and they all took time.",
The interactions that contributed most to my work friendships were the seemingly unproductive moments spent together at work.,
"Goodall explains how he brought this practice to life at his company, Cisco, through the Power of Teams program.",
Sometimes they might even need to vent to their co-workers about their boss.,
"Most notably, the productivity hacks that have been promoted for years are no longer effective.",
"In fact, most of these strategies aren't even realistic anymore and we have to adjust.",
"While I'm not hating on traditional productivity techniques, the new reality is that they are outdated and must be adapted.",
COVID-19.I'm sure that you've come across this adage a million times.,
"In fact, this has been championed by some of the most productive and successful people throughout time.",
"Everyone from Ben Franklin, Tim Cook, Michelle Obama, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson are morning birds.",
"To be fair, there is merit to being an early riser.",
"And, because the world is still sleeping, you're more productive.",
"The hormone melatonin, whose rise makes the body feel less alert, decreases later in the morning for night owls.",
"So, instead of forcing yourself to wake up at some ungodly hour, follow your own circadian rhythm.",
"Now that you aren't fighting against yourself, you can plan your schedule when you're at your best.",
"And, since you may be homeschooling your kids, there's another way that this could work in your favor as well.",
"If you're a night owl, you can focus on your most important work when the kids go to bed.",
That means you can be with them during the day while still being productive during your peak hours.,
Yet another common productivity hack promoted by successful individuals is having a morning routine.,
These habits can supercharge your day since they can set the tone for the day.,
"Case in point, the hour-long morning routine of Tim Ferriss.",
"While I have nothing against it, it's just not realistic for everyone, in particular parents.",
"But, make sure that you keep it simple enough so that it's realistic.",
"However, ""don't respond unless it will take you less than a minute.",
"For the uninitiated, it doesn't mean literally eating frogs - which I don't find all that appetizing.",
"Instead, it's tackling your most important or challenging task bright and early.",
Most of us tend to be most alert and energetic in the morning.,
"Besides, once this is no longer hanging over your head, it feels like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders.",
"But, as already mentioned, not everyone is a morning person.",
"Again, as opposed to forcing yourself to work when you aren't at your peak is counterproductive.",
"As such, it's a better idea to schedule your ""frogs"" during your golden hours.",
"Additionally, even if you are a morning person, there's a solid chance that you've had to adjust your schedule.",
"For example, let's say you currently have kids at home, and you need to help them with schoolwork.",
Research from Kevin Kruse has found that millionaires don't rely on to-do-lists.,
The first reason he found was that they don't account for time.,
"Once again, our impulse is to fight the urgent and ignore the important.",
"It's no wonder we feel so overwhelmed in the day, but fight insomnia at night.",
"I should add, though, that there's absolutely nothing wrong with jotting down reminders.",
The occasional braindump ensures that you won't forget anything while clearing your head.,
"However, committing to only lists may not be as effective as scheduling.",
"In all seriousness, I'm a fan of the Pomodoro Technique.",
"After all, it encourages me to take frequent breaks throughout the day to keep me fresh.",
"Moreover, it has benefits like improving planning and dealing with distractions and interruptions.",
Because you're supposed to work in 25-minutes and then take a break.,
"To solve this predicament, try a modified version called the Flowtime Technique.",
"Created by Zoë Read-Biven, here's how it works.",
The jest is that you're tracking your time while also identifying common distractions.,
"Also, it still encourages you to take breaks, but whenever you need them.",
But that's only if you know how to clearly communicate your expectations and have people that you trust.,
"Furthermore, you still need to carve out time to monitor the task.",
"And, most importantly, you also need to know what exactly to delegate and to whom.",
"If you're missing any of the above, outsourcing and delegating properly won't be effective.",
Studies have found that multitasking can improve your performance by sharpening multisensory integration.,
"What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast; ""This means deepening time, not fragmenting it.",
"Besides, science has shown that you'll get more done when it's quiet.",
"Of course, can you actually be in an environment where it's completely silent?",
"Even if I head noise-canceling headphones,s higher-pitched random noises, like voices, can still come through.",
"At the same time, there are advantages to listening to music and background noise.",
"You may work best listening to classical music, while others prefer video game tunes.",
"For those who were fortunate enough to have a home office, the transition to working from home hasn't been as trying.",
"But, if you don't have the space for a home office?",
"If you're really limited on space because you're in a small apartment or sharing tablespace with your family, get creative.",
"For instance, you could clean out a closet and make a cozy office in there.",
"But, to be honest, you really don't need research to prove this.",
"And, it can also help you mentally shift into work mode.",
We're grieving the loss of the world we used to know - and love.,
"Despite what conventional wisdom has previously said, the new reality is that you can wear whatever you damn feel like.",
I think in a rebuttal to an L.A. Times piece entitled Enough With the WFH Sweatpants.,
"Like the Adult You're Getting Paid to Be, Esquire's Ben Boskovich, put it best. """,
Whether dressing like you're headed to the office makes you feel better or not is up to you.,
"Not me, and not a deputy fashion director who wants you to wear jeans.",
"If you have a video call, throw on an appropriate outfit instead of your cozy, yet raggedy, bathrobe.",
Putting things off can cause you to fall behind or even stress you out.,
It can also cause you to miss out on opportunities and put a strain on your relationships.,
"In fact, it may even be able to improve your productivity and happiness.",
"Not only is that detrimental to your health, but it also influences your productivity.",
"Back in 2017, research from UC Berkeley found that trying to force yourself doesn't work.",
More interesting was that those who do accept these feelings reported fewer mood disorder symptoms.,
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists have recommended that we don't ignore difficult feelings.",
"Instead, we need to acknowledge them and reach out for help.",
"Inc. ""A simple calendar or to-do list is best to quickly plan out your schedule and get things done.",
That means you need to make a time investment in figuring out the work.,
"Moreover, these tools are so robust that they can be overwhelming and you'll probably spend more time organizing than doing.",
"For years, it was advised that we strive for work-life balance.",
I feel that most of us realized this as we began working remotely.,
"But, you have to walk the dog, keep up with household chores, and take care of the kids.",
"In other words, instead of setting hard boundaries and compartmentalizing, you connect work and life.",
"Well, stick to a schedule and routine, but also be flexible.",
There's not a one of us that can escape our complicated family histories.,
"They're all different, unique, and filled with both tragedy and joy.",
"Giant Sparrow received many accolades for this title, all well deserved.",
"Set against the backdrop of Orcas Island, Washington, the imagery is as beautiful as it is haunting.",
"I knew I needed to change my ""system"" when I was becoming more stressed and less fulfilled.",
"As a writer, I felt like there were never enough hours in the day to do everything.",
"I wanted to do too much, and I wanted to do it now.",
I was piling so much on my plate and stretching myself far too thin.,
"However, so many things often got in the way of my daily word count goal.",
"When doing everything became impossible, I became discouraged, which created a negative cycle.",
The thing is: there simply aren't enough hours in the day to do everything I want.,
"Once I admitted that, I realized I needed to change my system to better fit my writer's lifestyle.",
I began by writing down a list of everything I wanted to do.,
And I mean everything: from long-term goals like publishing a book to short-term goals like refreshing my portfolio.,
"Once I did this, I noticed a trend: many tasks I wanted to do took some time to complete.",
"Most of them were projects that went through various stages of completion, and others required ongoing, never-ending maintenance.",
I needed to start thinking in terms of days instead of hours.,
"After accepting the fact that there simply aren't enough hours in the day, I gave myself permission to take more time.",
"Instead of having a daily to-do list, I began a running weekly Master Task List.",
"There, I wrote down everything I wanted to complete by the end of the week, instead of the day.",
"Then, as I prepared for each day ahead, I cherrypicked the tasks I was up to tackling.",
This gave me the flexibility of only selecting tasks based on my mental health and availability.,
"At Cliché Magazine, my team and I had a week when we brainstormed content ideas for the following month.",
"That way, we had a better idea of how much time we had to reach the deadline.",
"While I've often prepped blog posts a week in advance, rarely have I planned content a month out.",
"However, working a month in advance again has given me much more time to prepare thoughtful content without feeling rushed.",
"I'm still getting the same amount of writing done, but now I'm much more prepared and less stressed out.",
Discovering the apps Ulysses and Trello changed my life this past year.,
"Here, I can keep track of all my different projects all in one place without opening various windows in my Documents.",
Trello's kanban-style design makes it even easier for me to implement my Content Calendar.,
"Here is where I schedule tasks for the week or the month, arranged by stages of completion.",
"To Write column, then drag and drop it along the columns as it nears completion.",
"Both apps help me visualize the various moving stages of my writing, and I can't recommend them enough.",
"Once my writing projects are complete, I schedule them in advance.",
"Megan Portorreal is a professional writer, editor, and creative in the New York City area.",
"They sang and danced, played games like charades and musical chairs, or just talked to individuals who needed a soothing ear.",
Those tits you saw last night might be the last tits some of you will ever see.,
"You get some breakfast, and I want every one of you to write home just in case.",
"About 50,000 men lost their lives in those three days at Gettysburg, but not John Robert Harriman.",
It seemed like that might get put to the test again during this mission.,
None of this meant much to Patrick because all of these villages and provinces looked the same to him.,
One thing was certain: This was not going to be a good day.,
Patrick could only hope it wasn't going to be his last day.,
"After Patrick handed his letter to Hound Dog, the Sergeant gave it back and told him he forgot to stamp it.",
"That meant he hadn't written the word ""free"" on the envelope where the stamp would normally go,",
About 50 pounds in all to lug around in the stifling jungle heat.,
"Hound Dog turned around, and Patrick pointed to what looked like some kind of man-made structure.",
"Patrick did, and the rancid smell made him feel like puking right there.",
Patrick took cover in the disgusting shitter and that gave him a chance to scope where the enemy was attacking from.,
The roar of war was all around as Hound Dog tried to plot his response.,
Hound Dog scanned the snake line of men that stretched about 50 yards behind him and began barking his orders.,
Hound Dog made it to his first position just as Patrick had to stop to load the next bandoleer.,
Hound Dog began moving to the next position when the unthinkable happened.,
"The captain's right foot stepped on the wire, and the grenade that was maybe five feet to his right detonated.",
"Such as Jimmy Cannon, who took shrapnel that tore a hole into his neck and nearly severed his head.",
"If you hate your workspace, you are not going to get anything done.",
"Likewise, if you love your workspace, you are going to be extremely productive.",
"People might tell you that where you work doesn't matter, but I think those people are in denial.",
"After all, we are seeing how this plays out every day with people who work from home.",
Many people who love working from home have a workspace they love.,
I have found this to be true in my own life too.,
"Over the years, I have worked in offices with open workspaces, cubicles, and individual offices.",
"Some of the jobs I have had put me to work in event spaces, coffee shops, and out of my car.",
"According to studies, your physical workspace matters a great deal to how much work you get done and your overall wellbeing.",
"This was one of the more difficult settings for me and for a long time, I didn't know why.",
"However, I have a ton of natural light in this room and therefore complete a lot of work throughout the day.",
"You need to have a good, ergonomic set up for your desk and chair.",
"There is three main sense I am talking about here: sight, smell, touch.",
"The more this is tailored to you, the more you will like your workspace, the more you will get done.",
"While the sound is part of your senses, this one gets a space all to itself.",
Here are three ways to control the noise that contributes to your productivity.,
"Clearly, noise can be both positive and negative when it comes to your workspace and getting things done.",
That is why it is very important that you tailor this part of your workspace specifically to you.,
No matter what you need it should never be far away and it should be easy to access.,
The key is the ease of use and access so you can keep getting things done with minimal distraction or interruption.,
"Now, this doesn't have to be overly complicated, but it matters to know where you will take your breaks.",
"Likewise, if you will leave your workspace for a break, make sure you give yourself the best chance to rest.",
Don't leave your space just to do household chores or work on something else.,
Your workspace is the most important part of your daily productivity because you spend some much time there.,
"If it isn't conducive to getting things done, then you won't be productive.",
Don't just copy what others do or what you're told to do or even what the experts say.,
What is your favorite part of your workspace?Learn how to maximize your day by maximizing your morning with your e-mail course!,
You come from a country where girls don't step outside the house after it's dark.,
Going to a different country all alone is absolutely out of the question.,
And spend a fraction of your time trying to live a different life in this new place.,
"A life different from that of your own, which is tied to the demands of your culture and society.",
"The money is less, but you're positive that the experience will be worth it.",
"Meet strangers from across the world, make friends, make memories.",
You have minor social anxiety and going to people and being a conversation starter isn't your forte.,
"There are so many things which worry you - safety, money, new people, a new place.",
"But deep in your heart, you trust that you truly want to experience this in life.",
I landed in Paris even though each of my friends had a scary story to tell.,
"Yes I know, we millennials are swimming in the sea of instant gratification.",
"But meeting somebody without a profile picture is absurd and calling trouble upon yourself, isn't it?",
And one green flag:My gut was so sure about meeting this stranger.,
"Regardless of not knowing what he looks like or who he is, I had to see him.",
"He was bald, build alright, and met me with a warm smile.",
We spoke for about two hours while staring at the river in front of us.,
"The locals were around us, some French teenagers listening to music and couples sitting arm in arm.",
"Here we were, with our feet hanging down as we had a long conversation with many walls of silence.",
"Here are some excerpts from what we spoke about, and I'm hopeful they will make you ponder.",
People he interviewed came from two scenarios:Their only hope is to spot land when they spend their days on a raft.,
"Now tell me, is life really so hard or do we just enjoy whining about it?Mr.",
"A and his relatives lost their home because of the usual blasts, he claimed.",
His family is doing fine and are hopeful that things will get okay.,
He brightened up when he spoke about his family because it's a blessing for all of them to be together.,
"I love and value my family, but I hardly think of how much they mean to me.",
"Without them, no amount of money I make or the career I lead holds any value.",
"It took somebody else's story of a torn home to remind me this, that's the real problem here.",
This man had his house shattered and lost a huge part of his family.,
"His circumstances made it extremely difficult for him to turn his life around, but he kept going.",
No amount of excuses that I've ever made felt worth it when I spoke to him.,
"This man has had his whole world crushed but stands smiling, optimistic about what lies ahead.",
But my conversation with him gave me lessons I still carry with me today.,
"Three young women left to spend a day at the beach, and vanished without a trace.",
Police have been baffled by the case for more than half a century.,
"Summers in Chicago tend to be very hot and muggy, and the summer of 1966 was no exception.",
"She yelled a quick goodbye to her mother, telling her that she would be back early.",
"Though it was still early, the temperature had already topped 90 degrees and would continue to climb for the next few hours.",
"Like Ann, Patty, and Renee, Mike Yankalasa and Frances Cicero also lived in Chicago.",
"Around noon, they watched as the trio got up and began to make the 100-yard walk to the water's edge.",
They assumed the girls were just going to take a quick dip in the water to cool off and then come right back.,
"Mike and Frances continued to lay out in their little spot of sand, idly watching the crowds of people sunbathing and swimming.",
"The women must not have been impressed, and the men soon gave up and went off in search of more amiable targets.",
"Their amusement quickly turned to surprise, though, as they watched the three girls climb up into the boat.",
"Once they had settled in, the boat sailed off to the west and the teenagers lost sight of it.",
"As the sun began to set, the crowd on the beach finally started to thin out.",
"Crowds of tired, sunburned people made their way to the parking lot and tried to remember where they had left their cars.",
"Obviously, the three women hadn't made it back from their boat ride yet.",
Their beach blanket and all their belongings were still in the exact spot where they had left them so many hours earlier.,
"Bud had been a park ranger for years, and he was used to dealing with situations like this.",
The women had probably decided to go on an afternoon picnic that had turned into a moonlit cruise.,
It certainly wasn't the first time someone had left something behind on the beach.,
"The holiday weekend was in full swing, and the park rangers had their hands full dealing with the crowd of people.",
"Monday was July 4th, and the rangers arrived that morning expecting another busy and crowded day at the state park.",
William had just unlocked his office when he got a phone call from a man who identified himself as Harold Blough.,
He told the park superintendent that he was trying to locate his daughter.,
She had gone to the Dunes on Saturday with two friends but had never come home.,
"It was only 8:50am, but it was clear this wasn't going to be a routine day at the park.",
"Suspecting he was dealing with something far more serious than some forgotten belongings, William called the Indiana State Police.",
Indiana State Trooper Harry Young was the first officer on the scene.,
The first thing he did was call in the license plate number of the Buick.,
"Sergeant Edward Burke, a state police detective, was the next officer to arrive at the scene.",
"Wherever the women went, they were barefoot and clad only in their bathing suits.",
"The first 48 hours of an investigation are always the most critical, but police had already lost those crucial first hours.",
Search parties began the grueling task of going over every inch of the 2180-acre park.,
It was one of the most extensive manhunts the state of Indiana had ever seen.,
"In addition to the beach and the lake, there were many wooded areas and open fields in the state park.",
"While the publicity helped to generate many tips, most involved purported sightings of the women that police were unable to confirm.",
They were lucky; the video showed three women getting onto a small white boat that had a distinctive three-hulled design.,
The boat could be seen heading to the west before it disappeared from the video.,
"After a week of intensive searching, officials were confident that the women were not anywhere in the state park.",
Every inch of the park had been searched without finding any trace of the women.,
"They were also certain that the women hadn't drowned, as their bodies would have surfaced by that point.",
"Once they had ruled out accidental drowning, police were left with two main theories about what might have happened.",
"They got to know Ann because she and Patty both boarded their horses at the Tricolor Stables in Palatine, Illinois.",
The three women had bonded over their mutual love of horses and would often ride together.,
"On the surface, their horseback riding seemed to be a wholesome pastime, but detectives soon learned it had some sinister undertones.",
"In June of 1965, an incident at Tricolor Stables illustrated just how serious the feud had become.",
"As soon as she started the engine, the car blew up.",
"There was no doubt that George had been the intended target, and he was sure that Silas had been behind the bombing.",
The incident made him so paranoid that he devised a way to start a car while standing outside the passenger side door.,
"A couple of months before the women vanished, Patty came home with an extremely bruised and swollen face.",
"When her friends asked her about it, she told them that she was having trouble with some ""horse syndicate"" people.",
"She didn't elaborate, but her friends were sure that at least one of the Jayne brothers was to blame.",
Perhaps the women realized that they were in over their heads and believed that disappearing was the safest course of action.,
"Dick Wylie was a reporter in Chicago when the women went missing, and he covered the disappearance extensively.",
Their nephew would supposedly pick up women in a small boat to shuttle them to the larger boat where abortions were performed.,
Yet the fact that the women left all their belongings on the beach makes this theory seem unlikely.,
Could this have been the catalyst that led to the women deciding they needed to escape somehow?,
"In a letter addressed to her husband, Renee wrote that she was unhappy in her marriage and was contemplating getting a divorce.",
Her husband told investigators that he didn't think they had been having any marital problems and he was confused by the letter.,
"Adults go voluntarily missing all the time, but it's extremely rare for them to never be heard from again.",
"Unless the bodies of the women are found or the killer decides to come forward, the truth may never be discovered.",
Often it is in the context of some adtech or martech business challenge.,
"One of my first questions is usually: ""Where's the data?""Today, most brands have contractual ownership of their data.",
"What sort of data?In the past, much of this data was owned by the ad agency of record.",
Other data sets might have been owned by the publisher or media owner.,
"Although, that ownership shift took the better part of a decade to achieve.",
"After I confirm that the brand owns the data, I typically say, ""Ok great!",
"Also, the ANA standard contract templates for brands and agencies include language to ensure proper data ownership.",
Control of your brand's data does not mean that you are getting a single penny of value from it.,
The data exhaust coming off of all your campaigns is one of the most valuable assets your marketing department has.,
"Is all that data goodness sitting in a virtual drawer, collecting dust?",
Marketing crumbs were thrown at it just so the CMO could claim they were innovative.,
"In other newsletters, I've discussed the critical importance of first-party customer data.",
"A full-blown, wide-scale audit is in order.",
This is a prerequisite for all data management related work in the future.,
The goal is to generate an inventory or manifest of all campaign data and related brand data.,
"Next, you need to understand what each data set contains, how it is constructed, and how the data is organized.",
"To do this, you'll need to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty.",
"For example, do you know what data your ad server collects?",
"I promise you it is more than impressions, clicks, and conversions.",
Most ad servers have a row in a log or database for each impression with about 100 attributes and metrics for each.,
Your job is to understand what metrics are currently used versus what might be valuable to explore going forward.,
"Also, you need to get a sense of how portable the data is.",
You will likely need to create what is broadly known as a data lake.,
You'll need a data architecture subject matter expert if you do not already have one.,
"Unless you are a quant or have some level of data science experience, this area will be very foreign.",
Just know that this is the central collection and processing point for all of your marketing data.,
"It is where all the raw data finds its way home to you, where it belongs.",
One of the most basic services built on top of your snazzy new data lake is a reporting service.,
This is just a sample of the more popular choices you'll find in the market.,
"Once you have your source data in hand, explorable and extractable by a basic BI tool, your mind will be unlocked.",
"If done correctly, you'll never go back to the dark days of offline reporting again.",
"If the main way you consume or experience your campaign results is via Powerpoint reports created by someone else, stop it.",
"Reports delivered to you via PPT, PDF, XLS, whiteboard, or crayon should be a thing of the past.",
"However, it is 110% worth it and will be table stakes sooner than you realize.",
"If you enjoyed this article, consider subscribing to the AdLingo weekly newsletter.",
"Despite my greatest and most fevered wants, I will never ride an airship or fight toe to toe with a dragon god.",
"We live in a world of constant social and political turmoil, one that we regularly escape from by playing video games.",
Jin Sakai and Ramza Beoulve are both men who come from means but are struck down by the circumstances surrounding them.,
"They both become peasant heroes, shadowy figures that the lowborn class can openly celebrate.",
"The Ghost is more than a man, he is a titanic hero whose deeds represent the will of the oppressed.",
Governments and laws should exist only for those they have sworn to protect.,
Platitudes have no meaning if they cannot save the most vulnerable.,
"House Beoulve is corrupt, utilizing the war for its own ends in order to manipulate a place of prestige in greater Ivalice.",
"Ramza denounces his Beoulve name, takes up his mother's maiden title, and becomes a heretic of the church.",
"Ramza only cares about uncovering the truth, protecting those he loves, and standing for moral righteousness.",
The true Ghost is an amalgamation of the many people across Tsushima Island that sought to grow his legend.,
The comrades that Sakai found across the island gathered him a retinue of proficient allies.,
"These moments of sacrifice, these losses have built upon them the importance of fighting with belief, with meaning.",
"Despite fighting hard for the causes they believe in, both Ramza and Jin are branded as traitors, as heretics.",
They are stripped of everything they once loved and pushed into the obscurity of history.,
"The Ghost and Ramza fought to make the world a better place, and at that they succeeded.",
"It's not only important to stand up for the poor, huddled masses - it's imperative.",
It's rare that we see heroes of this caliber in the gaming lexicon.,
"In his Tinder profile picture, Terry was balanced on a unicycle - with a parrot perched on his shoulder.",
Of course I swiped right; this was a guy who looked like he had an interesting story.,
"We met at Piedmont Park, where Terry had suggested we could ride bikes.",
I was standing under the shade of a large tree when I first spotted Terry.,
"Terry was coming toward me, a huge grin plastered on his face - as he pumped his legs on his unicycle.",
He had to nearly shout to make himself heard - because this wasn't a normal unicycle.,
He was perched on a cycle that was at least five feet tall.,
"I had been so distracted by his dramatic entrance that it wasn't until I heard a squawky ""Viggy!",
"As if on cue, Julius squawked, ""No shit, Sherlock!""I recoiled in surprise.",
"My movements jostled the sunglasses perched atop my head, and they fell to the ground with a clack.",
"Julius yelled, earning horrified and disapproving looks from a few nearby strangers.",
"Terry only shrugged, which made Julius ruffle his wings and readjust his feet on Terry's shoulder.",
"Or, I mean, you can walk, and I'll cycle next to you.",
"The unicycle, the parrot, the unwavering commitment to the act.",
"Without waiting for a response, he said, ""Oh, I almost forgot.",
"This was on special today because it's going bad soon, and I thought you might like some?""",
"I started yelling and batting my head, letting go of my calm demeanor completely.",
"Then, I heard a rickety metal clacking, and Terry was sprawled out on the pavement by my side.",
"Julius, stop!""Despite his grasp of inappropriate language, Julius was not a well-trained parrot.",
"Unintentionally, I had started to jog around, fanning my head to no avail.",
"Terry was still somewhere behind me, struggling to remount his unicycle.",
"I readied myself, and then I released Julius while simultaneously taking off in a sprint.",
What I had feared ended up coming true - my hair smelled like Terry's discount ham for weeks.,
"By Stephanie HarrisonYou know what to do, but you can't make yourself do it.",
Getting stuck is an inevitable part of living a New Happy life.,
"Because if there is one thing that your brain doesn't like, it's feeling scared.",
It will do whatever it takes to stop you from taking the step into the scary unknown.,
Here are the three steps that will help you to get unstuck.,
"When you are stuck, your brain is running two completely conflicting programs.",
The primitive program and the evolved program are battling it out in an arm wrestle fight for control.,
"To trick your brain, you need to shrink the task that your evolved self has set your primitive self.",
"Your lack of activity then results in no progress or changes, making you feel even more stuck.",
You have to reclaim a sense of agency by exercising control over your life in some way.,
My favorite way to do this is to make some really weird choices that shake up this mindset.,
"Through our relationships with other people, we can find the security and safety that inspires us to take big, bold risks.",
She has a MA in positive psychology from the University of Pennsylvania and was as instructor in their graduate program.,
"Step one, of course, is to tell them she wasn't in the room when it happened.",
Tell them she was upstairs in a room directly above her kitchen ceiling.,
"She tells him she was in the upstairs bathroom, which has an overhead fan that must've drowned out any outside noise.",
"Fiona almost says she was taking a shower, but she won't get away with that.",
"He'd sat in the chair by the kitchen table, gripping the armrest tight as she cut into his temple.",
Do you think you have any idea as to what his motives were?,
"Was it a typical suicide, or some sort of protest thing?""""I have no idea.",
"His job was going fine, our relationship's been going well, I thought.",
"He'd said, as her surgical knife dug deeper into his skin, ""You're lucky I'm a masochist.",
She'd been wearing rubber gloves just in case this sort of thing happened.,
"When the shock went through him, his head jerked forward, pushing the knife further in.",
"The way they keep lowering the prerequisites to be a cop, soon some of them will actually be high school students.",
"He's thin and has tired eyes, and he's a good head taller than her.",
"She sits in the chair where Adam died and, finally alone, lets herself mourn.",
"If one of them had said 'come on, man, you're really going to give me a ticket?'",
"If you drive over the speed limit, the chip records it.",
"There's little need for detectives anymore, because there's nothing you can deduce that the chip won't tell you.",
"If citizens knew just how advanced chip technology has gotten, they'd never try to lie to the police again.",
"Most likely scenario: she and her boyfriend were planning on fleeing the country, and the plan went horribly wrong.",
"Sean thinks back to Fiona, who'd been fighting back real tears and real tremors throughout their conversation.",
Sean would've dismissed her as nothing more interesting than a regular victim.,
"She should be handcuffed in the back of the car right now, not sitting in her house.",
"He knows Joey's face, his body type, and his age.",
"He's smiling in the picture, even though you're not supposed to do that for ID photos.",
"Just the sight of his face sends a nervous, excited tingle in Sean's arms, in his legs.",
As a kid it would tell them when he was sleeping and when he was pretending to be.,
It would tell them if he was really sick or if he was faking it to get out of school.,
"If he ever dared to do drugs, the chip would detect it.",
"If he ever told a lie, the chip would detect it.",
"The classmate hadn't said anything about his heart rate, though.",
"Maybe they'd find you, but odds were you'd be dead by the time they did.",
It got to the point where parents were afraid to let their kids play outside.,
"People didn't like it at first, but 'progress is never recognized as progress at the time.'",
"At first the tracking chips were voluntary, and then it became national policy to insert them into babies' heads at birth.",
Some people didn't like this - 'there's always someone who doesn't like something' -,
"In the beginning these chips had been big and clunky, about a penny long and half-a-penny wide.",
If you hold one in your hand it can easily slip between your fingers.,
"God forbid it lands in a carpet, it'll be gone forever.",
She steps on the seat and reaches all the way to the back of the top shelf to pick up the burner phone.,
The phone knows who she needs to call when she turns it on.,
Cops think it was a suicide though; they don't suspect me.,
"After the socially appropriate pause, she continues: ""Are you sure they don't suspect you, though?",
The caveat is that the host can only imitate the conditions of the body at rest.,
Either that or accept that their life here will be entirely underground.,
"After the phone call with Carrie, Fiona picks up her standard personal phone, and pauses.",
Now would be the time to notify Adam's family of what happened.,
"And of course, all the other fights they've had will come back to haunt her.",
Sean's roommate and his friends are on VR in the living room when he gets home from work.,
"He walks past them into the kitchen, grabs a six pack of beer from the fridge and heads to his room.",
"As he plugs in his phone for an insta-charge, he downs one can.",
"As he turns on the hook-up app, he starts sipping on another.",
"It feels wrong once he sends it, but there's nothing he can do about that.",
"It's the same address from the police files, just two blocks away.",
"But at the very least, he knows Joey's telling the truth about his apartment.",
"He feels comfortable giving away his address, whereas Sean would never dare give him his.",
"Before taking a shower he spends a few minutes pacing around his room in his underwear, sipping through the third can.",
He rubs his hands through his hair and mutters reassurances to himself.,
Nobody's ever caressed his face or kissed him on the forehead or rested their head on his shoulder.,
"When he sent a face pic of himself last night, Joey called him cute.",
"The sky outside is dark now, and Fiona still hasn't called anyone.",
She places the phone down on the table and rests her head in her hands.,
"Granted, he was leaving her forever, but she wasn't mad.",
"Fiona called Carrie and asked her to provide Adam safe passage out of the country, and Carrie had reluctantly agreed.",
"Sure, he wasn't technically her boyfriend at the time of his death -",
"He looks exactly like his profile pic, except smaller somehow, less intimidating.",
"Every question Sean asked him, every pic Joey sent, seems to have been honest.",
"They don't shake hands, that would be too formal for what this is.",
"Sean almost says something a couple of times, but stops himself.",
"There's no small talk he can make that won't sound fake, forced.",
"The only thing he wants to ask is what they're going to do together, what is expected of Sean.",
"He understands the basics, of course, but he wants a rundown of what exactly is going to happen.",
"Sean accidentally shoulders the elevator wall as he's walking out, but doesn't acknowledge it.",
"He follows Joey into his apartment, past a living area where two other guys are watching TV.",
Sean can make out the shape of his nipples showing through the fabric.,
"Sean takes off his own jacket, the zipper feeling unusually stiff as he pulls it down.",
The sleeves try to cling to his arms as he pulls the jacket off completely.,
"He thought making out would be intuitive, but it isn't.",
"He tries to move his lips the way people do in movies, but it feels clumsy and dry, embarrassing.",
"He's still smiling, looking at Sean with kind, knowing eyes.",
Joey kisses him back this time and after another few seconds Sean gets the hang of it.,
"He could feel Joey's tongue in his mouth, and that's fine.",
"The stubble around Joey's mouth starts to chafe his lips a little, and that's fine too.",
"This goes on for probably two or three minutes, but it feels longer.",
"This doesn't happen though, because it feels like way too bold a move.",
"Sean's comfortable here, and if Joey wants to lean him back he'll go along with it.",
"Below Joey's belly button, his penis is stiff and pressing up under his sweatpants.",
He starts thinking about what his dad would say if he could see him now.,
Not only are you a pervert; you're a pervert with a limp dick.,
"They should be taking off each other's clothes in a passionate frenzy, not quietly taking their own shirts off.",
"An erection seems impossible for him right now, and they're both painfully aware of it.",
"Sean looks away from Joey and, for the first time that night, takes a real look around the room.",
There's a desk near the corner with a bunch of books and papers on it.,
"Sean has never seen, of bands Sean isn't familiar with.",
They put their shirts and jackets back on and Joey leads him out of the apartment.,
He somehow makes it out of the building without bumping into anything.,
Somehow they picked up on Fiona's connection to Carrie and now everyone'll be going to jail.,
"We've found another surgeon - he's an actual, licensed surgeon -",
Carrie knows she won't be able to lie to her now.,
"There was a vote, and they've decided you're too big of a liability.",
There's probably a guy at the station tracking your every move in real time.,
"The fact is that it happened, and now Fiona is contaminated.",
None of Carrie's people could ever be around her again without smelling that cop odor all over her.,
"You've helped so many people get out to a better place, why wouldn't you want to follow them?",
As long as you stay here you will never have any real freedom.,
"Otherwise, throw that phone away and don't call me again.",
He doesn't know where he's going; he just goes.,
"Hopefully, Joey's shrugged the whole encounter off and doesn't take it personally.",
He tries to imagine himself having sex with any of them and can't.,
Even as they pass by each other they're all too far away.,
He ends up at a bus stop bench in a quiet part of town.,
"There are no apartments here, only tiny houses all squeezed close together.",
"Most of the lights are off, and the street itself is completely empty.",
"The only sound is the crickets, the wind, and the car engines from the main road, far away.",
Sean sits down and thinks back to what he's just been through.,
"He edits the scene in his mind, inserting little changes in places where he should've done something differently.",
In his head he doesn't mess up the first kiss and he knows exactly what to do with his hands.,
"Instead he's out in the cold a long walk from home, and he has no idea who he is.",
"Depending on the choice she makes, after all, she might not have to.",
She realizes with a sudden clarity that she's been sitting at her kitchen table for several hours now.,
The antique analog clock on the wall's been ticking the whole time and she hasn't registered the sound in hours.,
"When she stands up it feels miraculous, like she hasn't realized she could leave the chair until just now.",
"She goes to the bathroom, then when she comes out she pours herself a glass of water.",
She finishes the glass of water and looks at her reflection in the window above the sink.,
"The woman has bags under her eyes and her hair is a frazzled mess, but she still looks kind of good.",
"She's always felt older than she looked, but right now her face is a good fit.",
"She squints, looking past her own reflection, and sees a man sitting at the bus stop across the street.",
There won't be a bus coming on that route until four in the morning.,
She turns off all the lights on the main floor and walks upstairs.,
"She turns on the hallway light and her bedroom light, then walks back downstairs.",
"She creeps through the dark, quiet kitchen and leans up against the window.",
"He's just sitting there outside her house in normal civilian clothes, all alone.",
"Fiona stares at him for a long time, the analog clock ticking loudly above her.",
"Sometimes his mouth moves like he's talking to someone, but there's no one else there.",
The deaths were so spread out that it was hard for anyone to find the connection at first.,
"Those are just rumors, though, that Carrie told her about.",
"She steps outside and, hands in her jacket pockets, quietly approaches the distracted officer.",
"He recognizes her face, then he looks at her house and frowns.",
"Against her better judgement she says, ""Want to go inside?",
"She decides to take the risk: ""I don't think they were that strict.",
"He covers his eyes with a hand and breaks down completely, as Fiona tries to figure out what to do.",
"Sean stops crying eventually, and lifts her head off Fiona's shoulder, wiping his eyes.",
"And again, I swear I didn't realize this was your house.",
"My partner thought it warranted investigation, but I told him to let it go.",
"He could re-open it if he wants to, but he probably won't.""",
"Do you think there's a chance that might happen?""Fiona shook her head, grimacing.",
"After all, if it's not a suicide, what's the most likely other outcome?",
"And for his family, there's no greater shame than that.",
A nice little stain on their records as parents for all the world to see.,
"Some cars drive by, and somebody's cat walks across the other sidewalk, but there are still no pedestrians.",
"The lights in the other houses start going out, one at a time.",
"People give him respect when he walks past them, and in a crisis they always assume he knows what he's doing.",
When he's in a uniform he doesn't look or feel like a lost child.,
"And besides, he might want to see Joey again, once he figures out exactly how he feels about him.",
They watch as a young woman jogs down the sidewalk across the street.,
"She could've been attacked or kidnapped or killed, and the perpetrator probably would've gotten away with it.",
But this woman jogs down the sidewalk and turns a corner without any trouble.,
Jimmy seems to always have balloons around his apartment to use during the demonstration of his backwards balloon theory.,
It's our third date and my third time seeing this show.,
"The thing is, I might even like what he's saying and maybe even agree with him.",
If only he didn't talk over me when I tried to interject.,
I toss a Frito into my mouth and pop open another Heineken as I settle in and feign fascination by his stellar observations.,
But never so open that you lose yourself and allow your strengths to seep out.,
We were familied by friction: every night I kneaded her dreams into a shape she could swallow.,
She fetched me the hem of her nightshirt and gnawed it to ribbons.,
"I know I love him, she told me once, because I would entirely eat him.",
"Sunny left that summer to follow the boyfriend to Taipei, where he was going to meet with a duck-blood supplier.",
My mother drove her to the airport and made her promise that she wouldn't get pregnant.,
"Above us, the ceiling fan stuttered, dicing the flies alive.",
"This is the wrong lighting, Sunny said, I'll show you again in the morning.",
"In the morning, in front of the bathroom sink, I watched Sunny drain her breasts.",
"And Sunny said she didn't know what they stocked in there, only that it was cheap.",
"Yeah, I said to Sunny, I wouldn't mind if that happened again.",
"She batted her breasts, swinging them like bells, their shadows curtaining our shared window.",
"With a silver safety pin, she pierced the bottom of her left breast and tweaked it like a lemon.",
"Some kind of yolk rivered out, pooling in the sink, rinsed down like beads.",
I asked Sunny how it was possible for her implants to migrate - isn't that what birds did during winter?,
"The heat originated from inside you, and there was no way to shy from your own skin.",
"Over there, she said, your blood lives closer to the surface of your body.",
"I asked what happened to her boyfriend, and why didn't he go out and buy some blood for her.",
"Sunny sheathed her breasts in her tank top and sighed and said, he stayed there.",
"We laughed, and her breasts buoyed up to the neckline of her shirt.",
"Gross, I said, it's like they're growing wings.",
"Sunny pressed them to her chest with her palms and said, that's the problem with new body parts.",
Sunny told me that our mothers' hometown was the last place on the entire island to get electricity.,
"Sunny propped her breasts in her palms and said, I guess if we ever lose electricity again we could burn these!",
"In that town, Sunny said, everyone is Indigenous and shares their profits equally.",
"The way we should, Sunny said, if we were still a tribe.",
"We would share land, too, she said, and we wouldn't have to pay rent.",
"I asked Sunny, and she said, south where the fat-ass geese go!",
"I used to sew those kinds of dresses at the factory and let me tell you,",
"A plastic rape whistle, a soda can tab, a quarter-machine ring, a tampon wrapper.",
Sunny was the one who stole the TV set from an ex-boyfriend who used to punch her breasts.,
"Actually, Sunny said, my breasts look the same as they did then.",
"I told him he should punch my stomach, because then at least maybe I'd throw up and lose some weight.",
"She stood up in front of the TV screen, flicking the light off her bare thighs.",
I said I had a chin like a red turtle-cake.,
"This is not what I imagined a flood would look like, I said sideways to Sunny.",
"I don't know, I said, I thought the water would be clean.",
"Sunny laughed and said this was a typhoon, not some biblical watercolor.",
It glides onto you nice and then slips off your skin and wears it for you.,
"Because there was no more birdwatching in the city, I spied on Sunny's bruise-blurred breasts instead.",
"I asked Sunny if it was possible to co-own a disaster, to divvy up the destruction.",
"I said, remember when you told me that all profits are shared among the people?",
"Sunny kneed the TV until the screen shivered, the image graining into sugar.",
"I'll go get the vacuum, she said, even though we didn't have one.",
"I don't know about what you asked, she said while walking away from me.",
"That night, Sunny kicked me awake, punting me off the mattress.",
"I woke face-down on the carpet, spitting the hair that was flossing my teeth.",
"You're eating your braid again, she said, stop it.",
"Sunny was standing by the window, opening the pane that was silvered with bird-poop stains.",
"In the gravy-thick moonlight, Sunny stripped off her tank top.",
"Her breasts swung out, feathered with hair that looked white in this light.",
"Stop, I said, someone will see you, but I was the only one in the room.",
"Where do they go, I'd asked Sunny, and she said I shouldn't be worried about the damn birds.",
"They had the sky to house them, and nothing could ever flood that high.",
"You're right, I said, and didn't ask anymore.",
"She reached beneath each breast, fondling for a seam, and unclasped herself like a coin purse.",
"Opened from the bottom, her breasts let out light, flashing their gems of fat.",
Sunny turned to me and said today was the day her mother died.,
"They hummed inside me like eggs, she told me, and I was afraid I was going to break them too bad.",
"I listened with all my blood, asking where they were going and if they could carry us.",
"After removing a shirt from its hanger, you shake off the dust and hold it up to the light.",
"The weather at your destination is mild, and this long sleeve shirt would be perfect--in theory.",
"But if you're not going to wear it now, when did you plan on wearing it?Never.",
Your decision not to pack it is a referendum on that shirt.,
"On paper, it's a perfect, casual, long-sleeve shirt.",
"In practice, there are more than five-or ten-long-sleeve shirts you'd pack in its place.",
"When that one shirt doesn't make it into your luggage, then that's all the answers you need.",
And that's why the best time to declutter is right before taking a trip.,
"Therefore, anything I pack has to be well-thought-out.",
"I end up packing a sort of capsule wardrobe - essential, functional, and each piece matches with the others.",
"In other words, when packing for a trip, I figure out what doesn't work for me.",
"Here are some examples:To be clear, I don't purge a huge pile of items every time.",
"That's great if you do, but don't get discouraged if you don't.",
"I think of this as ""marinating"" your minimalism-otherwise known as ""taking it slow.",
That's why I pack another item or two to make a decision while I'm on my vacation.,
A trip works as a great trial period for something you're not sure about.,
"Up until the last few years, I rarely decluttered because of decision fatigue.",
"Again, I only pack one or maybe two items I'm unsure about.",
"Usually, when packing, we grab the stuff we use every day.",
"Instead, we should give thought to items that haven't seen the light of day-at least not recently.",
"After all, stuff sits at the back of the closet because it's at the back of our minds.",
You can develop the habit of decluttering if you connect it to other routines.,
"Öner was waiting for me at the back table near the kitchen, his cane next to him.",
"He was born in Ordu, the port city on the Black Sea coast of Turkey.",
"He stayed in Ankara for 25 years, studied economy and finance and worked at the General Directorate of Highways in Ankara.",
"However, after a while his mother started treating Öner's wife badly.",
"He described her behavior as ""​tatsız​,"" without flavor or tasteless.",
He recalls that they arrived in London with 300 pounds and that it was a difficult journey with their 10-month old son.,
They arrived as tourists and sought solace in their family members who lived here.,
"Although he was a college graduate, he needed to work at very low-paying jobs and worked illegally in the beginning.",
He told me that it was extremely jarring - the fear of getting caught was a daily worry.,
Iznik used to be a greasy spoon that Öner tells me people would not walk past by - they would cross the street.,
"The place was on sale by an Italian man that he describes as ""sticky, unreliable, fraudulent and slippery like soap.",
He started out by serving British fare but the people living around the neighborhood pushed him to serve Turkish food.,
"They call the restaurant Iznik because ""it is a very important location both for our culture and Christian culture.",
"His dream became a reality when Şevket Sabancı, his wife Hayırlı Sabancı and his friends came for a meal one day.",
"He served them mantı, which was a brave choice because the family is from the mantı​ capital of Turkey, Kayseri.",
"While after his stroke, business has been a little slow, he is confident that things will start to pick up again.",
"When I ask him if it was all worth it, I notice tears streaming down his face again.",
"No matter how much time passes, the longing he has for Turkey stings the same.",
"After a long deliberation on whether we should do it or not, we thought: YOLO - you only live once!",
The queuing etiquette is a means of showing respect to the group and is drilled into every schoolchild from an early age.,
"As it happens, some retailers hire 'faux queuers' to pose as dedicated customers so they attract more crowds.",
I now wonder if it has loaded subtext and is a way to stereotype you.,
Another two examples of these nuance questions are: Where are you from?,
"If there happen to be a few of them clinging to a tree outside your apartment, the noise can be almost deafening.",
Sometimes a cultural shock is an observation or curious musing about something notable in another culture!,
My first cultural shock was on my first day in the office when I noticed that Japanese people sleep at work!,
"They mostly make it obvious: after lunch time, they set a 30 minute alarm and take a little power nap.",
"Before visiting a café, please make sure that they take the welfare and the rights of the felines seriously.",
"But when individual pieces of fruit are given personalised attention, they are accompanied with a very high price tag.",
"These fruits are considered status symbols, normally gifted to others or even displayed as decoration.",
"Particularly sakura, known as cherry blossom, which only blooms for a couple of weeks during April.",
Every single brand releases a special cherry-blossom version of its product.,
"Japan is full to the brim of secret sights and surprises, and this list is by no means exhaustive.",
