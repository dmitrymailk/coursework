I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.,future_simple
Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!,can
I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me.,future_simple
It's a true story every bit of this is true.,future_simple
"The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy.",other
And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville.,other
And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you:,other
"Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said they laughed.",past_simple
White House we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm,past_simple
"I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home.",past_simple
"I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling.",past_simple
"I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway.",other
Soon after Tipper and I left the (Mock sob),past_simple
we have 50 miles east of Nashville.,present_simple
"I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me.",other
There was no motorcade back there.,other
This was a rented Ford Taurus.,to_be_past
"It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat.",other
"We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.",past_simple
"We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant.",past_simple
"We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper.",past_simple
"She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying.",other
"And she said ""Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.""",other
"And the man said, ""He's come down a long way, hasn't he?",other
"And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington?",other
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.,other
"But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America.",other
"It was printed in Monterey, I checked.",to_be_past
Most of these expenditures are also profitable.,to_be_present
"And the story began, ""Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday,"" quote: '",other
"My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'"" ""'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'",other
""" Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, ""One more burger with fries!""",other
We have to change the minds of the American people.,other
"Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, ""Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!",other
""" We like to celebrate each other's successes in life.",present_simple
I was going to talk about information ecology.,other
"But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time.",other
Chris Anderson: It's a deal!,other
Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis?,other
"I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five.",other
I update the slide show every time I give it.,present_simple

Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees.,other
"Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment I'm kidding.",other
"But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do.",other
But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these.,past_simple
"First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual.",other
Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit.,other
it's not a cost; it's a profit.,to_be_present
It's not negative; it's positive.,to_be_present
These are investments that pay for themselves.,other
But they are also very effective in deflecting our path.,to_be_present
"Cars and trucks I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective.",other
And so we should address that.,other
But it's part of the puzzle.,to_be_present
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks.,to_be_present
Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference.,other
"And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here there are a lot of people directly involved in this this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it.",other
Carbon Capture and Sequestration that's what CCS stands for is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe.,other

There is a carbon calculator.,to_be_present

"It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet, the number one cause of death in children under five.",other
It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires acute respiratory infections caused by this.,other
I find this shocking and somewhat appalling.,present_simple
Can't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels?,other
Can't we make better stoves?,other
How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year?,other
"I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes, so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes, which is charcoal.",other
So this is a picture of rural Haiti.,to_be_present
Haiti is now 98 percent deforested.,to_be_present
You'll see scenes like this all over the island.,future_simple
It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation.,present_simple
A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil.,other
So the rains come they go down the rivers and the flooding happens.,present_simple
"Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it.",other
It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage.,to_be_present
"They know perfectly well, but they have no other choice.",present_simple
"Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared.",other
And so this is what they do.,other
"You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it.",other
"So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels.",other
"About four years ago, I took a team of students down to Haiti",past_simple
and we worked with Peace Corps,other
This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked.,other
And the idea was that you could take waste paper; you could compress it and make briquettes that could be used for fuel.,other
But this device was very slow.,to_be_past
"So our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple the throughput of this device.",other
We went down to Haiti.,past_simple
So you could imagine they were very excited about it.,could
And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them.,other
And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn.,other
So it was a little discouraging to the students.,to_be_past
"And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see it says, ""US Peace Corps.",other
""" As it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village.",other
"And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away.",other
And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel.,other
What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level.,other
You see these all over Haiti as well.,present_simple
"And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called ""bagasse.",other
""" It has no other use.",other
"It has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals.",other
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it.,present_simple
"What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with, something like charcoal.",other
"So over the next couple of years, students and I worked to develop a process.",past_simple
"So you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.",other
"After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln, and then you end up with this carbonized material here.",other
"However, you can't burn this.",can
It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking.,other
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes.,other
"And conveniently, one of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called ""kokonte,"" which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root.",other
"And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of ""manioc.""",other
"In fact, it's grown all over the world yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava, it's all the same thing a very starchy root vegetable.",other
"And you can make a very thick, sticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes.",can
"These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute.",other
So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT.,to_be_present
And these are the briquettes that we made.,to_be_present
Now I'm going to take you to a different continent.,other
This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India.,to_be_present
"And more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel.",other
"Kids and women are especially affected by it, because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires.",other
So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there.,other
"Well, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us.",past_simple
What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass.,past_simple
And there was wheat straw,other
and there was rice straw in this area.,other
"And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel.",other
"And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung.",other
And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel.,other
"And in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly.",present_simple
"And so we were very happy, thus far.",to_be_past
"But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long.",other
I am ten years old.,to_be_present
