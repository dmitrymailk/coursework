"Thus, many of us who cut our sleep short on a regular basis, consistently do not get the full benefits of REM sleep, including boosted creativity, better emotional regulation, and stress relief.",medium,present_simple
"Alcohol clearly kills my deep sleep, leading to more light sleep instead.",medium,present_simple
