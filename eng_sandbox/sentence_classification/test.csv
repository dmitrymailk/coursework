Some of the fondest memories I have of her are from this time.,news
We would sit together on the sofa and watch her favorite television show - Jeopardy! - even if she wasn't exactly sure who I was.,news
"I did well in high school and chose to attend a prestigious (and expensive) private university, far away from home.",news
"Although the amount of debt I would have after graduating was apparent up front, I did not fully understand it.",news

"I set out to earn more than one degree, which cost me more money.",news

"Here's a passage which gave me life after Trump was elected: Conservatism, by its nature, is racism.",news
"It's racism only because conservatism simply means to conserve, to preserve the status quo.",news
"And the status quo with respect to minorities, is: Stay in your place!",news
You will always be on the low end of the pole economically and politically.,news
"And that is why it is so difficult for Afro Americans to accept the conservatives, no matter who they happen to be, whether they are in the Republican party or the Democratic party.",news
"It's that isn't white, Anglo Saxon, Protestant male.",news
"Because that group wants to preserve what it has illegally gained and wishes to continue - in politics, and in economics.",news
"And it will use the political institution to keep their gains, even though they weren't gained honestly or legally.",news
Conservatism will prevent my children and my grandchildren from fulfilling their destiny as Americans.,news
"My children and my grandchildren, as well as I am, as well my father and my grandfather and my were citizens and are citizens, and conservatism wants to keep us as citizens.",news
"I will spend all of my energies fighting that type of thought, and I urge all minorities - not just Afro Americans, but all minorities - to resist this.",news
"Listening to my father fighting Reaganism, 30 years ago next week, is both depressing and freeing as I think about fighting Trumpism.",news
I feel depressed that the same issues he fought remain so present some three decades later - issues that won't be solved in my lifetime.,news
But I also feel less alone in knowing that I am connected to him - and to my ancestors and nieces and nephews - in an intergenerational struggle for a better America.,news
"Even if the fight doesn't end with me, I hope to ease the path for those who follow, or at least give the comfort that my father's words lend me today.",news
"Trump and his ilk will try to say stay in your place to all of us who aren't conservative white men accommodationist white liberals will do so, as well.",news

"Three flatmates of a gay Syrian refugee beheaded in a homophobic attack in Turkey last week fear they face a similar fate, after receiving death threats in the days since his murder.",news
"Wisam Sankari, a hospital cleaner, went missing on 25 July after going to meet another gay man in Istanbul.",news
"His body was found two days later in a nearby area of Istanbul, his head severed and his battered body only identifiable to his friends by his clothing.",news
"A week on, three of his flatmates say they fear being murdered in the same fashion after receiving warnings that the man Sankari met on 25 July wants to kill them too.",news
A Greek appeals board said in June that it considers Turkey safe enough for gay Syrians to be deported to as part of the controversial migration deal.,news
"But Sankari's friends say his experiences show how dangerous the country is for gay refugees, and unstable for refugees in general.",news
"They alleged that in the months before his death, Sankari had: Do you call this safe?",news
"We want everyone in Europe to understand our situation here for Syrians, especially gays.",news
"This was the third brutal attack Sankari had experienced, the flatmate continued.",news
"Five months ago, he was attacked and his head was cut, he said.",news
"He went to the police, but they didn't help him.",news
Another time he was put in a car and he had to throw himself from it to survive.,news
"Sankari's murder was one of at least 20 homophobic attacks on Syrian refugees in the past six months, according to an activist who is documenting such incidents.",news
"And with the political situation in the country, it's not getting better.",news
"More generally, Sankari's friends said many of his other experiences showed how vulnerable life is for refugees of any sexuality in Turkey.",news
"His latest employers paid him about half the Turkish minimum wage (600 Turkish lira, or £150) for a hospital cleaning job that saw him work seven days a week.",news
"If he complained, he risked being fired during previous employment as a waiter at a cafe, he was sacked for asking for time off to recover from illness.",news
"We're working as animals, said one of Sankari's friends, a literature graduate who was a teacher in Syria but now works as a waiter in Turkey.",news
The Turks want us to work and work and work - without money or rights.,news
Sankari's battles with Turkish bureaucracy also highlight the basic logistical challenges Syrians face on a daily basis in Turkey.,news
"Sankari struggled to access support from aid groups and officials in Istanbul because he had first registered with the Turkish government in Hatay, a city near the country's southern borders.",news
"To apply for resettlement in the west, or to secure even basic support from NGOs, Sankari needed to return to Hatay.",news
"But he was scared to do so because of threats he had faced while briefly living there, said Hossam, who had met Sankari at his weekly session.",news
"He was desperately seeking help but he couldn't reach anyone, said Hossam.",news
And those people couldn't reach places where they felt safe and secure.,news
A senior government official said: We are unable to independently verify the claim that the victim's plea for assistance was ignored by law enforcement.,news
"Obviously, this barbaric attack doesn't reflect the way Syrian refugees are treated in Turkey, which is the largest host of refugees in the world.",news
We are investigating this incident and will take all necessary steps to bring perpetrators to justice.,news
"In a statement, the UN refugee agency said it was working to resettle LGBTI refugees currently living in Turkey, and expressed sadness about Sankari's death.",news
A spokesperson added: We are very sorry and we would like to express our shock and sadness at this appalling crime.,news
We are looking forward to seeing that investigation of the case by the officials concluded asap and perpetrators are brought to justice.,news

"Baldwin Street, located on the north face of Signal Hill in Dunedin, New Zealand, is booming.",news
"Since being listed in the Guinness Book of Records for its exhausting 1:3 gradient, it has enjoyed local interest.",news
"But now Dunedin is a stopping point for international cruise ships, the street has become the top tourist destination in New Zealand's oldest city.",news
"In the busy season between October and February, hundreds of tourists visit the street each day, starting at 6am and often continuing until dark - which in the summer can be 11pm.",news
"It has also become a hot spot for daredevil sports enthusiasts who trike, bike and slide down the slope in anything with wheels.",news
"In response, a host of entrepreneurial residents have opened gift shops and food outlets - with more permanent infrastructure such as public toilets potentially on the horizon.",news
"Beverley McClay has lived on the street for nine years, and delights in the growing popularity of her home.",news
"From her porch, she often watches strangers open her gate, potter around her garden, and occasionally - and most unwelcomely - relieve themselves in her Corokia hedge.",news
"I think a lot of tourists don't know this is a real street, that people actually live here, she laughs.",news
"I often come out in my dressing grown to meet people, and the tourists like to watch me stacking wood, they ask me what I am doing.",news
"McClay, who lives alone, says the street's fame has stopped her from becoming lonely as the years go by.",news
"It makes me feel like I am part of a community here, there's always someone just outside my door.",news
"In the past year Baldwin Street has also become a destination in an unusual social media trend to snap pictures at odd angles, which create the optical illusion of the houses being severely lopsided.",news
"The trend has significantly increased visitor numbers - especially during the winter season when tourists usually avoided the area because of frost, ice and occasional snow.",news
"However, to McClay's disappointment, people are now tending to drive to the top of the street instead of walking, and preferring to use selfie sticks rather than asking residents to take their picture.",news
"On Friday, the street was crammed with an estimated 15, 000 people for the annual Jaffa race, in which 75, 000 chocolate balls were rolled down the hill.",news
"It's my busiest day of the year, said Bezar, who has become particularly fond of the visiting ship's captains, whose drinks she always serves first.",news
"I know it's just a street, but most of the residents here are so friendly, it's also become a really good way to have a chat to a Kiwi.",news

"There is no evidence that Hal Martin intended to betray his country, said Martin's attorneys Jim Wyda and Deborah Boardman in a statement, according to the Washington Post.",news
What we do know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country.,news
He served honorably in the United States Navy as a lieutenant and he has devoted his entire career to protecting his country.,news
They said the charges against Martin were mere allegations and they had not yet seen prosecutors' evidence.,news
The justice department confirmed that Martin worked for the same company as Snowden when he exposed details of NSA mass surveillance methods three years ago.,news
"According to the New York Times, Martin is suspected of taking the source code developed by the agency to break into computer systems of adversaries like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.",news

"Helmets, rifles, Murray Bennett, who lives next door to Martin, said.",news
A woman who came to the door of Martin's home said: This is a matter that's under investigation.,news
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave from the front of my house,news
Neighbors describe Martin and the woman he lives with - no one could say whether they were married - as nice decent and peaceful .,news
"During execution of the warrants, investigators found documents and digital information stored on various devices and removable digital media.",news
"In addition, investigators located property of the US government with an aggregate value in excess of $1, 000, which Martin allegedly stole, a justice department press statement said.",news
Martin is said to have had six classified documents obtained from sensitive intelligence and produced by a government agency in 2014.,news
"These documents were produced through sensitive government sources, methods and capabilities, which are critical to a wide variety of national security issues.",news
"The disclosure of the documents would reveal those sensitive sources, methods and capabilities, the justice department said.",news
"If convicted, Martin faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials and 10 years in prison for theft of government property.",news
An initial appearance was held for Martin in US district court in Baltimore on 29 August and he is still detained.,news
"The arrest is a major embarrassment for the NSA and its contractor Booz Allen coming just three years after Snowden, who worked for both.",news
"Highly classified information would no longer be concentrated in one place, making it harder for potential hackers.",news
"The new breach provides fresh arguments for privacy activists who argue that the NSA cannot be trusted to protect all the personal data it gathers, from bank accounts to health records.",news
Supporters of Snowden quickly made a distinction between him and the motives of the arrested man.,news
"They reiterated that Snowden is a whistleblower who leaked top secret material out of principle, believing the NSA was acting unconstitutionally by engaging in mass surveillance.",news
"Snowden, who had worked for the CIA and the NSA, handed over material to journalists at the Guardian in 2013 when he was employed by Booz Allen as contractor to the NSA.",news
"As a computer specialist based in Hawaii, he was engaged in a number of operations, including targeting China.",news

The issues are further amplified because the Trump Organization is a privately held corporation and the has flouted longstanding tradition in not releasing his tax returns.,news
The result is that there is no clear way to know what assets and liabilities Trump has.,news

"We told team managers on Thursday that if you lose rounds of racing, your results from previous races could determine your placement in finals or .",news
They are on notice that every race matters because if we lose two or three days' racing it could be the case.,news

And speaking to a lot of rowers in the boat park there's a lot of discontent.,news
"We've put 10 years plus into this and to have it decided on a little bit of lottery, and what waves hit a boat at a particular time, is a little bit disappointing.",news
Every race had its dramas that went beyond seeing who would cross the line first.,news
"At one point, the American sculler Genevra Stone nearly sunk like, well, a stone.",news
While the Egyptian sculler Nadia Negm reckoned the conditions were the worst in which she had rowed.,news
"At one point, just past 1, 000m, there were these huge waves and a full one came right into my boat and",news
"I was 100% sure I was going to sink, and then another wave came up and I just stopped and froze.",news

When would a new Trump emerge - a candidate able to appeal to more than the angry base who propelled him to primary victory over much more seasoned politicians?,news
"In the Republican establishment, the wait for the pivot began after Trump forced his remaining opponents out of the race, in Indiana four months ago.",news
"Once he had been formally nominated, the thinking went, maybe then the pivot would come.",news
"On Monday, the first presidential debate against Hillary Clinton takes place, at Hofstra University in New York.",news

"After doing without teleprompters for much of the primary, he turned to reading from scripts written by advisers brought in to save a sinking campaign.",news
"He also embarked on an outreach effort aimed at some minority communities, suddenly incorporating into his stump speech lines about the plight of African American voters.",news
"But Trump's platform, his slate of signature policies, chief among them his line on immigration, has remained exactly the same.",news

"Behind a podium, on primetime TV, appearance and style, not policy, often dictate who wins and who loses.",news
"On immigration, Sharry said, Trump hinted for weeks at a softening - and secured commensurate media coverage.",news
Then he delivered a speech in Phoenix that doubled down on his radical proposals such as deporting the roughly 11 million undocumented migrants who live in America today.,news

"A similar tactic was employed regarding Trump's proposal to ban all Muslim immigration, which was widely criticized even among Republican elected officials.",news

"Republican lawmakers were overwhelmingly responsible for the abortion restrictions under fire, and in each of these states, the party still controls at least one house of the legislature, if not also the governor's seat.",news

The law would have forced four out of five Alabama abortion clinics to close.,news

"There's been regular television debates, often with anything up to ten or 12 participants, and regular opinion polls dominating the front pages.",news

Matt believes there are different outcomes that can realistically happen once the votes have been counted.,news
"The Pirate Party might get a shot at governing, people might stick with whom they know and ignore the recent scandals, or another party altogether might have a late surge of support.",news
I don't see how they could all work in government or in coalition.,news

"Today, of course, the main focus of those denouncing Obama's proposal is Syrian refugees.",news

"When I had my first baby, the support I received from my nurse was indispensable in helping me initiate and continue breastfeeding.",news
"It may not be obvious, but putting newborns to the breast within the first hour of life can make the difference between life and death.",news
Delaying the start of breastfeeding beyond one hour after birth can raise a newborns risk of dying by 80% compared to those who are breastfed immediately.,news
Newborns now account for nearly half of all deaths of children under five.,news
Early breastfeeding plays a critical part in reducing newborn mortality and keeping babies healthy.,news
New research from Unicef shows that more than half of all newborns are not breastfed within one hour of birth.,news
"That means that 77 million newborns - over 50% of babies born each year are losing out on the benefits of early initiation, exposing them to a higher risk of disease and death.",news
"This is happening because women are not getting the support they need around the time of birth, even when a doctor, nurse or midwife is assisting their delivery.",news
"Globally, more than three quarters of all mothers give birth with the help of a skilled birth attendant.",news
"When babies are given alternatives to breastmilk, they breastfeed less often, making it harder for mothers to start and continue breastfeeding.",news
"Traditional practices also interfere with getting an early start to breastfeeding, depriving newborns of the essential nutrients, antibodies and contact with their mother that protect them from disease and death.",news
"In India, some women are taught to discard colostrum - the breast milk a mother produces right after birth.",news
"In Nigeria, some newborns are given water or tea in lieu of breast milk, putting them at risk of diarrhea and malnutrition.",news
"Countries in other parts of the world are inundated with formula marketing, which has led to plummeting breastfeeding rates.",news
"Placing newborns on their mother's bare chest - known as contact - immediately after birth helps reduce mortality by regulating a baby's heart rate, temperature and breathing, while also facilitating breastfeeding.",news
"Not only that, exposure to the bacteria on the mother's breast helps to colonize a newborn's digestive system with essential antibodies.",news
Immediate contact promotes bonding between newborn and mother and ensures that babies receive the nurturing they need from the very first moments they enter the world.,news
"This amounts to a 13% reduction in the deaths of children under five and also supports healthy brain development, increased IQ scores and better school performance for all children.",news
Breastfeeding is a powerful intervention - it's backed by research and doesn't require preparation or expensive new medications.,news
"Breastfeeding has incredible developmental benefits, and, in areas that lack access to clean environment and clean water to mix with formula powder, saves babies from diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia.",news
"But to serve millions of mothers and children better, one simple and important thing we can do now is support early initiation of breastfeeding.",news
"Providing new mothers with guidance on initiating breastfeeding, not supplying any liquids or foods other than breastmilk and ensuring that staff are appropriately trained are all simple adjustments that can help a woman breastfeed successfully.",news
"Given what research has taught us about the importance of early initiation, we have countless reasons to do everything possible to increase rates globally - especially when solutions come at little to no extra cost.",news
"There's nothing illegal about these tips, but some may find them unsporting.",news
Increasing the level of your trainer is crucial to get access to both higher level Pokémon and the tools to catch them.,news
"Above level 20 you gain access to Ultra balls, which make life a lot easier when trying to keep hold of the rarer beasts.",news
"Levelling up can be a bit of a slow grind, but Pidgey stacking can boost your trainer by at least one level.",news
"Low powered Pidgey are plentiful in most places and require only 12 candies to evolve into Pidgeotto, an act that normally gives you 500XP.",news
"With a lucky egg active, which doubles your XP for 30 minutes that becomes 1, 000XP per evolution.",news
"At lower levels that's enough to jump at least one, possibly two levels.",news
"After you're done with all the Pidgey, just trade in the resulting Pidgeotto to start collecting candies to do it again.",news
"You can use any Pokémon that can evolve, of course, but Pidgey is the most candy efficient given its abundance.",news
But what you might not know is that two Pokémon of the same type and level are also not equal.,news
"These individual values (IVs) cannot be directly interrogated, but using some calculations based on the health and power of a particular Pokémon for its given level, you can infer them.",news
By doing so you can work out which Pokémon are worth spending time improving using stardust and evolution candy and which are not.,news
"There are several ways to use IVs, with the simplest being to compare Pokémon of a same type and similar level to see which has the higher CP and HP values.",news
"But for those that want to take it further, an IV calculator is required.",news
"The best is arguably that created by Reddit Pokémon Go community, the Silph Road, which has been conducting research into various attributes of Pokémon Go.",news
"The IV rater allows you to quickly estimate how good your Pokémon can be, and whether it is worth hanging on to, simply by moving some sliders.",news
"One of the more powerful and easier to get Pokémon in the game are the evolved forms of Eevee, but unlike most other beasts in the game, Eevee has three different evolved forms in Pokémon Go.",news

"He has squandered his pick and his convention, and several battleground states along with them.",news
"He picked several fights he could not win, and showed no sign of learning from his own failure.",news
It would be tempting to say this was just another week in the bizarre life of the Republican presidential nominee.,news
"This week was a decisive turning point in the 2016 election, and there have been remarkably few of them in an campaign that is supposedly volatile.",news
"In fact, the volatility and unpredictability of this election doesn't come from polls or votes, but from the character of a single man: Donald J Trump.",news
The real surprise of 2016 is how constant this contest has been.,news
Trump led the primary polls from the beginning and never lost his lead.,news
He only surprised the chattering classes by defying their certainty that he would lose.,news
"That certainty was founded on nothing related to polling data, but rather their sheer disgust and disbelief with Trump's politics.",news
"Having defied expectations once, Trump is now supposed to be able to defy polling gravity forever more.",news
"That would be a strange conclusion to draw from the primaries, but here we are.",news
"Echoing the Trump campaign, the Fox News anchor Greta van Susteren distilled this position on Thursday, as she quizzed the Karl Rove.",news
"I see the rallies and they're big, and I see the poll numbers, and he's slipping in the polls, she said.",news
Rove - the man who challenged the Fox News election desk as it called the 2012 election for Obama - was incredulous.,news
"But I would remind you in the closing days in the 1984 presidential campaign, Walter Mondale was drawing large and enthusiastic rallies as he went on to narrowly win one state.",news
"To put it delicately, this is a difficult moment in the education of Donald Trump.",news
"For a candidate who leads every stump speech bragging about his poll numbers, there is less and less material every day.",news
"Ergo the polls - just like the media, Clinton and democracy itself - must be crooked.",news
"It would be nice to call this a logical fallacy, but those are two words that should never be placed within physical proximity of Donald J Trump.",news
"I see some great polls, he told a rally in Virginia on Tuesday.",news
"I see one from the Los Angeles Times, just came out, where we're ahead by four or five points.",news
That was the day after he told voters there was an even bigger problem with this confounding election.,news
"I'm afraid the election's going to be rigged, he told voters in Ohio.",news
Those who live in the world are having an easier time understanding Trump's challenges.,news
The simpler explanation is that he is losing because of his own performance and personality.,news
"As the saying goes, campaigns are like fish: they rot from the head down.",news
This one stinks already and it's only the start of August.,news
"If Mr Trump is up 10 or 15 points on election day and he ends up losing, then, you know, maybe he can raise some questions, Obama ventured.",news
"In any campaign cycle, there are periods when the dynamic turns decisively in one direction.",news
"While the dynamic can shift more than once, as the cycle runs its course there are fewer and fewer opportunities to do so.",news
"George HW Bush engineered one of those shifts after his 1988 convention, turning a deficit into an lead, backed up by devastating TV ads.",news

How does the past week of 2016 compare to those moments in recent presidential history?,news
"Trump miserably misjudged his dispute with the gold star parents of a fallen American soldier, Humayun Khan, who was Muslim.",news
He drove a wedge between himself and the few Republican leaders who publicly tolerated his nomination.,news
"And he seriously undermined his own brand of patriotic nationalism, as well as his party's reputation for strength on national security.",news
The lasting impact of Trump's disastrous week came from its echoes of the Democratic convention.,news
Each round of dispute with the Khan family only served to reinforce the criticism that he had sacrificed nothing.,news
Each response underscored Hillary Clinton's attack on his temperament and qualifications to serve as .,news
"In the middle of his own circular firing squad, Trump decided to shoot at the one unifying Republican who has politely ignored his insanity: House speaker Paul Ryan.",news
Trump's support for Ryan's primary opponent was - like the construction of so many hideous Trump Towers - wholly unnecessary.,news
Ryan's response was to send out a fundraising email assuming Trump had already blown this election.,news
"Of course, these aren't the closing weeks of the 2016 campaign.",news
Trump could yet turn around his national polling deficit of up to 14 points.,news
He could flip the polls in Florida (down four) Michigan (down nine),news
Pennsylvania (down 13) and New Hampshire (down 15).,news
"He could turn Georgia and Utah back into reliably Republican states again, instead of being states.",news
But Trump only has one shot left to do that: the TV debates that start in another seven weeks.,news

It's assumed it is related to multiple concussions that happened years before.,news

Many in BMX have shared their concerns over the effects of the concussions most riders have sustained at some point in their career.,news
Hazrati shared her findings on Mirra's brain with additional US and Canadian neuropathologists.,news
"It validates what we have been thinking about brain injuries in boxers and football players, Hazrati said.",news

Mirra's wife Lauren was told of Mirra's CTE in March.,news
She told ESPN how she noticed his personality change in the last year of his life.,news

Brown was a Tesla enthusiast with a need for speed according to reports by the Associated Press.,news
"He had previously posted a video to YouTube of the vehicle avoiding an accident while in autopilot mode, which Musk retweeted.",news
"In a blog post on Thursday about the incident, Tesla said: Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.",news
It also pointed out that autopilot is still in a public beta phase.,news
But other companies have chosen more conservative descriptions for their assisted cruise control.,news
Volvo calls its current features tech or park assist pilot which analysts say are more accurate descriptors than the autopilot term Tesla uses.,news
"Mercedes calls its package driver assistance and drive pilot Toyota has a safety sense feature, and Honda calls it sensing .",news
"Before the updated autopilot was released, he said that the car was almost able to go between San Francisco and Seattle without touching the controls at all .",news
"In April, he distracted fans and reporters from the news of a recall of 2, 700 Model X SUVs with a joking tweet comparing autopilot to the video game Mario Kart.",news
"Talulah Riley, Musk's wife, shared and deleted an Instagram video of herself driving on the highway between Los Angeles and San Diego without holding the wheel.",news
Many of Tesla's current owners are tech enthusiasts who are eager to try out the most vehicles.,news
"And when Musk products are presented as the forefront of the autonomous revolution the perception of some of those drivers is, I'm already there.",news

Say it can do 99% but not 100% - then people are not ready for the 1%.,news
"Smith warned against reading too much into this single instance or blaming Tesla, pointing out that there is already carnage on American roads which kills 100 people every day.",news
"We don't know how many of those could have been prevented if those vehicles had automatic braking, or a Tesla Autopilot system.",news
However Brauer said it was time for Musk to shift his messaging to clearly acknowledge the limitations of the cars.,news
Honda and Toyota have been really clear about that from day one .,news
Brauer said Musk's colorful remarks about the technology often present an exaggerated and dangerous image of the vehicles' capabilities.,news
"The term autopilot draws a dangerous link to flying, said Mary Missy Cummings, a Duke University robotics professor and former military pilot.",news
"I get to fly a fighter jet, because I'm highly trained, she said.",news
This accident really highlights the fact that people do not understand the capabilities and limitations of these vehicles.,news
"For now, the crash makes it clear that Tesla should shut off its autopilot feature for certain driving on freeways, said Cummings.",news
"Some experts, however, said the reality is that humans often fail to follow safety recommendations and tend to do a poor job at perceiving risk.",news
"This could be anyone of us, said Don MacKenzie, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Washington.",news
"Ragunathan Rajkumar, professor at the engineering department of of Carnegie Mellon university, agreed.",news
"The question is whether the humans read, understand, and follow what is said on the screen, which I think most people tend to ignore pretty quickly, he said.",news
The other issue is that we humans tend to be overconfident with something based on limited experience.,news

It is the clearest sign yet that CEO Jack Dorsey is pushing to provide clarity to shareholders and employees over the company's future as quickly as possible.,news

"It is not certain the process will result in a sale, the sources cautioned.",news
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.,news
"With Salesforce, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence.",news
Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter.,news

"If it sounds a lot like The Matrix, that's because it is.",news
"According to this week's New Yorker profile of Y Combinator venture capitalist Sam Altman, there are two tech billionaires secretly engaging scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation.",news
"And what evidence is there that we are, in fact, living in The Matrix?",news
"One popular argument for the simulation hypothesis, outside of acid trips, came from Oxford University's Nick Bostrom in 2003 (although the idea dates back as far as the philosopher René Descartes).",news
Bostrom suggested that members of an advanced posthuman civilization with vast computing power might choose to run simulations of their ancestors in the universe.,news
"This argument is extrapolated from observing current trends in technology, including the rise of virtual reality and efforts to map the human brain.",news
"Soon there will be nothing technical standing in the way to making machines that have their own consciousness, said Rich Terrile, a scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",news
"At the same time, videogames are becoming more and more sophisticated and in the future we'll be able to have simulations of conscious entities inside them.",news
Forty years ago we had Pong - two rectangles and a dot.,news
"Now 40 years later, we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it's getting better every year.",news
"And soon we'll have virtual reality, we'll have augmented reality, said Musk.",news
"If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality.",news
"If there are many more simulated minds than organic ones, then the chances of us being among the real minds starts to look more and more unlikely.",news
"As Terrile puts it: If in the future there are more digital people living in simulated environments than there are today, then what is to say we are not part of that already?",news
Reasons to believe that the universe is a simulation include the fact that it behaves mathematically and is broken up into pieces (subatomic particles) like a pixelated video game.,news
"Even things that we think of as continuous - time, energy, space, volume - all have a finite limit to their size.",news
"If that's the case, then our universe is both computable and finite.",news
"Quite frankly, if we are not living in a simulation, it is an extraordinarily unlikely circumstance, he added.",news
"I would say no, said Max Tegmark, a professor of physics at MIT.",news
"In order to make the argument in the first place, we need to know what the fundamental laws of physics are where the simulations are being made.",news
And if we are in a simulation then we have no clue what the laws of physics are.,news
"What I teach at MIT would be the simulated laws of physics, he said.",news
"I don't see that there's really an argument for it, she said.",news
It's also a lot of hubris to think we would be what ended up being simulated.,news
Terrile believes that recognizing that we are probably living in a simulation is as as Copernicus realizing that the Earth was not the center of the universe.,news
"It was such a profound idea that it wasn't even thought of as an assumption, he said.",news
"Before Copernicus, scientists had tried to explain the peculiar behaviour of the planets' motion with complex mathematical models.",news
"When they dropped the assumption, everything else became much simpler to understand.",news
"The simulation hypothesis also accounts for peculiarities in quantum mechanics, particularly the measurement problem, whereby things only become defined when they are observed.",news
Scientists have bent over backwards to eliminate the idea that we need a conscious observer.,news
"Maybe the real solution is you do need a conscious entity like a conscious player of a video game, he said.",news
We have a lot of problems in physics and we can't blame our failure to solve them on simulation.,news
"On one hand, neuroscientists and artificial intelligence researchers can check whether it's possible to simulate the human mind.",news
"So far, machines have proven to be good at playing chess and Go and putting captions on images.",news
"On the other hand, scientists can look for hallmarks of simulation.",news
Suppose someone is simulating our universe - it would be very tempting to cut corners in ways that makes the simulation cheaper to run.,news
"You could look for evidence of that in an experiment, said Tegmark.",news
"First, it provides a scientific basis for some kind of afterlife or larger domain of reality above our world.",news
"You don't need a miracle, faith or anything special to believe it.",news
"It comes naturally out of the laws of physics, he said.",news
"Second, it means we will soon have the same ability to create our own simulations.",news
We will have the power of mind and matter to be able to create whatever we want and occupy those worlds.,news

More than 90% of voters have said that the economy is extremely important to them.,news
The Guardian asked three economists to weigh in on what we can expect from a Trump or Clinton White House.,news
Here is what they had to say: Normal presidential candidates put forth proposals that usually have been vetted by policy experts.,news
They also generally have track records from their time as elected officials.,news
The combination of these factors allows external observers to make predictions on what policies might get adopted if they get elected and to then speculate on how those policies might affect the economy.,news

"He promises a big tax cut, but it's probably not very serious since he has no concomitant plan to restrain the growth of government spending.",news
"He threatens to impose steep tariffs, which would risk triggering a trade war, but he claims protectionism would merely be a stick to extort concessions from trading partners.",news
He makes noises about potentially defaulting on debt but then pivots and says the debt can be financed by printing money.,news
"It's not clear which would be the frying pan and which would be the fire, but either approach causes angst among most economists.",news

The Tax Policy Center has analyzed the plans of all three remaining presidential candidates and concluded that the Sanders tax plan would raise the average tax rate on the top 1% to 55.,news
"The net effect of Trump's program will be to cause considerable economic disruption but little if any net gain in employment or output, even while raising the risk of a major economic crisis.",news
Trump proposes to lower taxes and to reduce business regulation and foreign competition for American businesses and jobs.,news
"While high tariffs on Chinese or Mexican imports would shift some production to domestic suppliers, the effect will be muted because footloose suppliers will move to other sources not facing the tariffs.",news
"Any gains from reduced imports will also be offset by losses among American export industries, such as high technology, entertainment and business services.",news
"Similarly, if undocumented workers are repatriated, it would open some jobs but the net effect will be small and may not even be positive.",news
"Many positions vacated by repatriated immigrants will stay vacant for lack of willing workers, and any gains must be balanced when businesses fail because they have lost immigrant labor.",news
"The Trump fiscal policy will have some stimulative effect increased economic activity will come from increased spending building walls, and on immigration and customs enforcement and the military.",news
And reductions in employment will be particularly hard on workers because Trump plans further cuts in the social safety net.,news
"While he is pledged to maintain social security retirement and Medicare benefits, he has proposed putting time limits and further restrictions on other programs, including unemployment insurance and supplemental nutrition (food stamps).",news
"Should the economy face a major recession, cutbacks in these social insurance programs will further compound the economic downturn.",news

"More subsidies for higher education, but not an entitlement for everyone.",news
"And some restrictions on trade, but no sweeping reversal of the consensus that has existed since the second world war.",news
"And, needless to say, she won't support the types of entitlement reforms that have attracted support in the House and Senate.",news
"Then again, she says she will have her husband serve as some sort of economic czar.",news
"And given Bill Clinton's record, that implies a more centrist approach and an ability to strike big deals with congressional Republicans.",news
"It's just a guess, but incremental leftism almost certainly will characterize a Clinton presidency, which presumably means a continuation of the current weak economic expansion.",news
Though everything written about Clinton is speculative because we don't know whether she will have sufficient coattails to help congressional Democrats regain control of the House and Senate.,news
"Clinton has proposed to continue the economic policies of the Obama Administration including its support for free trade and a for undocumented immigrants, as well as advocating Obama proposal for an increase in the minimum wage",news
"Were these to be enacted, it would raise wages for as many as 40 million workers and narrow somewhat the gap between rich and poor.",news
"Perhaps the most significant Clinton proposals are in the regulation of financial markets, a major source of the economic crisis of 2007 to 2009.",news
Clinton favors strong enforcement of and would go further in regulating banks and financial markets to reduce the use of risky financial vehicles.,news
Increased regulation and taxation of risky activities by banks and other financial institutions might also help the economy by reducing the risk of a major financial meltdown.,news

"Of course, there will be more of us around by then too, so that total demand will only slow, rather than level out.",news
A heady whiff of technological optimism accompanies the explanation that this will happen because of unprecedented efficiencies created by new technologies and more stringent energy policies .,news

"Modern jazz is about shiny, digitally driven markets, the slightly less enthusiastic Unfinished symphony is about emerging greener models for growth, while Hard rock is a future of both low and grubby growth.",news
"The problem with these and many other scenarios that emerge in the mainstream, is the intellectual editing that occurs before they even begin.",news
"Most share two overwhelming, linked characteristics that strictly limit any subsequent room for manoeuvre.",news
"Firstly the demand for energy itself is seen as something innate, unchallengeable and unmanageable.",news
"Secondly, the assumption remains that the principles and practices of the economic model that has dominated for the last 30 years will remain for at least the next 30 years.",news

"They were poor again here in Ljubljana and fortunate, in the extreme, that Southgate did not have to reflect on England's first defeat in a qualifying fixture for seven years.",news
They rarely passed the ball with any authority and there was absolutely no sense of a group of players desperately trying to impress a new manager.,news
Southgate admitted his team had been lucky and it is not easy finding any compelling evidence to advance the case for him getting the job .,news
"The performance was a reminder that removing Wayne Rooney from the starting lineup will not automatically fix this team and,",news
That will continue to be the soundtrack for as long as England continue to put in these kinds of dishevelled displays.,news
Jesse Lingard and Theo Walcott did little to disprove the theory they were fortunate to be in the team.,news
Daniel Sturridge threatened only sporadically and England's three shots on target is their lowest in a competitive fixture since playing Costa Rica in the last World Cup.,news
Southgate talked about inheriting a mess and the performance left the impression little had changed.,news
At least Rooney can still consider himself a favourite of England's followers.,news
"Three days after the Wembley crowd subjected him to minor boos, the first appreciative cry of Rooney reverberated round Slovenia's stadium within the opening 90 seconds.",news
"If the hardcore fans want Southgate to take charge permanently, this was not an occasion when it became evident.",news
"That, however, was far from the only time England found themselves in trouble because of their own carelessness.",news
"Gary Cahill, in particular, had a difficult game and could have been sent off for a challenge on Josep Ilicic late on, leading to a confrontation between Lingard and Aljaz Srtuna.",news
Lingard was defending Marcus Rashford but Southgate was unimpressed and said his player needed to learn some more .,news

"Twice at the start of the second half, Slovenia had corners from the right and on both occasions",news
"The second save, in particular, from Kurtic's header was the kind of moment to reignite the debate about why Hart is spending the season on loan at Torino.",news
He should never have been exposed so often and Southgate explained that when he brought on Rooney as a replacement for Sturridge the decision was based on the need for some experience in there to calm things down .,news

"The reality is that over 50% of Republicans, according to a recent Fox News poll, want a different nominee than Donald Trump.",news
An insurgent group of convention delegates are even trying to oust the billionaire real estate mogul as nominee.,news
"The last Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, refuses to support Trump.",news
"The past two Republican presidents, George W Bush and George HW Bush, will not be coming to the convention and don't seem to have any interest in endorsing The Donald.",news
"The sitting Republican governor of the state the convention is going to be held in, John Kasich of Ohio, has not endorsed Trump either - and he seems in no hurry to do so.",news
Politico asked 50 Republican politicians whether they would be interested in speaking at the convention and only a few told the news outlet they would.,news
Many said they weren't even going to go to the convention.,news
The Wall Street Journal recently reported that it could barely find anyone in Congress willing to speak favorably of the presumptive Republican nominee.,news
"Less than two weeks before the Republican convention, the party's congressional wing is no more enthusiastic about Donald Trump for president than when he clinched the nomination two months ago, the story began.",news
"Then there is the conservative intellectual establishment, among which Trump is largely reviled (though in some case he is merely despised).",news
"The dean of conservative columnists, George Will, even changed his party registration over Trump's nomination.",news
"For Trump's part, it's not even clear he wants to unify the party.",news
"When Trump came to Capitol Hill last week to meet with Senate Republicans, he called Illinois senator Mark Kirk, who rescinded his endorsement of Trump, a loser.",news
"In a testy conservation with Senator Jeff Flake, who has yet to rally behind him, Trump threatened to help defeat the Arizona lawmaker in his bid.",news
Trump was more explicit about his view on the importance of unity during a campaign rally in North Carolina last week.,news
"To be honest, I think I win without unity, he said.",news
Probably I do better without the support I'm talking about because that's why I'm here in the first place.,news
One of Trump's most famous surrogates doesn't seem particularly interested in helping unite the party either.,news
"Indeed, a poll released last Wednesday had Trump winning just 70% of the Republican vote in a race against Hillary Clinton.",news
A Raba Research poll released this week was even worse with Trump garnering just 66% of Republicans.,news
"In both polls, Trump was trailing Clinton by either 11 or 12 percentage points, though in fairness to Trump, the RealClearPolitics polling average has Clinton up closer to 4%.",news
Maybe the party will unite as the race moves toward November out of sheer tribalism or fear of Hillary Clinton's supreme court picks.,news
So Priebus should forget about the Republican party uniting at the convention.,news
"In response, a group has said it will send representatives to protect Trump supporters from the protesters.",news
"That's a toxic recipe for something, but whatever it is, it sure isn't unity.",news
"Men who act as the primary breadwinners in their marriages are more likely to face psychological and health hurdles, according to a new study that looks at a potential adverse impact of traditional gender roles.",news
"The study, released on Friday by University of Connecticut sociologists, found that as men take on a greater share of economic responsibility in their marriage, they reported greater strains on their wellbeing and health.",news
"In years where men in question were their family's sole breadwinner, their psychological and health outcomes were at their worst.",news
"Men are expected to be breadwinners, yet providing for one's family with little or no help has negative repercussions, said lead author Christin Munsch, professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut.",news
"A lot of what we know about how gender plays out in marriage focuses on the ways in which women are disadvantaged, she said.",news
Our study contributes to a growing body of research that demonstrates the ways in which gendered expectations are harmful for men too.,news
But the study also looked at women and found a contrasting psychological outcome.,news
"For women, taking on a greater financial responsibility in their marriages had positive effects on happiness and wellbeing.",news
"Breadwinning women may feel a sense of pride, without worrying what others will say if they can't or don't maintain it.",news
"After all, they have accomplished something rare for their gender, the study says, about women who are their family's primary breadwinner.",news
"Should they fail to maintain this status, however, they have less to lose than men in the same position, based on social expectations.",news
"For decades, the number of US households with men as the primary breadwinner has steadily decreased.",news
"Experts attribute this to a number of factors, including changing gender roles in heterosexual marriages, as well as increasing numbers of women in the workforce.",news
"According to Pew figures, 46% of households both work up from 31% in 1970.",news
"Survey respondents were asked how much time they spent during the last month being nervous, calm and peaceful, downhearted and blue, happy, and so down in the dumps that nothing can cheer you up .",news
Their happiness level was ranked from one to five based on their response.,news
"Philip Victor, a journalist living in Atlanta, said he does feel pressure as the sole breadwinner in his family.",news
"He has a young child and wife of four years who is currently studying for her nursing exam, and said both he and his wife look forward to a time when economic responsibility is shared.",news
But I would say that sense of pressure comes from being the primary income earner and not simply because I'm a man.,news
"Matt Mehrhoff, 31, a school teacher in Lincoln, Nebraska, described experience on both sides of the breadwinning equation in his marriage of four years.",news
"He said that he and his wife have at various points taken on more or less economic burden, including when he was in graduate school, or after the recent birth of their son.",news
"I'm not sure if it has to do with my gender, but after getting a better paying job and having a newborn, I definitely feel more pressure, he said.",news
"The researchers acknowledged the significant limitations of its findings, particularly as they apply to couples.",news
The NLSY covers people between the ages of 18 and 32 who are in heterosexual marriages.,news
"Consequently, we cannot presume that the reported relationships will hold in older populations, gay and lesbian populations, or cohabiting populations, the study said.",news
The findings run counter to some previous studies about men and women in heterosexual marriages.,news
"One study by Olin Business School at Washington University in 2013 found that in relationships where women earned more than men, the latter experienced higher rates of sexual and psychological problems.",news
The study acknowledges that the anxiety that individuals have in marriages based on their economic dependence or independence might be affected by their prior views about traditional gender roles.,news
"It may be the case that breadwinning provokes anxiety among men who desire more equitable arrangements, but has little effect among men who desire more traditional arrangements, the study said.",news
"Similarly, economic dependency may elicit anxiety among women who prefer egalitarian marriages, but not among women who prefer more traditional arrangements.",news

"Dael Devenport, an NPS archaeologist based in Anchorage, takes regular helicopter trips to survey the coast of the park.",news
"There are groups of abandoned houses claimed by the sea and wind, containing items such as lamps, stone tools and ulus - a type of half knife used to skin seals and caribou.",news
The Inupiat people who live in the region have retreated from this part of the coast.,news
"A lot of these sites haven't been surveyed properly, we are trying to figure out which are most vulnerable and mitigate against that, Devenport said.",news
"You can see houses that are washing away, if you walk along the coast you see the profile of houses.",news
Most people haven't thought about how climate change affects archeological sites.,news
"A site is a snapshot in time, it's not like we can pick it up and move it somewhere else.",news
"A recent survey found almost all of a former settlement of the Thule culture, ancestors of today's Inuit, had been disturbed and stripped of items such as harpoon tips and figurines carved from walrus ivory.",news
"As permafrost melts and walls are washed away, more treasures are revealed to opportunists.",news
It's probably done by people from local communities who know where the sites are.,news
"They can sell items onto dealers, who can get about $50, 000 for a figurine from a buyer in Japan.",news
"When that artifact has been pulled out from the ground and not documented, we lose all of that information.",news

"It's hard to predict exactly what will happen but some systems have been pushed over the threshold, certainly, said Schuurman.",news
We need to recognize that climate change is ongoing and we can only expect the impacts will get stronger time goes on.,news
"I tell park managers that whether they are thinking about climate change every day or not, it is likely to find you and tap you on the shoulder.",news
A pressing question for the NPS is how these changes will go down with the public.,news
"Last year was a record, with 305 million visitors to national parks.",news
"But Sally Jewell, secretary of the interior, recently warned that a lack of funding to deal with the existential threat of climate change, along with unchecked development, will lead to ruin.",news
Jewell said that current trends mean that the next century will mean national parks and wildlife refuges will be like postage stamps of nature on a map.,news
Isolated islands of conservation with facilities that crowds of Americans visit like zoos to catch a glimpse of our nation's remaining wildlife and undeveloped patches of land.,news
Some national parks are already looking at how to respond to this potentially diminished future.,news

"Visitation could actually jump by nearly 25% in 2060 as it warms, according to one forecast.",news
The summer months may become too hot for visitors to parks in the southwest.,news
"Either way, it will be hard to hide that a trip to the Rocky Mountains in Montana to see Glacier national park won't involve seeing any actual glaciers.",news
"Yes, that will be a visible and dramatic change, said Schuurman.",news
"Without being blasé in any way, people are adaptable and Glacier national park without its glaciers will still be a stunningly beautiful place.",news
"That said, I think anyone would look back and be sad about the loss.",news
"Temperature rise, Temperatures across US national parks have risen by about 2.",news
The number of glaciers at Glacier national park has halved since 1968.,news

The plan was in collaboration with the Korea International Cooperation Agency (Koica) and supported by a $1.,news
"Before the end of this year, the final transport master plan (TMP) is due to be presented to Ghana's ministry of transport for implementation.",news
"Nearby Lagos, the economic capital of Nigeria, is notorious for being one of the most gridlocked cities in the world.",news
"But its population is around five times Accra's, and its economy greater than the whole of Ghana - so",news
"With a small population, Ghana should be able to manage traffic much better, Amoasi says.",news
The planners should sit down and realise they're not doing this for themselves they're doing it for the nation.,news
"Bernard Abeiku Arthur, a senior urban specialist with Cities Alliance, says it is this kind of regulatory neglect that has led to today's unabating traffic troubles and dysfunctional transport system in Accra.",news
"We knew we were getting urbanised, but we ignored all the necessary ingredients and elements for planning our urban space properly.",news
"Arthur says the new TMP is very fanciful on paper, but also too limiting geographically - excluding regions beyond Greater Accra from which much of the traffic originates.",news
"So if you're doing your calculation and you cut out the fringes, you might not be doing a very good calculation.",news
"Francis Akakpo, programme officer at Koica in Ghana, says the planners were unable to conduct research on areas beyond the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area because of limited time and resources .",news
"Ghana's first mass transit bus system, Omnibus Services Authority, was established in 1927 during the British colonial period.",news
"After independence, public transportation remained largely until the late 1980s and early 90s, when the government divested itself of assets amid financial mismanagement.",news
"This was when the privately run buses appeared to fill the gap: the tro tro, a significant contributor to congestion, has been the most common mode of mass transportation ever since.",news
"In September, however, the Greater Accra Passenger Transport Executive launched a pilot run of a new Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) system, unleashing city buses across several major routes throughout Greater Accra.",news
"These buses will only be released on a gradual, incremental basis, to make room for adoption and acceptance",news
"But according to Abeiku from Cities Alliance, even a successful implementation of the public bus system will only provide minimal relief to congestion.",news
"For sustainable improvements, he says, planners must commit to focusing on rail, tram and subway developments so commuters like Stella Ampofo aren't forced to upend their daily lives just to get to work.",news
"We have to envision what kind of city we want Accra to be, Abeiku says.",news

Every new hairstyle has been combed as a cipher for a change in the national mood every dress evaluated for the values it embodies.,news
There is no denying that this feels retrograde for a woman of Obama's intellect and background.,news
"There is a rhythm to this kind of coverage, with every fashion feature on her wardrobe triggering an opinion piece raging at this unbefitting treatment of a lawyer with degrees from Harvard and Princeton.",news
"Yet, contrary to what many expected, Obama herself has played the role in a notably traditional key.",news
"In contrast to her predecessor Hillary Clinton's battles over public healthcare, she has adopted relatively uncontroversial causes:",news
"While these causes are, perhaps, more culturally loaded than they first appear - the campaign against childhood obesity has a more progressive slant",news
Obama has followed in the first lady tradition by putting fashion centre stage of her public persona.,news
"On the night of her husband's election to office in 2008, she wore a Narciso Rodriguez dress in a fiery speckle pattern.",news
The fashion press reported the pattern as dégradé while others went with lava lamp .,news
To wear a very dress at such a moment made it clear that Obama had no intention of allowing the White House to cramp her style.,news
"She had broken an unspoken rule of modern culture, which holds that a serious person must have a sober wardrobe.",news
"Until Obama, the iconography of the first lady revolved around Jackie Kennedy.",news
"Half a century later, wives of heads of state all over the world are still measured against Kennedy, but the comparison is sharpest in the White House.",news
"Where her predecessors had tiptoed around the edges of Kennedy style, as if anxious to avoid the comparison, Obama has embraced many elements of the look and made them her own.",news
"The sleeveless shift dresses she favours are a direct link, as are the outsize strings of pearls, often framed by necklines.",news
"Even elements of the two women's hair and makeup are similar, despite their physical difference: note the full, stiffly curled hair and the penchant for false eyelashes.",news
"The Kennedys represent an American ideal that is classy and democratic, and Obama has used fashion to ally herself and her husband with that same message.",news
The visual connection with the Kennedys draws the eye to the obvious difference: their skin colour.,news

"You don't go to Buckingham Palace in a sweater, sniffed the designer Oscar de la Renta - but he was already out of touch.",news
Without wearing a single outfit that could be considered truly Obama has rewritten the playbook.,news
"Since then, the trend for the sleeveless dress as grownup but fun, dressy but comfortable - fuelled, in huge part, by Obama herself - has grown and grown.",news
She made it OK for a woman to wear a dress showcasing arms that speak of serious as well as,news

Australia celebrated their first archery medal in 12 years by defeating China for the bronze.,news
"All three Olympic debutants, Kim, Ku and Lee, showed no sign of rookie nerves as they trampled over Netherlands and Australia before saving their best for the gold .",news
"Cheered by a rowdy Korean contingent in the terraces, the trio threw down the gauntlet in the opening set, hitting the innermost gold circle six times in succession to score the maximum 60 points.",news
"More than a statement, the opening salvo was a winding blow for the more seasoned US team of Olympian Brady Ellison, Jake Kaminski and Zach Garrett.",news
They shot well in response but could manage only 57 points for the set and from there the pattern of the match was fixed.,news
"The Ku took the perfect score of 10 points with all six of his arrows, and missed only once.",news

The team sealed South Korea's 20th archery gold medal from 37 Olympic titles contested since the sport returned in its modern format in 1972.,news
"With its professional teams and punishing training regimes, the depth of Korean archery is unmatched and the nation will be disappointed if it fails to sweep all four titles at Rio.",news

"And maybe, just maybe, you felt one candidate was a very clear winner by the end of it all.",news
The only question you should now be asking yourself is how many other people in the country agreed with me?,news
I have one poll (and a whole bunch of caveats) for you.,news
The poll suggests that the debate was a huge success for Hillary Clinton.,news
The caveats suggest Democrats don't have a reason to celebrate yet.,news
The poll was jointly conducted by media channel CNN and research company ORC late last night.,news
The interviewers called up people they had already identified who said they planned on watching the debate.,news
"Regardless of which candidate you happen to support, who do you think did the best job in the debate - Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?",news
"At 62% it was a clear win for Clinton, while just 27% said Trump (6% said both equally and",news
The other polling questions seemed to confirm a clear victory: Who seemed to be the stronger leader?,news
"The poll was conducted among 521 people - even though those people were all registered voters, that's still not very many views you're collecting.",news
There's another thing too - the entire poll was skewed towards Clinton to start off with.,news
"Of the people spoke to, 41% identified themselves as Democrats and 26% identified as Republican (the rest said they were Independents).",news
"So you would have expected Clinton to do better, regardless of how she performed during the debate.",news
"If you're feeling particularly skeptical, you should pay attention to the margin of error on a poll.",news
"When you take into account the fact that there were a lot of Democrats in this survey, that lead suddenly looks a lot less impressive.",news
"What actually does offer some promise of predicting voter behavior is taking a big bunch of surveys, each reputable, each with a slightly different methodology, and averaging them out.",news
"So, to really understand who won the debate, we'll need to wait a little while because most surveys take about a week to be conducted, analyzed and then published.",news
"Viewers not only need to think Clinton did really well in last night's debate, but they need to be willing to change their voting intention if the former secretary of state wants to win in November.",news

I view this as a public health crisis and one that we should act on.,news

"They can't help themselves from playing games, even when lives are on the line, Clinton said.",news
I call on all Republicans to put people before politics and finally vote on a clean funding bill to fight Zika right here in Florida.,news
"South Florida, dubbed as ground zero for Zika in the US, remains the hardest hit by the outbreak.",news
"In addition to the state having confirmed 577 cases of people who contracted the virus while traveling overseas, concerns are now rising over local transmissions.",news

"Murphy on Tuesday attacked Rubio as ineffective in delivering Zika funding to Florida, telling reporters his opponent was playing politics with women's health.",news
"His comments followed a new ad buy in Florida by Naral America, one of the nation's largest abortion rights groups, which targets Rubio for opposing abortion even if a woman is infected by Zika.",news
But not everyone is as willing to trade barbs over a public health crisis.,news
"The person that hasn't delivered a Zika funding bill is Mitch McConnell, he added.",news

"In a tweet earlier on Thursday, Conway drew attention to what she described as a deluge of social media private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state .",news
"In a second tweet she added that previous secretaries of state such as Henry Kissinger and George Shultz flew around the world less, counseled POTUS close to home more.",news
"Trump's decision over the state department is widely considered to be a heated battle between Romney supporters and those, like Huckabee and Gingrich, who favor the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.",news
A third group is said to be pressing for the search for an alternative to continue.,news
"In comments on Wednesday, Huckabee warned that appointments of disloyal Republicans could prove to be a distraction to Trump.",news
"It's not about that I don't care for Mitt personally, but I'm still very unhappy that Mitt did everything he could to derail Donald Trump, Huckabee told Fox News.",news
"He attacked him on a personal level about his character, integrity, his honor.",news
"At the Republican convention in July, Romney attempted to induce voters to cast their primary ballot for whichever Republican could beat Trump.",news
"In March, he called Trump a phony and dissed Trump's business acumen.",news
"A business genius he is not, Romney said, adding that Trump's promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University .",news
Trump countered that Romney was a failed candidate who would have dropped to his knees for his endorsement.,news
"Gingrich, meanwhile, offered that the only way Romney could be considered for an administration post would be if he publicly repudiated every criticism he had made of Trump.",news
The former House speaker said Romney was the most vicious and most explicit opponent all through the campaign on the Republican side .,news
"After Trump met with Romney last weekend, Trump's transition team described the meeting as an extremely positive and productive conversation .",news
"Any day now, monarch butterflies will begin their epic migration from Canada to Mexico.",news
The phenomenon has entranced Oscar López Rivera since his childhood days in rural Puerto Rico.,news
The length of their journey and what they do to survive: how can an insect so small go so far?,news
That's an achingly powerful question when you consider who is posing it.,news
"For the past 35 years, López Rivera has been unable to fly, his wings clipped.",news
"He has been held in federal institutions, for 12 of those years totally alone inside a concrete box from which he had no view of the sky.",news
"The last time he saw a live butterfly, let alone a monarch, was in 1981.",news
"López Rivera is one of the US's, and the world's, political prisoners.",news
"Aged 73, he has spent more than half his life behind bars.",news
"He is convicted of killing no one, of hurting no one.",news
His crime was seditious conspiracy - plotting against the US state in the furtherance of Puerto Rican independence.,news
He still believes in what he calls that noble cause : full sovereignty for his Caribbean birthplace that is classified as a US territory .,news
Two decades ago he and his fellow Puerto Rican independence fighters renounced violence and embraced peaceful political reform.,news
The last year in which the militant group to which he belonged committed a violent act was 1983.,news
"Yet there he still sits in his prison cell, reading and painting, the last of his kind locked up, so venerable that other prisoners call him El Viejo - the Old One.",news
"It is as though he is stuck in a trapped for ever in the headstrong 1970s, a septuagenarian forced to dress up in floral shirt, flares and platform shoes dancing to Chic.",news
"The world, and López Rivera with it, has moved on, but the US government continues to see him through the prism of a bygone age.",news
"Unless someone intervenes to release him, he will remain in captivity until 26 June 2023, five months after his 80th birthday.",news
"Fortunately for López Rivera, there is such a person who holds the power of clemency: Barack Obama.",news
"As the US president prepares to quit the White House, he is drawing up his final pardon list, presenting the prisoner with a slender hope.",news
"Archbishop Desmond Tutu the governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro García Padilla the Hispanic caucus of the US Congress former US president",news
"Jimmy Carter Democratic presidential Bernie Sanders and the creator of the smash Broadway musical Hamilton, Miranda, who confronted Obama about López Rivera face to face during a recent White House visit.",news
"With friends like that, isn't López Rivera a for release?",news
"Not according to the man himself, who remains cautious about his chances.",news
"I do not practise wishful thinking, he begins in perfect English, delivered with a strong Puerto Rican accent.",news
"The way he has been treated, the obstacles he has faced in the White House, makes him a little skittish about decisions.",news
What a carefully weighted remark about something as visceral as his freedom.,news
"In the course of a phone conversation (the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, having refused to allow the Guardian to visit him in person) it becomes clear that this is not artifice:",news
López Rivera says he draws some optimism from Obama's frequent expressions of admiration for Nelson Mandela.,news
"He embraced Mandela as a great man, he saw that what Mandela did was important throughout the world.",news
"To invite comparison with Mandela may seem for a man who in the US is relatively little known, but back home López Rivera is often cast as the Mandela of Puerto Rico .",news
Mandela served 27 years in South African prisons for leading an liberation struggle that deployed selective violence as a political tool,news
"López Rivera has already served eight years longer, arguably for doing the same thing.",news
López Rivera was born in 1943 in San Sebastián in the of Puerto Rico.,news
His childhood was spent living in the constitutional limbo that has defined the island since it was ceded to the US by Spain in 1898.,news
"Neither a sovereign country, nor the 51st state of the union, Puerto Rico is caught betwixt and between.",news
"Its people are US citizens, hold US passports, and can be drafted into the US military as López Rivera would soon discover.",news
"Yet when it comes to voting for the US president or a representative in the US Congress, a Puerto Rican is persona non grata.",news
"Quite rich, you might think, coming from a nation such as the US, which was founded upon the principle of no taxation without representation.",news
"The only thing we are good for is to be cannon fodder, López Rivera says in a rare display of chagrin.",news
"Not that he had a clue about any of that when he was growing up in San Sebastián and Chicago, where his family moved when he was 14.",news
He was just an ordinary kid for whom the concepts of or shrugging off the Yankee yoke were as alien as nuclear physics.,news
I arrived thinking we were bringing freedom to Vietnamese people but as soon as I hit the ground I realised that wasn't happening.,news
"We did sweeping operations lasting 30 days, getting villagers out of their homes, moving them off the rice paddies, them.",news
"By the time he returned to Chicago a year later, sporting a Bronze Star for meritorious achievement, he says he had undergone a transformation.",news
"I felt an obligation to change, to look at life from a totally different perspective.",news
He threw himself into community work among the Puerto Ricans of Chicago.,news
"As the name suggested, the FALN believed armed force was justified as a means to an end.",news
Targets were chosen for being symbols of Yankee imperialism such as oil companies with offshore rigs in Puerto Rican waters.,news
"López Rivera insists that the focus was always on bricks and mortar, not people.",news
We called it 'armed propaganda' - using targets to draw attention to our struggle.,news
"That may have been the case, but the results were, to put it politely, inconsistent.",news
"In 1975 the group claimed responsibility for a bombing at the historic Fraunces Tavern in Lower Manhattan, the scene of George Washington's farewell to troops after the American revolution.",news
Two years later an employee at the Mobil building in New York was killed by another FALN device.,news
"But when I asked him if he ever committed acts of armed force such as planting a bomb, he replied: I cannot comment on that.",news
But he is also adamant that the decision to renounce force was real and permanent.,news
"We realised other tactics to armed force could be more effective, mobilising people through peaceful campaigning.",news
"Morally, also, we came to see that we had to lead by example, that if we are advocating for a better world then there are things you cannot do.",news
"When I ask him if he would pose a threat to the public were Obama to set him free, he replies:",news
"At trial, prosecutors presented no evidence that tied him to any deaths or injuries, or even specific attacks.",news
"For his part, he and his comrades refused to recognise the judicial process, calling himself a prisoner of war, offering no defence and declining even to attend the trial.",news
He told me: How can a Puerto Rican be seditious towards the US state when we never had any part in electing a US government?,news
"By contrast, as his lawyer Jan Susler has pointed out, the average federal sentence for murder in 1981 was 10. 3 years.",news
"Later, his sentence was extended to 70 years when, he insists, he was framed by agents provocateurs planted in his cell who cooked up a plot to escape and then implicated him in it.",news
"In a less disciplined individual, such harsh treatment would inevitably spawn bitterness and despair.",news
"Yes, he has faced terrible times been labelled a terrorist by prison guards, called a spic and worse.",news
"But he has always made use of his life of incarceration, he says.",news
"I made myself a promise: they can lock me up, but the time I spend in prison is my time.",news
"I use it to my own advantage, for my own goals.",news
"From the moment I get up to the moment I go to bed, I keep active.",news
"That means rising at 4am to an exercise regime of 40 minutes of stretching, and sidewinders and upper body routines.",news
"Currently, he's reading Edward Said's Orientalism, and before that he devoured the New Yorker writer Jane Mayer's book on billionaire rightwing donors, Dark Money.",news
He also likes to paint as a way of taking myself out of prison into the outside world .,news
"He uses as his template photographs of landscapes or seascapes that he tears from magazines, making up for his lack of access to the natural world.",news
"He caught the painting bug after the alleged escape plot when he was put into solitary confinement in two of the toughest supermax prisons in the US: Marion, Illinois, and Florence, Colorado.",news
He would spend all but two hours a week in his concrete cell with no sight of the sky.,news
You see less colour everything blurs into the of the cell walls.,news
So he turned to painting as a way to bring colour back into his life.,news
"That's when he rediscovered his passion for the monarch butterfly, reproducing pictures of the insects as a reflection on their migration.",news
"I always thought they were not going to destroy me, that was not going to happen.",news
Though he is now out of solitary he has still had to deal with social deprivation.,news
"At its peak, he was one of two dozen independistas in federal prisons now he is the last one.",news
"Over the years, he has seen his comrades walk free, their ranks gradually depleted, until in 2010 he became the only one left.",news
To have no regret about his predicament is all the more extraordinary in that he could have been released in 2009.,news
"In August 1999, Bill Clinton did what López Rivera's supporters are now urging Obama to do: he used his final days in office to grant a presidential pardon to 11 Puerto Rican independence fighters.",news
"That's not my practice, I couldn't do it, he says.",news
Surely he must have had moments in the past seven years when he has questioned his rejection of the deal that would have set him free?,news
"For me, the decision was the one I had to make.",news
So what now is the likelihood that Obama will follow in Clinton's footsteps and finally fling open the cell doors?,news
One factor in Obama's calculation might be that Clinton's round of pardons sparked a fireball of opposition in Congress and the media.,news
The Clinton backlash perhaps explains Obama's apparent ambivalence on the matter.,news
He is reported to have told Miranda that López Rivera's clemency petition was on his desk .,news
But López Rivera responds to the mixed messages emanating from the White House with trademark composure.,news
"I have no choice but to be optimistic, he says, as the Terre Haute guards call time on our conversation.",news
West's hospitalisation comes at a pivotal time for 's complex relationship with mental health.,news
"We have to look to the origins of to really understand how much mental health has always been at its core, said Sule and Inkster.",news
"It developed in the mid 70s in the South Bronx, where gangs were roaming the streets, there was a drug epidemic, there was extreme poverty, a housing crisis.",news
"You throw in absent fathers, losing family to crime, people with no support all those are ingredients for mental health problems.",news
"However, the disparity, Sule and Inkster pointed out, was that while the lyrics documented struggle and depression, it was a very different story when it came to artists giving interviews or performing.",news
"There was this very masculine culture of where you had to be resilient and you couldn't show any signs of weakness, said Sule and Inkster.",news
"In October, Ohio rapper Kid Cudi, made a public statement to say he had been hospitalised and admitted anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as I can remember .",news
"Its been difficult for me to find the words to what I'm about to share with you because I feel ashamed, he wrote.",news
The wave of support that Kid Cudi received from some of the biggest names in from A$AP Rocky and Travis Scott to Wiz Khalifa and even West himself - and the fact it gave rise to trending hashtag,news
According to Inkster and Sule it was a conversation that began to open up in 2011 when DMX admitted that many of his public struggles with addiction and crime were related to his bipolar disorder.,news
"Mental health is something that a lot of people just aren't ready to talk about, especially in the black community, especially black men.",news
"It's very taboo, it's very outside of the norm for black men to think it's OK to see a therapist or anything like that, said Mensa recently.",news
"Charles Hamilton, a rapper who emerged to great acclaim in 2009, going on to collaborate with Eminem among others, very publicly unravelled and was later sectioned due to bipolar disorder.",news
"Returning to the public eye last year, he too spoke openly about his mental health issues.",news
"I didn't leave my house, I just made music all the time.",news
"I was fighting depression, I shut myself in, he admitted.",news
"I wanted to commit career suicide, physical suicide, spiritual suicide, I didn't care anymore.",news
"Yet for Inkster and Sule, the most significant figure breaking down this stigma around depression and revealing weakness is Kendrick Lamar.",news
"Back in the early days of that would never happen, they said.",news
"Yes, there are still braggadocio lyrics and attitudes but I would say has made great strides.",news
"The head of the Centers for Disease Control, congressional Democrats and the at the Department of Homeland Security called for Republicans to bring a Zika funding bill to the floor - again.",news
"The call comes two weeks after a measure passed the House around 3am, loaded with unrelated provisions Democrats called poison pills and after the Senate attempted to advance a $1.",news
"We've got one week left, said Kathy Castor, a Democratic representative for the Tampa Bay area, along Florida's Gulf Coast.",news
One week left - and if Speaker Paul Ryan cannot get a bill to the president's desk it will be a colossal failure to address a crisis.,news
"The subtropical, virus can cause children to be born with abnormally small heads, a devastating birth defect known as microcephaly.",news
"Researchers know little about the disease: there is no cure, no vaccine and few diagnostic tools.",news
Knowledge about how to control the mosquitoes that transmit Zika is also limited.,news
"The Aedes aegypti mosquito is prevalent along America's Gulf Coast, but is less susceptible as to common mosquito control methods than other species.",news
"Would you believe that just yesterday we had 11 new cases in Florida, said Democratic senator Bill Nelson.",news
"He and fellow Floridian, Republican Marco Rubio, attempted to bring a $1.",news
"The new diagnoses, Nelson said, brings the state's total to 263, which includes 43 pregnant women .",news
"It's been 136 days since the president requested just under $2bn in emergency funding, Nelson said.",news
"Compare that it took just 38 days to get $6bn for Ebola, and it took just 49 days to get $2bn to respond to the swine flu in 2009.",news
The race to compromise on a Zika measure comes about one week before Congress adjourns for the summer.,news
"The disease was first flagged as dangerous in January, the World Health Organization declared it an emergency by February.",news
"Now, at the height of mosquito season, more than 1, 100 people across the US have been diagnosed with Zika.",news
All the cases are travel associated where people were infected outside of the US.,news
"However, public health officials have said repeatedly the disease could jump to American mosquitoes if a individual is bitten.",news
"Just two weeks ago, the House passed a bill to fund Zika, but the measure was rejected by Democrats because of provisions.",news
"Among the poison pills Democrats said, was a $540m cut in funding to Obamacare and a deleted provision to stop the Confederate flag from flying at federal veterans cemeteries.",news
"In turn, Republicans accused Democrats of failing to pass the bill despite what they billed as beneficial measures to lift restrictions on certain pesticides.",news
"One hundred babies would be $1bn, said Dr Ed McCabe.",news
"A majority of Republicans and Democrats polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they support Zika research, but surveyors called Americans' understanding of the virus uneven .",news
"Of the 85% of Americans who have heard of Zika, just 13% said they are personally threatened by it (74% said the virus threatens pregnant women).",news
"The only virtue in watching an infectious disease spread in slow motion is that it should give some places the advantage of time to prepare for it, McCabe said.",news
"Public health officials are particularly concerned about how the stalemate could affect Puerto Rico, where the virus has infected island mosquitoes, and already hamstrung by a debt crisis.",news
"The director of the CDC, Dr Tom Frieden, said public health officials believe up to 15 women per day are infected with the virus.",news
"What we are seeing in Puerto Rico today is a very rapid increase in the level of infection, said Frieden.",news
"This is a great concern, it's a silent epidemic, he said, because of the lack of tools to diagnose new infections.",news
"To date nearly 2, 500 people in Puerto Rico have been diagnosed with the disease, including 279 pregnant women.",news

"When former Jets coach Weeb Ewbank hired him, he had to make a difference.",news
"If he felt he wasn't making a difference, then his career as a professional coach would be short.",news
"Ryan's first job as a defensive coordinator came in 1976 with the Vikings under Bud Grant, like Ewbank a Hall of Fame coach.",news
"He spent two years there before moving to the rival Bears, where he concocted the 46 defense that overwhelmed the league with its aggressiveness and unpredictability.",news
"Ryan's defenders, featuring such Hall of Famers as linebacker Mike Singletary and ends Dan Hampton and Richard Dent, came from all angles and was nearly impossible to budge on the ground.",news
"Some say the 46 is just an front, said Ryan, who named the scheme after safety Doug Plank, who wore that number.",news
Ryan and head coach Mike Ditka often feuded during that season and Super Bowl run.,news
"They nearly slugged it out at halftime of Chicago's only defeat, at Miami on a Monday night in December.",news
"At a meeting the night before the Bears beat New England in the 1986 Super Bowl, Dent said a teary Ryan informed his players that he was going to Philadelphia:",news

Jurors heard testimony on Monday about the extent to which the story has damaged Eramo's life and reputation before they began deliberating to decide how much to award her in damages.,news
"Eramo told jurors that after the story's publication, she had trouble sleeping, feared for her safety and struggled with how to explain what was happening to her son.",news
"One day, she crawled under her desk and contemplated suicide as she felt her world come crashing down around her, she said.",news
Her husband testified that she told him: I don't know that I can live anymore.,news
"I just wanted to disappear, said Eramo, who cried throughout much of her testimony.",news
She claimed the article prompted the university to move her out of her job as an associate dean into a different administrative role that she doesn't like as much because she rarely works with students.,news
"When the article was published, she was also preparing to undergo a double mastectomy for breast cancer.",news
Eramo and her attorneys suggested that the stress she was under could have contributed to a infection that led to a hospital stay.,news
"Even the strongest people have a breaking point, said Tom Clare, an attorney for Eramo.",news
"The story roiled the University of Virginia campus, prompted calls for Eramo's resignation and sparked a national conversation about sexual assault at elite institutions.",news
Jackie's story quickly fell apart after reporters from other outlets started asking questions and determined that Rolling Stone never spoke to the woman's alleged attackers - or even verified their existence - before going to print.,news
The jury also found that Erdely acted with actual malice on six claims: two statements in the article and four statements to media outlets after the story was published.,news
Jurors awarded $2m to Eramo for statements made by Erdely and $1m for the republication of the article by Rolling Stone and Wenner Media.,news
Rolling Stone has agreed to pay Erdely's legal costs and the damages levied against her.,news
"Rolling Stone's attorneys argued throughout the trial that while it may have been a mistake to trust Jackie, their portrayal of the university and Eramo was fair and accurate.",news
"Paxton apologized to Eramo, but stressed that Eramo not only kept a job at the university after the article was published, but she received a pay raise.",news
"In their damages defense, attorneys for Rolling Stone showed jurors just one exhibit:",news
A 2015 Office of Civil Rights report that criticizes the university's handling of sexual assault complaints and specifically mentions that Eramo helped to create a hostile environment for victims on campus.,news
"Rolling Stone also faces a $25m lawsuit from Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity where Jackie claimed her assault took place.",news
"Seth Rogen's naughty food cartoon Sausage Party is, like much of his best work, deceptive packaging.",news
"The script he and his usual collaborator Evan Goldberg have written (in conjunction with Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir) seems, at first, to trade solely on anthropomorphised food using profanity on supermarket shelves.",news
Its occupants (food from around the world) are kept compliant by an unprovable belief system.,news
"If they are good and obey the gods, they will one day be chosen and taken to the Great Beyond (outside the gleaming automated doors in a cart.)",news
"This fear prevents sausages and buns from getting intimate, despite their urges to conjoin.",news
"Our lead sausage Frank (voiced by Rogen) is upbeat, cheery and randy for his shelfmate Brenda (Kristen Wiig) a bun who returns his affection.",news
"All is well at the store, with the happy food singing songs of praise to the gods who will one day scoop them up.",news
"But when that shellshocked honey mustard (Danny McBride) returns with stories of the gods actually being bloodthirsty monsters, things start to change.",news
The first of a number of extraordinary comes when our heroes end up selected (yay!),news
"There is a shocking amount of proper, terrorising fear during this and subsequent scenes.",news
"I'd personally be OK allowing children to see the goofy prurience in this film, but it's the horrific imagery (some of which apes Saving Private Ryan) that might freak a kid out.",news
"Disrupted, Frank and Brenda must get back to their aisle in the hopes of repackaging themselves without getting tossed.",news
"The douche, sleazily voiced by Nick Kroll, is a play on .",news
"Racial stereotypes await on every aisle, which will undoubtedly be a third rail for some viewers.",news
"My attitude is that if you want to play in that sandbox, you have to be sure to insult everyone and, more importantly, make sure the jokes work.",news
Sausage Party features an adorable potato (with googly eyes all over its body!),news
"This is a story that is vehemently against the corruption found in organised religion, but not in a atheist Gervais kind of way.",news
Something to consider right now as we get closer to an election where one candidate's supporters seem too stupid to tie their own shoes.,news
And another message: everyone would probably be happier if they were screwing.,news
"Sausage Party is a movie with an extended climax, and before the final ending there's an already much discussed food orgy that, no joke, is something you need to see to believe.",news
"The whole thing is so tasty, you may just want seconds.",news
And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful.,ted
"I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night.",ted
Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!,ted
I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me.,ted
It's a true story - every bit of this is true.,ted
White House - we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville.,ted
"I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but - I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me.",ted
"It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat.",ted
"We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant.",ted
"Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it.",ted
"We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper.",ted
"She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much",ted
"And she said Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.",ted
"And the man said, He's come down a long way, hasn't he?",ted
And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville.,ted
"And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves,",ted
"Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said - they laughed.",ted
"I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home.",ted
"I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling.",ted
"I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway.",ted
"And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, Call Washington!",ted
"And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington?",ted
"And the story began, Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday, quote: 'My wife Tipper and",ted
"I have opened a low-cost family restaurant' - 'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'",ted
"Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on - one of them had me in a big white chef's hat",ted
"Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!",ted
"But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time.",ted
Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis?,ted
"I want to start with a couple of - I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five.",ted
"I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it.",ted
"Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells.",ted
"Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January.",ted
Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees.,ted
"Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment",ted
"But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do.",ted
"First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual.",ted
Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit.,ted
"Cars and trucks - I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective.",ted
"It's an easy, visible target of concern - and it should be - but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks.",ted
"Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world.",ted
Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference.,ted
"You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis.",ted
Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life.,ted
"Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people.",ted
"A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy.",ted
"It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced.",ted
"Participant Productions convened - with my active involvement - the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator.",ted
"You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce.",ted
"And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets.",ted
"Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think.",ted
"Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community.",ted
"Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management.",ted
"And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions.",ted
"The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining.",ted
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it.,ted
"Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.",ted
Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics?,ted
"It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat.",ted
"This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is.",ted
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions - global warming pollution - and trading it.,ted
"Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system.",ted
"Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors - how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation?",ted
"Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided.",ted
The market will work to solve this problem - if we can accomplish this.,ted
"Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done.",ted
"And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did.",ted
"It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads.",ted
"Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested.",ted
"I like climate crisis instead of climate collapse, but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this.",ted
"Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination.",ted
"I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue.",ted
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do.,ted
"Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them.",ted
"In terms of invention, I'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects.",ted
"I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest.",ted
It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world.,ted
"It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet, the number one cause of death in children under five.",ted
It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires - acute respiratory infections caused by this.,ted
How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year?,ted
"I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes, so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes, which is charcoal.",ted
It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation.,ted
A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths - that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil.,ted
So the rains come - they go down the rivers and the flooding happens.,ted
"Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it.",ted
"Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared.",ted
"You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it.",ted
"So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels.",ted
"About four years ago, I took a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there.",ted
This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked.,ted
And the idea was that you could take waste paper; you could compress it and make briquettes that could be used for fuel.,ted
"So our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple the throughput of this device.",ted
And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them.,ted
And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn.,ted
"And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see it says, US Peace Corps.",ted
"As it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village.",ted
"And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away.",ted
And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel.,ted
What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level.,ted
And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called bagasse.,ted
"It has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals.",ted
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it.,ted
"What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with, something like charcoal.",ted
"So over the next couple of years, students and I worked to develop a process.",ted
"So you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.",ted
"After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln, and then you end up with this carbonized material here.",ted
It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking.,ted
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes.,ted
"And conveniently, one of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called kokonte, which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root.",ted
"And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of manioc.",ted
"In fact, it's grown all over the world - yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava, it's all the same thing - a very starchy root vegetable.",ted
"And you can make a very thick, sticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes.",ted
"These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute.",ted
So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT.,ted
This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India.,ted
"And more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel.",ted
"Kids and women are especially affected by it, because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires.",ted
So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there.,ted
"Well, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us.",ted
What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass.,ted
And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area.,ted
"And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel.",ted
"And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung.",ted
And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel.,ted
"And in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly.",ted
"But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long.",ted
And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking.,ted
So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.,ted
"And after some time, we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only - actually",ted
"So now we're in a situation where we have a product, which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be.",ted
"In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees are cut down every year.",ted
There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those.,ted
"In addition, the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars.",ted
That's an awful lot for a country like Haiti - with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars.,ted
So this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project.,ted
"And one of the things that I think is also interesting, is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis.",ted
And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal.,ted
"And he's found that worldwide, you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel.",ted
"That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees.",ted
But now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel.,ted
"One of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month.",ted
"And I think it's the coolest thing, and it's even lower tech than what you just saw, if you can imagine such a thing.",ted
And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes - it comes ready made.,ted
"They're fully functional, field-tested, ready to roll out.",ted
"And I think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology, is that the technology transfer is so easy.",ted
"Compared to the sugarcane charcoal, where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder, this comes pre-briquetted.",ted
"And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now, which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life.",ted
"But once you see it, like you guys in the front row -",ted
"And this is, I think, a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things.",ted
"So not only do you have health benefits, you have environmental benefits.",ted
But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits.,ted
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own.,ted
"It's really rare that you don't have trade-offs between health and economics, or environment and economics.",ted
"So when we talk about, now, the future we will create, one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in.",ted
"And now, I don't actually mean the world that we live in.",ted
I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat.,ted
I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water.,ted
That's as if the entire workforce of the state of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water.,ted
"It's a place where, for example, if this were India, in this room, only three of us would have a car.",ted
"If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet.",ted
"If this were Zambia - 300 of you would be farmers, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV.",ted
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day.,ted
These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for.,ted
"These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers, our designers, our business people, our entrepreneurs to be facing.",ted
I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address.,ted
But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale.,ted
The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops.,ted
"And we need to rethink our development strategies, so that we're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers, but rather to stop being poor farmers.",ted
And we need to think about how we can do that effectively.,ted
We need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems.,ted
"So we need to create this future, and we need to start doing it now.",ted
Tell us - just while we see if someone has a question - just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on.,ted
We're also looking at low-cost water-treatment systems.,ted
One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that.,ted
CA: What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale?,ted
"Do you need to find entrepreneurs, or venture capitalists, or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale?",ted
It's a difficult thing - it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income.,ted
So you can't use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward.,ted
"So, you know, I do what I can with the students.",ted
We have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward.,ted
"But I think with the vision to do that, we can move forward.",ted
"A public, Dewey long ago observed, is constituted through discussion and debate.",ted
"If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question, and avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned, then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion.",ted
"It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time, namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building.",ted
"To put the assumptions very clearly: capitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable, and so has democracy.",ted
"If we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities, they were the rare exception, not the norm.",ted
"The question now, however, is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation.",ted
But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions.,ted
"And that provides the ground for a type of action, because consensus of each moment allows us to act.",ted
But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems.,ted
"Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive, as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights, about denial of justice, rather than provision of it.",ted
"And in terms of experience of capitalism, there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences.",ted
"Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds, timber, that is cut right from under the poorest.",ted
"And technical assistance might shock you, but it's the worst form of - today - of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries.",ted
"Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day, who are incapable of thinking creatively, or organically.",ted
"Next assumption - and of course the events of July 7, I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 - have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds.",ted
But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in.,ted
"And that is that if we want to have one world, this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion, and then inclusion for some.",ted
"We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world, in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope.",ted
"Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history, where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics.",ted
"We have three critical terms: economy, civil society and the state.",ted
"I will not deal with those first two, except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions, from one context to another, can only make for disaster.",ted
Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context.,ted
"Textbook economics does not work in my context, and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy.",ted
"The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward, and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling, for which I have enormous respect.",ted
"Second, instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state, why don't we simplify and say, what are a series of functions that the state in the 21st century must perform?",ted
"This is a feasible goal, basically because, contrary to widespread assumption, I would argue that we know how to do this.",ted
"Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today, if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943?",ted
But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning.,ted
Now in order to do this - and this brings this group -,ted
"The least important form of capital, in this project, is financial capital - money.",ted
"Because it lacks the institutional, organizational, managerial forms to turn it into capital.",ted
"And what is required is a combination of physical capital, institutional capital, human capital - and security, of course, is critical, but so is information.",ted
"The first challenge is to rethink, fundamentally, the issue of the time.",ted
"What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re-engage in a project, that capital formation is rapid?",ted
"The absolute majority of the world's population are below 20, and they are growing larger and faster.",ted
"They need different ways of being approached, different ways of being enfranchised, different ways of being skilled.",ted
"Second is, you're problem solvers, but you're not engaging your global responsibility.",ted
"But if you don't think through the problems of corruption, who will?",ted
"The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads, or dams, or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in 60 years.",ted
"But, particularly, what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work.",ted
"As the work on paradigms, long time ago showed - Thomas Kuhn's work - it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments - true breakthroughs - occur.",ted
"And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor, through this means.",ted
"So, Ashraf, until recently, you were the finance minister of Afghanistan, a country right at the middle of much of the world's agenda.",ted
"Ashraf Ghani: What scares me most is - is you, lack of your engagement.",ted
"But seriously, the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as, at least, a 10- to 20-year perspective.",ted
"But in my world - you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years, space had expanded.",ted
I rode - traveled - travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took 12.,ted
"So the first is when the scale is that, we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure - it takes six years to deliver infrastructure.",ted
"But the modality of attention, or what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow.",ted
"Second is, when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power - we had the Red Army for 10 continuous years, 110,000 strong, literally terrorizing.",ted
The sky: every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear.,ted
"Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism - from all sides.",ted
"The United States, Great Britain, joined for instance, Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism.",ted
"So, when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan, it's because of that legacy.",ted
"I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here, standing in front of you, speaking.",ted
"When I joined as finance minister, I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent.",ted
"I think we can make it, and the reason we can make it is because of the people.",ted
"You see, because, I mean - I give you one statistic.",ted
"You know, when I went back in December of 2001, I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist.",ted
"And I told them - my people, with the Americans here - separate.",ted
"They see engagement, global engagement, as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people.",ted
"And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is - Clare Lockhart is here, so I'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan.",ted
And that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table.,ted
"What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future, where her children could really have a different life.",ted
CA: How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade?,ted
"Look, there's a very little known fact: countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars don't produce drugs.",ted
Cotton does not compete with opium; a t-shirt does.,ted
"Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit.",ted
"It is important, but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want is global access.",ted
They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners - and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again.,ted
"So I think economically, the critical issue really is to now think through.",ted
And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work.,ted
"The aid system does not have the knowledge, the vision, the ability.",ted
"I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it.",ted
"Yeah, to be exact, you know, I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country 27.5 billion.",ted
"It's that a dollar of private investment, in my judgment, is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid, in terms of the dynamic that it generates.",ted
Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents; it could be 20 cents; or it could be four dollars.,ted
"It depends on what form it comes, what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it.",ted
"You know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries, not to generate growth in the poor countries.",ted
"And this is, again, one of those assumptions - the way car seats are an assumption that we've inherited in governments, and doors.",ted
"You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries, provide advice, but they do.",ted
If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves - and I'm putting that proposition equally,ted
And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy.,ted
"Unless that kind of compact is entered into, you will not be able to sustain the consensus.",ted
"I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.",ted
We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space.,ted
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done.,ted
"And that is, instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places, and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.",ted
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization; they need to look forward to breakthroughs.,ted
"We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future.",ted
"I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to - for this next decade and a half - oh shoot, I screwed up.",ted
"But anyway that's - the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though, is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later.",ted
"And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young: three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.",ted
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened.,ted
"It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, Ooh, hey, I can do that.",ted
There's only a few people that have flown in early 1908.,ted
"In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, thousand of pilots.",ted
"Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today, but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.",ted
"There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried, and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.",ted
The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition.,ted
"So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts, in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today.",ted
"And that's why they're so safe, as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.",ted
There's only been two concepts tried - two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.,ted
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.,ted
"Well, what happened when I was a little kid was - some pretty heavy stuff too.",ted
Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars - and this was before Sputnik.,ted
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now.,ted
"We thought there'd be animals there; we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?",ted
"But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts.",ted
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.,ted
"I founded another company in '82, which is my company now.",ted
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.,ted
And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.,ted
"The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet.",ted
"Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.",ted
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56.,ted
"The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander.",ted
"It was a - you know, it landed on the moon, take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -",ted
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.,ted
"Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow, have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.",ted
"The interesting thing - by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles.",ted
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.,ted
"Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it.",ted
"You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.",ted
"But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it.",ted
I put down innovation - I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.,ted
"The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space, and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned space flights in the world - the very first year.",ted
"In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.",ted
"In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station.",ted
"And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five, which was the number the same year back in 1961.",ted
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.,ted
"We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough - at least as safe as the early airlines - so that can be done.",ted
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company.,ted
"Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?",ted
"The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.",ted
"And the reason it has to be sub-orbital is, there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit.",ted
"The governments have been doing this - three governments have been doing this for 45 years, and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.",ted
That's - You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.,ted
"It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.",ted
"I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.",ted
"But I think once it does, we will find solutions, and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.",ted
"And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon",ted
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere - you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.,ted
"My critics say, Hey, Rutan's just spending a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.",ted
This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun.,ted
"And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, well, wait a minute.",ted
"Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer, but the home computer was for games.",ted
For a whole decade it was for fun - we didn't even know what it was for.,ted
And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our homes.,ted
"OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart, but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.",ted
"Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.",ted
And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.,ted
The military fighters had a - highest-performance military airplane was the SR71.,ted
"It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly, and was taken out of service.",ted
"It went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of service.",ted
And we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.,ted
"And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, or if you've got a 10-year-old now.",ted
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.,ted
"Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane.",ted
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been,ted
But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub-orbital flights to space,ted
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.,ted
"OK, I look forward to a new capitalist's space race, let's call it.",ted
"You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones.",ted
The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it,ted
"Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.",ted
"America - the world saw America as not being the leader in technology, and that was a very strong thing.",ted
"And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever.",ted
"And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.",ted
"Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.",ted
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America - can't do it.,ted
"This is available because a Russian space program is starving, and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.",ted
"They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.",ted
"And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians?",ted
"Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.",ted
"I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry.",ted
"And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.",ted
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered.,ted
"OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.",ted
This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020.,ted
"I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.",ted
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15.,ted
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff - and we've done it for a long time.,ted
"The NACA, before NASA, never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.",ted
"But NASA is developing the space liner, always has, and runs the only space line, OK.",ted
And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it.,ted
"But starting back in June of 2004, when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it, can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.",ted
"What I want to talk about is, as background, is the idea that cars are art.",ted
"And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane - if you accept that - that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital",ted
Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.,ted
"We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion - but that's not what interests me in this speech.",ted
"Automobiles may be what you use, but cars are what we are, in many ways.",ted
Cars are not a suit of clothes; cars are an avatar.,ted
"Cars are an expansion of yourself: they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it - your anger, whatever.",ted
"It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy, the car is sexy.",ted
"And if you're full of road rage, you've got a Chevy: Like a Rock, right?",ted
"Many people think, Well, it's computers, and it's done by machines and stuff like that.",ted
"Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.",ted
It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.,ted
And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum.,ted
"That tension between the need to express, the need to discover, then you put something new into it, and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship.",ted
"We work in clay, which hasn't changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it, and there's a very interesting analogy to that too.",ted
"Real quickly - Michelangelo once said he's there to discover the figure within, OK?",ted
"Between that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot",ted
"OK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here, but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here.",ted
"Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality you have to touch about it?",ted
"And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.",ted
"Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore, I believe that that pressure within that Moore's talking about - at least when it comes to cars",ted
"It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself, that comes in a car, and takes over people like me.",ted
"Do this, do this, do this, until this thing comes alive.",ted
And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.,ted
"This sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it, and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars.",ted
"And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this, or when somebody works like this.",ted
"It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.",ted
"Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.",ted
Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.,ted
We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.,ted
"That's what we're searching for - when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there.",ted
"However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian, instead of this quantum approach.",ted
And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing.,ted
Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.,ted
"And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars, is very applicable.",ted
"You know a car when you've seen it, with soul.",ted
"Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me, are interchangeable.",ted
I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.,ted
"I think this one here, there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know,",ted
It really only gets serious when you look at something like this.,ted
"This is one substitution that I believe all of us, in design management, are guilty of.",ted
"But right now it's in dealing with our own people, our own teams who are doing the creating.",ted
"The idea of people-work is what we work with here, and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs.",ted
"We have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision - that means we have to work as one family; we have to understand ourselves that way.",ted
There's good times; there's interesting times; and there's some stress times too.,ted
"You want to do cars, you've got to go outside.",ted
You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.,ted
"That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.",ted
"Now one thing about art is, art is discovery, and art is discovering yourself through your art.",ted
"And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion, we are completely in love with our own creations.",ted
"This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.",ted
"But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension, a new meaning.",ted
We have a shared center; we have a shared focus - that car stays at the middle of all our relationships.,ted
"And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.",ted
I heard today about Joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction.,ted
"This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too.",ted
"They've got that gene infected in them as well, and they want that to live, more than anything else.",ted
We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.,ted
"We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it, that I only had a phone number that connected me to them.",ted
"And so we sent them off with this team name, Deep Blue.",ted
Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM - we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.,ted
"It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue, in a company like BMW, has a hook - Deep Blue, wow, cool name.",ted
"And we took a team of designers, and we sent them off to America.",ted
"Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.",ted
"And a group of engineers worked in Germany, and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV.",ted
"Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart, where the customer is, live with them in America.",ted
"They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.",ted
"And I'm telling myself, This is going to be a great car, they're doing research that I've never even thought about before.",ted
"And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio, and six or seven apartments, it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu.",ted
"But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.",ted
"And one of the young women in the project, she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.",ted
"The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub - it's quite fascinating.",ted
"On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this.",ted
"This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever, saying, Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good.",ted
So my concept of what a design studio was probably - I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.,ted
"And one was hoping that these two teams would get together, and this collusion of incredible creativity, under these incredible surroundings, and these incredibly stressed-out engineers, would create some incredible solutions.",ted
"Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was - these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions.",ted
"You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point, you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far, that they cannot bring this together at all.",ted
"And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon, which is just up the road from here - you know Tiburon?",ted
"We would see where we were going, we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.",ted
"And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.",ted
"I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it, and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either -",ted
"So we went to Tiburon, after three months, and the team had gotten together the week before, many days ahead of time.",ted
"The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them, and they put their presentation together.",ted
"Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.",ted
"And they hadn't done anything because - kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems, and we were asking them to create a problem.",ted
"And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say, This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it.",ted
"And the engineers told the designers, If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out, we'll walk right out of the project.",ted
"So I didn't know any of this, and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.",ted
We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers.,ted
"Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance, I was seriously being baffled with bullshit.",ted
"You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.",ted
"After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.",ted
"I screamed at them, I yelled at them, What the hell are you doing?",ted
"You're letting me down, you're my designers, you're supposed to be the creative ones, what the hell is going on around here?",ted
"It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones, but this was probably one of my better ones.",ted
"And I went into these people; how could they take BMW's money, how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing?",ted
"The engineers all sat at one end of the table, the designers",ted
"And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know, did she fly out with me or something?",ted
"I said, No, and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.",ted
"And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married, the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.",ted
"He said, Love is not selfish, he said, Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.'",ted
"It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month, and it's two times less than last month, so that means you don't love me as much.",ted
"And I thought about this, and I thought, You know, I'm not showing love here.",ted
"I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.",ted
"This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches, and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team.",ted
"I said, Guys, I'm thinking about something here, this isn't right.",ted
I can't have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one.,ted
"Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'",ted
"And I think we felt much closer that day, we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there, and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.",ted
"We put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love, I think, truly back into the center of the process.",ted
"By the way, that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SUVs in America.",ted
"One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes - you see it downstairs, the X Coupe - they had a lot of fun with that.",ted
"It was the rendition of our motorcycle, the GS, as Carl Magnusson says, brute-iful, as the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels.",ted
"And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you, was this one here.",ted
I'm also going to steal a little quote out of Little Prince.,ted
"There's a lot to be said about trust and love, if you know that those two words are synonymous for design.",ted
"I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day, and it's stayed that way ever since.",ted
"And I hope that you too find that there's more to design, and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself.",ted
"It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.",ted
"At the break, I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate.",ted
What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves.,ted
"It's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism, that of haemophilus influenzae.",ted
That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months.,ted
We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours.,ted
"So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added: most human pathogens, a couple of plants, several insects and several mammals, including the human genome.",ted
"We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year, as a side project from environmental organisms.",ted
"But as we look, what's out there, we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet.",ted
"Less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago, and so we decided to do something about it.",ted
"And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition, where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions, trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.",ted
"It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel, in part to help excite young people about going into science.",ted
"For example, it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes - there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments.",ted
"It turns out, almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors, and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication.",ted
"From one site, from one barrel of seawater, we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species.",ted
We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.,ted
"We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day, particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums.",ted
We filter through some simple apparatuses; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City.,ted
And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time.,ted
"Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean.",ted
"Some of these make logical sense, in terms of different temperature gradients.",ted
"The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light, and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.",ted
"Maybe not surprisingly, in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue, the photoreceptors tend to see blue light.",ted
"When there's a lot of chlorophyll around, they see a lot of green light.",ted
"But they vary even more, possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes.",ted
"And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are: Are we just discovering new members of known families, or are we discovering new families?",ted
"And it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families, but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families.",ted
"So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes, components and life on this planet.",ted
"When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree, we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.",ted
"Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome.",ted
"And if you take all animals together, we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families.",ted
I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution.,ted
"And we think in a gene-centric view - maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas - than in a genome-centric view, which are different constructs of these gene components.",ted
"Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA, has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two, and is getting very rapid and very cheap.",ted
"Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995, and that from mycoplasma genitalium.",ted
"And we have really nice T-shirts that say, you know, I heart my genitalium.",ted
"And we simply asked the question, if one species needs 800, another 500, is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system?",ted
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code.,ted
"And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.",ted
So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those non-essential genes.,ted
"But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment.",ted
"We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms, and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.",ted
The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so.,ted
"So we think that we can expand or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here, to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500.",ted
"The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them, and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.",ted
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult.,ted
This was not the first synthetic virus - a polio virus had been made a year before - but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do.,ted
"This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware, and that's the notions that we have with biology.",ted
"People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare, and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee, and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area.",ted
"And I think it's important to keep reality in mind, versus what happens with people's imaginations.",ted
"Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today - that genome can be made.",ted
"And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox, but the DNA from this organism is not infective.",ted
"So even if somebody made the smallpox genome, that DNA itself would not cause infections.",ted
"And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents.",ted
"If that research is truly discontinued, there should be very little activity on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.",ted
"And possibly eukaryotic cells, those that we have, are possible within a decade.",ted
"So we're now making several dozen different constructs, because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome.",ted
"The key is, how do you put all of the others?",ted
"We start with these fragments, and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome.",ted
"This is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans, that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.",ted
"It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours, after its chromosomes are literally blown apart.",ted
"This organism is ubiquitous on the planet, and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there.",ted
This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation.,ted
"The glass started to burn and crack, while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier.",ted
Here's an actual picture of what happens: the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million rads of radiation.,ted
"It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that, and we probably have thousands, if not tens of thousands, of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that.",ted
"After these genomes are synthesized, the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome.",ted
"So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential, not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues.",ted
"For example, from the third organism we sequenced, Methanococcus jannaschii - it lives in boiling water temperatures; its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.",ted
"So we know lots of different pathways, thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO2, and can capture that back.",ted
"So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes, we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere, converting that into biopolymers or other products.",ted
"We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide, and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.",ted
"Also, there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane.",ted
And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products.,ted
"And therefore, as with all biology, you get selection through screening, whether you're screening for hydrogen production, or chemical production, or just viability.",ted
To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach.,ted
We're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.,ted
"Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen, and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process.",ted
"We're also combining cellulases, the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol.",ted
The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce.,ted
"I think future engineered species could be the source of food, hopefully a source of energy, environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry.",ted
We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species.,ted
"It was actually a very strange study, because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books, and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life, so it must be OK.",ted
"The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this, but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them.",ted
"Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold.",ted
"I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold.",ted
"It's not enough your software crashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs - it erased my ROMs!",ted
"With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD.",ted
"When I was offered the Times column six years ago, the deal was like this:",ted
"You get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them until the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back, and you'll get paid for it.",ted
"So, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it.",ted
"The job, though, came with one small downside, and that is, they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column.",ted
"And what I've noticed is - first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.",ted
"If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails.",ted
And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration.,ted
"Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen.",ted
"They're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast.",ted
"It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure.",ted
There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use.,ted
"And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will -",ted
"And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use.",ted
"This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS.",ted
And the entire operating system - this is the good part - the entire operating system fit in 211,ted
You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!,ted
"So the irony is, that as these things became easier to use, a less technical, broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time.",ted
I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day.,ted
"And the calls that - you know how they say, Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?",ted
Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD.,ted
"So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable.",ted
"And the technician said, Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?",ted
"She says, All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen.",ted
"And the technician's like, Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?",ted
"She goes, Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'",ted
"Well, if you like that one - how much time have we got?",ted
"Another one, a guy called - this is absolutely true - his computer had crashed, and he told the technician he couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed 11.",ted
"He said, The message says, 'Error Type 11.'",ted
"So, we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users.",ted
"But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now?",ted
"In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller.",ted
"So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier, but our fingers are essentially staying the same size.",ted
Software is subject to another primal force: the mandate to release more and more versions.,ted
"When you buy a piece of software, it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it.",ted
"It's more like joining a club, where you pay dues every year, and every year, they say, We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99.",ted
"I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years.",ted
And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades.,ted
"I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox - which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it.",ted
"I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration.",ted
"Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor: Simple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database.",ted
"And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died.",ted
"They don't need the database and the website, but they're like,",ted
"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday.",ted
"So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go?",ted
"You can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.",ted
"But if you're not careful about how you choose, you wind up with this.",ted
"This is an un-retouched - this is not a joke - un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word, the copy that you have, with all the toolbars open.",ted
"You've obviously never opened all the toolbars, but all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here.",ted
"And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal.",ted
You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically.,ted
"Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface, is knowing when to use which one of these features.",ted
"So, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000.",ted
"There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu?",ted
It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices.,ted
"Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design.",ted
Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps.,ted
"And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall.",ted
"If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.",ted
Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.,ted
"From the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type.",ted
So there is a limit that we don't want to cross.,ted
"How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way?",ted
"I believe in consistency, when possible, real-world equivalents, trash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly.",ted
"But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence.",ted
"I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.",ted
"If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok?",ted
"It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan.",ted
"Now, it would be inconsistent to put United States first, but it would be intelligent.",ted
"This one's been touched on before, but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called Start?",ted
Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer.,ted
"Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document, in page order, on that printer.",ted
So why in God's name do you see this every time you print?,ted
"And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not Print.",ted
"Now, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity.",ted
"Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this.",ted
"I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s, and after the talk, I met one of the employees.",ted
"So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter.",ted
"Ok, when you want to create a new blank document in Word - it could happen.",ted
I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS.,ted
I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss.,ted
"They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't.",ted
"They're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis.",ted
"But there's also a new Microsoft, that's really doing good, simple interface designs.",ted
"The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market, but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed.",ted
"So, the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse.",ted
"The screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes, things are coming out at a faster pace.",ted
"The crowd went wild, but I had just seen - I'm like, where have I seen this before?",ted
"I had just seen the movie Evita - with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what?",ted
"When I try to explain why I'm back, after telling the press Apple's future is black.",ted
All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz.,ted
So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty.,ted
"And then I heard Al Gore's talk, and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed.",ted
"Because the iPod came out, and it violated every bit of common wisdom.",ted
"Other products cost less; other products had more features, they had voice recorders and FM transmitters.",ted
"The other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard, not Apple's propriety standard.",ted
This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance.,ted
"When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer?",ted
"Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around.",ted
"What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts.",ted
"I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera.",ted
"You might've seen this, this is Apple's new laptop.",ted
"And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives, or one of your children.",ted
You walk along - and I'm about to pull this onto the floor.,ted
It's magnetic - it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.,ted
In my very last example - I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software.,ted
And I'll just - you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous.,ted
Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly; period.,ted
And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period.,ted
"Ok, this is not an ideal situation, because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff.",ted
"The point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word, and having it write out a much longer thing.",ted
"So if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say, Thanks for that.",ted
"And conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail - which happens daily - I say, Piss off.",ted
"This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put in version eight?",ted
"And the company got sick of that, so they said, This version, we're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate.",ted
"So, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology: remember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok?",ted
And if you're among the people who create this stuff: Easy is hard.,ted
"Remember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add, it's deciding what to leave out.",ted
"Kurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent - or at least pretends to be - that he asked me to question him rather than speaking.",ted
"In fact what we're going to talk about, I think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address.",ted
And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.,ted
"Dan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center, many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground.",ted
"Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene.",ted
Jim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.,ted
There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest - Ground Zero.,ted
Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis.,ted
This was - out of all the tourist sites in New York City -,ted
Tourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened.,ted
"So many, in fact, that seeing has become a bit of a problem.",ted
Tourist: I think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on.,ted
"In record time, a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer.",ted
"JA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America.",ted
"Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument, people come here to see what's no longer there.",ted
The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site,ted
"The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter.",ted
"Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.",ted
The ramps are made of simple material - the kind of plywood you see at construction sites - which is really the whole point.,ted
In the face of America's worst destruction people are building again.,ted
"This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment, but certainly David you are known as - I know, a phrase you hate - an entertainment architect.",ted
How did the shock that all of us - and especially all of us in New York - felt on the 11th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing?,ted
"In fact we're finishing a book which is called Pleasure, which is about sensual pleasure in spaces.",ted
But I've got to tell you - it became impossible to do that.,ted
And I found myself the Friday after September 11th - two days afterwards - literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything.,ted
"And in discussing this with other architects, we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were - they should rebuild them 50 stories taller.",ted
"And I thought it was astonishing to speculate, as if this were a competition, on something that was such a fresh wound.",ted
"And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios, but to help right now.",ted
"So we tried to come up with a way, as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team.",ted
KA: Were you conscious of suddenly - as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants - suddenly fulfilling needs?,ted
"Well what I was aware of was, there was this overwhelming need to act now.",ted
And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this.,ted
"There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.",ted
"We took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists, and over four days - it was like this urban barn-raising - to renovate it, and everyone wanted to help.",ted
"Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us.",ted
"And that was done, effectively, by October 8 or something?",ted
"We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group.",ted
I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild.,ted
And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.,ted
"And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled, and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process.",ted
"It was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group that was not representative of the city.",ted
So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea.,ted
The families - the victims of the families - were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.,ted
"And the city actually - through Tim Zagat initially, and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani",ted
"So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin, and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life.",ted
"It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it, where the families of the victims had left notes to them.",ted
"And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there.",ted
And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV.,ted
There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience.,ted
"So seeing this in a very simple, dignified way was a very powerful experience.",ted
"So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform, but we've spent some time down there.",ted
"They were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there, that had nowhere to go.",ted
And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site.,ted
There was a way - there had to be a way - to get people to move around the site.,ted
But then you've got to figure out a way - we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board - but simply funding this thing.,ted
"It looks like a fairly simple thing, but this was a half a million dollar project?",ted
"Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen.",ted
"This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this, and they sensed that this needed to happen.",ted
"And there was therefore this ticking clock, because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that.",ted
"And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York, because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible.",ted
"So we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was one major developer in New York - KA:",ted
"His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center, if that helps anyone - volunteered to help.",ted
"And Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country, volunteered to do it at cost.",ted
"So this developer said, You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense.",ted
"And I think this was the 21st, and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th.",ted
"We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice, and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it.",ted
Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge,ted
"In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.",ted
"There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul - that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified, and a place to reflect and remember.",ted
"And I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need.",ted
"So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said, I'm going to lock the door, because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this.",ted
"And we said, Well, this is half the size, it doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone - everyone in the city.",ted
We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this.,ted
And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed.,ted
The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding.,ted
"So we didn't know what to do, but we decided to cast a very wide net.",ted
We knew that one way or another this was going to happen.,ted
KA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation.,ted
"It seems to me with this, that it was the opposite of that.",ted
"Well here's the issue: we knew that this was not in the sense of - we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial.",ted
"That this was a place for people to reflect, to remember - a kind of quiet place.",ted
So it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer - as we said about the families' platform - and the experience as possible.,ted
"But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible.",ted
One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable.,ted
"I mean, we've talked about this before - a lot of your work",ted
"You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here.",ted
"Did that require, as an architect, a new way of thinking about what you were doing?",ted
"I think this is, obviously, substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it.",ted
"Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is, number one - the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done.",ted
So the notion of collaboration - I think this reinforces how important that is.,ted
"And in terms of the temporary nature of it, our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be.",ted
"I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city, about what's really happening there.",ted
"And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address, where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial.",ted
"Which was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people.",ted
"So that, very much, is in the realm of things I've been interested in before.",ted
"KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.",ted
Do you have - having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project - have any ideas about what should or shouldn't be done?,ted
"Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate -",ted
I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan.,ted
"The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings, which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings.",ted
"And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas, where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses.",ted
"And I think there should be a broader - which there's starting to be - the dialogue is really opening up to, what does this site really want to be?",ted
"And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out, that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion.",ted
"There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive, about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over, so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land.",ted
"Is this an opportunity, is the silver lining - a silver lining, here - to rebuild some more traditional city grid, or not?",ted
DR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities.,ted
And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day?,ted
"I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces, regardless of what the number is.",ted
"So yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities.",ted
"And in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven.",ted
And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city.,ted
"I think a public dialogue - I think, you know, I'd like to see an international competition, and a call for ideas for uses.",ted
"Whether it's arts, whether it's housing, whether it's what amount of shopping?",ted
This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help.,ted
Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice in New York to do artist housing.,ted
"And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic, single solutions, and more about a multiplicity of things.",ted
One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was.,ted
"We certainly did as much research as we could, and we were conscious of other memorials.",ted
And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do.,ted
The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable.,ted
KA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done.,ted
"As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.",ted
"This morning, the world's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats, I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.",ted
"They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today, they will be steering cars by wire, without all that mechanical stuff.",ted
"They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire, to get rid of all that mechanical stuff.",ted
"That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?",ted
"Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.",ted
"But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first, it would be that from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology.",ted
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community.,ted
"The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation.",ted
"And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this, I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.",ted
"You never know what strikes the fancy of whom, but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.",ted
"And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.",ted
What I don't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied.,ted
"For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns.",ted
"So, the car - the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage - was a big deal; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.",ted
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.,ted
"It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm, or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.",ted
"It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.",ted
"By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.",ted
We've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.,ted
"But during that entire process, more and more people have been born, and more and more people are moving to cities.",ted
China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half.,ted
"And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years, have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.",ted
"And if you just look at how technology has been applied, we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume, large-weight problems of moving things around.",ted
"And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane, or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.",ted
"The fact is, the last mile is the problem, and half the world now lives in dense cities.",ted
"And people spend, depending on who they are, between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.",ted
"Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air, and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.",ted
"And again, I say that not to attack any industry, I think -",ted
"The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks, it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.",ted
"If - in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles; 1.7 million people used cars.",ted
"We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?",ted
"So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile, and it was dumb luck.",ted
"We were working on iBOTs, but once we made this, we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis.",ted
"It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.",ted
"And every one of those industries, by the way - just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.",ted
"I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon, then on a railroad, then an airplane.",ted
"In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.",ted
"The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city - Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris - the most expensive real estate is their downtowns.",ted
"So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities?",ted
"What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean, environmentally friendly?",ted
"We thought it would be really neat to do that, and one of the problems we really were worried about is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?",ted
Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels - I'm a motor vehicle.,ted
I have the same footprint as a pedestrian; I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.,ted
"I took this down to Ground Zero, and knocked my way through crowds for an hour.",ted
"But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two, and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.",ted
"We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter, and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.",ted
Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.,ted
"We've been so concerned about that, we went to the Postmaster General of the United States, as the first person we ever showed on the outside, and said, Put your people on it.",ted
"And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously.",ted
"We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff.",ted
And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.,ted
"So we've been working really, really hard, but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.",ted
"We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things, and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.",ted
"One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.",ted
"I mean, if you looked in the dictionary, a little old lady - came by me - and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now -",ted
"And the camera is down at her, and this guy has to put the microphone in her face, said, What do you mean by that?",ted
"Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says,",ted
"And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore.",ted
"I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things.",ted
"And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears, were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it -",ted
"When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk, then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes, and",ted
"But she looks up and says this, and it occurs to me,",ted
"The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations, or any of the other think tanks - in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet will be in cities.",ted
"Cars were not meant for parallel parking; they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it:",ted
The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.,ted
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking - three times - a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.,ted
"But if you could put a pin in most cities, and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.",ted
"If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes, you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car,",ted
"We could change the way people allocate their resources, the way this planet uses its energy, make it more fun.",ted
And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.,ted
This is a Stirling cycle engine; this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.,ted
"This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.",ted
"Yes, it could be attached to this, and yes, on a kilogram of propane, you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.",ted
"But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say, you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.",ted
"It doesn't matter much - it says if you get 200 watts of electricity, you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.",ted
"That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way.",ted
"Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place, turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.",ted
The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.,ted
"Depending on whose numbers you believe, it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.",ted
"And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it, or watching their kids die.",ted
"So if we put this box on here in a few years, could we have a solution to transportation, electricity, and communication, and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?",ted
"And what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurring, that people are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and die like us.",ted
"And in one generation, for example, Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest.",ted
"And in Africa, cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries.",ted
"So there's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people, and practice preventive medicine on a global scale.",ted
"Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people - not only in this country, but also worldwide - than everything else combined, and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody.",ted
"And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the prostate tumor activity is shown in red - you can see it diminishing after a year.",ted
Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids.,ted
"What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years, and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do.",ted
"Well, you know, the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet.",ted
"But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick like we are.",ted
So I've been working with a lot of the big food companies.,ted
The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work - they're going to have an Asian salad.,ted
"At Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods.",ted
"And so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu.",ted
"First of all, it's been fantastic being here over these past few days.",ted
"And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people, these amazing talks that we've had.",ted
"I feel that I've fitted in, in many ways, to some of the things that I've heard.",ted
"They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated, a world that isn't polluted.",ted
"The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries, they were able to store a lot of electricity.",ted
"So every house - and there were, I think, eight houses in this little community - could have light for, I think it was about half an hour each evening.",ted
"And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer.",ted
We want to know about what other people do - we're interested in it.,ted
"We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese, and we're good at languages.",ted
"But, of course, my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization - I can't really call it a civilization.",ted
"And I propose to bring into this TED conference, as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom.",ted
"Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film, but these beings have voices that mean something.",ted
"During that time, there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work.",ted
"And we use GSI - geographic whatever it is, GSI - to determine the range of the chimps.",ted
And we're using - you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff - but we're using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area.,ted
"And of course, there's developments in infrared, so you can watch animals at night, and equipment for recording by video, and tape recording is getting lighter and better.",ted
"So in many, many ways, we can do things today that we couldn't do when I began in 1960.",ted
"Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals with large brains, are studied in captivity, modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals.",ted
"So that we know today, they're capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began.",ted
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan - her name means love -,ted
"She loves her computer - she'll leave her big group, and her running water, and her trees and everything.",ted
"She's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans.",ted
"She does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them, but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn't like making mistakes.",ted
"And her concentration - she's already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again, just for the satisfaction of having done it better.",ted
"And the food is not important - she does get a tiny reward, like one raisin for a correct response - but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand.",ted
"Anyway, David Greybeard - and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest.",ted
And not only that - he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves - modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose - the beginning of tool-making.,ted
"The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time, it was thought that humans, and only humans, used and made tools.",ted
"When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.",ted
"So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news, he said, Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,' or accept chimpanzees as humans.",ted
"We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.",ted
"Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa, wherever chimps have been studied, there are completely different tool-using behaviors.",ted
"And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice - that is a definition of human culture.",ted
"It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human.",ted
"The importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible - and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society.",ted
"The long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother, with the brothers and sisters, and which can last through a lifetime, which may be up to 60 years.",ted
"They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity, so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far.",ted
"Sometimes they hunt - not that often, but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation, and they share the prey.",ted
"We find that they show emotions, similar to - maybe sometimes the same - as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair.",ted
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors - self as opposed to other.,ted
"They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.",ted
"But this teaches us a new respect - and it's a new respect not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest, but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet.",ted
"So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees - who've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility - are in the wild, disappearing very fast.",ted
They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well.,ted
"The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land.",ted
They're disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear-cutting.,ted
"And this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world, to what is known as the bush-meat trade.",ted
"They shoot everything, every single thing that moves that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it.",ted
And now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it.,ted
"And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called, than for domestic meat - it's culturally preferred.",ted
They're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money.,ted
"Their culture is being destroyed, along with the animals upon whom they depend.",ted
"So, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left.",ted
"We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity, and I've seen it happening with my own eyes.",ted
"And the grim picture in Africa - I love Africa, and what do we see in Africa?",ted
"Were the people that we heard about yesterday, on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree - were they stupid?",ted
"Of course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn't a question of Let's leave the tree for tomorrow.",ted
"Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer, and then we'll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end.",ted
"The one thing we have, which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures, is this sophisticated spoken language - a language with which we can tell children about things that aren't here.",ted
"We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future, discuss ideas with each other, so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group.",ted
We can do it by talking to each other; we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word.,ted
"And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards, and we're destroying the world.",ted
"In the developed world, in a way, it's worse, because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we're doing.",ted
"Do you know, we're bringing little babies into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them?",ted
"And the air is harming them, and the food that's grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them.",ted
And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere.,ted
Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago?,ted
"And so many of these diseases, like asthma and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped.",ted
"As I was traveling around the world, you know, I had to leave the forest -",ted
"I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because, finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now",ted
"And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope.",ted
"Well, it doesn't matter what we do; eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.",ted
Everything is hopeless - we're always being told so by the media.,ted
"And then I met some who were angry, and anger that can turn to violence, and we're all familiar with that.",ted
"And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren, and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age.",ted
"I feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania, I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots.",ted
"There's little brochures all around outside, and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future, I beg that you pick up that brochure.",ted
"Shoots seem tiny, but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls.",ted
See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet.,ted
"Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through, and can make this a better world.",ted
And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference.,ted
"So, the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects.",ted
And these are projects to make the world around them a better place.,ted
One project to show care and concern for your own human community.,ted
And the third kind of project: something for the local environment.,ted
It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural.,ted
"It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in.",ted
"We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York.",ted
"Because they're buying into it, and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do.",ted
"It isn't something that their parents tell them, or their teachers tell them.",ted
"That's effective, but if they decide themselves, We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there.",ted
We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden.,ted
We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories.,ted
"You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me.",ted
"As I travel around the world 300 days a year, everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages.",ted
"And now comes the technology into it, because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world.",ted
"But also - and this is so important - to communicate their despair, to say, We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?",ted
"And then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel, saying,",ted
"Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture.",ted
Hard work and persistence -don't give up - and love and compassion leading to respect for all life.,ted
"Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two.",ted
"Anyway - so basically, Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people's lives.",ted
"And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact, not just because you can share technology with us, but because so many of you have children.",ted
"And if you take this program out, and give it to your children, they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good, because they've got parents like you.",ted
And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place.,ted
But the kids do ask me - and this won't take more than two minutes,ted
"Firstly, the human brain - I don't need to say anything about that.",ted
"Now that we know what the problems are around the world, human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems.",ted
"We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life.",ted
"We can see a whole area desolated, and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help.",ted
"And thirdly, the last speaker talked about - or the speaker before last, talked about the indomitable human spirit.",ted
We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible.,ted
Even after the 11th of September - and I was in New York,ted
"And just after that a woman brought me this little bell, and I want to end on this note.",ted
"She said, If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this.",ted
"So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?",ted
It's in your hands and my hands and those of our children.,ted
It's really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager.,ted
"Today I want to talk to you about the future, but first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past.",ted
"My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp.",ted
"And she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split.",ted
And somehow - we don't really know exactly the whole story - but the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp.,ted
"And when my mother was two years old, the Hungarian revolution was raging, and they decided to escape Hungary.",ted
"They got on a boat, and yet another divergence - the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia.",ted
"They got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada.",ted
"So, to make a long story short, they came to Canada.",ted
"She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto, and at 44 she died of stomach cancer.",ted
"I never met my grandmother, but I carry on her name - her exact name, Eva Vertes - and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too.",ted
"I found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old.",ted
My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon.,ted
And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called The Hot Zone.,ted
"There was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover, and I just wanted to read it.",ted
"So from that moment on, I read every medical book I could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much.",ted
"Maybe now, you know - being a big high school kid - I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world.",ted
"I was 14, and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab.",ted
"But I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway?",ted
"And I got to go talk to one professor, Dr. Jacobs, who accepted me into the lab.",ted
"At that time, I was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology",ted
"And from then I wanted to look not at impairment, but at prevention of impairment.",ted
"I started reading about Alzheimer's and tried to familiarize myself with the research, and at the same time when I was in the - I was reading in the medical library one day, and",ted
"And being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought,",ted
"Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's which is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound - purine derivatives - that are promoting cell growth.",ted
"And so I thought, Maybe if it can promote cell growth, it can inhibit cell death, too.",ted
"So I presented those results at the International Science Fair, which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life.",ted
"And there I was awarded Best in the World in Medicine, which allowed me to get in, or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world.",ted
"And from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world, I wanted to explore it all.",ted
"I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that.",ted
And this is really what I want to talk to you about today - about cancer.,ted
"At first when I heard of cancer stem cells, I didn't really know how to put the two together.",ted
"I'd heard of stem cells, and I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future - the therapy of many diseases to come in the future, perhaps.",ted
"But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time, so how did the good and bad go together?",ted
"Last summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells.",ted
"And while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature, trying to - again - familiarize myself with this new medical field.",ted
"The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it.",ted
"If you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises.",ted
"If you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs.",ted
"And it was really interesting - there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises.",ted
Because what stem cells are - they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue.,ted
"So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ",ted
"And the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged, we need to repair the lung.",ted
And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair - because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue.,ted
"But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response, but can't quite control it.",ted
It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated.,ted
And I really think that we can't think about cancer - let alone any disease - in such black-and-white terms.,ted
"If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation, we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it.",ted
It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point.,ted
"We're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix.",ted
"If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate - to become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue, whatever that cancer has been put there to do - it would be a repair process.",ted
"But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart, or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter.",ted
"And skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body, or over 50 percent of our body.",ted
"Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer - at least not that I know of.",ted
"So, I looked further into it, found as many articles as I could, and it was amazing - because it turned out that it was very rare.",ted
"Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer, but of metastases going to skeletal muscle.",ted
And what metastases are is when the tumor - when a piece - breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ.,ted
"If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it, or somehow - you know, it's contained.",ted
"But once it starts moving throughout the body, that's when it becomes deadly.",ted
"So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles, but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle - there seemed to be something here.",ted
"So these articles were saying, you know, Skeletal - metastasis to skeletal muscle - is very rare.",ted
"At first - the first thing I did was I emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said, Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle.",ted
And a lot of the replies I got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue.,ted
"Meaning that you have muscle cells, but they're not dividing, so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack.",ted
"But then again, this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely.",ted
"And furthermore, that nervous tissue - brain - gets cancer, and brain cells are also terminally differentiated.",ted
"I guess, my hypotheses that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami.",ted
And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers.,ted
"But I know that in science, once you get the answers, inevitably you're going to have more questions.",ted
So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life.,ted
"Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle, there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle.",ted
And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells.,ted
"And you think, the more highways there are in a tissue, the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases.",ted
"So first of all I thought, you know, Wouldn't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle?",ted
"And as well, cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis, which is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow.",ted
"Without angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful.",ted
So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer.,ted
It's the one portion of our body - our heart's always beating.,ted
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply?,ted
"It needs to be constantly contracting, so therefore it's almost selfish.",ted
"Therefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue, it can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.",ted
"And another thing that's really interesting is that there's this whole - the way tumors move throughout the body, it's a very complex system - and there's something called the chemokine network.",ted
"And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants, and they're the stop and go signals for cancer.",ted
"So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors, and another organ - a distant organ somewhere in the body - will have the corresponding chemokines, and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it.",ted
Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules?,ted
"And the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle - there's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured, that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle.",ted
"I mean, there are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle.",ted
"But it seems like by investigating, by attacking cancer, by searching where cancer is not, there has got to be something - there's got to be something",ted
"And what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells.",ted
"So this compound, MyoD, has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells.",ted
"Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells, and this is why it seems as if it is so rare.",ted
"If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way, cancer occurred - I mean, everybody would have cancer almost.",ted
"I really believe that the human body is very, very smart, and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do.",ted
It's different when a bacteria comes into the body - that's a foreign object - we want that out.,ted
"But when the body is actually initiating a process and we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is the right solution.",ted
"So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched, that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy.",ted
A tumor - put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells?,ted
"That's a very far-fetched idea, but I really believe that it may be possible.",ted
"These cells are so versatile, these cancer cells are so versatile - we just have to manipulate them in the right way.",ted
"And again, some of these may be far-fetched, but I figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas, it's here at TED, so thank you very much.",ted
"Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments, and I realized that I almost became a scientist.",ted
"So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator, and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker",ted
And the glass - luckily I turned around - I had it all in my back,ted
FG: People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay.,ted
"The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous, Frank Gehry.",ted
"And Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.",ted
"I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect, to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.",ted
"And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs, whatever they were, were very big.",ted
You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent on working for somebody.,ted
A lot of us work for people; we're in the hands of other people.,ted
And that's one of the great dilemmas - we're in a creativity session - it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity: how to do work,ted
"And you've achieved that and that makes your win doubly big, triply big.",ted
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.,ted
"And when I started out, I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff.",ted
"And I realized when I'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff, and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars.",ted
"And actually, it was responding to clients that I had who didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much.",ted
"Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife.",ted
We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like 50 grand,ted
"I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer, out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.",ted
"We were standing out in the desert all alone and, thinking about my house, he said, Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent, somewhere in 2000 years",ted
"Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money, so the stuff was a little more permanent.",ted
"But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long, this guy was telling us the other day.",ted
"I approach each project with a new insecurity, almost like the first project I ever did, and I get the sweats",ted
"When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.",ted
"Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence that it's going to be OK.",ted
And like the playwright said the other day - I could relate to him: you're not sure.,ted
They weren't mistakes; I saw everything that I would have changed and I was embarrassed by it.,ted
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?,ted
"Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me, and I thought he was nuts.",ted
"I didn't think he knew what he was doing, and he pulled it off.",ted
"So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.",ted
"September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero, and I'm totally against that.",ted
"How much further along is it than that, and when will that be finished?",ted
"That will be finished in 2003 - September, October - and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys come play with us at that place.",ted
"Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.",ted
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me.,ted
There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients.,ted
"If you think about the world, and even just in this audience, most of us are involved with buildings.",ted
"And so to find one, a guy like that, you hang on to him.",ted
"He's become the head of Art Center, and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.",ted
I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal:,ted
Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.,ted
"I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work, and his early work had a resemblance to my early work.",ted
"When I came out of college, I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California, and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that.",ted
"I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it, but it didn't feel good to me.",ted
"Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.",ted
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building.,ted
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.,ted
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you.,ted
"I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra, who doesn't think architecture is art.",ted
It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians - it's similar to,ted
"And I think for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city.",ted
"No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos, right?",ted
"Like the Rockefeller Center model, which is kind of from another era.",ted
"My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building, you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.",ted
"That was the surprise of going across the river, of going on the highway around it, of walking down the street and finding it.",ted
"But you know, Richard, most architects when they present their work - most of the people we know, you get up and you talk about your work, and it's almost",ted
"I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.",ted
"If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.",ted
The MIT project - they were interviewing me for MIT and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.,ted
"There wasn't a bloody leak in the place, it was just fantastic.",ted
"You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story, when the woman called and said, Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head.",ted
"OK, you solved all the problems, you did all the stuff",ted
"And I think that's what I've always been interested in, is that - which is a personal kind of expression.",ted
"Bilbao, I think, shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city.",ted
"They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget, be polite, and they're missing out on the real value of an architect.",ted
"Usually I say no right away, but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned",ted
And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in Malaga.,ted
"Just before going to lunch with the mayor, we went to the harbor commissioner.",ted
"It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here, and I was here, and my guys.",ted
"We sat down, and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet.",ted
"And the guy looked at me and said, Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?",ted
"I said to my team, Let's get out of here.",ted
"They just brought us there to hustle this group, you know, to create a project.",ted
"Luckily, I'm old enough that I can complain I can't travel.",ted
"Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it's been very long.",ted
"Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories, only to find out that you're a performance artist.",ted
"I'm also a software engineer, and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer.",ted
And I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression.,ted
"Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible, you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on.",ted
I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project.,ted
I did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths.,ted
And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica; we repeated it in England.,ted
And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen.,ted
We used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were.,ted
"He's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound.",ted
"Well, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it.",ted
"I just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York, you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week, and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea.",ted
"And with that, I think I should give up the stage, so, thank you so much.",ted
"I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century, and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.",ted
"But I want to start with my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work.",ted
"What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner.",ted
"And so I want to tell you about that first, and then go on into where I think love is going.",ted
I think our ancestors - I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago.,ted
"The first thing that happens is, a person begins to take on what I call, special meaning.",ted
"As a truck driver once said to me, The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne.",ted
"You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.",ted
It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody,ted
Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party.,ted
"And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.",ted
"The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out.",ted
"He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me.",ted
"But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them.",ted
"As one Polynesian said, I felt like jumping in the sky.",ted
You feel intense elation when things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly.,ted
"As one businessman in New York said to me, Anything she liked, I liked.",ted
"You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually, you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else.",ted
"But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely sexually possessive of them.",ted
The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team.,ted
"But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving: an intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally.",ted
"It would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you.",ted
"The motor in the brain begins to crank, and you want this person.",ted
"Before I put these people in the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions.",ted
It was: What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?,ted
"And then, the very last question - I would always have to work myself up to this question, because I'm not a psychologist.",ted
I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation.,ted
"So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between.",ted
So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state.,ted
"In fact, one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine.",ted
"In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low.",ted
"It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.",ted
"The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work.",ted
"And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive.",ted
"You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, No, thank you, you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression.",ted
"But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it.",ted
"They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.",ted
"In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system.",ted
I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow.,ted
And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction.,ted
"W.H. Auden called it an intolerable neural itch, and indeed, that's what it is.",ted
"The second of these three brain systems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love.",ted
And the third brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.,ted
"And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners.",ted
You can feel it when you're just driving along in your car.,ted
"I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy.",ted
"And I think that attachment, the third brain system, evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being at least long enough to raise a child together as a team.",ted
"So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends.",ted
I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations.,ted
"For every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend.",ted
"We all know of them, but nevertheless - the Arabs say, The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on.",ted
"And I say back into the job market, because this is not new.",ted
"For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work to gather their vegetables.",ted
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.,ted
"And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men.",ted
"With the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful.",ted
"Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors, but then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market.",ted
"In short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.",ted
We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal.,ted
I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community.,ted
"I'll say just a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love.",ted
There's a lot of gender differences; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child.,ted
I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike.,ted
"There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common.",ted
"We are - in the words of Ted Hughes, I think that we are like two feet.",ted
And we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain.,ted
I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.,ted
"Women's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak.",ted
"But even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.",ted
They've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.,ted
"They held that baby in front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.",ted
"Even in places like India and Japan, where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market, they're moving into journalism.",ted
"Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producer who calls me, who negotiates what we're going to say, is a woman.",ted
"In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, To have a great writer is to have another government.",ted
Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women.,ted
"It's one of many, many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market.",ted
"We now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning.",ted
"Because the female parts of the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes.",ted
"They tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers.",ted
"Men tend to - and these are averages - tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous, focus on what they do, and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern.",ted
"In fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world.",ted
"And what I really think that we're doing is, we're moving towards a collaborative society, a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed.",ted
"But in fact, women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life.",ted
"I'm always astonished when people come to me and say, Why is it that men are so adulterous?",ted
"And I say, Who do you think these men are sleeping with?",ted
"They're now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the symmetrical marriage, or the pure marriage, or the companionate marriage.",ted
"This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.",ted
"People around the world, in a study of 37 societies, want to be in love with the person that they marry.",ted
"Indeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life.",ted
I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend.,ted
"The first one being women moving into the job market, the second one being the aging world population.",ted
"They're now saying that in America, that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85.",ted
"Because in that highest age category of 76 to 85, as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them.",ted
So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age.,ted
"For one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.",ted
"And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.",ted
"So the divorce rate right now is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline.",ted
"I would even say that with Viagra, estrogen replacement, hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women - women have never been as interesting as they are now.",ted
"Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable.",ted
"And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now.",ted
"These three brain systems - lust, romantic love and attachment - don't always go together.",ted
"Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with.",ted
"With orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin - those are associated with attachment.",ted
This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them.,ted
"But these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment, aren't always connected to each other.",ted
"You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else, while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners.",ted
"In short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time.",ted
"In fact, you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else.",ted
It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do.,ted
"So I don't think, honestly, we're an animal that was built to be happy; we are an animal that was built to reproduce.",ted
"And I think, however, we can make good relationships with each other.",ted
"I want to conclude with a worry, and with a wonderful story.",ted
Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States.,ted
"I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants, SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants - since she was 13.",ted
"I've got nothing against people who take them short term, when they're going through something horrible.",ted
But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term.,ted
"And indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin.",ted
"And by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit.",ted
"Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive.",ted
"And when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment.",ted
"And when you tamper with one brain system, you're going to tamper with another.",ted
I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place.,ted
I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years.,ted
I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike.,ted
"Why you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike.",ted
"And about a year ago, an Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them.",ted
It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another.,ted
That's my current project; it will be my next book.,ted
There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another.,ted
"You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious, in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain, probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love.",ted
"You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your love map, an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up.",ted
"And I also think that you gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.",ted
"I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too, the magic of it.",ted
It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one - probably a true story.,ted
It was a graduate student - I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues - Art Aron,ted
"And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student, and she was not in love with him.",ted
"And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody, you can drive up the dopamine in the brain, and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love.",ted
And he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him.,ted
"And sure enough - I've never been in one, but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks",ted
"He figured that this would drive up the dopamine, and she'd fall in love with him.",ted
So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time.,ted
"An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw, and she throws her hands up",ted
"But I will end by saying that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives: the sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner.",ted
They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called this mortal coil.,ted
It is a thrill to be here at a conference that's devoted to Inspired by Nature - you can imagine.,ted
"Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters, which is the Western Grebe.",ted
You haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance.,ted
"I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park, which is a long, skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it, and my partner and I have a rowing shell.",ted
"And so we were rowing, and one of these Western Grebes came along.",ted
"And what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together, the two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater.",ted
"And so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly.",ted
"And this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect, and started to run along the water next to us, in a courtship dance - for miles.",ted
"It would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start.",ted
Or - and this is the fun part for me - we want you to take us out into the natural world.,ted
"We'll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us.",ted
So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater.,ted
"And some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there.",ted
"What they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry.",ted
"And we said, well, that's not exactly being inspired by nature.",ted
"This is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it.",ted
"Give me a design challenge, sustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable.",ted
"And they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes.",ted
"And then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins, or we have to dig them up.",ted
So if we had some way to stop this scaling - and so I picked up some shells on the beach.,ted
"And I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate.",ted
"They didn't know that what a seashell is, it's templated by proteins, and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell.",ted
"So the same sort of a process, without the proteins, is happening on the inside of their pipes.",ted
This is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration.,ted
"So one of them thought about it and said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater - self-assembly",ted
"And I said, well, in the same way that they exude a protein",ted
"And, in fact, there is a product called TPA that's mimicked that protein - that stop-protein - and it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes.",ted
"From then on, you could not get these engineers back in the boat.",ted
"The first day they would take a hike, and it was, click, click, click, click.",ted
They would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel.,ted
What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve.,ted
Learning about the natural world is one thing; learning from the natural world - that's the switch.,ted
What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere; they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world.,ted
The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context.,ted
And the context is the Earth - the same context that we're trying to solve our problems in.,ted
"So there's computers that protect themselves, like an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation and biological development.",ted
"And we're learning from neural nets, genetic algorithms, evolutionary computing.",ted
"But what's interesting to me is that we haven't looked at this, as much.",ted
"I mean, these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in Silicon Valley.",ted
So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success.,ted
"So what can we learn about making - not just computers, but everything?",ted
"The plane you came in, cars, the seats that you're sitting on.",ted
"How do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world?",ted
"More importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years?",ted
And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has.,ted
"It's called heat, beat and treat - that's what material scientists call it.",ted
"And it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product.",ted
You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures; you use chemicals.,ted
And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily.,ted
"By adding information to matter, it gives it a function that's different than without that structure.",ted
Because life doesn't really deal in things; there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems.,ted
"As I'm reading more and more now, and following the story, there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences.",ted
"And at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are.",ted
"What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture, to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in?",ted
"I'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly.",ted
Back to that shell: the shell is a self-assembling material.,ted
On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater.,ted
"It's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough.",ted
"But what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns, it happens in seawater.",ted
"It happens near, in and near, the organism's body.",ted
A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process.,ted
"Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell, to a solar cell, onto a roof, and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light.",ted
Here's an interesting one for the IT world: bio-silicon.,ted
"And so silicon, which we make right now - it's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips - this is a bio-mineralization process that's now being mimicked.",ted
"Imagine being able to - and, again, it's a templated process, and it solidifies out of a liquid process - imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature.",ted
"On the left, this is a brittle star; it's covered with lenses that the people at Lucent Technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever.",ted
It's one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of.,ted
"And there's many of them, all over its entire body.",ted
"What's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles.",ted
"A woman named Joanna Aizenberg, at Lucent, is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create these sort of lenses.",ted
"Down at the very base of it, there's fiber optics that work better than ours, actually, to move light, but you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible.",ted
"A guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself, you know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time.",ted
"Plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose, right, out of CO2.",ted
He's found a way - he's found a catalyst - and he's found a way to take CO2 and make it into polycarbonates.,ted
"There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU.",ted
"In our fuel cells, we do it with platinum; life does it with a very, very common iron.",ted
And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase.,ted
That's very exciting for fuel cells - to be able to do that without platinum.,ted
We've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them.,ted
"And those little bumps actually increase efficiency in, for instance, the edge of an airplane - increase efficiency by about 32 percent.",ted
"Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings, if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing.",ted
"Light comes through, it bounces back off the layers; it's called thin-film interference.",ted
Imagine being able to self-assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color.,ted
"Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface, so that it's self-cleaning with just water.",ted
"That's a ball of water, and those are dirt particles.",ted
And that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf.,ted
"There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics -",ted
"Water is going to be our big, grand challenge: quenching thirst.",ted
The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog.,ted
"The one on the right is a pill bug - pulls water out of air, does not drink fresh water.",ted
"Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta, before it gets into a building, are key technologies.",ted
"What if we were to say, no more hard rock mining?",ted
"What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams, small amounts of metals in water?",ted
That's what microbes do; they chelate metals out of water.,ted
There's a company here in San Francisco called MR3 that is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters to mine waste streams.,ted
This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider.,ted
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book.,ted
"It's not easy, because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table.",ted
"To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table, and create miracle materials like that cell, is the task of green chemistry.",ted
"Timed degradation: packaging that is good until you don't want it to be good anymore, and dissolves on cue.",ted
"That's a mussel you can find in the waters out here, and the threads holding it to a rock are timed; at exactly two years, they begin to dissolve.",ted
There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients.,ted
And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken; what's called the cold chain gets broken.,ted
"A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade - which dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months and months and months, and is able to regenerate itself.",ted
And he found a way to dry out vaccines - encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells - meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated.,ted
"This is a session about water - learning about organisms that can do without water, in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration.",ted
"When they're involved in foreplay, they're thinking about something very, very important - and that's having their genetic material remain, 10,000 generations from now.",ted
And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring.,ted
"Luckily, there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas.",ted
"Chris Anderson: Talk about foreplay, I - we need to get to 12, but really quickly.",ted
"Just like, you know, like the 10-second version of 10, 11 and 12.",ted
"Because we just - your slides are so gorgeous, and the ideas are so big",ted
"There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer, and yet they don't collide with one another.",ted
There's a person at Newcastle who has figured out that it's a very large neuron.,ted
And she's actually figuring out how to make a collision-avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust.,ted
Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life.,ted
"In ensemble, that's what whole ecosystems do: they create more and more opportunities for life.",ted
"I mean, it looks simple because the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out.",ted
"That is, those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places, are not around to tell us about it.",ted
It builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water; it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live.,ted
And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs.,ted
"We have to find a way to meet our needs, while making of this place an Eden.",ted
"I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life.",ted
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.,ted
"And I've since then tried to keep technology at arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.",ted
"At the same time, I run a website on cool tools, where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.",ted
"So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature, as it relates to the spiritual.",ted
This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.,ted
It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.,ted
I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.,ted
He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.,ted
So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about.,ted
Danny Hillis actually has an update on that - he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.,ted
"Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.",ted
"And as I struggled to understand that, I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations.",ted
"And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.",ted
The question that I came up with was this question: what does technology want?,ted
"And by that, I don't mean, does it want chocolate or vanilla?",ted
"By what it wants, I mean, what are its inherent trends and biases?",ted
"One way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.",ted
"And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say, to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.",ted
"And I'm applying a similar trick to say, what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology?",ted
"Obviously, this in an incomplete question, just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it.",ted
"So I'm attempting to say, if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?",ted
"And I think once we ask that question we have to go back, actually, to life.",ted
"Because obviously, if we keep extending the origins of technology far back, I think we come back to life at some point.",ted
"So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.",ted
"And like you heard from the previous speakers, we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.",ted
Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.,ted
Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth.,ted
"And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects, just to see what's on life.",ted
"And if we did that with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth, we would begin to see some incredible species.",ted
This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.,ted
I can't think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.,ted
It's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.,ted
"These are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus, six kingdoms.",ted
"Six different broad approaches: the plants, the animals, the fungi, the protests - the little things - the bacteria and the Archaea bacteria.",ted
"But a more interesting way, the current way to take the long view, is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.",ted
"And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.",ted
"So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth.",ted
"You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.",ted
But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.,ted
They've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here.,ted
"But we see that each one of these is actually hacking, and has a different way of finding out how to do life.",ted
"And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say, what does evolution want?",ted
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we don't find life.,ted
"We find life at the bottom of every long-term, long-distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up - and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.",ted
More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life.,ted
We see the movement from a general-purpose cell to the more specific and specialized.,ted
"And actually, we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.",ted
One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability.,ted
And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.,ted
Like those chloroplast cells - they're completely surrounded by other life.,ted
"And so the general, long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization, complexity and socialization.",ted
"Now, I took that and said, OK, what are the long-term trends in technology?",ted
"And so, remarkably, I discovered that there's also a drift toward specialization.",ted
"That we see there's a general hammer, and hammers become more and more specific over time.",ted
"I actually had my daughter - gave her a tally counter, and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household.",ted
"I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII, had only about 7,000 items in his household.",ted
"And he was the King of England, and that was the entire wealth of England at the time.",ted
So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.,ted
This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out and he sees machines making machines.,ted
"Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.",ted
"Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non-technology, or even life.",ted
"And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche.",ted
So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution.,ted
"The same drives that we see towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization, towards complexity.",ted
"That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor, you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.",ted
"I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.",ted
That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.,ted
"And so it would be sort of approximately up there, coming out of the animal kingdom.",ted
"And if we were to do that, we would find out - we could actually approach technology in this way.",ted
He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium.,ted
He has one of the world's largest collections - about 500 of them.,ted
"And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails, and to do a morphological analysis, and try to derive their genealogical history over time.",ted
"But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom, those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made.",ted
"When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.",ted
"And it turns out that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree, and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system.",ted
"In fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology.",ted
"And it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die.",ted
"So I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said, Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars?",ted
"In fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.",ted
And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile.,ted
"And the thing that I liked is sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button - - for buying steam valves.",ted
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.,ted
And I took a page - not quite a random page - I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made.,ted
I want to know how many of these things are still in production.,ted
"Be it corn shellers - you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills; all these things - and these are not, again, antiques.",ted
"In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.",ted
"And in fact, what's important is that this information actually never died out.",ted
"And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.",ted
"Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard.",ted
"And it turns out that the time, the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited, is decreasing over time.",ted
"And that basically, you can delay technology, but you can't kill it.",ted
"So this makes sense, because in a certain sense what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.",ted
"So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically, the evolution of evolvability.",ted
"So what's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks, are increasing.",ted
And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.,ted
"And then what we see in the singularity, that prophesized by Kurzweil and others - his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.",ted
"So if you have life hacking - life means hacking, the game of survival - then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.",ted
"A finite game is play to win, and an infinite game is played to keep playing.",ted
"The origins of technology was not in 1829, but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang, and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed.",ted
"The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot, and it was so tight",ted
"And at the Big Bang, what it expanded was the potential for difference.",ted
"So as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices, opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.",ted
"That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.",ted
"And so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.",ted
And that's why we continue to grab technology - because we want those things.,ted
"And each time we make a new opportunity place, we're allowing a platform to make new ones.",ted
Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented - what a loss to society there would be.,ted
Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints.,ted
"Somewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented.",ted
We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference.,ted
I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.,ted
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies.,ted
Maybe in some ways the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.,ted
"It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields, but it's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.",ted
All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology.,ted
It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.,ted
"And it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.",ted
"And so when I think about what technology wants, I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here - and",ted
And your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is.,ted
"And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved, so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.",ted
And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game.,ted
And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are.,ted
"I think I was supposed to talk about my new book, which is called Blink, and it's about snap judgments and first impressions.",ted
"And it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.",ted
"But I was thinking about this, and I realized that although my new book makes me happy, and I think would make my mother happy, it's not really about happiness.",ted
"Now, I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is, although at some point in my life, I dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics.",ted
"And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard, and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains, New York.",ted
We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect drink.,ted
"Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer, and that's what Howard thought.",ted
"Because Pepsi told him, We're working with a band between eight and 12 percent.",ted
Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough; anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet.,ted
We want to know: what's the sweet spot between 8 and 12?,ted
"Now, if I gave you this problem to do, you would all say, it's very simple.",ted
"Howard does the experiment, and he gets the data back, and he plots it on a curve, and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve.",ted
"Now, most people in that business, in the world of testing food and such, are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess.",ted
"They think, Well, you know, figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy.",ted
"You know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way.",ted
"You know, let's just make an educated guess, and they simply point and they go for 10 percent, right in the middle.",ted
"And this was not good enough for him, and this question bedeviled him for years.",ted
"And he would think it through and say, What was wrong?",ted
Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?,ted
"And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him.",ted
"And that is, that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data, they were asking the wrong question.",ted
"They were looking for the perfect Pepsi, and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis.",ted
This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science.,ted
"Howard immediately went on the road, and he would go to conferences around the country, and he would stand up and say, You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi.",ted
"And people would look at him blankly and say, What are you talking about?",ted
"Tried to get business, nobody would hire him - he was obsessed, though, and he talked about it and talked about it.",ted
"Howard loves the Yiddish expression To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish.",ted
"Vlasic Pickles came to him, and they said, Doctor Moskowitz, we want to make the perfect pickle.",ted
"And he said, There is no perfect pickle; there are only perfect pickles.",ted
"In fact, Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation.",ted
"Campbell's made Prego, and Prego, in the early 80s, was struggling next to RagГ№, which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s.",ted
"In the industry - I don't know whether you care about this, or how much time I have to go into this.",ted
"But it was, technically speaking - this is an aside - Prego is a better tomato sauce than RagГ№.",ted
The quality of the tomato paste is much better; the spice mix is far superior; it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way.,ted
"In fact, they would do the famous bowl test back in the 70s with RagГ№ and Prego.",ted
"You'd have a plate of spaghetti, and you would pour it on, right?",ted
"And the RagГ№ would all go to the bottom, and the Prego would sit on top.",ted
"And, anyway, despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence, and the quality of their tomato paste, Prego was struggling.",ted
"So they came to Howard, and they said, fix us.",ted
"And Howard looked at their product line, and he said, what you have is a dead tomato society.",ted
"And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen, and he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce.",ted
"Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce, he varied spaghetti sauce.",ted
"And then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces, and he went on the road.",ted
"He went to New York, to Chicago, he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.",ted
"And he sat them down for two hours, and over the course of that two hours, he gave them ten bowls.",ted
"Ten small bowls of pasta, with a different spaghetti sauce on each one.",ted
"And after they ate each bowl, they had to rate, from 0 to 100, how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was.",ted
"At the end of that process, after doing it for months and months, he had a mountain of data about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce.",ted
"Instead, he looked at the data, and he said, let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters.",ted
"And sure enough, if you sit down, and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce, you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups.",ted
There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain; there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy; and there are people who like it extra chunky.,ted
"And Prego turned to Howard, and they said, You're telling me that one third of Americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs?",ted
"And Prego then went back, and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce, and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country.",ted
"And over the next 10 years, they made 600 million dollars off their line of extra-chunky sauces.",ted
"Everyone else in the industry looked at what Howard had done, and they said, Oh my god!",ted
"And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar, and 14 different kinds of mustard, and 71 different kinds of olive oil.",ted
"And then eventually even RagГ№ hired Howard, and Howard did the exact same thing for RagГ№ that he did for Prego.",ted
"And today, if you go to a really good supermarket, do you know how many RagГ№s there are?",ted
"In six varieties: Cheese, Light, Robusto, Rich &amp; Hearty, Old World Traditional - Extra-Chunky Garden.",ted
What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy.,ted
"Assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat, what will make people happy, is to ask them.",ted
"And for years and years and years, RagГ№ and Prego would have focus groups, and they would sit you down, and they would say, What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?",ted
"And for all those years - 20, 30 years - through all those focus group sessions, no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.",ted
"Even though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did.",ted
"As Howard loves to say, The mind knows not what the tongue wants.",ted
"And a critically important step in understanding our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want, deep down.",ted
"If I asked all of you, for example, in this room, what you want in a coffee, you know what you'd say?",ted
"Every one of you would say, I want a dark, rich, hearty roast.",ted
"What percentage of you actually like a dark, rich, hearty roast?",ted
"According to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you.",ted
"But you will never, ever say to someone who asks you what you want that I want a milky, weak coffee.",ted
Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize - it's another very critical point - he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call horizontal segmentation.,ted
"In particular, they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon.",ted
"Much more volatile brown mustard seed, some white wine, a nose hit, much more delicate aromatics.",ted
"They put it in a little tiny glass jar, with a wonderful enameled label on it, made it look French, even though it's made in Oxnard, California.",ted
"And instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight-ounce bottle, the way that French's and Gulden's did, they decided to charge four dollars.",ted
"With the guy in the Rolls Royce, eating the Grey Poupon.",ted
"Another pulls up, and says, Do you have any Grey Poupon?",ted
"And the whole thing, after they did that, Grey Poupon takes off!",ted
"And everyone's take-home lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive, something to aspire to.",ted
"It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now, and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy.",ted
"Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane.",ted
There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people.,ted
"And for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks.",ted
"Third thing that Howard did, and perhaps the most important, is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish.",ted
"For the longest time in the food industry, there was a sense that there was one way, a perfect way, to make a dish.",ted
"You go to Chez Panisse, they give you the red-tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something",ted
Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi.,ted
"And she serves it that way time and time again, and if you quarrel with her, she will say, You know what?",ted
This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant.,ted
"When we talked about authentic tomato sauce in the 1970s, we talked about Italian tomato sauce, we talked about the earliest RagГ№s, which had no visible solids, right?",ted
"Which were thin, you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta.",ted
"In other words, people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals.",ted
"And it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals, because all of science, through the 19th century and much of the 20th, was obsessed with universals.",ted
"Psychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave.",ted
"What is the great revolution in science of the last 10, 15 years?",ted
It is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability.,ted
"Now in medical science, we don't want to know, necessarily, just how cancer works, we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer.",ted
"What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce.",ted
"And for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks.",ted
"I'll give you one last illustration of variability, and that is -",ted
"If I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee - a type of coffee, a brew - that made all of you happy,",ted
"The difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between coffee that makes you wince, and coffee that makes you deliriously happy.",ted
"That is the final, and I think most beautiful lesson, of Howard Moskowitz: that in embracing the diversity of human beings, we will find a surer way to true happiness.",ted
"Being on the same stage as Al Gore, who was the first person I ever voted for.",ted
"And - So I was getting pretty nervous and, you know,",ted
"I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage, and that's more nerve-racking.",ted
"I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather, and I realized that I had all of these Teds going through my bloodstream - that I had to consider this my element.",ted
"And because I wanted to impress you all with slides, since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs, I made a graph that moves, and I talk about the makeup of me.",ted
"So, besides this freakish thing, this is my science slide.",ted
"This is math, and this is science, this is genetics.",ted
"This is my grandmother, and this is where I get this mouth.",ted
"So - I'm a blogger, which, probably, to a lot of you, means different things.",ted
"You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha, where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen, and it spread all over.",ted
"Kryptonite had to adjust the lock, and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns.",ted
"You may have heard about Rathergate, which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the th in 111 is not typeset on an old typewriter; it's on Word.",ted
"But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media, and these are great examples.",ted
"These people are reaching thousands, if not millions, of readers, and that's incredibly important.",ted
"During the hurricane, you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog, updating it frequently.",ted
"You have my friend, who has a blog on PVRs, personal recorders.",ted
"He makes enough money just by running ads, to support his family up in Oregon.",ted
"That's all he does now, and this is something that blogs have made possible.",ted
It's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it.,ted
"Children with cleft palates get it, and they document their story.",ted
"I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing, and I am an expert on this person, and so I write about it.",ted
"So, the short story about my blog: it started in 2001, I was 23.",ted
"I wasn't happy with my job, because I was a designer, but I wasn't being really stimulated.",ted
"I didn't have any use for it, but I missed writing.",ted
"And when I started my blog, it was really this one goal -",ted
"I said, I am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet.",ted
"I said, I'm going to win an award, because I had never won an award in my entire life.",ted
"And I said, I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award.",ted
"I reached all of these people, and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day.",ted
"I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo - a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money.",ted
And I don't play instruments; I don't know anything about music.,ted
"I like music, and I like banjos, and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing, and I said, I could do that.",ted
"And I said to my husband, Ben, can I buy a banjo?",ted
"And my husband - this is my husband, who is very hot - he won an award for being hot.",ted
"And I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him, he was such a tyrant - he would not let me buy this banjo.",ted
"And those people who know me understood my joke - this is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people.",ted
"Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant, this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog.",ted
And if he knew I was showing this right now - I put this in today - he would kill me.,ted
"But the thing was, my friends read it, and they're like, Oh, that Mena, she wrote a post about wanting a stupid thing and being stupid.",ted
"I've been with him since I was 17, we've never had a separate bank account.",ted
And I realized: I don't want to reach these people.,ted

"These are out there, but it's more of the personal that interests me, and this is who I am.",ted
"You see Norman Rockwell, and you have art critics say, Norman Rockwell is not art.",ted
"Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms, and this is not something to be considered high art.",ted
And I think this is one of the most important things to us as humans.,ted
These are the blogs that interest me: the people that just tell stories.,ted
"One story is about this baby, and his name is Odin.",ted
"And he was writing his blog one day, and his wife gave birth to her baby at 25 weeks.",ted
"One day, it was normal; the next day, it was hell.",ted
"His baby is so small, and I've never encountered such a - just - a disturbing image, but just so heartfelt.",ted
That's not something you're going to see in a paper or magazine,ted
"That's not a huge amount of people reading, but 28 people matter.",ted
"We talked about the WELL, and about all these sorts of things throughout our online history.",ted
"But I think blogs are basically just an evolution, and that's where we are today.",ted
"You have your Google search, where you say, What is Mena Trott?",ted
"But then you also find people's blogs, and those are the records of people that are writing daily - not necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them.",ted
"And we talk about the world flattens, being in this panel, and I am very optimistic - whenever I think about blogs, I'm like",ted
"We're getting into China, we want to be there, but there are so many people that won't have the access to write a blog.",ted
"But to see something like the $100 computer is amazing, because blogging software is simple.",ted
"We have a successful company because of timing, and because of perseverance, but it's simple stuff -",ted
So - the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important.,ted
But this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my direct line.,ted
"I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before, and this one, I grew up with, looking at constantly.",ted
"I would spend hours looking at the connections, saying, Oh, the little kid up at the top has red hair; so does that first generation up there.",ted
"This is not science, but this was enough for me to be really interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line.",ted
"I have this record, this 1910 census, of another Grabowski -",ted
"This is all I have, a couple of facts about somebody.",ted
"I have their date of birth, their age, what they did in their household, if they spoke English, and that's it,",ted
"And it's pretty sad, because I only go back five generations, and that's it.",ted
"I don't even know what happens on my mom's side, because she's from Cuba",ted
"Another photo that has greatly influenced me, or a series of photos, is this project that's done by an Argentinean man and his wife.",ted
"And he's basically taking a picture of his family every day for the past, what is '76?",ted
"There was a joke, originally, about my graph that I left out, which is: You see all this math?",ted
"I'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100, because that's my skill set.",ted
"So you have these people aging, and now this is them today, or last year.",ted
"And that's a powerful thing to have, to be able to track this.",ted
"I know that one day my children will be wondering - or my grandchildren, or my great-grandchildren, if I ever have children - what I am going to - who I was.",ted
"I am a blogger - that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time every day.",ted
I take a picture of myself - I've been doing this since last year - every single day.,ted
"And, you know, it's the same picture; it's basically the same person.",ted
"I don't write this for this audience; I'm showing it now, but I would go insane if this was really public.",ted
"About four people probably read it, and they tell me, You haven't updated.",ted
I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated.,ted
"But this is amazing, because I can go back to a day - to April 2005, and say, what was I doing this day?",ted
It's this visual cue that is so important to what we do.,ted
"I put the bad pictures up too, because there are bad pictures.",ted
And I remember instantly: I am in Germany in this - I had to go for a one-day trip.,ted
"I was sick, and I was in a hotel room, and I wanted not to be there.",ted
"And so you see these things, it's not just always smiling.",ted
"If you look at my driver's license, I have the same look, and it's a pretty disturbing thing, but it's something that is really important.",ted
"And the last story I really want to tell is this story, because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I'm doing.",ted
"I'll probably get choked up, because I tend to when I talk about this.",ted
"So, this woman, her name was Emma, and she was a blogger on our service, TypePad.",ted
"She was writing and writing, and we all started reading it, because we had so few blogs on the service, we could keep track of everyone.",ted
"And she was writing one day, and then she disappeared for a little bit.",ted
"And her sister came on, and she said that Emma had passed away.",ted
"And all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional, and it was a very hard day at the company.",ted
"And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship, and flattening this sort of world.",ted
"But the big thing that really influenced us was, her sister wrote to me, and she said -",ted
"I'm Michael Shermer, director of the Skeptics Society, publisher of Skeptic magazine.",ted
"And unless you've been on Mars recently, you know there's a lot of that out there.",ted
"Some people call us debunkers, which is kind of a negative term.",ted
"But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk.",ted
"We are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there - well, we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas, trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas.",ted
"I brought this with me, this was given to us by NBC Dateline to test.",ted
This was being sold to high-school administrators for $900 apiece.,ted
It's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it.,ted
"You could dowse for all sorts of things, but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers.",ted
"So the way it works is you go down the hallway, and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker,",ted
"Well, this is science, so we'll do a controlled experiment.",ted
"Sir, do you want to empty your pockets, please, sir?",ted
"So the question was, can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers?",ted
"And the answer is, if you open enough of them, yes.",ted
"But in science, we have to keep track of the misses, not just the hits.",ted
"And that's probably the key lesson to my short talk here: This is how psychics work, astrologers, tarot card readers and so on.",ted
"In science, we keep the whole database, and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number you'd expect by chance.",ted
"We had two opaque boxes: one with government-approved THC marijuana, and one with nothing.",ted
And it got it 50 percent of the time - which is exactly what you'd expect with a coin-flip model.,ted
So that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do.,ted
"I have an opinion of this myself because of the business I'm in, but in fact, people, it turns out, are getting smarter.",ted
"With science, don't think of skepticism as a thing, or science as a thing.",ted
It's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena.,ted
Or is it more likely that a reader of Skeptic did this with Photoshop?,ted
"Before we say something is out of this world, we should first make sure that it's not in this world.",ted
"What's more likely: that Arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship, or that the World Weekly News makes stuff up?",ted
The same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon.,ted
"For those of you in the back, it says here: Then a miracle occurs.",ted
I think you need to be more explicit here in step two.,ted
"You can say a miracle occurs, it's just that it doesn't explain anything or offer anything.",ted
"And it's true, scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers - dark energy or dark matter, something like that - until we figure out what it is, we'll call it this.",ted
"For intelligent design creationists, it's the end of the chain.",ted
"So again, we can ask this: what's more likely?",ted
"Are UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual cognitive mistakes, or even fakes?",ted
"This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena, California, looking down over Pasadena.",ted
"And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap, it's because it is.",ted
"You don't even need Photoshop or high-tech equipment, you don't need computers.",ted
You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go.,ted
"On a more serious note, in all of science we're looking for a balance between data and theory.",ted
"In the case of Galileo, he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn.",ted
"Second of all, his data was grainy and fuzzy, and he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at.",ted
So he wrote that he had seen - I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies.,ted
"So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data, you can't have a good theory.",ted
This is Christiaan Huygens's book that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn.,ted
"And we see the angles of the rings at different angles, there.",ted
The problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive biases.,ted
"So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things, on a simple level, and then I'll go to more serious ones.",ted
"In 1976, where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians.",ted
"And when you're squinting, you're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain, so you're reducing the quality of your data.",ted
"And if I didn't tell you what to look for, you'd still see the face, because we're programmed by evolution to see faces.",ted
"And of course, happy faces, faces of all kinds are easy to see.",ted
"If astronomers were frogs, perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.",ted
He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer.,ted
"Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville, just down the street, or is it up the street from here?",ted
"Tree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy, branchy, black-and-white splotchy",ted
Here's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo.,ted
"Here's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich - which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino - of course, this being America.",ted
"It has that sort of puckered lips, 1940s-era look.",ted
"The faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches, and so on.",ted
"Just to give you a size, that's Dawkins, me and The Amazing Randi, next to this two, two and a half story-sized image.",ted
"All these candles, thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this.",ted
"So we walked around the backside, to see what was going on.",ted
"It turns out wherever there's a sprinkler head and a palm tree, you get the effect.",ted
"Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside, which they started to wipe off.",ted
"So is it really a miracle of Mary, or is it a miracle of Marge?",ted
"And now I'm going to finish up with another example of this, with auditory illusions.",ted
"There's this film, White Noise, with Michael Keaton, about the dead talking back to us.",ted
"By the way, the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal.",ted
"In this case, supposedly, these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena.",ted
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now.,ted
"Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run, There's still time to change the road you're on.",ted
"All right, here it is backwards, and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there.",ted
"Now, I'll prime the auditory part of your brain to tell you what you're supposed to hear, and then hear it again.",ted
You can't miss it when I tell you what's there.,ted
"I'm going to just end with a positive, nice little story.",ted
"One of the top popular singers in England today, Katie Melua.",ted
"It was in the top five in 2005, called, Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing.",ted
"In America it'd be, We're 6,000 light years from the edge.",ted
"But my friend, Simon Singh, the particle physicist now turned science educator, who wrote the book The Big Bang, and so on, uses every chance he gets to promote good science.",ted
"And so he wrote an op-ed piece in The Guardian about Katie's song, in which he said,",ted
"You know, it's 13.7 billion light years, and it's not a guess.",ted
"So we can say, although not absolutely true, it's pretty close to being true.",ted
"And, to his credit, Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out, and said, I'm so embarrassed.",ted
We are 13.7 billion light years from the edge of the observable universe.,ted
"And with the available information, I predict that I will always be with you.",ted
"The second school I was at had big trees too, had a fantastic tulip tree",ted
"One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates, and taken in the bushes -",ted
I was stripped; I was attacked; I was abused; and this came out of the blue.,ted
"Now, the reason I say that, because, afterwards, I was thinking -",ted
"So I got involved with this tour, which was for Amnesty, and then in '88 I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle.",ted
"But the thing that really amazed me, that I had no idea, was that you could suffer in this way and then have your whole experience, your story, denied, buried and forgotten.",ted
"And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around, or a video or film camera, it was a great deal harder to do - for those in power to bury the story.",ted
And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision,ted
"And we campaign with activist groups and help them tell their story and,",ted
"And 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers, and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the - now, what's it called?",ted
"Text: Between Two Fires: Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda Man: When we were at home, it was Kony's rebel soldiers disturbing us.",ted
"A soldier walked onto the road, asking where we'd been.",ted
The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn.,ted
And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also.,ted
The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession.,ted
"In my country, it was - we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis; we've got Abu Ghraib; we've got Guantanamo Bay.",ted
"And as the story of Mr. Morales, just down the road, excuse me, Mr. Gabriel, would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit?",ted
"No, not at all, no problem, take your time.",ted
"But this, surely, whoever that man is, whatever he's done, this is cruel and unusual punishment.",ted
"Anyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras, and I'd like to show you just a little more of that.",ted
Shoot a video; expose injustice; reveal the truth; show us what's wrong with the world; and maybe we can help make it right.,ted
All the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with WITNESS.,ted
"WITNESS was born of technological innovation - in a sense the small, portable, DV cam was really what allowed it to come into being.",ted
"And so, the dream is that we could have a world in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort",ted
"There could be a new movement growing up, rising from the ground, reaching for the light, and growing strong, just like a tree.",ted
Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days.,ted
"So many different points of resonance that it's going to be difficult to bring them all up, but I'll try to do my best.",ted
"OK, so these are LP records and they've been replaced, right?",ted
"They've been swept away over the last two decades by these types of world-flattening digitization technologies, right?",ted
And I think it was best witnessed when Thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today.,ted
What I mean by that is that anyone in the world is free and allowed to create new music and musical ideas.,ted
"Anyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical ideas, use them in innovative ways.",ted
"Anyone is allowed to mix them in different types of ways, draw connections between musical ideas, and people can burn them or create final products and continue the circle.",ted
"In particular, textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school.",ted
"OK, does anybody realize there's a crisis in our schools, around the world?",ted
"I'm not going to spend too much time on that, but what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects that appear when an author publishes a book.",ted
"And this is even more true if you happen to speak a language other than one of the world's major languages, and especially English.",ted
I'm going to call these people below the barrier shutouts because they're really shut out of the process of being able to share their knowledge with the world.,ted
The first thing I'd like you to do is a little thought experiment.,ted
"OK, everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages.",ted
"So, liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them and then storing them in a vast, interconnected, global repository.",ted
Think of it as a massive iTunes for book-type content.,ted
"And then take that material and imagine making it all open, so that people can modify it, play with it, improve it.",ted
"Instead of editions of a book coming out every two years, imagine them coming out every 25 seconds.",ted
"So, imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this.",ted
We're working on the open-source tools and the content.,ted
"So, that's sort of to put it in perspective here.",ted
What are some of the people that are using these kind of tools?,ted
And not only that - it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions.,ted
"In fact, a lot of this use coming from United States K-12 schools, because anyone who's involved in a school scale back, the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum.",ted
"And so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open, free content.",ted
A team of volunteers at the University of Texas at El Paso - graduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas.,ted
"And within about a week, having this be some of our most popular material in widespread use all over Latin America, and in particular in Mexico, because of the open, extensible nature of this.",ted
"People, volunteers and even companies that are translating materials into Asian languages like Chinese, Japanese and Thai, to spread the knowledge even further.",ted
"We've been working with Teachers Without Borders, who are very interested in mixing our materials.",ted
They're going to be using Connexions as their platform to develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach in 84 countries around the world.,ted
"TWB is currently in Iraq, training 20,000 teachers supported by USAID.",ted
"OK, other organizations we've been working with, UC Merced - people know about UC Merced.",ted
"It's a new university in California, in the Central Valley, working very closely with community colleges.",ted
They're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system.,ted
And they're also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open-source.,ted
"We've been working with AMD, which has a project called 50x15, which is trying to bring Internet connectivity to 50 percent of the world's population by 2015.",ted
We're going to be providing content to them in a whole range of different languages.,ted
And we've also been working with a number of other organizations.,ted
"In particular, a bunch of the projects that are funded by Hewlett Foundation, who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content.",ted
"OK, burn - I think this is, sort of, quite interesting.",ted
Burn is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation of one of these courses.,ted
And I think a lot of you received - I think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack.,ted
Just to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook.,ted
Because it's published on demand and it's developed from this repository of open materials.,ted
"If this book were to be published by a regular publisher, it would cost at least 122 dollars.",ted
And I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing.,ted
"We're not talking about the Harry Potter end, right at the left side.",ted
"Books that might sell 100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year.",ted
"There is tremendous sustaining revenue under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours, but also to sustain this new emergence of on-demand publishers, like QOOP, who produced these two books.",ted
"And it's going to reach a crescendo over the next few years, and I think that it's for our benefit, really, and for the world's benefit.",ted
"There's tons of technology, and the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about is XML.",ted
And what you can really think of XML in this case is it's the packaging that we're putting around these pages.,ted
"Well, what the XML is going to do is it's going to turn those pages into Lego blocks.",ted
"XML are the nubs on the Lego that allow us to combine the content together in a myriad different ways, and it provides us a framework to share content.",ted
"It lets you reuse the same materials in multiple different ways, and surprising new ways.",ted
"It lets you interconnect ideas, indicating how fields relate to each other.",ted
We came up with this six-and-a-half years ago because I teach the stuff in the red box.,ted
"And my day job, as Chris said - I'm an electrical engineering professor.",ted
"I teach signal processing and my challenge was to show that this math - Wow, about half of you have already fallen asleep just looking at the equation.",ted
"But this seemingly dry math is actually the center of this tremendously powerful web that links technology - that links really cool applications like music synthesizers to tremendous economic opportunities, but also governed by intellectual property.",ted
"And the thing that I realized is there was no way that I, as an engineer, could write this book that would get all of this across.",ted
We needed a community to do it and we needed new tools to be able to interconnect these ideas.,ted
"And people who are teachers out here - whoever taught, you know this - it's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about.",ted
Imagine - this is possible: that every single equation that you click on in one of your new e-texts is something that you're going to be able to explore and experiment with.,ted
"You can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it, tinker with it, understand it.",ted
"The same type of mark-up, like MathML, for chemistry.",ted
Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed.,ted
"Imagine Music XML that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music, play with it, understand it.",ted
"It's no wonder that everybody's getting into it, right?",ted
"OK, the second big enabler, and this is where I told a big lie.",ted
"We can share and rip, mix and burn, but in fact, that's all illegal.",ted
"And we would be accused of piracy for doing that, because this music has been propertized.",ted
"So, really, the key thing here is we can't let this happen.",ted
"So, what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning.",ted
And what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe and makes it easily understandable.,ted
"At the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions and in lots of other projects, you can find their logo.",ted
"Clicking on that logo takes you to an absolute no-nonsense, human-readable document, a deed, that tells you exactly what you can do with this content.",ted
"Because in academic publishing and much of educational publishing, it's really this idea of sharing knowledge and making impact.",ted
"And Creative Commons is taking off - over 43 million things out there, licensed with a Creative Commons license.",ted
"OK, I'd like to conclude with just the last few points.",ted
"We get over 500,000 unique visitors per month, just to our particular site.",ted
"MIT OpenCourseWare, which is another large open-content site, gets a similar number of hits.",ted
"And the first thing that people are probably thinking is quality control, right?",ted
Because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons.,ted
"It didn't take long until people started contributing materials, for example, on lingerie, which is actually a pretty good module.",ted
"The only problem is it's plagiarized from a major French feminist journal, and when you go to the supposed course website, it points to a lingerie-selling website.",ted
So we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control and this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in.,ted
"Because Chris and his team have ensured that things are very, very high quality, right?",ted
And so we need to be able to do the same thing.,ted
"And we need to be able to design structures, and what we're doing is designing social software to enable anyone to build their own peer review process, and we call these things lenses.",ted
"And basically what they allow is anyone out there can develop their own peer-review process, so that they can focus on the content in the repository that they think is really important.",ted
So I'd just like to end by saying: you can really view this as a call to action.,ted
"I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television, I'm really getting into the Internet lately.",ted
"If I controlled the Internet, you could auction your broken heart on eBay.",ted
Take the money; go to Amazon; buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to - call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language.,ted
"If I were in charge of the Internet, you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings.",ted
"Hang left at cranky, right at preoccupied, U-turn on silent treatment, all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'.",ted
"Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan, but I still stretch miles in all directions.",ted
"If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com would be one big website.",ted
That way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job,ted
"Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people.",ted
They would not email you back - but you'd get an automated reply.,ted
Their name in your inbox - it's all you wanted anyway.,ted
Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy.,ted
Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions.,ted
"He forms an attachment to kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom, who downloads the boy in the orchard, the emperor of oranges, who grows up to be me - the guy who usually goes too far.",ted
"So if I were emperor of the Internet, I guess I'd still be mortal, huh?",ted
"But at that point, I would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis - so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office.",ted
"I'd be like some kind of Internet genius, and me, I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that - pop!",ted
We can make You've got Hallelujah the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on.,ted
"I only know nine Lovegroves, two of which are my parents.",ted
"So there's a terribly weird freaky side to me, which I'm fighting with all the time.",ted
"So to try and get through today, I've kind of disciplined myself with an 18-minute talk.",ted
"I thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough, that would guide me through the 18 minutes.",ted
I am known as Captain Organic and that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position.,ted
But today what I'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people's soul and emotion.,ted
"Not very long ago, not many thousands of years ago, we actually lived in caves, and I don't think we've lost that coding system.",ted
I'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design.,ted
"My world is the world of people like Amory Lovins, Janine Benyus, James Watson.",ted
"I could have been, perhaps, but I work in this world where I trust my instincts.",ted
So I am a 21st-century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with.,ted
And we should be developing things - we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use.,ted
"Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, 500 years ago, before photography.",ted
"It shows how observation, curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art.",ted
People like Leonardo - there have not been many - had this amazingly instinctive curiosity.,ted
"I don't want to sound pretentious saying that, but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago - well into the 21st century, 500 years later.",ted
"Impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it: 100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet.",ted
"Here you see the machining, the milling of a block of acrylic.",ted
"At that point, I don't know if that's possible at all.",ted
"It's a seductor, but I just feel in my bones that that's possible.",ted
These are the invisible things that you never see in your life.,ted
"When I do make some money, I'll have one machined for myself.",ted
"When they sent it to me, I thought I'd failed.",ted
"It's an icon of water itself, and it elevates people's perception of contemporary design.",ted
"Each bottle is different, meaning the water level will give you a different shape.",ted
"In the future, they will look like that, because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things, perhaps, in life.",ted
"Biopolymers, these new ideas for materials, will come into play in probably a decade.",ted
"I have this special interest in things like this, which blow my mind.",ted
"I don't know whether to, you know, drop to my knees, cry",ted
But I just know that nature - nature improves with ever-greater purpose,ted
"When I look at these things, they look pretty normal to me.",ted
"But these things evolved over many years, and what we're trying to do - I get three weeks to design a telephone.",ted
"How the hell do I do that, when you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve?",ted
I'm just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates.,ted
How that flows through me and how that comes out is what I'm trying to understand.,ted
It's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure.,ted
My office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab.,ted
"I studied cooking in school for four years, and in that experience, which was called domestic science, it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification.",ted
"A meringue is made exactly the same way, in my estimation, as a bone.",ted
"I need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that, but I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something, a car - I don't know.",ted
I'm also interested in growth patterns: the unbridled way that nature grows things,ted
"These interrelated forms, they do inspire everything I do, although I might end up making something incredibly simple.",ted
This is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium.,ted
"It shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of, kind of, engineering and biological thinking, shown pretty much as a bone structure.",ted
Any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object.,ted
It went into Time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century.,ted
"For somebody growing up in Wales in a little village, that's enough.",ted
"It shows how you make one holistic form, like the car industry, and then you break up what you need.",ted
"It's an absolutely fat-free design, and when you look at it, you see human beings.",ted
"When that moves into polymers, you can change the elasticity, the fluidity of the form.",ted
"This is an idea for a gas-injected, one-piece polymer chair.",ted
"If you took the idea of fractal technology further, take a membrane, shrinking it down constantly like nature does - that could be a seat for a chair.",ted
Observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day.,ted
"When you see a Henry Moore, still, your hair stands up.",ted
"If he was a car designer, phew, we'd all be driving one.",ted
"Ironically, that object was made by the Killarney process, which is a brand-new process here for the 21st century, and I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that.",ted
"When I look into these data images, I see new things.",ted
"Coral, all these natural forces, take away what they don't need",ted
This is a new chair which should come on the market in September.,ted
It goes with the flow of the polymer and you'll see - there's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing.,ted
It's great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming.,ted
"If you see the shadows that come through that, they're actually probably more important than the product, but it's the minimum it takes.",ted
I'm looking at single-surface structures and how they stretch and flow.,ted
"It's based on furniture typologies, but that's not the end motivation.",ted
"It's grown in my mind, and then it's grown in terms of the whole process that I go through.",ted

It's being built as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York.,ted
"When I see these animations, oh Jesus, I'm blown away.",ted
So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio.,ted
This kind of effervescent - fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas.,ted
"I said, You don't copy Apple, that's for sure.",ted
"You know, I mean - I'm delivering; they're not taking.",ted
"I've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years, sitting on a hot bed.",ted
"It's got a vacuum-formed, carbon-nylon pan.",ted
There's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels; they're fitted like Formula 1.,ted
"It presents the solar panel to the sun, and at night, it's a street lamp.",ted
"That's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first, and do the car second.",ted

"It's a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element, and this is a carbon-fiber handrail which is only supported in two places.",ted

So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video.,ted
"It's a homemade video, made it myself at three o'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is.",ted
It's a new bio-polycarbonate chair I'm doing in Italy.,ted

And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years - a record label I started that had a CD called Sauce.,ted
"Before I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread, and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.",ted
"But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread, and he focused, like most inventors did, on the patent part and the making part.",ted
"And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread, no one wanted it.",ted
"And it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop or you're an intellectual, or you're in business, or you're flying hot air balloons.",ted
I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do.,ted
That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion.,ted
"That people who can spread ideas, regardless of what those ideas are, win.",ted
"When I talk about it I usually pick business, because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation, and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score.",ted
But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do.,ted
At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV.,ted
TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way.,ted
"The way the TV-industrial complex works, is you buy some ads, interrupt some people, that gets you distribution.",ted
"And it goes around and around and around, the same way that the military-industrial complex worked a long time ago.",ted
"If we did that then everyone would pay attention, and we would win.",ted
"Well, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours.",ted
"And the thing that's happened is, they canceled the TV-industrial complex.",ted
"That just over the last few years, what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it's not working the way that it used to.",ted
But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child.,ted
I go to the deli; I'm sick; I need to buy some medicine.,ted
The brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year.,ted
And I ignored every message because I don't have a pain reliever problem.,ted
I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have.,ted
"And I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem, because I don't care.",ted
"Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago, with just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek.",ted

Consumers don't care about you at all; they just don't care.,ted
"Part of the reason is - they've got way more choices than they used to, and way less time.",ted
"And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff.",ted
"And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow, and you keep driving because you've seen cows before.",ted
But if the cow was purple - isn't that a great special effect?,ted
"If the cow was purple, you'd notice it for a while.",ted
"I mean, if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those, too.",ted
"The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about, what gets done, what gets changed, what gets purchased, what gets built, is: Is it remarkable?",ted
"And remarkable is a really cool word, because we think it just means neat, but it also means worth making a remark about.",ted

"Every week, the number one best-selling DVD in America changes.",ted
"It's never The Godfather, it's never Citizen Kane, it's always some third-rate movie with some second-rate star.",ted

The only thing they have in common is that they're different.,ted
"We're now in the fashion business, no matter what we do for a living, we're in the fashion business.",ted
And people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business - they're used to it.,ted
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way.,ted
"How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads, or insisting on meetings with people.",ted
"But it's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread, and which ones don't.",ted
They sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair.,ted
"They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought, to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work.",ted
"This guy, Lionel PoilГўne, the most famous baker in the world -",ted
"Last year, he sold 10 million dollars' worth of French bread.",ted
"Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned, by one baker at a time, in a wood-fired oven.",ted
"And when Lionel started his bakery, the French pooh-pooh-ed it.",ted
"It was neat; it was remarkable; and slowly, it spread from one person to another person until finally, it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris.",ted
"Now he's in London, and he ships by FedEx all around the world.",ted
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people.,ted
Smooth out the edges; go for the center; that's the big market.,ted
"They would ignore the geeks, and God forbid, the laggards.",ted
"But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken, I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more.",ted
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you.,ted
"And when you talk to them, they'll listen, because they like listening - it's about them.",ted
"And if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve, and it'll spread.",ted
They have something I call otaku - it's a great Japanese word.,ted
"It describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say, drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place, because that's what they do: they get obsessed with it.",ted
"To make a product, to market an idea, to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku, is almost impossible.",ted
"Instead, you have to find a group that really, desperately cares about what it is you have to say.",ted
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends.,ted
"There's a hot sauce otaku, but there's no mustard otaku.",ted
"That's why there's lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces, and not so many kinds of mustard.",ted
"Not because it's hard to make interesting mustard - you could make interesting mustard - but people don't, because no one's obsessed with it, and thus no one tells their friends.",ted
"This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars, but it sleeps for 12 minutes.",ted
"They want to talk to the people who do, and maybe it'll spread.",ted
"You can't get in, the car's got bulletproof glass, because it'll blow out the windshield otherwise.",ted
"It's really simple - you sell to the people who are listening, and just maybe, those people tell their friends.",ted
"Those people who buy them have the otaku, and then they tell their friends, and it spreads and it spreads.",ted
"Hard Candy nail polish, doesn't appeal to everybody, but to the people who love it, they talk about it like crazy.",ted
"This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company, making them a fortune.",ted
"It costs 35 percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about, because it's remarkable.",ted
They didn't just slap a new ad on the product; they changed what it meant to build a paint product.,ted
"They got this way by being remarkable, sometimes a little too remarkable.",ted
"And this picture frame has a cord going out the back, and you plug it into the wall.",ted
"My father has this on his desk, and he sees his grandchildren everyday, changing constantly.",ted
And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk.,ted
After you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem.,ted
What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them.,ted
The first one is: Design is free when you get to scale.,ted
The people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them.,ted
The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people.,ted
"The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes, be remarkable.",ted
And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do.,ted
"It doesn't matter whether you're making a record album, or you're an architect, or you have a tract on sociology.",ted
"If it's very good, it's not going to work, because no one's going to notice it.",ted
Silk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section.,ted
"Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk - not milk.",ted
"For the people who were there and looking at that section, it was remarkable.",ted
They didn't triple their sales with advertising; they tripled it by doing something remarkable.,ted
"You don't have to like it, but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable.",ted
Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum; he changed an entire city's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see.,ted
"Now, at countless meetings at, you know, the Portland City Council, or who knows where, they said, we need an architect - can we get Frank Gehry?",ted
"A record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD, this remarkable new format -",ted
So what you need to do is figure out who does care.,ted
"Who is going to raise their hand and say, I want to hear what you're doing next, and sell something to them.",ted
"As you can see, if that's nowhere, it's in the middle of it.",ted
And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake.,ted
"So the founding fathers said, We've got some money to spend.",ted
"And like most committees, they were going to build something pretty safe.",ted
And then an artist came to them - this is a true artist's rendering - he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town.,ted
"I don't know about you, but if they build it, that's where I'm going to go.",ted
"You'll be happy to know that I'll be talking not about my own tragedy, but other people's tragedy.",ted
"It's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people's tragedy than your own, and I want to keep it in the spirit of the conference.",ted
"So, if you believe the media accounts, being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life, in the words of Virginia Postrel.",ted
"There was money, there was drugs, guns, women, you know, you name it - jewelry,",ted
"But I think, more realistically, that being in a gang - selling drugs for a gang - is perhaps the worst job in all of America.",ted
And that's what I'd like to convince you of today.,ted
"First, I want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence on inner-city gangs.",ted
"Secondly, I want to tell you how somebody like me came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang - an interesting story, I think.",ted
"So before I do that, just one warning, which is that this presentation has been rated 'R' by the Motion Picture Association of America.",ted
"Given who is up on the stage, you'll be delighted to know that, in fact, there'll be no nudity - Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside.",ted
"So let me start by talking about crack cocaine, and how it transformed the gang.",ted
"To do that, you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine, in the early '80s, and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader.",ted
"Being a gang leader in the inner city wasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s - the early '80s, let me say.",ted
"Now, you had a lot of power, and you got to beat people up -",ted
"You couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang, because the people in the gang didn't have any money.",ted
You couldn't sell cocaine; cocaine's a great product - powdered cocaine - but you've got to know rich white people.,ted
"And most of the inner-city gang members didn't know any rich white people, so couldn't sell to that market.",ted
"Turns out, petty crime's a terrible way to make a living.",ted
"As a result, as a gang leader, you had, you know, power -",ted
There were limits to how powerful and important you could be if you had to live at home with your mother.,ted
"And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell, crack cocaine was the extra-chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city.",ted
"And for the worse - not for the better, but for the worse.",ted
Because you could smoke crack cocaine - you can't smoke powdered cocaine - and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high than snorting it.,ted
"And it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine, but when it came, it really did.",ted
"And it was a perfect drug; you could buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar, sell it for five dollars.",ted
"So for fifteen minutes, you get this great high, and then when you come down, all you want to do is get high again.",ted
Not really me - I'm really a bit player in all this.,ted
"My co-author, Sudhir Venkatesh, is the main character.",ted
"He was a math major in college who had a good heart, and decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD, came to the University of Chicago.",ted
"Now, the three months before he came to Chicago, he had spent following the Grateful Dead.",ted
He's a South Asian - very dark-skinned South Asian.,ted
"Big man, and he had hair, in his words, down to his ass.",ted
"So he showed up at the University of Chicago, and the famous sociologist William Julius Wilson was doing a book that involved surveying people all across Chicago.",ted
"So Sudhir, the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city, dutifully took his clipboard and walked down to this housing project, gets to the first building.",ted
"But he hears some voices up in the stairwell, so he climbs up the stairwell, comes around the corner, and finds a group of young African-American men playing dice.",ted
You don't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner.,ted
"So his greeting was not particularly warm, but they did say, well, OK - let's hear your questions on your survey.",ted
So - I kid you not - the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was: How do you feel about being poor and Black in America?,ted
"Very Bad What Sudhir found out is, in fact, that the real answer was the following: A)",ted
"The survey was not, in the end, going to be what got Sudhir off the hook.",ted
"There was a lot of gunfire, there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members.",ted
"By morning, the gang leader arrived, checked out Sudhir, decided he was no threat, and they let him go home.",ted
"So Sudhir went home, took a shower, took a nap.",ted
"But ultimately, the story has a happy ending for Sudhir, who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country.",ted
"And especially for me, as I sat in my office with my Excel spreadsheet open, waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang.",ted
It was one of the most unequal co-authoring relationships ever -,ted
"Well, let me say one thing: We really got access to everybody in the gang.",ted
"We got an inside look at the gang, from the very bottom up to the very top.",ted
"They made them available to us, and we not only could study them, but we could ask them questions about what was in them.",ted
So here's what the org chart of the gang looks like.,ted
"I don't know if you know much about org charts, but if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified McDonald's org chart, this is exactly what it would look like.",ted
"It's amazing, but the top level of the gang, they actually call themselves the Board of Directors.",ted
"Now, below that board of directors, you've got essentially what are regional VPs - people who control, say, the South Side of Chicago, or the West Side of Chicago.",ted
But the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees.,ted
They get the exclusive property rights to control the drug-selling.,ted
"They get the name of the gang behind them, for merchandising and marketing.",ted
"And they're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit, depending on how good they are at running the business.",ted
"Now, the group I really want you to think about, though, are the ones at the bottom - the foot soldiers.",ted
"These are the teenagers, typically, who'd be standing out on the street corner, selling the drugs.",ted
"And important to note is that almost all of the weight, all of the people in this organization are at the bottom - just like McDonald's.",ted
"So in some sense, the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonald's, and it's not just by chance that they're like them.",ted
"In fact, in these neighborhoods, they'd be the same people.",ted
"So the same kids who are working in the gang were actually, at the very same time, typically working part-time at a place like McDonald's.",ted
"Which already foreshadows the main result that I've talked about, about what a crappy job it was, being in the gang.",ted
"Because obviously, if being in the gang were such a wonderful, lucrative job, why in the world would these guys moonlight at McDonald's?",ted
"But based on being able to talk to them and to see their records, this is what it looks like in terms of the wages.",ted
The hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $3.50 an hour.,ted
It's easy to see by the patterns of consumption they have.,ted
"There was very little money in the gang, especially at the bottom.",ted
"Now if you managed to rise up, say, and be that local leader, the guy who's the equivalent of the McDonald's franchisee, you'd be making 100,000 dollars a year.",ted
"And that, in some ways, was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods as a young black male.",ted
"If you managed to rise to the very top, 200,000 or 400,000 dollars a year is what you'd hope to make.",ted
"And one of the sad parts of this is that, indeed, among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals in these communities - this is what they were striving for.",ted
"They weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways, because there were no legitimate channels out.",ted
"And it actually was the right choice, probably, to try to make it out this way.",ted
"You look at this, the relationship to McDonald's breaks down here.",ted
"Well, the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time.",ted
"So, with shooting at you, what are the death rates?",ted
"And so the death rate - not to mention the rate of being arrested, sent to prison, being wounded -",ted
"You're in the gang for four years, you expect to die with about a 25 percent likelihood.",ted
"So for comparison's purposes, let's think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky.",ted
"Let's say that you were a murderer and you were convicted of murder, and you're sent to death row.",ted
"It turns out, the death rates on death row from all causes, including execution: two percent a year.",ted
So it's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street.,ted
"That gives you some pause, for those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime.",ted
"And this is violent death - it's unbelievable, in some sense.",ted
"To put it into perspective: if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq, for instance, right now fighting the war: 0.5 percent.",ted
I think the first one is that they got fooled by history.,ted
"It used to be the gang was a rite of passage; that the young people controlled the gang; that as you got older, you dropped out of the gang.",ted
"And so the logical thing to think was that they are going to age out of the gang like everybody else has, and the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth.",ted
"There are striking similarities, I think, to the Internet boom.",ted
"The first set of people in Silicon Valley got very, very rich.",ted
"And then all of my friends said, Maybe I should go do that, too.",ted
And they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came.,ted
"In some sense, that's what happened, exactly, to the set of people we were looking at.",ted
"But the rules changed, and they never got to make partner.",ted
"Indeed, the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late 1980s are still running the major gangs in Chicago today.",ted
"They never passed on any of the wealth, So everybody got stuck at that $3.50-an-hour job, and it turned out to be a disaster.",ted
The other thing the gang was very good at was marketing and trickery.,ted
"And so for instance, one thing the gang would do is - the gang leaders would have big entourages, and they'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry.",ted
"And they didn't really have gold jewelry, they had gold-plated jewelry.",ted
"It goes back to, you know, the real-real versus the fake-real.",ted
"And really, they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be.",ted
"So for instance, they would give a 14-year-old kid a whole roll of bills to hold.",ted
"That 14-year-old kid would say to his friends, Hey, look at all the money I got in the gang.",ted
"It wasn't his money - until he spent it, and then he was in debt to the gang, and was sort of an indentured servant for a while.",ted
"Let me do one last thing I hadn't thought I'd have time to do, which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics, from the study of the gang.",ted
"This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics, called a compensating differential.",ted
"It's the idea that the increment to wages that a worker requires to leave him indifferent between performing two tasks, one which is more unpleasant than the other.",ted
Compensating differential - it's why we think garbagemen might be paid more than people who work in parks.,ted
"The words of one of the members of the gang, I think, make this clear.",ted
"So if I gonna be asked to put my life on the line, then front me the cash, man.",ted
"I think the gang member says it much more articulately than the economist, about what's going on.",ted
"Economists talk about game theory, that every two-person game has a Nash equilibrium.",ted
They're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot -,ted
"But we gotta be careful, 'cause they can shoot around here too",ted
One thing we observed in the data is that it looked like - the gang leader always got paid.,ted
"No matter how bad it was economically, he always got himself paid.",ted
"We had some theories related to cash flow, and lack of access to capital markets, and things like that.",ted
Why is it you always get paid and your workers don't always get paid?,ted
"His response is, You got all these niggers below you who want your job, you dig?",ted
"If you start taking losses, they see you as weak and shit.",ted
"And I thought about it and said, CEOs often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses, even when companies are losing a lot of money.",ted
And it never would really occur to an economist that this idea of 'weak and shit' could really be important.,ted
Maybe weak and shit is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis.,ted
"Once upon a time, there was a dread disease that afflicted children.",ted
"And in fact, among all the diseases that existed in this land, it was the worst.",ted
"And along came a brilliant inventor, a scientist, who came up with a partial cure for that disease.",ted
"Many children still died, but it was certainly better than what they had before.",ted
"And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free, virtually free, and was very easy to use.",ted
"But the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use it on the youngest children, on infants, and on one-year-olds.",ted
And the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds.,ted
"And the problem with this cure was it was very expensive, and it was very complicated to use.",ted
"And although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly, almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end.",ted
"But what they did, of course, since it was so complicated and expensive, they only used it on the zero-year-olds and the one-year-olds.",ted
And they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the two-year-olds and up.,ted
"Until a particular mother, whose child had just turned two, died of this disease.",ted
"And she thought to herself, My child just turned two, and until the child turned two, I had always used this complicated, expensive cure, you know, this treatment.",ted
"And then the child turned two, and I started using the cheap and easy treatment, and I wonder -",ted
"And she told all the other people, and she said, How could it possibly be that something that's cheap and simple works as well as something that's complicated and expensive?",ted
It probably is the wrong thing to do to switch and use the cheap and simple solution.,ted
"And the government, they heard her story and the other people, and they said, Yeah, you're right, we should make a law.",ted
We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children.,ted
"But then along came a lowly economist, who had children himself, and he used the expensive and complicated treatment.",ted
"And he thought about it, and the expensive one didn't seem that great to him.",ted
"And lo and behold, when he went through the data, he found that it didn't look like",ted
"And the parents were very unhappy, and they said, This is a terrible thing, because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing?",ted
"And in particular, the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought, How can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free?",ted
"And people were very angry, and they called him horrible names.",ted
"It's a true story about the United States today, and the disease I'm referring to is actually motor vehicle accidents for children.",ted
"And the free cure is adult seatbelts, and the expensive cure - the 300-million-dollar-a-year cure - is child car seats.",ted
And then talk about why - what is it that makes that true?,ted
"So, many times when you try to do research on data, it records complicated stories - it's hard to find in the data.",ted
It doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats.,ted
So the United States keeps a data set of every fatal accident that's happened since 1975.,ted
"So in every car crash in which at least one person dies, they have information on all of the people.",ted
"If you put a child in a car seat, 18.2 percent of the children die.",ted
"If they're wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt, in this raw data, 19.4 percent die.",ted
"And interestingly, wearing a lap-only seatbelt, 16.7 percent die.",ted
"And actually, the theory tells you that the lap-only seatbelt's got to be worse than the lap-and-shoulder belt.",ted
"And that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data, there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way.",ted
"So what we do in the study is - and this is just presenting the same information, but turned into a figure to make it easier.",ted
"So the yellow bar represents car seats, the orange bar lap-and-shoulder, and the red bar lap-only seatbelts.",ted
"And this is all relative to unrestrained - the bigger the bar, the better.",ted
"So you can control for the basic things, like how hard the crash was, what seat the child was sitting in, etc.",ted
"And so, you can see that the lap-only seatbelts start to look worse once you do that.",ted
"And then finally, the last set of bars, which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash, 50, 75, 100 different characteristics of the crash.",ted
"And what you find is that the car seats and the lap-and-shoulder belts, when it comes to saving lives, fatalities look exactly identical.",ted
And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well.,ted
"In order to have the car seat approved, you need to pass certain federal standards, all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash.",ted
"But when you look at other types of crashes, like rear-impact crashes, indeed, the car seats don't perform as well.",ted
"And I think that's because they've been optimized to pass, as we always expect people to do, to optimize relative to bright-line rules about how affected the car will be.",ted
"And the other thing you might argue is, Well, car seats have got a lot better over time.",ted
And so if we look at recent crashes - the whole data set is almost 30 years' worth of data - you won't see it in the recent crashes.,ted
"But indeed, in recent crashes the lap-and-shoulder seatbelts, actually, are doing even better than the car seats.",ted
"They say, Well, that's impossible, that can't be.",ted
"And the line of argument, if you ask parents, is, But car seats are so expensive and complicated, and they have this big tangle of latches",ted
"It's kind of an interesting logic, I think, that people use.",ted
"And the other logic, they say, Well, the government wouldn't have told us to use them if they weren't much better.",ted
But what's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much.,ted
"It really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two, which has led to the passage of all these laws - not very much on data.",ted
"So you can only get so far, I think, in telling your story by using these abstract statistics.",ted
"And so I had some friends over to dinner, and I was asking -",ted
I was asking them what advice they might have for me about proving my point.,ted
We can't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats.,ted
"Under the conditions of anonymity, they said they would be happy to do this test for us - so anonymity, and 1,500 dollars per seat that we crashed.",ted
"And so, we went to Buffalo, New York, and here is the precursor to it.",ted
"These are the crash test dummies, waiting for their chance to take the center stage.",ted
"Here, they don't actually crash the entire car, you know - it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it.",ted
"So they just have these bench seats, and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it.",ted
And I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think car seats are so great.,ted
"Does he not look content, ready to go, like he could survive anything?",ted
"And then, if you look at the kid in back, it looks like he's already choking before the crash even happens.",ted
"It's hard to believe, when you look at this, that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash.",ted
"So this is going to be a crash where they're going to slam this thing forward into a wall at 30 miles an hour, and see what happens.",ted
"These are three-year-old dummies, by the way.",ted
"This is a car seat that was installed by someone who has installed 1,000 car seats, who knew exactly how to do it.",ted
And also it turned out these bench seats are the very best way to install car seats.,ted
"And so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat, OK?",ted
"The federal standards are that you have to score below a 1,000 to be an approved car seat on this crash, in some metric of units which are not important.",ted
"So this car seat was actually an above-average car seat from Consumer Reports, and did quite well.",ted
"Now, this is the kid, same crash, who is in the seatbelt.",ted
"He hardly moves at all, actually, relative to the other child.",ted
"Anyway, it turns out that those two crashes, that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse.",ted
"So, he gets about a 500 out of - you know, on this range - relative to a 400 and something.",ted
"But still, if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government, and said, I have invented a new car seat.",ted
"I would like you to approve it for selling, then they would say, This is a fantastic new car seat, it works great.",ted
"It only got a 500, it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000.",ted
And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat.,ted
"So, in some sense, what this is suggesting is that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong, which is putting children at risk.",ted
"It's just that, fundamentally, the car seats aren't doing much.",ted
"So, I'll show you the six-year-old crashes as well.",ted
"The six-year-old is in a car seat, and it turns out that looks terrible, but that's great.",ted
Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all.,ted
"And then here's the six-year-old in the seatbelt, and in fact, they get exactly within, you know, within one or two points of the same.",ted
"So really, for the six-year-old, the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever.",ted
"That's some more evidence, so in some sense - I was criticized by a scientist, who said, You could never publish a study with an n of 4, meaning those four crashes.",ted
And so I think the answer to this puzzle is that there's a much better solution out there,ted
"And if you think from a design perspective, about going back to square one, and say, I just want to protect kids in the back seat.",ted
"And then, let's make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain.",ted
"It's just actually - you see, this is folding up - it's behind the seat.",ted
"You've got a regular seat for adults, and then you fold it down, and the kid sits on top, and it's integrated.",ted
"It seems to me that this can't be a very expensive solution, and it's got to work better than what we already have.",ted
"So the question is, is there any hope for adoption of something like this, which would presumably save a lot of lives?",ted
"And I think the answer, perhaps, lies in a story.",ted
And this is a long time ago: you were allowed to do things then you can't do today.,ted
"So, my father would have patients come in who he thought were not really sick.",ted
"And he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them, and he'd say, Come back in a week, if you still feel lousy.",ted
"OK, and most of them would not come back, but some of them would come back.",ted
"And when they came back, he, still convinced they were not sick, had another jar of pills.",ted
"And these, to me, are the analogy for the car seats.",ted
"People would look at these and say, Man, this thing is so big and so hard to swallow.",ted
"If this doesn't make me feel better, you know, what possibly could?",ted
"And it turned out that most people wouldn't come back, because it worked.",ted
"But every once in a while, there was still a patient convinced that he was sick, and he'd come back.",ted
"And the jar of pills he had, he said, were the tiniest little pills he could find, so small you could barely see them.",ted
"It's almost like this thing here, which you can't even see.",ted
"And it turned out that never, in all the times my dad gave out this pill, the really tiny pill, did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness.",ted
"So, my dad always took that as evidence that this little, teeny, powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect.",ted
"And in some sense, if that's the right story, I think integrated car seats you will see, very quickly, becoming something that everyone has.",ted
"The other possible conclusion is, well, maybe after coming to my father three times, getting sent home with placebos, he still felt sick, he went and found another doctor.",ted
"And if that's the case, then I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come.",ted
"Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective, or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury?",ted
"In my data, and in another data set I've looked at for New Jersey crashes, I find very small differences in injury.",ted
"So in this data, it's statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lap-and-shoulder belts.",ted
"Now, what's interesting, I should say this as a disclaimer, there is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data, which suggests that car seats are dramatically better.",ted
"And I really can't resolve, yet, and I'd like to work with these medical researchers to try to understand how there can be these differences, which are completely at odds with one another.",ted
The question is even if - are there enough serious injuries to make these cost-effective?,ted
"Even if they're right, it's not so clear that they're so cost-effective.",ted
"I'm interested - I kind of do the same thing, but I don't move my body.",ted
"And instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space, I work in the mineral world.",ted
"Because I have to say, for my whole career, if there's anything that's been consistent, it's been that you can't do it.",ted
"No matter what I've done, what I've tried to do, everybody says it can't be done.",ted
And it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas.,ted
"It's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line, not the straight line.",ted
I'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things.,ted
"But basically, what we do is, we try to give coherence to the world.",ted
"We make physical things, buildings that become a part in an accretional process; they make cities.",ted
"And those things are the reflection of the processes, and the time that they are made.",ted
And what I'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world and the territories which are useful as generative material.,ted
"Because, really, all I'm interested in, always, as an architect, is the way things are produced because that's what I do.",ted
"I have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain and saying,",ted
"In fact, somebody mentioned - Ewan, maybe it was you in your introduction - about",ted
"And I've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators, if anybody's involved in cake decorations -",ted
"And so, in the formation of things, in giving it form, in concretizing these things, it starts with some notion of how one organizes.",ted
"There's been a continual relationship between inventions, which are private, and reality, which has been important to me.",ted
"And it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer, observing every kilometer a particular object of desire, and then placing that within this.",ted
"And the notion was that I could make an organization not built on normal coherencies, but built on non-sequiturs, built on randomness.",ted
And then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity of systems.,ted
It's the relationship - it's the dynamics between the systems - which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture that is - that would otherwise not exist.,ted
"And those systems could be identified, and they could be grouped together.",ted
"And what I'm interested in is not the styling of that, but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity.",ted
"This is a project that we just finished in Penang for a very, very large city project that came directly out of this process, which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it.",ted
"And the project - again, enormous, enormous competition - on the Hudson River and in New York that we were asked to do three years ago, which uses these processes.",ted
"Because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate, and as the aggregates get larger we require more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems.",ted
I was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC.,ted
"We won the competition - what was it, nine months ago?",ted
"Again, a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated, very large-scale organisms.",ted
"In this case, we only used 15 of the 60 acres of land, and the 45 acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village.",ted
"And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs, etc.",ted
"Its position, of course, in the middle of Manhattan - it's on Hunter's Point.",ted
"And then the broader ideas of city-making start having direct influences on architecture, on the elements that make up the broader scheme, the buildings themselves, and start guiding us.",ted
Architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place.,ted
"And so I can start this discussion in any number of places, and I've chosen three or four to talk about.",ted
And it has also to do with an interest in the vast kind of territory that architecture touches.,ted
There's just no place that it doesn't somehow have a connective tissue to.,ted
"This is Jim Dine, and it's the absence of presence, etc.",ted
"It's the clothing, the skin, without the presence of the character.",ted
"And this was the first prototype in Korea, as we're dealing with a dynamic envelope, and then the same characteristic of the fabric.",ted
And now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated.,ted
"If you look at most buildings, what you look at is the building, the facade, and it is the building.",ted
And you're looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body.,ted
"And then, again, the building itself, middle of Los Angeles, right across from City Hall.",ted
"And as it moves, it takes pieces of the earth with it.",ted
"It's part of a sign system, which was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles - the two-dimension, three-dimension signing, etc.",ted
"It's transparent, and it allows you to understand, I think, what is always the most interesting thing in any building, which is the actual constructional processes that make it.",ted
And that was very much part of the notion of the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles.,ted
"And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium, that light becomes literally a building material.",ted
"Well, that immediately turned into something much broader, and as a scope.",ted
"And again, we're looking at an early sketch where I'm understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower.",ted
"And now it turned into something much, much broader as a problem, and it has to do with performance.",ted
"This will be the first building in the United States that took - well, I can't say it took the air conditioning out.",ted
"I wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it.",ted
"It's a wrong attitude, actually, because the hybrid is probably more interesting.",ted
"There's some air conditioning left in the base, but the skin now moves on hydraulics.",ted
It forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind.,ted
"And so now what we're looking at, as the projects get larger in scale, as they interface with broader problems, that they expand the capabilities in terms of their performance.",ted
We could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground.,ted
"And I understood that building really could be the augmentation of the Earth's surface, and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense.",ted
"And then - well, he was probably looking at this - this is Nazca; this is 700 years ago - the most amazing four-kilometer land sculptures.",ted
"This is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona - well, whatever it is, a model, a conceptual, kind of idea.",ted
And it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable.,ted
"So it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth.",ted
There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work.,ted
"And there it is, again, as it's starting to get resolved tectonically, and then there's the school.",ted
"And, of course, we're interested in participating with education.",ted
"I have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates X, Y and Z function.",ted
What I'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people.,ted
It demands some sort of notion of inquiry because it's a system that's developed not sculpturally.,ted
"It has to do with a broad, consistent logic, and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building.",ted
And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles that uses some of the same ideas.,ted
"Then, again, we're doing the headquarters for NOAA - National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency - outside of Washington in Maryland.",ted
"They have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles, and the site's in red.",ted
"There's actually three baseball fields on it right now, and they're going to stay there.",ted
"We put one piece directly north-south, and it holds the dishes at the ears, right?",ted
"And then right below that the processing, and the mission lift, and the mission control room, and all the other spaces are underground.",ted
And what you look at is an aircraft carrier that's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes.,ted
"And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion, broken up by a series of courts, and it's five acres of uninterrupted, horizontal space for their administrative offices.",ted
"And then that, in turn, propelled us to look at larger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue.",ted
"And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing, but something that's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time.",ted
"One enters the building as it lifts off the ground, and it becomes part of the idea.",ted
"And then the skin - the edges of this - all promote the dynamic, the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts, geologic shifts.",ted
"The main idea was the gateway, where it breaks the site, and the building occupies both the public space and the private space.",ted
"And finally, one of the most interesting projects - it's a courthouse.",ted
"And what I want to talk about - this is the Supreme Court, of course - and, well, I'm dealing with Michael Hogan, the Chief Justice of Oregon.",ted
"Because I'm going, I'm interested in the phenomenon that's taking place in here.",ted
And I'm a character that's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there's no such thing as nature any more.,ted
"And then of course, this one, our governor at the moment.",ted
"And we spent some time with Conan, believe it or not, and then that led us to, kind of, the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic, architectural.",ted
"And it forced us to talk about notions of how we work, and the dynamics of that, and what other sources of the work is.",ted
"And it led us to the project, the courthouse, which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse.",ted
You'll find a stair that's the same length as the Supreme Court.,ted
"Here's a piano nobile, which is a device used in the Renaissance.",ted
"And I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already.",ted
"While creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless, creativity is always meaningful.",ted
"You know, creation is what put that dog in that picture, and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters.",ted
"When you think about - you know, creativity has a lot to do with causality too.",ted
"You know, when I was a teenager, I was a creator.",ted
"Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was, and tried to maintain that persona - I became creative.",ted
"Though it's actually true, you know, the reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil.",ted
"If I was born in Monterey, probably would be in Brazil.",ted
You couldn't really say what you wanted to say; you had to invent ways of doing it.,ted
"That led me to another step of why I'm here today, is because I really liked media of all kinds.",ted
"I was a media junkie, and eventually got involved with advertising.",ted
"My first job in Brazil was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards, and based on speed, angle of approach and actually blocks of text.",ted
"It was very - actually, it was a very good study, and got me a job in an ad agency.",ted
And they also decided that I had to - to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it.,ted
"On my way out, I had to break a fight apart.",ted
"Luckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see.",ted
"And, even more luckily, the guy said that he was sorry and I bribed him for compensation money",ted
"Well, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images.",ted
"You know, I became - I took this very iconoclastic approach.",ted
"Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do - I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials, that's what I really wanted to do.",ted
"But I - they didn't let me do it, so I just - you know, they would only let me do other things.",ted
But I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice.,ted
"It was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising.",ted
Is a remnant of a race of - a very evolved race of entertainers.,ted
"Unfortunately, it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform.",ted
"A Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it.",ted
"Actually, the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks, that I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee; the coffee was actually pre-Columbian.",ted
"The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume, for travel purposes.",ted
"And the half tombstone, for people who are not dead yet.",ted
"I wanted to take that into the realm of images, and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.",ted
"But now I wanted to work in a very low-tech way, so something that would mean at the same time a lump of cotton",ted
"But I was still, you know - this is a kitty cloud.",ted
"But I was still working with sculpture, and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.",ted
"I think it was '94, and I saw Ghiberti's Door of Paradise.",ted
"First, he got an age-old way of making it, which was relief, and he worked this with three-point perspective, which was brand-new technology at the time.",ted
"So I decided to make these very simple renderings, that at first they are taken as a line drawing - you know, something that's very -",ted
"The idea was to - because everybody overlooks white - like pencil drawings, you know?",ted
Then you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time.,ted
"It had a physicality, and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way, towards the image.",ted
And the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings.,ted
"I started taking that into the realm of landscape, which is something that's almost a picture of nothing.",ted
"I made these pictures called Pictures of Thread, and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture.",ted
"These always end up being a photograph at the end, or more like an etching in this case.",ted
"And I don't know how many yards, after John Constable.",ted
"Departing from the lines, I decided to tackle the idea of points, like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves.",ted
"I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts, and I did work and play with them.",ted
"Upon my arrival in New York, I decided - they were children of sugar plantation workers.",ted
"And by manipulating sugar over a black paper, I made portraits of them.",ted
"It was just the name of the child, with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.",ted
"And so I decided to make these pictures, and they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them.",ted
I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection.,ted
"And you render this with the most non-specific material, which is dust itself.",ted
"Like, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor.",ted
"They do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list.",ted
"I bought a computer, and they told me it had millions of colors in it.",ted
"You know an artist's first response to this is, who counted it?",ted
"And I realized that I never worked with color, because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors.",ted
"But once they're applied to numeric structure, then you can feel more comfortable.",ted
So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches.,ted
"They end up being very large pictures, and I photographed with a very large camera - an 8x10 camera.",ted
So you can see the surface of every single swatch - like in this picture of Chuck Close.,ted
And you have to walk very far to be able to see it.,ted
"Also, the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts - and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today, which is the bit map.",ted
I tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake.,ted
"But then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original.",ted
And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself.,ted
I opt for very simple line drawings - kind of stupid looking.,ted
"And at the same time, I was doing these very large constructions, being 150 meters away.",ted
"I wasn't interested in the very large things, or in the small things.",ted
"I was more interested in the things in between, you know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.",ted
This is like you see - the size of a person over there.,ted
"And I love this work, because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.",ted
"And it was quite wonderful, because I had an interest - an early interest - in theater, that's justified on this thing.",ted
"In theater, you have the character and the actor in the same place, trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience.",ted
"And in this, you'd have like a - something that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time.",ted
"My interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way.",ted
"On the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think - and I went to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of Othello by an amateur group.",ted
"See, I think it's not really about impression, making people fall for a really perfect illusion, as much as it is to make - I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion.",ted
"Because it's not about fooling somebody, it's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief: how much you want to be fooled.",ted
That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that.,ted
I get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical Pentagon long-range strategic planners.,ted
And the answer I like to offer is what they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war.,ted
And what I've spent 15 years doing in this business - and it's taken me almost 14 to figure it out - is I think about the future of wars in the context of everything else.,ted
So I tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace.,ted
The material I'm going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas.,ted
It's the one that takes me around the world right now interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit.,ted
"The material was generated in two years of work I did for the Secretary of Defense, thinking about a new national grand strategy for the United States.",ted
I'm going to present a problem and try to give you an answer.,ted
"Here's my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the Pentagon: the theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies.",ted
This is gobbledygook for if the United States fights somebody we're going to be huge.,ted
"And if they try to fight us in the traditional, straight-up manner we're going to kick their ass, which is why people don't try to do that any more.",ted
I met the last Air Force General who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat.,ted
That's how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours.,ted
So that overmatched capability creates problems - catastrophic successes the White House calls them.,ted
"And we're trying to figure that out, because it is an amazing capability.",ted
"The question is, what's the good you can do with it?",ted
"So we say, area-denial, anti-access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over.",ted
"They throw up anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies.",ted
Trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our Achilles' heels instantly.,ted
"Prometheus approach, largely a geographic definition, focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict.",ted
We field the first-half team in a league that insists on keeping score until the end of the game.,ted
"We can run the score up against anybody, and then get our asses kicked in the second half - what they call fourth generation warfare.",ted
We did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse.,ted
"What we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow, and creating the peace space that allows us to move on.",ted
"Problem is, the Defense Department over here beats the hell out of you.",ted
"The State Department over here says, Come on boy, I know you can make it.",ted
"And that poor country runs off that ledge, does that cartoon thing and then drops.",ted
"It's about non-lethal technologies, because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting you're going to lose friends very quickly.",ted
"This is not about projecting power, but about staying power, which is about legitimacy with the locals.",ted
"I know their senior leadership, they wanted to give it to us.",ted
"We don't think you can pull it off, we're not going to give you our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder.",ted
"And the Chinese said to me, Dr. Barnett, you're absolutely right.",ted
"But it's not a perfect world, and your administration isn't getting us any closer.",ted
"And it's time to start admitting you can't ask the same 19-year-old to do it all, day in and day out.",ted
"Frankly, we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it.",ted
"Because if we did, that guy would be in front of the Senate, still testifying over Abu Ghraib.",ted
What we need to build is a force for the Everything Else.,ted
What I think this really represents is lack of an A to Z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states.,ted
"They got out on the far end, we said, Fine, don't worry about it.",ted
A certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non-zero outcome.,ted
"We don't have one for processing politically bankrupt states that, frankly, everybody wants gone.",ted
"Like Saddam, like Mugabe, like Kim Jong-Il - people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions.",ted
I'm going to distinguish between what I call front half and back half.,ted
"And let's call this red line, I don't know, mission accomplished.",ted
"What we have extant right now, at the beginning of this system, is the U.N. Security Council as a grand jury.",ted
"They can put it in an envelope and mail it to you, and then say in no uncertain terms, Please cut that out.",ted
That gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the 1990s.,ted
"That gets you 250,000 dead in the Sudan in the last 15 months.",ted
"Everybody's got to answer their grandchildren some day what you did about the holocaust in Africa, and you better have an answer.",ted
"What we do have is the U.S.-enabled Leviathan Force that says, You want me to take that guy down?",ted
"As soon as I can't find anybody else to air out, I leave the scene immediately.",ted
"A functioning executive that will translate will into action, because we don't have it.",ted
Every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing.,ted
We haven't faced an imminent threat since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.,ted
But we use this language from a bygone era to scare ourselves into doing something because we're a democracy and that's what it takes.,ted
"And if that doesn't work we scream, He's got a gun!",ted
"And then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say, Jesus, it was dark.",ted
"We should have had 250,000 troops streaming into Iraq on the heels of that Leviathan sweeping towards Baghdad.",ted
"No looting, no military disappearing, no arms disappearing, no ammo disappearing, no Muqtada Al-Sadr - I'm wrecking his bones - no insurgency.",ted
Talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months.,ted
"We had six months to feel the lob, to get the job done, and we dicked around for six months.",ted
"They said, You're that powerful, you can resurrect this country.",ted
"What we need is an international reconstruction fund - Sebastian Mallaby, Washington Post, great idea.",ted
They're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the IMF.,ted
You vote according to how much money you put in the kitty.,ted
I'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the Balkans.,ted
"Would you like Kim Jong-Il, who's killed about two million people, would you like him gone?",ted
They've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War.,ted
"I'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire, which I can do because I'm not inside the beltway.",ted
So they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization.,ted
"The problem is you need a big, sexy opponent to fight against.",ted
And if you can't find one you've got to make one up.,ted
The rest of the military got dragged down into the muck across the 1990s and they developed this very derisive term to describe it: military operations other than war.,ted
"I ask you, who joins the military to do things other than war?",ted
"I maintain this is code inside the Army for, We don't want to do this.",ted
They spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world,ted
"For eight years, after screwing up the relationship on day one - inauguration day with gays in the military - which was deft.",ted
"It's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says, Doctor, it hurts when I do this.",ted
I used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early 1990s.,ted
"I'd say, You're buying one military and you're operating another, and eventually it's going to hurt.",ted
"And they'd say, Dr. Barnett, you are so right.",ted
"It elevates MOOTW - how we pronounce that acronym - from crap to grand strategy, because that's how you're going to shrink that gap.",ted
"Some people put these two things together and they call it empire, which I think is a boneheaded concept.",ted
"Empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets, which you cannot do, but maximum rule sets which you must do.",ted
We enforce the minimal rule sets for maintaining connectivity to the global economy.,ted
How this impacts the way we think about the future of war.,ted
"Going back to the beginning of our country - historically, defenses meant protection of the homeland.",ted
"Written into our constitution, two different forces, two different functions.",ted
"Raise an army when you need it, and maintain a navy for day-to-day connectivity.",ted
In 1947 we merged these two things together in the Defense Department.,ted
"Our long-term rationale becomes, we're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the Soviets.",ted
We connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay.,ted
They can kill three million in Chicago tomorrow and we don't go to the mattresses with nukes.,ted
"The question is how do we reconnect American national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable, and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet?",ted
We talked about this going all the way back to the end of the Cold War.,ted
"Let's have a Department of War, and a Department of Something Else.",ted
It's going to be the Department of Agriculture for the 21st century.,ted
It's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him.,ted
I knew we'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force.,ted
But I know this organization doesn't change until it experiences failure.,ted
This is the military the rest of the world wants us to build.,ted
It's why I travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries.,ted
It means you've got to stop pretending you can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same 19-year-old.,ted
"Switching back, morning, afternoon, evening, morning, afternoon, evening.",ted
"Handing out aid, shooting back, handing out aid, shooting back.",ted
"That force on the left, you can train a 19-year-old to do that.",ted
That force on the right is more like a 40-year-old cop.,ted
"That Sys Admin force is the force that never comes home, does most of your work.",ted
"But here's the promise you make to the American public, to your own people, to the world.",ted
"You break out that Leviathan Force, you promise, you guarantee that you're going to mount one hell of a - immediately - follow-on Sys Admin effort.",ted
Don't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace.,ted
"Leviathan traditional partners, they all look like the Brits and their former colonies.",ted
"International organizations, non-governmental organizations, private voluntary organizations, contractors.",ted
"Leviathan Force, it's all about joint operations between the military services.",ted
"What we need to do is inter-agency operations, which frankly Condi Rice was in charge of.",ted
And I'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed.,ted
"Gender balanced much more, older, educated, married with children.",ted
The force on the left respects Posse Comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the U.S.,ted
The force on the left is never coming under the purview of the International Criminal Court.,ted
And you've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that.,ted
"I've been told by the Revolution of Military Affairs crowd for years, we can do it faster, cheaper, smaller, just as lethal.",ted
"I say, Great, I'm going to take the Sys Admin budget out of your hide.",ted
You're going to build the Sys Admin Force inside the U.S. Military first.,ted
"But ultimately you're going to civilianize it, probably two thirds.",ted
"So yes, it begins inside the Pentagon, but over time it's going to cross that river.",ted
"I may not live long enough to get you there, but it's going to happen.",ted
We're going to have a Department of Something Else between war and peace.,ted
This is where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense.,ted
And this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk.,ted
"This is the history of the marines - small wars, small arms.",ted
That's what keeps the Sys Admin Force from being a pussy force.,ted
"Department of Navy, strategic subs go this way, surface combatants are over there, and the news is they may actually be that small.",ted
"I tell young officers, You may command 500 ships in your career.",ted
"Here's the dirty secret of the Air Force, you can win by bombing.",ted
But you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace.,ted
Because when the thing gets prevented in Chicago with the three million dead,ted
So it's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that.,ted
How are you going to get them to work for this force?,ted
"Last point, intelligence community - the muscle and the defense agencies go this way.",ted
"What should be the CIA, open, analytical, open source should come over here.",ted
"Read that great piece in the New Yorker about how our echo boomers, 19 to 25, over in Iraq taught each other how to do Sys Admin work, over the Internet in chat rooms.",ted
"They said, Well, Jesus, they already know this stuff.",ted
"These are the sunglasses that don't scare people, simple stuff.",ted
"Ken Hale, who's a linguist, said that of the 6,000 languages spoken on Earth right now, 3,000 aren't spoken by the children.",ted
"So that in one generation, we're going to halve our cultural diversity.",ted
"He went on to say that every two weeks, an elder goes to the grave carrying the last spoken word of that culture.",ted
"So an entire philosophy, a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries, goes away.",ted
"So for the last 20 years, since my dental experience, I have been traveling the world and coming back with stories about some of these people.",ted
What I'd like to do right now is share some of those stories with you.,ted
She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country.,ted
"So I took this picture three days after she arrived, and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on, with her toes sticking out.",ted
"And she crossed in March, and there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March.",ted
"His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising, when the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet.",ted
"And he was beaten, starved, tortured - lost all his teeth while in prison.",ted
"And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man.",ted
"I met him two weeks after he got out of prison - that he went through that experience, and ended up with the demeanor that he had.",ted
"So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people, and I'd spent about five weeks there, and I was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet into Dharamsala.",ted
"And it just so happened, on the fifth week, there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama.",ted
"And what he said was: treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels, because it's your enemies that build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment.",ted
"That hit me so hard, telling these people that had been through this experience.",ted
"So, two months later, I went into Tibet, and I started interviewing the people there, taking my photographs.",ted
And I'd snuck in - because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet,ted
"So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama, and I would hand them out.",ted
"And when I gave them to the people, they'd either hold them to their heart, or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there.",ted
I did this 10 years ago - that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left.,ted
"So I was going in, interviewing these people and doing their portraits.",ted
"And they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau, way in the western part of the country.",ted
"And they had just come down from the high pastures, at 18,000 feet.",ted
"Same thing: gave her a picture, she held it up to her forehead.",ted
"And I usually hand out Polaroids when I do these, because I'm setting up lights, and checking my lights, and when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent.",ted
"This is Tenzin Gyatso; he was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two, out in a peasant's house, way out in the middle of nowhere.",ted
"At the age of four, he was installed as the 14th Dalai Lama.",ted
"As a teenager, he faced the invasion of his country, and had to deal with it - he was the leader of the country.",ted
"And if you think about this man, 46 years later, still sticking to this non-violent response to a severe political and human rights issue.",ted
"And the young people, young Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work.",ted
"You know, violence as a political tool is all the rage right now.",ted
So this is our icon to non-violence in our world - one of our living icons.,ted
And this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon - oil was discovered in 1972.,ted
"And Moi belongs to the Huaorani tribe, and they're known as very fierce, they're known as auca.",ted
And they've managed to keep out the seismologists and the oil workers with spears and blowguns.,ted
And we spent - I was with a team - two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt.,ted
"This was on a monkey hunt, hunting with curare-tipped darts.",ted
And the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible.,ted
"They could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see.",ted
And I couldn't even see the monkeys that they were getting with these darts.,ted
And her tribe has had to move three times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills.,ted
And these people are the people who take the brunt of it.,ted
"He's the shaman of the Huaorani, and he said to us, you know, I'm an older man now; I'm getting tired",ted
"And I was - I usually travel alone when I do my work, but I did this -",ted
"And as it turned out, these guys really taught me a thing or two about blending in with the locals.",ted
"One of the things I did just before 9/11 - August of 2001 - I took my son, Dax, who was 16 at the time, and I took him to Pakistan.",ted
"Because at first I wanted - you know, I've taken him on a couple of trips, but I wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less.",ted
"And he brought a soccer ball, and we had soccer every night in this little village.",ted
"By the way, Mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well.",ted
"And this is John Doolikahn, who's the shaman of the Kalash.",ted
"And he's up in the mountains, right on the border with Afghanistan.",ted
"In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora, the area where Osama bin Laden's supposed to be.",ted
"And the shaman - I did a whole series on shamanism, which is an interesting phenomenon.",ted
And they're all praying to the mountain gods as they go into trance.,ted
"You know, getting kids used to different realities, I think, is so important.",ted
"What Dan Dennett said the other day - having a curriculum where they study different religions, just to make a mental flexibility, give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems -",ted
I think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place.,ted
"So, one thing we did five years ago: we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the United States.",ted
So we first hooked up a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle.,ted
"This is Daniel; he's one of our students in Arctic Village, Alaska.",ted
"He lives in this log cabin - no running water, no heat other than - no windows and high-speed Internet connection.",ted
And the way we've done this - we teach digital storytelling to these kids.,ted
And we have them tell stories about issues in their community in their community that they care about.,ted
"And this is in Peru, where the kids told the story about a river that they cleaned up.",ted
"And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops, and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling, and have them work with the kids.",ted
"And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in, and this has worked the best.",ted
This is teaching Photoshop in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala.,ted
"We have the website, where the kids all get their homepage.",ted
"We've got about 60 movies that these kids have made, and they're quite incredible.",ted
"The one I want to show you - after we get them to make the movies, we have a night where we show the movies to the community.",ted
"And this is in Takaungu - we've got a generator and a digital projector, and we're projecting it up against a barn, and showing one of the movies that they made.",ted
"And if you get a chance, you can go to our website, and you'll see the incredible work these kids do.",ted
The other thing: I wanted to give indigenous people a voice.,ted
But the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country.,ted
National Geographic just did a Roper Study of 18 to 26 year olds in our country and in nine other industrialized countries.,ted
And this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago.,ted
"So what I'd like to show you now, in the couple of minutes I have left, is a film that a student made in Guatemala.",ted
"A week before we got to the workshop, a massive landslide, caused by Hurricane Stan, last October, came in and buried 600 people alive in their village.",ted
And he hadn't seen a computer before we did this movie.,ted
"We taught him Photoshop and - yeah, we can play it.",ted
This is an old Mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather.,ted
"Well, I thought there would be a podium, so I'm a bit scared.",ted
Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA.,ted
"And since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it.",ted
"So I'll say something - - I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made, and why Francis and I found it.",ted
"And then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now.",ted
In back of me is a picture of me when I was 17.,ted
"I was at the University of Chicago, in my third year, and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago let you in after two years of high school.",ted
"So you - it was fun to get away from high school - - because I was very small, and I was no good in sports, or anything like that.",ted
"But I should say that my background - my father was, you know, raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican, but after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat.",ted
"And by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday Mass, and going on birdwatching walks with my father.",ted
"And, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution.",ted
"And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major, and thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough, maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology.",ted
"Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book called What is Life?",ted
"And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.",ted
"You know, Darwin explained life after it got started, but what was the essence of life?",ted
"And Schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes, and it had to be present on a molecule.",ted
"You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule, and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form.",ted
"And so, from that moment on, I wanted to be a geneticist",ted
"So I had, you know, a hero at a distance.",ted
"So I went to Indiana, which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics, and besides, they had a really good basketball team.",ted
"I got the impression that, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA.",ted
"And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.",ted
"So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well, maybe I could become a biochemist, but I discovered biochemistry was very boring.",ted
"It wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was; it was just nuclear science.",ted
"And there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program, and he talked about DNA.",ted
"But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet, and he showed this x-ray photograph.",ted
"So DNA had a structure, even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions.",ted
"So I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher, and I ended up in Cambridge, England.",ted
"So I went to Cambridge, because it was really the best place in the world then for x-ray crystallography.",ted
"And x-ray crystallography is now a subject in, you know, chemistry departments.",ted
"I mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists.",ted
So the best place for x-ray crystallography was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.,ted
"And within a day, we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA.",ted
But just ask what the molecule - how should it fold up?,ted
"And the reason for doing so, at the center of this photograph, is Linus Pauling.",ted
"About six months before, he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins.",ted
"And in doing so, he banished the man out on the right, Sir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor.",ted
"This is a photograph several years later, when Bragg had cause to smile.",ted
"He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there, because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix, and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists.",ted
"And certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists, so we tried to build a model.",ted
"X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix.",ted
"Wilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator, Rosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model.",ted
So we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent.,ted
"And so we didn't build any models, and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins.",ted
"You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts.",ted
And we kept telling the people in London that Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA.,ted
"He'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped.",ted
"And, in fact, he'd written the people in London:",ted
"But about, oh, 15 months after I got to Cambridge, a rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son, who was in Cambridge, that his father was now working on DNA.",ted
"And so, one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling, and he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts.",ted
"And boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped.",ted
"And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.",ted
"And I read it, and it was just - it was crap.",ted
"So this was, you know, unexpected from the world's - - and",ted
"We rushed over to the chemistry department and said, Could Pauling be right?",ted
"And, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong.",ted
"And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript - I should say I took the manuscript to London, and showed the people.",ted
"Well, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game and that they should immediately start building models.",ted
"Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months, and after she left he would start building models.",ted
"And so I came back with that news to Cambridge, and Bragg said,",ted
"She really, you know, in one sense she was a chemist, but really she would have been trained",ted
"And I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models was, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist.",ted
"And so Crick and I, you know, started building models, and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough.",ted
"Well, we got the answer on the 28th February '53.",ted
"And it was because of a rule, which, to me, is a very good rule:",ted
"Never be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't.",ted
"I went in and showed them a pairing I'd done, and Jerry Donohue - he was a chemist - he said,",ted
You've got - the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place.,ted
"So the next day, you know, after I thought, Well, he might be right.",ted
"So I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing, and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions.",ted
"So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours.",ted
"So in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information.",ted
"So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it, because you didn't have any other scheme.",ted
"They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right.",ted
"But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right.",ted
"The next five years, there were essentially something like five references to our work in Nature - none.",ted
"And so we were left by ourselves, and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you - what does this genetic information do?",ted
"It was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein?",ted
"It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.",ted
But there is what we did when we didn't know where to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club.,ted
"George Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie.",ted
The question was: How do you go from a four-letter code to the 20-letter code of proteins?,ted
"Feynman was a member, and Teller, and friends of Gamow.",ted
"But that's the only - no, we were only photographed twice.",ted
"And on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie.",ted
"There's Francis up on the upper right, and Alex Rich - the M.D.-turned-crystallographer - is next to me.",ted
"And I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think, because the girl I had, boy, she was gone.",ted
"And so I didn't really get happy until 1960, because then we found out, basically, you know, that there are three forms of RNA.",ted
"And we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA.",ted
"And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA - synthetic RNA - put it in a system making protein.",ted
"So that's the first cracking of the genetic code, and it was all over by 1966.",ted
"So there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was - so what happened since then?",ted
"When we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk at Cold Spring Harbor.",ted
"The physicist, Leo Szilard, he looked at me and said, Are you going to patent this?",ted
"And - but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it, because you couldn't.",ted
"At least they patented something which, you know, could do useful things.",ted
"And then, they learned how to read the letters for the code.",ted
"And, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry.",ted
"And, but we were still a long ways from, you know, answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood, which is: How do you nature-nurture?",ted
"I'm already out of time, but this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician turned physicist.",ted
"And he developed a technique which essentially will let us look at sample DNA and, eventually, a million spots along it.",ted
"Then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in Madison called NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix.",ted
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer.,ted
And you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions.,ted
"So the DNA is really badly mucked up, whereas if you have a chance of surviving, the DNA isn't so mucked up.",ted
So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call DNA biopsies.,ted
"Before you get treated for cancer, you should really look at this technique, and get a feeling of the face of the enemy.",ted
"So, we started with breast cancer because there's lots of money for it, no government money.",ted
And now I have a sort of vested interest: I want to do it for prostate cancer.,ted
"So, you know, you aren't treated if it's not dangerous.",ted
"But Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells, and made a really sort of surprising observation.",ted
"Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one.",ted
"And the question is well, if we're around here, you know, these little losses or gains might not be too bad.",ted
"But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene, maybe we'll feel sick.",ted
And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it.,ted
"And the parent of a child with Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism, had sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it.",ted
"Couldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism.",ted
"And you can see here, there are a lot of them.",ted
So a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of DNA.,ted
"We saw one autistic kid, about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes.",ted
"We haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably don't have that loss, or they wouldn't be parents.",ted
"And so, I'll conclude by saying we've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia.",ted
And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture.,ted
"But as you can see, there's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high.",ted
"And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure, and whether this is one that predisposes - and",ted
"Now, some people who think they're right-handed are genetically left-handed.",ted
"I'm just saying that, if you think, oh, I don't carry a left-handed gene",ted
We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar; there's a relationship.,ted
"And if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.",ted
Let me show you some images of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow.,ted
"So, that's Kibera, the largest squatter community in Nairobi.",ted
"This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Bombay, India, what's called Mumbai these days.",ted
"This is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela in Rio de Janeiro.",ted
"And this is Sultanbelyi, which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul.",ted
"They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow, the new urban world.",ted
"To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here, his name is Julius.",ted
And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera.,ted
They're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly.,ted
"And I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi, and he's one of many.",ted
"So, close to 200,000 people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas.",ted
"That's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week, but almost 1.4 million people a week",ted
"And if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute.",ted
"So, that'll be - in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here, between",ted
"Today - a billion squatters, one in six people on the planet.",ted
"And the estimate is that in 2050, there'll be three billion squatters, better than one in three people on earth.",ted
"So, these are the cities of the future, and we have to engage them.",ted
Because I think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is.,ted
"So - The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.",ted
Armstrong and his friends had no water - they bought it from a nearby tap owner - no toilet - the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine - and no sewers or sanitation.,ted
"They did have electricity, but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires, and could only power one feeble bulb.",ted
"This was Southland, a small shanty community on the western side of Nairobi, Kenya.",ted
"But it could've been anywhere in the city, because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.",ted
"In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out.",ted
"They called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz.",ted
Hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes; the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof; and we perspired as we ate.,ted
"After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie, put on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare.",ted
Outside a mound of garbage formed the border between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata.,ted
"It was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide.",ted
"As we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash.",ted
They couldn't have been more than five or six years old.,ted
"They were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile.",ted
"I thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong.",ted
"Once atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts, squatted, and defecated.",ted
"When 20 families - 100 people or so - share a single latrine, a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing.",ted
But it stood in jarring contrast to something Armstrong had said as we were eating - that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood.,ted
"Instead, the human spirit radiated out from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something no legal neighborhood could: freedom. '",ted
"Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.'",ted
"He meant back beyond that mountain of trash, back in the legal city, of legal buildings, with legal leases and legal rights. '",ted
"Once you have stayed here,' he said, 'you can stay for the rest of your life.'",ted
"So, he has hope, and this is where these communities start.",ted
"This is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera, little more than a stick-and-mud hut next to a garbage heap.",ted
"This is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right?",ted
"We're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs, and plaster over the brick, some color, and this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi, and it's getting even better.",ted
He's got a fence; he scavenged a door; he's got new tile on the roof.,ted
And then you get Rocinha and you can see that it's getting even better.,ted
"They develop - you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other, room, after room, after room.",ted
All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick.,ted
"And then you get Sultanbelyi, in Turkey, where it's even built to a higher level of design.",ted
"The crud in the front is mattress stuffing, and you see that all over Turkey.",ted
People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs.,ted
"But the green building, on behind, you can see that the top floor is not occupied, so people are building with the possibility of expansion.",ted
"And then you finally get squatter homes like this, which is built on the suburban model.",ted
"Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community.",ted
"This is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavea, and there's a bus route that runs through it, lots of people out on the street.",ted
These communities in these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities.,ted
This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a beco - these are how you get around the community.,ted
"They're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio, and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions.",ted
"And these becos are normally very crowded, and people hump furniture up them, or refrigerators up them, all sorts of things.",ted
"This is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks, so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way.",ted
"This is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market, lots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy.",ted
It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built.,ted
"This here, on the right-hand side, is what's called a - if you look at the fine print under the awning - it's a hotel.",ted
"And what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place.",ted
"People tap in and they have thieves who are called grillos or crickets, and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood.",ted
"People burn trash to get rid of the garbage, and they dig their own sewer channels.",ted
"And when they have more money they cement their streets, and they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that.",ted
"People run their water pipes all over the place, and that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do: they steal electricity",ted
"So, the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village, to the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi?",ted
"That does not necessarily mean property rights, and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question, because property rights create a lot of complications.",ted
"They're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt, and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt.",ted
"There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don't work in these cases, but they do need security of tenure.",ted
"And they need access to politics, and that can mean two things.",ted
"That can mean community organizing from below, but it can also mean possibilities from above.",ted
"And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people in the community, you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality.",ted
"And when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics.",ted
"You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes, provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.",ted
She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai.,ted
That's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median.,ted
"This is Richard Muthama Peter, and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera.",ted
"He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood, and the people in the neighborhood, and is a great resource in the community.",ted
"And finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio, the fruit merchant with his two kids here, and a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know.",ted
The future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people.,ted
"So, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book, from what Armstrong said, and from all these people, is that these are neighborhoods.",ted
"Charles Van Doren, who was later a senior editor of Britannica, said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical - it should stop being safe.",ted
"But if you know anything about the history of Britannica since 1962, it was anything but radical: still a very completely safe, stodgy type of encyclopedia.",ted
So Wikipedia - you just saw the little demonstration of it - it's a freely licensed encyclopedia.,ted
"It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many, many languages.",ted
"It's written using wiki software - which is the type of software he just demonstrated - so anyone can quickly edit and save, and it goes live on the Internet immediately.",ted
And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff.,ted
"So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization, he's exactly describing Wikipedia.",ted
And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside.,ted
"So Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, which I founded, a nonprofit organization.",ted
"And our goal, the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation, is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.",ted
"And so, if you think about what that means, it means a lot more than just building a cool website.",ted
"We're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide, poverty worldwide, empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions.",ted
And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet.,ted
So there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world.,ted
"We're funded by donations from the public, and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia.",ted
So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was.,ted
And I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is.,ted
"We've got two million total articles across many, many different languages.",ted
"The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French - all the Western-European languages are quite big.",ted
"But only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia, which is surprising to a lot of people.",ted
"A lot of people think in a very English-centric way on the Internet, but for us, we're truly global.",ted
How popular we've gotten to be - we're a top-50 website and we're more popular than the New York Times.,ted
This shows the growth of Wikipedia - we're the blue line there - and this is the New York Times over there.,ted
"We have exactly one employee, and that employee is our lead software developer.",ted
And the way that we're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine.,ted
"People are always asking, Well, who's in charge of this?",ted
"I can go online any time of the day or night and see eight to 10 people waiting for me to ask a question or something, anything about the servers.",ted
You could never afford to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day and do what we're doing at Wikipedia.,ted
"So we're doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly, so it's really gotten to be a huge thing.",ted
"And the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars.",ted
"We hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia, so we actually hired him, so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes.",ted
"So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is, why isn't it all rubbish?",ted
"It isn't perfect, but it's much better than you would expect, given our completely chaotic model.",ted
"So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me, you think, Oh, this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish.",ted
But when we've seen quality tests - and there haven't been enough of these yet,ted
"So a German magazine compared German Wikipedia, which is much, much smaller than English, to Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial, and we won across the board.",ted
"They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality, and we were very pleased with that result.",ted
So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy.,ted
"The reporters called me up and they - I mean, I have to say they spelled my name right, but they really wanted to say the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious",ted
"And so they quote me as saying, They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia.",ted
And it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions.,ted
"Time magazine recently reported that Extreme action sometimes has to be taken, and Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004.",ted
This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for - occasionally a little bit here and there.,ted
So the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all.,ted
"Articles on controversial topics are edited a lot, but they don't cause much controversy within the community.",ted
And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality.,ted
The real struggle is not between the right and the left - that's where most people assume - but it's between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks.,ted
And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities.,ted
Sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly.,ted
"So there's a few elements, mostly social policies and some elements of the software.",ted
So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy.,ted
"This is something that I set down, from the very beginning, as a core principle of the community that's completely not debatable.",ted
"It's a social concept of cooperation, so we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity.",ted
We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it.,ted
So this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done.,ted
"So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political, religious, cultural backgrounds.",ted
"If you engage in that type of behavior, you'll be asked to leave the community.",ted
Every single change on the site goes to the Recent changes page.,ted
"So as soon as he made his change, it went to the Recent changes page.",ted
"That recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel, which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools.",ted
And people can get RSS feeds - they can get email notifications of changes.,ted
"So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists, because it is sometimes vandalized.",ted
"And therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly, and then they'll just simply revert the change.",ted
"There's a new pages feed, for example, so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it's created.",ted
"This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted, you know, ASDFASDF.",ted
"But also, that's some of the most interesting and fun things, some of the new articles.",ted
"People will start an article on some interesting topic, other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much better.",ted
"So we do have edits by anonymous users, which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia.",ted
"So, Chris was able to do his change - he didn't have to log in or anything; he just went on the website and made a change.",ted
But it turns out that only about 18 percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users.,ted
"These are the people who are doing the bulk of the site, and they are, in a sense, semi-professionals at what they're doing.",ted
The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality.,ted
"We don't always meet those standards, but that's what we're striving for.",ted
"And so that tight community is who really cares for the site, and these are some of the smartest people I've ever met.",ted
"It's my job to say that, but it's actually true.",ted
The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people.,ted
"The tools and the software: there's lots of tools that allow us - allow us, meaning the community - to self-monitor and to monitor all the work.",ted
"This is an example of a page history on flat Earth, and you can see some changes that were made.",ted
"What's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see, OK,",ted
"When somebody goes and looks at - they see that someone, an anonymous IP number, made an edit to my page.",ted
"Somebody looks at it - they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place - to see, OK, well, these words have changed, things like this.",ted
So that's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page.,ted
Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended.,ted
Most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open-ended in the software.,ted
And so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules.,ted
The example I've got up here is the Votes for Deletion page.,ted
"So, I mentioned earlier, people type ASDFASDF - it needs to be deleted.",ted
"But you can imagine there's a lot of other areas where the question is, is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia?",ted
So we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this.,ted
And so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page.,ted
"The Google test is you look in Google and see if it's there, because if something's not even in Google, it probably doesn't exist at all.",ted
"It's not a perfect rule, but it's a nice starting point for quick research.",ted
"I found it in a book, 'Film Threat Video Guide: the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'",ted
And what's interesting about this is that the software is - these votes are just text typed into a page.,ted
This is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue.,ted
"Now it is true that at the end of the day, an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say, OK, 18 deletes",ted
"But in other cases, this could be 18 deletes and two keeps, and we would keep it, because if those last two keeps say, Wait a minute.",ted
"Down here at the bottom, Keep, real movie, RickK. RickK is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism, hoaxes and votes for deletion.",ted
His voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he's doing.,ted
That doesn't mean that they have the right to delete pages.,ted
They still have to follow all the rules - but they're elected by the community.,ted
Sometimes people - random trolls on the Internet - like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia.,ted
"I always laugh at this, because I have no idea how they're elected, actually.",ted
"You got a hint of that when I mentioned, like, RickK's voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don't know.",ted
"And I always embarrass her because I say, Well, Angela, for example, could get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia, because she's so admired and so powerful.",ted
"But the irony is, of course, that Angela can do this because she's the one person who you know would never, ever break any rules of Wikipedia.",ted
"I was describing this in Berlin once, and the next day in the newspaper",ted
"And that's not exactly what I said, but - the point is my role in the community -",ted
"Within the free software world, there's been a long-standing tradition of the benevolent dictator model.",ted
"So if you look at most of the major free software projects, they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator.",ted
"But there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy, a certain amount of - sometimes we have to make a decision",ted
"So as an example of how this can be important: we recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia, and they said, Oh, well, this is horrible,",ted
"And we see they have a voting process, so we're going to send - we have 40,000 members and we're going to send them over",ted
"They always think they've got 40,000 members when they've got 18.",ted
But they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article.,ted
"Of course, the vote ended up being about 85 to 18, so there was no real danger to our democratic processes.",ted
What if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote?,ted
"Then I said, Well, fuck it, we'll just change the rules.",ted
That's my job in the community: to say we won't allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content.,ted
"And so, as long as people trust me in my role, then that's a valid place for me.",ted
"Of course, because of the free licensing, if I do a bad job, the volunteers are more than happy to take and",ted
"So the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works, it's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work, but we are not fanatical web anarchists.",ted
"Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success.",ted
It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased.,ted
Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia changing education?,ted
"Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia.",ted
"There's a media storyline about Wikipedia, which I think is false.",ted
"And the storyline is, there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia, but academics hate it and teachers hate it.",ted
"The last time I got an email from a journalist saying, Why do academics hate Wikipedia?",ted
I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently appointed a fellow there.,ted
"And I said, Well, they don't all hate it.",ted
"And we actually have a project that I'm personally really excited about, which is the Wikibooks project, which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages.",ted
It's going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition.,ted
But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.,ted
We don't mean we're going to Spam them with AOL-style CDs.,ted
We mean we're going to give them a tool that they can use.,ted
And I think that we're going to see - it may not even come from us; there's all kinds of innovation going on.,ted
"We've heard a lot about the promise of technology, and the peril.",ted
"If we could convert 0.03 percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy, we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030.",ted
"We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy, expensive and very inefficient.",ted
Nano-engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it's needed.,ted
"Bono spoke very eloquently, that we have the tools, for the first time, to address age-old problems of disease and poverty.",ted
"In 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region, there were 500 million people living in poverty - that number now is under 200 million.",ted
"The World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million, which is a reduction of 95 percent.",ted
I did enjoy Bono's comment linking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley.,ted
"Being from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself, I'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s, although we hung around Harvard Square.",ted
"But we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty, and I'm going to talk about those issues, if we have the will.",ted
"That's been a strong interest of mine, and a theme that I've developed for some 30 years.",ted
I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project.,ted
"That invariably, the world was a different place when I would introduce a technology.",ted
"So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends, and track where technology would be at different points in time, and began to build the mathematical models of that.",ted
"I've got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather data on key measures of technology in many different areas, and we build models.",ted
"And you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future.",ted
"And if you ask me, will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now",ted
Will WiMax CDMA G3 be the wireless standard three years from now?,ted
"There are remarkably smooth exponential curves that govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth.",ted
"And I'm going to show you a small sample of this, but there's really a theoretical reason why technology develops in an exponential fashion.",ted
"And a lot of people, when they think about the future, think about it linearly.",ted
"They think they're going to continue to develop a problem or address a problem using today's tools, at today's pace of progress, and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth.",ted
"We had our best Ph.D. students, our most advanced equipment around the world, we got 1/10,000th of the project done, so how're we going to get this done in 15 years?",ted
"And 10 years into the project, the skeptics were still going strong - says,",ted
"You're two-thirds through this project, and you've managed to only sequence a very tiny percentage of the whole genome.",ted
"But it's the nature of exponential growth that once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes.",ted
Most of the project was done in the last few years of the project.,ted
It took us 15 years to sequence HIV - we sequenced SARS in 31 days.,ted
I'm going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is.,ted
"The actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas, is doubling every decade, according to our models.",ted
"These are all logarithmic graphs, so as you go up the levels it represents, generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100.",ted
"It took us half a century to adopt the telephone, the first virtual-reality technology.",ted
"If you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph, television, radio, telephone were adopted in decades.",ted
"Recent technologies - like the PC, the web, cell phones - were under a decade.",ted
"Now this is an interesting chart, and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process - and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes - accelerate.",ted
"They work through interaction - they create a capability, and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage.",ted
"So the first step in biological evolution, the evolution of DNA - actually it was RNA came",ted
"So the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals were evolved, took only 10 million years.",ted
"And then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions, and biological evolution kept accelerating.",ted
"So Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species, the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage - and by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb -",ted
"And the first step took tens of thousands of years - stone tools, fire, the wheel - kept accelerating.",ted
We always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation.,ted
Printing press took a century to be adopted; the first computers were designed pen-on-paper - now we use computers.,ted
"You have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements, what the key points are, there's differences of opinion when agriculture started, or how long the Cambrian Explosion took.",ted
"Information technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth, every year.",ted
"A personal experience, when I was at MIT - computer taking up about the size of this room, less powerful than the computer in your cell phone.",ted
"But Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth, is just one example of many, because it's basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology.",ted
"I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph - by the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth - that's another exponential.",ted
"It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900, two years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year.",ted
"Every time one paradigm ran out of steam, another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth.",ted
"In fact, when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm, it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm.",ted
"And because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law for quite a long time - the first prediction said 2002, until now it says 2022.",ted
"But by the teen years, the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width, and we won't be able to shrink them any more.",ted
"That'll be the end of Moore's Law, but it won't be the end of the exponential growth of computing, because chips are flat.",ted
We live in a three-dimensional world; we might as well use the third dimension.,ted
"We will go into the third dimension and there's been tremendous progress, just in the last few years, of getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work.",ted
We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam.,ted
"Processor performance on Intel chips, the average price of a transistor - 1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar.",ted
"You would think it would be a very erratic process, and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process.",ted
"We can't predict any particular project, but the result of this whole worldwide, chaotic, unpredictable activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable.",ted
"Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses, it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor.",ted
"As we make them smaller and less expensive, the electrons have less distance to travel.",ted
"They're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors, so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years.",ted
"You add other forms of innovation and processor design, you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year.",ted
"I mean, it's true of DNA sequencing; it's true of brain scanning; it's true of the World Wide Web.",ted
"In terms of price performance, that's a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate.",ted
"We had deflation during the Depression, but that was collapse of the money supply, collapse of consumer confidence, a completely different phenomena.",ted
"This is due to greater productivity, but the economist says, But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that.",ted
"If you have 50 percent deflation, people may increase their volume 30, 40 percent, but they won't keep up with it.",ted
But what we're actually seeing is that we actually more than keep up with it.,ted
We've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars in information technology over the last 50 years.,ted
"I mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago.",ted
"As the price performance makes new applications feasible, new applications come to the market.",ted
A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology in these information terms.,ted
These were evolved in very different times - we'd like to actually change those programs.,ted
"One little software program, called the fat insulin receptor gene, basically says, Hold onto every calorie, because the next hunting season may not work out so well.",ted
That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago.,ted
"They tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenously and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim.",ted
They didn't get diabetes; they didn't get heart disease; they lived 20 percent longer; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction without the restriction.,ted
"Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this, felt that would be interesting drug for the human market, and that's just one of the 30,000 genes that affect our biochemistry.",ted
There are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material in the right place on the chromosome.,ted
"There's actually a - for the first time now, something going to human trials, that actually cures pulmonary hypertension - a fatal disease - using gene therapy.",ted
"So we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers.",ted
"It cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990, then a penny in 2000.",ted
"The amount of genetic data - basically this shows that smooth exponential growth doubled every year, enabling the genome project to be completed.",ted
"The price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways; wired, wireless is growing exponentially.",ted
"The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to, measured many different ways.",ted
"Miniaturization - we're shrinking the size of technology at an exponential rate, both wired and wireless.",ted
"These are some designs from Eric Drexler's book - which we're now showing are feasible with super-computing simulations, where actually there are scientists building molecule-scale robots.",ted
"One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait, that's built out of molecules.",ted
The most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions.,ted
There's one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes.,ted
"They put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell - they tried this in rats - it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion, and actually cures type 1 diabetes.",ted
"Once we understand its principles of operation, and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating, we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable.",ted
"You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours - so, Honey, I'm in the pool, will take on a whole new meaning.",ted
It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials.,ted
"Presumably we'll ban them, but then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms routinely out-performing the Olympic athletes.",ted
"These are 2020-circa scenarios, but they're not as futuristic as it may sound.",ted
There are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices; there are many experiments in animals.,ted
"There's actually one going into human trial, so this is feasible technology.",ted
"If we come back to our exponential growth of computing, 1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain.",ted
"It will intersect human intelligence in terms of capacity in the 2020s, but that'll be the hardware side of the equation.",ted
"Well, it turns out we can see inside the human brain, and in fact not surprisingly, the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.",ted
"This is a block diagram of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well - in applying psychoacoustic tests, gets very similar results to human auditory perception.",ted
"There's another simulation of the cerebellum - that's more than half the neurons in the brain - again, works very similarly to human skill formation.",ted
We've already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions out of the several hundred.,ted
We've had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour of labor in the last 50 years.,ted
"You might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust?",ted
"All right, this is a technology that we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in.",ted
"They'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment.",ted
"Images will be written directly to our retina, providing full-immersion virtual reality, augmented real reality.",ted
"I mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-power greater price performance, capacity and bandwidth of these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal.",ted
It'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today.,ted
"We'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain, 1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity.",ted
"Computers will combine the subtle pan-recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior, in terms of doing analytic thinking, remembering billions of facts accurately.",ted
"These nano-bots I mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications: cleaning up the environment, providing powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment.",ted
"But they'll also go inside our brain, interact with our biological neurons.",ted
We've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this.,ted
"You can go there with other people, have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses.",ted
"Experience beamers, I call them, will put their whole flow of sensory experiences in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet.",ted
You can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else.,ted
"But most importantly, it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology, which in some sense we're doing already.",ted
We routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology.,ted
"It was 37 in 1800, and with this sort of biotechnology, nano-technology revolutions, this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead.",ted
"My main message is that progress in technology is exponential, not linear.",ted
"Many - even scientists - assume a linear model, so they'll say, Oh, it'll be hundreds of years before we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly or artificial intelligence.",ted
"If you really look at the power of exponential growth, you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand.",ted
"And information technology is increasingly encompassing all of our lives, from our music to our manufacturing to our biology to our energy to materials.",ted
"We'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s, from information, in very inexpensive raw materials, using nano-technology.",ted
So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems.,ted
"I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together, and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.",ted
"I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.",ted
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging.,ted
"Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year - or indeed, to get sick in the first place.",ted
"And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step, that point of maybe 30 years life extension.",ted
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?,ted
Hands up: anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?,ted
"That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.",ted
"Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.",ted
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.,ted
"I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here, but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.",ted
"And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.",ted
"You know, a lot of people said, Well, you know, city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.",ted
"It's a traditional part of the way of life, and we should be allowed to carry on doing it.",ted
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes.,ted
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades.,ted
"It's not just about life, of course - - it's about healthy life, you know - getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun.",ted
"So really, this is how I would like to describe it.",ted
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging.,ted
"And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless.",ted
"But these are completely crazy, when you actually remember your sense of proportion.",ted
"You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about.",ted
"But the question is, are they so dangerous - these risks of doing something about aging - that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite, namely, leaving aging as it is?",ted
"Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?",ted
"You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, is what I say.",ted
"Now, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.",ted
"And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids, and kids are really important to most people.",ted
"And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question, and give answers like this.",ted
"I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.",ted
"We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate, or a high death rate.",ted
"A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies, in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.",ted
"And, I say that that's fine - the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.",ted
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.,ted
"So the next thing is, now why should we get a little bit more active on this?",ted
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.,ted
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.,ted
"Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all.",ted
"But of course, that only works when we have both of these components.",ted
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear - and we might be in range of doing something about aging -,ted
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.,ted
"And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.",ted
"Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place, which is to say, metabolism.",ted
This is not a completely tautological statement; it's a reasonable statement.,ted
"So basically, metabolism, which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next, has side effects.",ted
"So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.",ted
"And there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.",ted
"Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle, because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on.",ted
"The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface, because, you know, prevention is better than cure.",ted
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.,ted
"In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work - even cells",ted
"Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end, but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention.",ted
"I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it?",ted
"Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two.",ted
"What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today - or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive - would actually live?",ted
"In order to answer that question - you might think it's simple, but it's not simple.",ted
"Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer.",ted
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.,ted
"There are two sorts of technological progress really, for this purpose.",ted
"There are fundamental, major breakthroughs, and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.",ted
"Now, they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames.",ted
Fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough.,ted
"It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun, and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.",ted
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight.,ted
"We can think, really, that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.",ted
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore.,ted
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.,ted
"Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line, happening of course a bit later.",ted
"I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics - you know, the same sort of time frame.",ted
"So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago, isn't a step at all.",ted
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.,ted
"In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.",ted
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.,ted
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough.,ted
"They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.",ted
"I decided to give this a little name, which is longevity escape velocity.",ted
"But if you're only 50, then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive",ted
"And of course, if you're a bit younger than that, then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.",ted
"And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.",ted
"I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse, which basically means mice that live about three years on average.",ted
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.,ted
"And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them, and with those therapies, we get them to live, on average, to their fifth birthday.",ted
"The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone",ted
"Which we can now, as I've explained, equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.",ted
"Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things, starting from the time we get the mice?",ted
"And thirdly, the question is, what will it do to actually how much people want it?",ted
"And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question, and it's extremely hard to answer.",ted
"One has to be very speculative, and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation, that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.",ted
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.,ted
"We need to give our best guess as to the time frame, in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities.",ted
"So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone, robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.",ted
"They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.",ted
"That will be history at this point, because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans, since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.",ted
"So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes, and of course that has enormous implications.",ted
"So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice, I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.",ted
I'm going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology.,ted
"Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology, the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.",ted
"We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage.",ted
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment.,ted
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology.,ted
And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.,ted
"So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.",ted
"We can call it the engineering approach, and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.",ted
"And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle, and it's something that we are within range of being able to do, because it doesn't involve improving on evolution.",ted
"We know that this threshold exists, because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age, even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.",ted
"If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another.",ted
"It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related, and it's just an incomplete list.",ted
"They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.",ted
"Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.",ted
"First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.",ted
"Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.",ted
"So of course, there are some biologists in the audience, and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.",ted
"You may have been dissatisfied with this talk, but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.",ted
"I've published a great deal on this; I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based, and there's quite a lot of detail there.",ted
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.,ted
"So if you think that I'm wrong, you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.",ted
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists,ted
"So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework, in order to understand whether this is true.",ted
"But, I mean, look - how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?",ted
"It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech, but it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this.",ted
"Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it, why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?",ted
Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.,ted
"However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die, so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.",ted
"So, why does - evolution has - seems to have selected against immortality, when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?",ted
Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.,ted
"I read somewhere that in the last 20 years, the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.",ted
"If I project that, that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.",ted
"That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?",ted
The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade.,ted
"So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.",ted
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.,ted
"I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo, and that the brain cells last 80 years or so.",ted
"If that is indeed true, biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?",ted
"If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years, as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?",ted
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification.,ted
"As a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many.",ted
"It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted, and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out.",ted
And one of those I'd like to share with you today.,ted
"I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago, back before the sky turned blue.",ted
There's stromatolites down there - the first living things to capture photosynthesis - and it's the only place they still occur today.,ted
"Going down there was like entering a time capsule, and I came out with a different sense of myself in time.",ted
The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today.,ted
I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time.,ted
"It's a story about you and me, nature and science.",ted
"And with that said, I'd like to invite you for a short, brief journey of life through time.",ted
"The fire gave way, Earth emerged - but this was an alien planet.",ted
Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth.,ted
"Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force.",ted
"And where that energy touches water, something new emerges: life.",ted
Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate.,ted
"Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed into more complex forms.",ted
"Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs, among the first to leave the sea.",ted
"They still do what they've done for ages, their enemies long gone.",ted
"Once they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape.",ted
"The fundamental forms of ferns followed, to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds.",ted
"It took time for life to break away from water, and it still beckons all the time.",ted
"Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar, and the center of Brazil, where plants called cycads remain rock hard.",ted
"One early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday.",ted
"In Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree, and in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword.",ted
"Growing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price.",ted
A 'roo hops in Oz; a horse runs in Asia; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil.,ted
"Primates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first, becoming lemurs not much later.",ted
The blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the Earth.,ted
And our brains - our celebrated brains - reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.,ted
"And where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter, Mars is still not very far.",ted
"And where water is liquid, it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll - and that molecular marvel is what's made a difference - it powers everything.",ted
"The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly through plants and algae, and their waste is our breath, and vice versa.",ted
"This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.",ted
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next.,ted
"There's only one other person here, I think, who did that.",ted
"I talked about what the Media Lab was doing, which today has almost 500 people in it.",ted
"And if you read the press, last week it actually said I quit the Media Lab.",ted
"And I will now do for the rest of my life the One Laptop Per Child, which I've sort of been doing for a year and a half, anyway.",ted
"So I'm going to tell you about this, use my 18 minutes to tell you why we're doing it, how we're doing it",ted
And at some point I'll even pass around what the $100 laptop might be like.,ted
"I was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues, and so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this.",ted
"It's amazing when you meet a head of state, and you say, What is your most precious natural resource?",ted
"They will not say children at first, and then when you say, children, they will pretty quickly agree with you.",ted
"Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems, they include education, sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education.",ted
So with those as the principles - some of you may know Seymour Papert.,ted
"This is back in 1982, when we were working in Senegal.",ted
"It didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries and learning pretty quickly that these kids,",ted
"And these are two anecdotes - one was in Cambodia, in a village that has no electricity, no water, no television, no telephone, but has broadband Internet now.",ted
"And these kids, their first English word is Google and they only know Skype.",ted
And they go home at night - they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity.,ted
"The parents love it, because when they open up the laptops, it's the brightest light source in the house.",ted
And talk about where metaphors and reality mix - this is the actual school.,ted
"In parallel with this, Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child in the year 2002.",ted
"Now at the time, I think it's fair to say that 80 percent of the teachers were - let me say, apprehensive.",ted
"And they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries, more schools, whatever.",ted
"And now, three and a half years later, guess what?",ted
"They're reporting five things: drop of truancy to almost zero, attending parent-teacher meetings - which nobody did and now almost everybody does - drop in discipline problems, increase in student participation.",ted
So when you see that kind of thing - this is not something that you have to test.,ted
"The days of pilot projects are over, when people say, We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works.",ted
"Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it, and then when you figure out that this works, you can join as well.",ted
"So, One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago.",ted
"It raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built, and then have it produced afterwards.",ted
"And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price, OK?",ted
"It's because you can go to a manufacturer - and I will leave the name out - but we wanted a small display, doesn't have to have perfect color uniformity.",ted
"And this particular manufacturer said, We're not interested in that.",ted
"And I said, That's kind of too bad, because we need 100 million units a year.",ted
"And they said, Oh, well, maybe we could become part of your strategic plan.",ted
And that's why we will not launch this without five to 10 million units in the first run.,ted
"And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down, and that's why I said seven to 10 million there.",ted
And we're doing it without a sales-and-marketing team.,ted
"I mean, you're looking at the sales-and-marketing team.",ted
"We will do it by going to seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it, and then the others can follow.",ted
It's the so-called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia.,ted
"Now once people start looking at this, they say, Ah, this is a laptop project.",ted
"Because laptop economics are the following: I say 50 percent here - it's more like 60, 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales, marketing, distribution and profit.",ted
"None of those figure into our cost, because first of all, we sell it at cost, and the governments distribute it.",ted
"Now the display on your laptop costs, in rough numbers, 10 dollars a diagonal inch.",ted
"It's the rest - that little brown box - that is pretty fascinating, because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself.",ted

"It'll be just like it was in 1985, when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512.",ted
"So you really can bring into a village, and then the villages can connect themselves, and you really can do it quite well.",ted
The dual mode display - the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors - isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight?,ted
"And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlighting most of the time, most cell phones.",ted
"Now, what we're doing is, we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit.",ted
And whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software is to be seen.,ted
"And when it's frontlit, it's black and white at three times the resolution.",ted
That's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now.,ted
"And in about 30 days, we'll know for sure whether this works.",ted
"And this is again something that people don't believe, but I really think it's quite true.",ted
So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with.,ted
"Before you do it, for the people down in simulcast - Nicholas Negroponte:",ted

They can decide - it's the federal government in each case.,ted
"It's kind of agonizing, because a lot of people say, Let's do it at the state level, because states are more nimble than the feds, just because of size.",ted
"And if you look at governments around the world, ministries of education tend to be the most conservative, and also the ones that have huge payrolls.",ted
"Everybody thinks they know about education, a lot of culture is built into it as well.",ted
"If you look at the countries, they're pretty geoculturally distributed.",ted
"Probably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed.",ted
We're purposely not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones.,ted
"And since I visit each one of those countries within at least every three months, I'm just going around the world every three weeks.",ted
Everybody says it's a $100 laptop - you can't do it.,ted
"We're coming in probably at 135, to start, then drift down.",ted

"The only criticism, and people really don't want to criticize this, because it is a humanitarian effort, a nonprofit effort and to criticize it is a little bit stupid, actually.",ted
"But the one thing that people could criticize was, Great idea, but these guys can't do it.",ted
"And that could either mean these guys, professors and so on couldn't do it, or that it's not possible.",ted
"Well, on December 12, a company called Quanta agreed to build it, and since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today, that question disappeared.",ted

"The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.",ted
"I'll talk first as an astronomer, and then as a worried member of the human race.",ted
But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.,ted
"And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning, to set our Earth in a cosmic context.",ted
"If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last Monday.",ted
"That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.",ted
"This artist's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.",ted
"It is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane - the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade.",ted
"If we go beyond our solar system, we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.",ted
Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.,ted
"And we can see places where stars are forming, like the Eagle Nebula.",ted
"And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion, leaving remnants like that.",ted
"On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.",ted
"And to the cosmologist, these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe.",ted
This picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about 100 patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky.,ted
"Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank, but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.",ted
"Each is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda, which looks so small and faint because its light has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.",ted
The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them.,ted
"We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang - a hot, dense state.",ted
So how did that amorphous Big Bang turn into our complex cosmos?,ted
"I'm going to show you a movie simulation 16 powers of 10 faster than real time, which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out.",ted
"But you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom, you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small, dense irregularities, and structures develop.",ted
And we'll end up after 13 billion years with something looking rather like our own universe.,ted
And we compare simulated universes like that - I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk - with what we actually see in the sky.,ted
"Well, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang, but we still don't know what banged and why it banged.",ted
We know our universes are united though - links between left and right.,ted
"The everyday world is determined by atoms, how they stick together to make molecules.",ted
Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together.,ted
"And, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter: particles in huge swarms, far smaller even than atomic nuclei.",ted
But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.,ted
"But the unfinished business for 21st-century science is to link together cosmos and micro-world with a unified theory - symbolized, as it were, gastronomically at the top of that picture.",ted
"And until we have that synthesis, we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom, quantum effects could shake everything.",ted
"And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small, which we don't yet have.",ted
"One idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space, just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper.",ted
"You can imagine ants on one of them thinking it's a two-dimensional universe, not being aware of another population of ants on the other.",ted
"So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours, but we're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension, and we're imprisoned in our three.",ted
And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we've normally called our universe - the aftermath of our Big Bang.,ted
"Bottom right depicts our universe, which on the horizon is not beyond that, but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality.",ted
"There's one challenge symbolized at the top, but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom.",ted
"You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small, but we want to understand the very complex.",ted
"And the most complex things are ourselves, midway between atoms and stars.",ted
We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of.,ted
"We clearly have to be large, compared to atoms, to have layer upon layer of complex structure.",ted
"We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets - otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity.",ted
It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us.,ted
"The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all, greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right.",ted
"And it's this science, which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world, but also transforming our world faster than ever.",ted
"And more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.",ted
"And I now move on to the second part of my talk, and the book Our Final Century was mentioned.",ted
"If I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself, and I would add that it's available in paperback.",ted
And in America it was called Our Final Hour because Americans like instant gratification.,ted
"But my theme is that in this century, not only has science changed the world faster than ever, but in new and different ways.",ted
"Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence, perhaps even implants into our brains, may change human beings themselves.",ted
"And human beings, their physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years.",ted
"And the human impact on the global environment - greenhouse warming, mass extinctions and so forth - is unprecedented, too.",ted
"Bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects, while, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources.",ted
"In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower just one fanatic, or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses, to trigger some kind on disaster.",ted
"Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure - error rather than terror.",ted
And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence.,ted
"In fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc.",ted
"I don't go along with all that, but it's interesting that he had a simple solution.",ted
He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits.,ted
"First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones.",ted
"And also, when a scientist makes a discovery, he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be.",ted
And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.,ted
But he was a moral compass - an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control.,ted
"And perhaps the greatest living person is someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.",ted
"He's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement.",ted
"He persuaded Einstein, as his last act, to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.",ted
"And I think to harness science optimally, to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed, we need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt.",ted
"We need not just campaigning physicists, but we need biologists, computer experts and environmentalists as well.",ted
"And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service, or company employees subject to commercial pressure.",ted
"I wrote my book, Our Final Century, as a scientist, just a general scientist.",ted
"But there's one respect, I think, in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective, and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future.",ted
"The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years, but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out.",ted
"On that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway.",ted
"And it'll be another six billion before that happens, and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.",ted
"There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there, experiencing the sun's demise, but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria.",ted
"The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond.",ted
So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our Earth and beyond.,ted
"But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective, our century is very, very special, the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet.",ted
"As I should have shown this earlier, it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun; it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.",ted
"When Einstein died in 1955, one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by Herblock in the Washington Post.",ted
"And I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image.",ted
"We've been familiar for 40 years with this image: the fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds, contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints.",ted
"But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years, but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth.",ted
"Over nearly all that immense time, Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually.",ted
The only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions.,ted
"But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history, the last one-millionth part, a few thousand years, the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before.",ted
Within just 50 years - that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age -,ted
The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves - the total output from all TV and cell phones and radar transmissions.,ted
"Metallic objects - albeit very small ones, a few tons at most - escaped into orbit around the Earth.",ted
A race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years.,ted
But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the Earth's life?,ted
These human-induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed?,ted
"If they continued their vigil, what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years?",ted
"Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth spawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?",ted
"The science done by the young Einstein will continue as long as our civilization, but for civilization to survive, we'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein - humane, global and farseeing.",ted
"And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth, far beyond the Earth as depicted here.",ted
"Actually, that's hello in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us.",ted
"Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers, to bring people into the process of creating things.",ted
I call this first chapter - for the Brits in the room - the Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious.,ted
"Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them.",ted
"And I think, a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go, Duh!",ted
"And rather than talk about it in the theory, I think I'm just going to show you an example.",ted
We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was.,ted
"Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.",ted
"We showed them the whole cut, and they were all completely, what is this?",ted
"And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.",ted
"And just putting yourself in the position of the patient - this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.",ted
"He just lay in the hospital bed, and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time.",ted
That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.,ted
"And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.",ted
"So, looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out - as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in - was, for these guys, quite a revelation.",ted
"It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.",ted
It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.,ted
So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.,ted
"You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror, so it created a tiny human interaction.",ted
"Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action - said, OK, we embrace this.",ted
Which I thought was really - I showed this to my mother recently.,ted
I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.,ted
"It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.",ted
"Not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers, but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.",ted
This is my personal space - was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.,ted
"So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room, which was lovely.",ted
"So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.",ted
"So this is not particularly a new idea, kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution.",ted
I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.,ted
"Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter - came down on a Saturday morning, saw her daughter watching the test card, waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street.",ted
Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship.,ted
"George de Mestral - this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock - was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs, sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.",ted
"So there's a whole series of just using your eyes, seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.",ted
"Second one, without sounding overly Zen, and this is a quote from the Buddha: Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things, is often a really interesting place to start.",ted
"So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision, is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.",ted
We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo - they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics.,ted
This was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.,ted
"And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.",ted
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place - and I'll explain this in a second - it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing.,ted
When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine - which was the procedure that this device's data was about; it was for pain management -,ted
"And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did, was hold the patient's hand to comfort them.",ted
Human gesture - which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.,ted
"So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy but much more human and practical, was this.",ted
"So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination, but it has a thumb-scroll",ted
"So, again, going back to this - the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product.",ted
"We use this phrase workarounds a lot, sort of, looking around us.",ted
I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here.,ted
"It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do, which have huge intention and huge opportunity.",ted
"People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.",ted
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?,ted
Because we kind of have to - we're just compelled to.,ted
"Again, we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions.",ted
And we're always saying to our clients: You should look at this stuff.,ted
"We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street, that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.",ted
"So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things.",ted
We co-opt other experiences - we take one item and transfer it to another.,ted
"My mother used to say to me, Just because your sister jumps in the lake",ted
"So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something, that's permission for them to do the same thing.",ted
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.,ted
"And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.",ted
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing.,ted
"Third section is this idea of not knowing, of consciously putting yourself backwards.",ted
"Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh.",ted
"A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA, and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children.",ted
This is the Billy bookcase - it's IKEA's biggest selling product.,ted
"Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me, because they're impossible to assemble.",ted
"The reality is when you actually watch children, children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.",ted
"They live around things, and so their spatial awareness relationship, and their thinking around storage is totally different.",ted
"So the first thing you have to do - this is Graham, the designer - is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes.",ted
"It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.",ted
"So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.",ted
"But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary, and I think that's one of the things.",ted
"I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win.",ted
"Again, that's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is: Where do we start?",ted
"So, again, we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.",ted
"And, again, as designers, we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.",ted
"The way it's produced, it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials.",ted
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.,ted
"So what seems like a very clunky product is, in fact, incredibly useful.",ted
It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster - you pump up and down on it.,ted
"It's turning these guys - again, one of the themes - it's turning them into entrepreneurs.",ted
"And for us, it's been great because it's won loads of design awards.",ted
So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning.,ted
"We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.",ted
"Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.",ted
"I've been asked to take the long view, and I'm going to tell you what I think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view.",ted
"Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers, which is encouraging.",ted
It seems that there's not just one person who thinks that these problems are important.,ted
"If you look at the statistics, the odds are not very favorable to us.",ted
Roughly 90 percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now.,ted
"So the annual death rate adds up to 150,000 - sorry, the daily death rate - 150,000 people per day, which is a huge number by any standard.",ted
"If we just look at the single, biggest cause of death - aging - it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die.",ted
That adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of Canada.,ted
"Sometimes, we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big.",ted
I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem.,ted
"Once you think about it, you see this is not statistical points; these are - let's see, how far have I talked?",ted
"So that would be, roughly, 324 people have died since I've begun speaking.",ted
People like - it's roughly the population in this room has just died.,ted
"Now, the human cost of that is obvious, once you start to think about it - the suffering, the loss - it's also, economically, enormously wasteful.",ted
"I just look at the information, and knowledge, and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general, and aging, in particular.",ted
A person's lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book.,ted
"It's one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember, even today.",ted
"But this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress - burnt down, forever lost - each year.",ted
"And I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey, and other people like him, to try to do something about this as soon as possible.",ted
"Existential risk is a threat to human survival, or to the long-term potential of our species.",ted
"Now, why do I say that this is a big problem?",ted
"Well, let's first look at the probability - and this is very, very difficult to estimate - but there have been only four studies on this in recent years, which is surprising.",ted
"You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big, but it's a very neglected area.",ted
"But there have been four studies - one by John Lesley, wrote a book on this.",ted
He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century: 50 percent.,ted
"Similarly, the Astronomer Royal, whom we heard speak yesterday, also has a 50 percent probability estimate.",ted
"Another author doesn't give any numerical estimate, but says the probability is significant that it will fail.",ted
I said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have.,ted
"Now, the exact figures here, we should take with a big grain of salt, but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial.",ted
Now one percent of six billion people is equivalent to 60 million.,ted
"If we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up, then the figure becomes astronomical.",ted
If we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe - the Virgo,ted
"Then, even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number - 10 to the power of 32.",ted
"So if you take into account future generations as much as our own, every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant.",ted
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve.,ted
"And even if you just look at the current people, and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct, it should still have a high priority.",ted
"Now, let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem, because it's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp.",ted
Think about some time in your life - some people might never have experienced it - but,ted
"It might have been at the moment of some great, creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage.",ted
Or an aesthetic experience - a sunset or a great piece of art.,ted
"Every once in a while we have these moments, and we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best.",ted
"And you wonder, why can't it be like that all the time?",ted
"And then, of course, it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades.",ted
"And it's really difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind, just how good life can be at its best.",ted
The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be.,ted
"Here are a number of things that we don't want - illness, involuntary death, unnecessary suffering, cruelty, stunted growth, memory loss, ignorance, absence of creativity.",ted
Suppose we fixed these things - we did something about all of these.,ted
"We might end up with something like this, which is - I mean,",ted
Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards?,ted
"And if we think about this, I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives.",ted
"If we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change?",ted
"Not just the way we think about the world, but the way we are - our very biology.",ted
"They do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition, but for most people, they don't really transform what it is to be human.",ted
"And they also all seem a little bit - most people have this instinct that, well, sure, there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people.",ted
But there's a kind of queasiness that these are unnatural in some way.,ted
It's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use.,ted
"As far as I can see, all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room, so that's a great thing.",ted
"So if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read, you're actually, literally rewriting your own brain.",ted
You're changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along.,ted
"So in a broad sense, we don't need to think about technology as only little gadgets, like these things here, but even institutions and techniques, psychological methods and so forth.",ted
"Looking ahead, there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later.",ted
"We are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are, but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws, laws of chemistry, etc.",ted
"It's possible to assume, setting aside a possibility of catastrophe, that sooner or later we will develop all of these.",ted
And even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition.,ted
So let's look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement.,ted
"Health span is a big and urgent thing, because if you're not alive, then all the other things will be to little avail.",ted
"Intellectual capacity - let's take that box, which falls into a lot of different sub-categories: memory, concentration, mental energy, intelligence, empathy.",ted
Part of the reason why we value these traits is that they make us better at competing with other people - they're positional goods.,ted
"It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with, and to remember what you have learned.",ted
"Now, the human mind is not a single unitary information processor, but it has a lot of different, special, evolved modules that do specific things for us.",ted
We're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it.,ted
"All of these would enable, in principle - be amenable to enhancement.",ted
Some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have.,ted
It's also interesting to think about what other things are - so,ted
Imagine a species that just didn't have this neural machinery for processing music.,ted
"But maybe they have another faculty, something else that would seem equally irrational to us, but they actually tap into some great possible value there.",ted
"So we could think of adding on different, new sensory capacities and mental faculties.",ted
"Be able to switch between relaxation and activity - being able to go slow when you need to do that, and to speed up.",ted
"Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do - easier to achieve the flow state, when you're totally immersed in something you are doing.",ted
"The ability to - it's another interesting application that would have large social ramification, perhaps.",ted
"If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person, undiminished through time, so that wouldn't have",ted
It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this.,ted
You can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it's naturally polygamous.,ted
"Might be more complicated in humans, but perhaps not that much.",ted
This is the last picture that I want to - now we've got to use the laser pointer.,ted
"A possible mode of being here would be a way of life - a way of being, experiencing, thinking, seeing, interacting with the world.",ted
"Down here in this little corner, here, we have the little sub-space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings - beings with our biological capacities.",ted
"It's a part of the space that's accessible to animals; since we are animals, we are a subset of that.",ted
"There would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for, say, 200 years.",ted
Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are.,ted
"So then, you move off to this larger sphere of human +, and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being.",ted
"Well, we know already that in this little human circle there, there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being - human life at its best is wonderful.",ted
"I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design?",ted
"Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that.",ted
The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings.,ted
"Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length, and that changes the frequency of the sound wave.",ted
"OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it a 16th-century technology.",ted
"But actually, the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound.",ted
"I remember when I was little, my mom asked me, Would you like to play the violin or the piano?",ted
I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day!,ted
"The best of all is that if I don't want to practice, (Whispering) I can hide it.",ted
"But whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff that easily looks dated.",ted
"But I think it's very personal and unique that, although each violin looks pretty similar, no two violins sound the same - even from the same maker or based on the same model.",ted
"I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids -",ted
"A few years later, I heard a joke about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz.",ted
"After Mr. Heifetz's concert, a lady came over and complimented him:",ted
"And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person, so he picked up his violin and said, Funny - I don't hear anything.",ted
"Now I realize that as the musician, we human beings, with our great mind, artistic heart and skill, can change this 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment.",ted
"At first, I thought I was just going to be here to perform, but unexpectedly, I learned and enjoyed much more.",ted
"I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school.",ted
"Like the speaker before me - I am a TED virgin, I guess.",ted
I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone.,ted
"And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century, and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.",ted
I have another piece that I'd like to play for you.,ted
"It's called Abegg Variations, by Robert Schumann, a German 19th-century composer.",ted
"The name Abegg is actually A-B-E-G-G, and that's the main theme in the melody.",ted
That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.,ted
"So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.",ted
"It's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.",ted
"Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called Sync and Flow, I was wondering, What do I know that these geniuses don't?",ted
"So, I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start.",ted
I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose.,ted
"And once I choose my main theme, I have to decide: Out of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want?",ted
"So for inspiration, I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers.",ted
"Next, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers.",ted
"And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas, because then you have to think.",ted
"Drawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art.",ted
And then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character?,ted
Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book?,ted
"And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind, because I know",ted
"And sometimes, if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally.",ted
"What happens is, if something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly, and",ted
You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.,ted
"I'm not going to play my own composition today because, although I did finish it, it's way too long.",ted
"I have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet.",ted
And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five - anyone to come up here and choose five -,ted
Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?,ted
"OK - C, G, B, A and E. JL: Thank you very much!",ted
"Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E.",ted
I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.,ted
"So, I'm going to have a moment to think, and I'll try to make something out of it.",ted
"The next song, or the encore that I'm going to play is called Bumble Boogie, by Jack Fina.",ted
We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.,ted
"So I'll try and do that, but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.",ted
"Now, the second thing that everyone already knows is that, contrary to what was believed for most of human history, human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.",ted
"Now, the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very untypical place, uniquely suited and so on.",ted
And the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.,ted
"And, especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions, then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.",ted
"Well, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction, and we see a wall and chemical scum -",ted
"And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe, is nowhere near any galaxies.",ted
"So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back, and",ted
"And at this point, we've come 100,000 light-years from here.",ted
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.,ted
"To get to a typical place, you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that, into intergalactic space.",ted
"Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space.",ted
"Can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?",ted
"And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright, so brilliant an event, that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light-years.",ted
It's also very cold out there - less than three degrees above absolute zero.,ted
The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create.,ted
So that's how different a typical place is from this place.,ted
"Now, how do we know about an environment that's so far away",ted
"Well, the Earth - our environment, in the form of us - is creating knowledge.",ted
"Well, look out even further than we've just been - I mean from here, with a telescope - and you'll see things that look like stars, they're called quasars.",ted
"Quasars originally meant quasi-stellar object, which means things that look a bit like stars.",ted
"Billions of years ago and billions of light-years away, the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a supermassive black hole.",ted
And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse and,ted
"Now, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet.",ted
Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets.,ted
"It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion, but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.",ted
"The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model of the other, the quasar.",ted
"Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well, but an explanatory model, embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure.",ted
"And if that weren't amazing enough, the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time.",ted
"Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision, the structure of everything.",ted
"This place, and not other places in the universe, is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality.",ted
"And so, far from being insignificant, the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen is one of the most important things about the physical world.",ted
"Now, how does the solar system - our environment, in the form of us - acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe?",ted
"Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark - I mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis - one thing that's true about it",ted
It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.,ted
"One of them is matter, because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing.",ted
"Information processing is computation, computation requires a computer, and there's no known way of making a computer without matter.",ted
"We also need energy to make the computer, and most important, to make the media, in effect, onto which we record the knowledge that we discover.",ted
"And then thirdly, less tangible but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations, is evidence.",ted
"We happened to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's law of gravity, about 300 years ago.",ted
"But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that, and we'll continue to fall for billions of years afterwards.",ted
"As far as we know, evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking, on our planet.",ted
Our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy.,ted
"Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space, the same size as our home, the solar system.",ted
"Now, that cube is very empty by human standards, but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.",ted
"Now, it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on.",ted
"But the thing is, in a comprehensible universe, if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics, then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?",ted
"In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.",ted
"If we could do that, we'd automatically have an energy supply, because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor.",ted
"And with a more powerful telescope, you'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies, you'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics.",ted
"And locally there, you could build particle accelerators and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry, and so on.",ted
Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips - because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.,ted
"But I have to tell you - and sorry, Richard - but",ted
I never did like biology field trips much - and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years.,ted
"So, in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge.",ted
"Any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are, if the knowledge of how to do so were present there.",ted
"If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations, then so is almost every other environment, so is the Earth.",ted
"And the limiting factor, there and here, is not resources - because they're plentiful - but knowledge, which is scarce.",ted
"Now, this cosmic knowledge-based view may - and, I think, ought to - make us feel very special.",ted
"But it should also make us feel vulnerable, because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe, we won't survive them.",ted
"All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light-years away, and we'll all be dead!",ted
"Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things, from astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong, and most importantly, to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.",ted
And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century.,ted
I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.,ted
"Now, I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in, but I do agree with him about this",ted
"But it depends, not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.",ted
The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history.,ted
"So let me now apply this to a current controversy, not because I want to advocate any particular solution, but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean.",ted
"Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist.",ted
And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory.,ted
"And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem, merely to postpone it by a little.",ted
"So it's already too late to avoid it, and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger.",ted
"It was probably already too late in the 1970s, when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age, in which billions would die.",ted
"Now, the lesson of that seems clear to me, and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate.",ted
"When we know of an impending disaster and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself, then there's not going to be much argument, really.",ted
But no precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.,ted
"Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance.",ted
"And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure, but that's only if we know what to prevent.",ted
"If you've been punched on the nose, then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches.",ted
"If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only, then it would achieve very little of either.",ted
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs.,ted
"It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature and with plans to live at the higher temperature - and not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply.",ted
"And some such plans exist, things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide.",ted
"At the moment, these things are fringe research; they're not central to the human effort to face this problem or problems in general.",ted
"I usually say to people, when they say, What do you do?",ted
"I say, I do hardware, because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do.",ted
"And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some Valley event, to which he replied, How quaint.",ted
"This doesn't mean we should ignore software, or information, or computation.",ted
And that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about.,ted
"So, this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future.",ted
"And I've always been nervous about the term futurist, because you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it.",ted
"And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have, and said, You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?",ted
"And George Homsey, a great guy, said, Oh, the future is amazing.",ted
"We're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut, and we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint.",ted
"So, you may think that's sort of really crazy, but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible.",ted
"So, this isn't my work, but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT.",ted
"This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight and a few other very, very bright individuals.",ted
"Basically, what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system.",ted
"Literally, think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program.",ted
And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich for a design competition in biology.,ted
"And from the results of the same competition last year, a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on and off.",ted
"So this is interesting in the sense that you can now do if-then-for statements in materials, in structure.",ted
"I spent six years thinking about that, but to show you the power of art over science - this is actually one of the cartoons I write.",ted
"Took me six years at MIT, and about that many pages to describe what I was doing, and it took him one page.",ted
"He's an interesting little kid - and his sister, Celine - and what he's doing here is observing the self-assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl.",ted
"And in fact you can program the self-assembly of things, so he starts chocolate-dipping edges, changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity.",ted
"In theory, if you program those sufficiently, you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure.",ted
"In this case, he's done self-replication of a complex 3D structure.",ted
"And that's what I thought about for a long time, because this is how we currently make things.",ted
"This is a silicon wafer, and essentially that's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff, sort of layered up.",ted
"The feature side is - you know, people will say, unclear down around about 65 nanometers now.",ted
"And that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers, and it's a complex 3D structure.",ted
We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way.,ted
"The secret to biology is, it builds computation into the way it makes things.",ted
"So this little thing here, polymerase, is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA.",ted
And the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins.,ted
"I thought about this in the sense that it's great to build in biological materials, but can we do similar things?",ted
"Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems, like higher speed semiconductors, etc.",ted
"So, this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system.",ted
"Now, if I make a string of these, a bit string, they will be able to replicate.",ted
"It was work actually by Lionel Penrose, father of Roger Penrose, the tiles guy.",ted
"He did a lot of this work in the '60s, and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution, but it's now coming back.",ted
"So now I'm going to show you the hands-free, autonomous self-replication.",ted
"So we've tracked in the video the input string, which was green, green, yellow, yellow, green.",ted
"So I was trying to, you know, take the engineer's version:",ted
Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing?,ted
So what I'm showing you here is that we can make a 2D shape - the B - assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules.,ted
"And the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here, and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design, was that you don't need digital logic to do computation.",ted
So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process.,ted
"So, Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday, I believe, but I'll show you again.",ted
"Each different color has a different magnetic polarity, and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out.",ted
And now I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits.,ted
"So, you know, it's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently.",ted
"And so I'm thinking about, you know, what are the programs for programming the physical universe?",ted
"And how do we think about materials and structure, sort of as an information and computation problem?",ted
"Not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point, but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic, are the computers.",ted
"Having totally absorbed this philosophy, I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently.",ted
"With the universe as a computer, you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations.",ted
"You set a couple of boundary conditions, like gravity, the surface tension, density, etc.,",ted
"So, this actually applied to the problem of - so there's a half a billion to a billion people in the world don't have access to cheap eyeglasses.",ted
So can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site?,ted
And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you've cooked it.,ted
"I've seen this video, but I still don't know if it's going to end",ted
"This is a very old movie, so with the new prototypes, actually both surfaces are flexible, but this will show you the point.",ted
"Now you've finished the lens, you literally pop it out.",ted
"That's next year's Yves Klein, you know, eyeglasses shape.",ted
And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters.,ted
"And as I rotate it against this side shot, you'll see that that has cylinder, and that was programmed in - literally into the physics of the system.",ted
"So, this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things, like this.",ted
"This is something that my people at SQUID Labs are working on at the moment, called electronic rope.",ted
And you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor.,ted
So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope.,ted
"Just by thinking about the physics of the world, materials as the computer, you can start to do things like this.",ted
I guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that I think about with this.,ted
"And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems, share the information and work on those things together.",ted
"So, a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time, and unless Lisa Randall changes that, we'll continue to move in linear time.",ted
"So that means anything you do, or anything you make, you produce a sequence of steps - and I think Lego in the '70s nailed this, and they did it most elegantly.",ted
"So, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things, so you end up with this sort of guy",ted
"And I think this applies across a very broad - sort of, a lot of concepts.",ted
"You know, Cameron Sinclair yesterday said, How do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity?",ted
"And if you've seen Amy Smith, she talks about how you get students at MIT to work with communities in Haiti.",ted
"I don't know exactly how to do this yet, but, you know, it's something being actively thought about.",ted
"So, you know, that leads to questions like, is this a compiler?",ted
"Maybe I'm getting a little too abstract, but you know, this is the sort",ted
"They're starting to invest in materials science, but these are the new things in materials science.",ted
"How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas, and see the world in a different way?",ted
And it's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe,ted
"I've probably got a couple of minutes of questions, or I can show -",ted
"I think they also said that I do extreme stuff in the introduction, so I may have to explain that.",ted
"So this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite, which also happens to be a minimal energy surface.",ted
"So returning to the droplet, again, thinking about the universe in a new way.",ted
"So I've been working on this a little, also, with a couple of other guys.",ted
"But, you know, this is another way to look at the - if you abstract again, this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe.",ted
"You could just hang it as a bed sheet, but again, the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape.",ted
And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that.,ted
And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation.,ted
The first is what I like to call a hyper-rational process.,ted
"It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level, and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call, sort of a rational conclusion to something.",ted
"And it concludes in something that you see here, that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality.",ted
The second - the second is that this process does not have a signature.,ted
"And the third is that it challenges - and this is, in the length of this, very hard to support why, connect all these things - but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility.",ted
"High modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic, almost anything can happen within them.",ted
I call it sort of shotgun flexibility - turn your head this way; shoot; and you're bound to kill something.,ted
"So, this is the promise of high modernism: within a single space, actually, any kind of activity can happen.",ted
"But as we're seeing, operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters.",ted
"And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility, something that we call compartmentalized flexibility.",ted
"And the idea is that you, within that continuum, identify a series of points, and you design specifically to them.",ted
"They can be pushed off-center a little bit, but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped.",ted
"Now I'm going to talk about - I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams, and",ted
I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see.,ted
"With the library staff and the library board, we settled on two core positions.",ted
"This is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years, the evolution of the book, and other technologies.",ted
"This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book, and our position was, books are technology - that's something people forget -",ted
The second premise - and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first -,ted
"Ok, now, this I'll come back to later, but something - actually, the librarians at first said, No, this isn't our mandate.",ted
So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building.,ted
The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility.,ted
"We don't know the future of the library; we don't know the future of the book; and so, we'll use this approach.",ted
"And what we saw were buildings that were very generic, and worse - not only were they very generic - so, not only",ted
"And in this case, what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book.",ted
"Now, we had to convince the library that social roles were equally important to media, in order to get them to accept this.",ted
What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left.,ted
That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory.,ted
"Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say, You know what?",ted
"We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books.",ted
"Two-thirds of it is already dedicated - that's the white band below, the thing you said isn't important - is already dedicated to social functions.",ted
"So once we had presented that back to them, they agreed that this sort of core concept could work.",ted
We got the right to go back to first principles - that's the third diagram.,ted
"What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library, specifically in terms of square footage.",ted
"On the left of that diagram, here, you'll see a series of five platforms - sort of combs, collective programs.",ted
"And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces; things like reading rooms, whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years we can't predict.",ted
"They signed it, and to their chagrin, we came back a week later, and we presented them this.",ted
"And as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right.",ted
"The things on the left-hand side of the diagram, those are the boxes.",ted
We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships.,ted
"The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code, and so forth.",ted
"So, you see the five platforms, those are the boxes.",ted
"The area in between is sort of an urban continuum, these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree.",ted
"To give you some sense of the power of this idea, the biggest block is what we call the book spiral.",ted
It's literally built in a very inexpensive way - it is a parking garage for books.,ted
"It just so happens to be on the 6th through 10th floors of the building, but that is not necessarily an expensive approach.",ted
"And so this was the final operation, which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter, and to hold onto them with a skin.",ted
"One, it is the lateral stability for the entire building; it's a structural element.",ted
"But its dimensions were designed not only for structure, but also for holding on every piece of glass.",ted
The glass was then - I'll use the word impregnated - but it had a layer of metal that was called stretched metal.,ted
"That metal acts as a microlouver, so from the exterior of the building, the sun sees it as totally opaque, but from the interior, it's entirely transparent.",ted
So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building.,ted
"And I think what's important is, when we first unveiled the building, the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego.",ted
"And it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians.",ted
"They said, Look, we don't know what it is, but we know it's everything that we need it to be, based on the observations that we've done about the program.",ted
"So, it's an unusual building for a public library, obviously.",ted
So now we're going into what we call the living room.,ted
It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space.,ted
"There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle, but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain.",ted
"So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything, including eat, yell, play chess and so forth.",ted
Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber.,ted
You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you.,ted
"This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife, right there.",ted
"So, it's very indiscernible, but it's actually a continuous stair-stepping.",ted
"It allows you to, on one city block, go up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum.",ted
"Ok, now I'm going to go back, and I'm going to hit a second project.",ted
"It was an unusual client for us, because they came to us",ted
"We've been working in a temporary space for 30 years, but because of that temporary space, we've become an infamous theater company.",ted
"Theater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle, with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company.",ted
"So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building that could be a pristine building, but keep this kind of experimental nature.",ted
"And the second is, they were what we call a multi-form theater, they do different kinds of performances in repertory.",ted
"So they in the morning will do something in arena, then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth.",ted
"And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations, and for operational budget reasons, this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi-form theater in the United States",ted
"It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere, wherever you place it, the area under it is charged for theatrical performances.",ted
"And it allowed us to go back to first principles, and redefine fly tower, acoustic enclosure, light enclosure and so forth.",ted
"And at the push of a button, it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium, thrust, and in fact, arena and traverse and flat floor, in a very quick transfiguration.",ted
"So in fact, using operational budget, we can - sorry, capital cost - we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost.",ted
"The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure, so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop.",ted
"Portions can be opened, so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance, or you can even just have an open-air performance, or for intermissions.",ted
"The balconies all move to go between those configurations, but they also disappear.",ted
"You can bring enormous objects in, so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company - their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh, and they'll want to bring in a real aircraft.",ted
"And then it also provides them, in the off-season, the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things.",ted
"And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money, they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown.",ted
"And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma, so they worked in reverse.",ted
And it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building.,ted
"So this is Louisville's skyline, and I'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project.",ted
"We actually had to operate on three discrete sites, all of them well smaller than the size of the building.",ted
"We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it.",ted
"Now, this area floods three to four times a year, and there's a levee behind our site, similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans.",ted
"Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor, a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites.",ted
So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub.,ted
"And then we would size all the other elements - the different commercial elements: hotel, luxury housing, offices and so forth - and dump it on top.",ted
In fact - and you know this - this is called the Time Warner Building.,ted
"Just lift the entire block, flip some of the elements over, reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown, and make circulation connections and reroute the road.",ted
"So that's the basic concept, and now I'm going to show you what it leads to.",ted
"Ok, it seems a very formal, willful gesture, but something derived entirely out of the constraints.",ted
"And again, when we unveiled it, there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement, not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems.",ted
"Now, within that center zone, as I said, we have the ability to mix a series of things.",ted
"So here, this is sort of an x-ray - the towers are totally developer-driven.",ted
"It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen, or to see the art, and so forth.",ted
"As we're building the cores, we build the contemporary art museum at grade.",ted
"The moment the cores get to mid level, we finish the art museum; we put all the mechanical equipment in it; and then we jack it up into the air.",ted
"This is how they build really large aircraft hangars, for instance, the ones that they did for the A380.",ted
"Finish the cores, finish the meat and you get something that looks like this.",ted
"Now I only have about 30 seconds, so I want to start an animation, and we'll conclude with that.",ted
"About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.",ted
"So, upon landing - this was still at the old Hong Kong airport that's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city",ted
"And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed.",ted
So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.,ted
And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there.,ted
"And it turned out that - I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.",ted
"And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags, and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking,",ted
"Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up, I'm going to have a good time working here.",ted
"But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful.",ted
"On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.",ted
"However, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life - of, you know,",ted
I think what the conference brochure refers to as moments that take your breath away.,ted
"And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.",ted
"Now, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them",ted
I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.,ted
"What I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.",ted
"And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.",ted
There's one from a consumer's point of view - where I was happy while experiencing design.,ted
My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely.,ted
And The Police's Synchronicity cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.,ted
So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.,ted
"You know, of course, they are related to this combination of at least two of them being, you know, design objects.",ted
"And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know, situated somewhere here",ted
"Now, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint - if you're happy while actually doing it.",ted
And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs?,ted
"So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy.",ted
"And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because - well, also, with an eye on this conference.",ted
"Under Arcadia, they showed things like this, from the Edo period - a hundred ways to write happiness in different forms.",ted
"Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono - that, of course, later on was, you know, made into the label for The Beatles.",ted
This is a blue field - it's actually an Yves Klein painting.,ted
"Then, under Desire, they showed these Shunsho paintings - also from the Edo period - ink on silk.",ted
"And, lastly, under Harmony, they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet.",ted
"Now, what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness.",ted
"And I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization - that's a really easy thing to do.",ted
"And, you know, my studio - we've done it all the time.",ted
Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.,ted
"Or we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it.",ted
"Much, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness - and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me.",ted
"This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself True.",ted
Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be familiar with these signs?,ted
Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.,ted
They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.,ted
"Now, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.",ted
"So you're you're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.",ted
"I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.",ted
"He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested, so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.",ted
And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody - sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.,ted
"This is at P.S. 1 - a sculpture that's basically a square room by James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling.",ted
"You're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.",ted
"And, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there.",ted
"There are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.",ted
"I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' Cloud a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.",ted
"But my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.",ted
"And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles - empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.",ted
"And he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.",ted
I think that was - the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.,ted
Jee gets to have his project; the public gets a sweeter environment; and different public gets a place to express itself; and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.,ted
"Which brought me back to my list making - you know, just to see what I actually like about my job.",ted
"Or, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it.",ted
Try not to get stuck doing the same thing - or try not get stuck behind the computer all day.,ted
"This is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.",ted
"Then, of course, trying to, you know, work on things where the content is actually important for me.",ted
And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.,ted
"And, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads - design six",ted
"So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned - in this case,",ted
Everything I do always comes back to me - and we made these spreads right out of this.,ted
So it was: Everything I do always comes back to me.,ted
"A couple of weeks ago, a French company asked us to design five billboards for them.",ted
"We flew to Arizona - the designer who works with me, and myself - and photographed this one.",ted
"This is: Having - this is the same thing; it's just, you know, photographed from the side.",ted
"The old story about climate protection is that it's costly, or it would have been done already.",ted
So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it.,ted
"The new story about climate protection is that it's not costly, but profitable.",ted
"Many other firms - IBM - are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants, and they get their money back in two or three years.",ted
"If, of course, that were true, there would be no innovation, and nobody could make any money.",ted
"But the new story about oil is the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil - not just incrementally, but completely - quite the contrary.",ted
"This process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict, particularly over oil.",ted
"This thesis is set out in a book called Winning the Oil Endgame that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at Oilendgame.com - about 170,000 downloads so far.",ted
"And it was co-sponsored by the Pentagon - it's independent, it's peer-reviewed and",ted
"Now, a bit of economic history, I think, may be helpful here.",ted
"So, very unexpectedly, they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales.",ted
The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit-maximizing capitalists.,ted
And it's funny - it feels a bit like this now for oil.,ted
"We've been spending the last few decades accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substituting for oil, and no one had bothered to add them up before.",ted
"Now, there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil.",ted
"On the competitiveness front, we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together.",ted
"And serious competition from Europe, from Korea, and next is China, which will soon be a major net exporter of cars.",ted
How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new wally-badged Shanghai automotive super-efficient car?,ted
China has an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leap-frog technology.,ted
"The point here is, these cars are going to be made super efficient.",ted
"Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil, or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars?",ted
"The more we keep on using the oil, particularly the imported oil, the more we face a very obvious array of problems.",ted
"Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing, but nothing is not the right number.",ted
"It could well be enough to double the oil price, for example.",ted
And our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in Far-off-istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect American citizens.,ted
"They don't like fighting over oil, they don't like being in the sands and",ted
"Now, in order to avoid these problems, whatever you think they're worth, it's actually not that complicated.",ted
"We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently, at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel.",ted
And then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas.,ted
"In the process, we will gain about a million good jobs, mainly rural.",ted
"And protect another million jobs now at risk, mainly in auto-making.",ted
And we'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year.,ted
"For example, this Opel two-seater does 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon.",ted
"This muscle car from Toyota: 408 horsepower in an ultra-light that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds, and still gets 32 miles a gallon.",ted
"And in the upper left, a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM - 84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid, in a four-seater.",ted
"Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon.",ted
So you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return.,ted
"Then you can go even further, almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements, double the big haulers' margins.",ted
"And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull, and flip the market.",ted
"In the airplane business, it's again a similar story where the first 20 percent fuel saving is free, as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner.",ted
"Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles, the cars and light trucks, because we all know the most about those; probably everybody here drives one.",ted
"And only this little bit, only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop.",ted
"In fact, since 95 percent of the weight you're moving is the car not the driver, less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver.",ted
This is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort.,ted
"Moreover, three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car.",ted
And it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels.,ted
So there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter.,ted
"For example, we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods.",ted
Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf.,ted
"Because these materials could actually absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel, and do so a lot more smoothly.",ted
And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight.,ted
"We could make cars bigger, which is protective, but make them light.",ted
"Whereas if we made them heavy, they'd be both hostile and inefficient.",ted
"And when you make them light in the right way, that can be simpler and cheaper to make.",ted
"You can end up saving money, and lives, and oil, all at the same time.",ted
And the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely.,ted
"Because the auto body has only, say, 14 parts, instead of 100, 150.",ted
"Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set, instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel.",ted
"And if you want, you can lay color in the mold, and get rid of the paint shop.",ted
Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car.,ted
"So you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensity than the leanest plant in the industry, which GM has in Lansing.",ted
"And then another six can be made robustly, competitively, from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel, without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production.",ted
"There is a huge amount of gas to be saved, about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price.",ted
"And here are some no-brainer substitutions of it, with lots left over.",ted
Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12.,ted
"Or we could, of course, just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil, or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us.",ted
"But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead, because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers, and they don't.",ted
"And that doesn't even count, for example, that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country.",ted
"Now, to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence, there is a few ways government could help.",ted
"You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class, in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three.",ted
"This expands choice rapidly in the market, and actually makes more money for automakers as well.",ted
"And for each car so financed, scrap almost one clunker, preferably the dirtiest ones.",ted
"This creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise, because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car.",ted
"It turns out that if, say, African-American and white households had the same car ownership, it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities.",ted
There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster.,ted
And we could even do an X Prize-style golden carrot that's worth stretching further for.,ted
"For example, a billion-dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker to sell 200,000 really advanced vehicles, like some you saw earlier.",ted
"Then the legacy airlines can't afford to buy the efficient new planes they desperately need to cut their fuel bills, but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that",ted
Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive.,ted
"We ought to take them out back and shoot them, and put bounty hunters after them.",ted
"Just turn it over to the private sector, and we have an Internet.",ted
"And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there, we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the 2040s.",ted
And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before.,ted
They would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year.,ted
And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC.,ted
We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil.,ted
If you're here today - and I'm very happy that you are,ted
"However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City.",ted
"And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.",ted
"The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog - an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998.",ted
She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.,ted
The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.,ted
"So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive.",ted
"I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier.",ted
"Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.",ted
"There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river.",ted
"I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.",ted
And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.,ted
"And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined.",ted
"We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years.",ted
"We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times, into a $3 million park.",ted
"And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved.",ted
"That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.",ted
But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine.,ted
"We feel the problems right now, and have for some time.",ted
"Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other.",ted
"As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health.",ted
"I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do.",ted
"These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma.",ted
Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?,ted
"Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it.",ted
Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average.,ted
"And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs, health problems associated with pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts of untapped potential.",ted
Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed.,ted
Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care.,ted
This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits.,ted
"Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy.",ted
"None of us want that, and we all have that in common.",ted
"Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking.",ted
"Graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned.",ted
"But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways.",ted
I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down.,ted
"My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home.",ted
"At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood.",ted
"And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country.",ted
"Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment.",ted
Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions - dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding.,ted
"Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to.",ted
"In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign.",ted
One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.,ted
"The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance.",ted
Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed.,ted
The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.,ted
"And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you?",ted
"So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home, and all we had.",ted
"And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.",ted
"Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation.",ted
The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come.,ted
Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood.,ted
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided?,ted
This was planning - in quotes - that did not have our best interests in mind.,ted
"Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning.",ted
I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx.,ted
I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths.,ted
"Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life.",ted
"They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development.",ted
This is Lafayette Avenue - and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.,ted
"And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park.",ted
"Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.",ted
"As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more.",ted
"Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs - and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment.",ted
"The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it.",ted
The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway.,ted
"We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.",ted
We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices.,ted
"Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere.",ted
"Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban heat island effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe.",ted
"Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.",ted
"Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors.",ted
"Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common.",ted
"Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz.",ted
Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another.,ted
"In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common.",ted
"We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability.",ted
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable.,ted
But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out.,ted
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone.,ted
"Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did?",ted
Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?,ted
"Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral.",ted
This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through.,ted
"But I'll tell you later, if you want to know.",ted
"But - I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end.",ted
I'm interested in what I like to call the triple bottom line that sustainable development can produce.,ted
"Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up.",ted
"Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks.",ted
"And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit.",ted
"Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes.",ted
My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues.,ted
Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development.,ted
"You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to.",ted
"There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune.",ted
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins - both heroes of mine by the way - have shown that you can actually do that.,ted
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit.,ted
"That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create.",ted
"But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries in other cities.",ted
"Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx.",ted
"However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique PeГ±alosa.",ted
"Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them.",ted
"If you're a mayor, you can do something about that.",ted
"But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened.",ted
"His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that.",ted
That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S.,ted
That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange.,ted
"This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal.",ted
"Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere.",ted
I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding.,ted
What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around.,ted
But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process.,ted
"Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count.",ted
"By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world.",ted
"We might have come to this conference from very, very different stations in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing.",ted
"To explain the wish, I'm going to have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been, and that's around the world.",ted
"When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work, not only about responding to natural disasters, but involved in systemic issues.",ted
"We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce, innovative, sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives.",ted
"So I started my life as an architect, or training as an architect, and I was always interested in socially responsible design, and how you can really make an impact.",ted
"But when I went to architecture school, it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family.",ted
"So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it, but for the community as a whole.",ted
"And in 1999, we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo.",ted
"And I didn't know what I was doing - like I said, mid-20s - and I'm the Internet generation, so we started a website.",ted
"We put a call out there, and to my surprise, in a couple of months, we had hundreds of entries from around the world.",ted
That led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas.,ted
"Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa, responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.",ted
"We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran, in Bam, also following up on our work in Africa.",ted
Working within the United States - most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner.,ted
"So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere; and also, I will go into some more projects.",ted
I think we can pretty much assume that 2005 was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters.,ted
"And because of the Internet, and because of connections to blogs and so forth, within literally hours of the tsunami, we were already raising funds, getting involved, working with people on the ground.",ted
"We run from a couple of laptops, and in the first couple of days, I had 4,000 emails from people needing help.",ted
"So we began to get involved in projects there, and I'll talk about some others.",ted
"And then of course, this year we've been responding to Katrina, as well as following up on our reconstruction work.",ted
"In 2004, I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help, or the number of requests that I was getting.",ted
"So we decided to embrace an open-source model of business - so that anyone, anywhere in the world, could start a local chapter, and they can get involved in local problems.",ted
"So that means, you know, somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do.",ted
"So what happened is, we used Meetup and all these other Internet tools, and we ended up having 40 chapters starting up, thousands of architects in 104 countries.",ted
"So the bullet point - sorry, I never do a suit, so I knew that I was going to take this off.",ted
"So what you don't know is, we've got these thousands of designers working around the world, connected basically by a website, and we have a staff of three.",ted
"The fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it, we did it.",ted
"So seven years later, we've developed so that we've got advocacy, instigation and implementation.",ted
"We advocate for good design, not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums, op-eds; we have a book on humanitarian work; but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy.",ted
"Instigation, developing ideas with communities and NGOs, doing open-source design competitions.",ted
"And then implementing - actually going out there and doing the work, because when you invent, it's never a reality until it's built.",ted
"So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change, we build that change.",ted
This wasn't imposing an architecture on a community; this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to.,ted
"We had from the sublime to the ridiculous, but they worked.",ted
"And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building, but also the issues of governance, and the idea of creating communities through complex networks.",ted
"So we've engaged not just designers, but also a whole variety of technology-based professionals.",ted
"Within three days, we realized the problem was not housing; it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS.",ted
And it wasn't doctors telling us this; it was actual villagers that we were staying with.,ted
"And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk 10, 15 kilometers to see doctors, you get the doctors to the people.",ted
"And the medical community there said, We've said this for the last decade.",ted
"So in a way, we had taken pre-existing needs and shown solutions.",ted
"And so again, we had a whole variety of ideas that came in.",ted
"This one I personally love, because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions, but about raising awareness.",ted
"You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land, and it grows 14 feet in a month.",ted
"So it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS, you also need to have nutrition rates, and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there.",ted
"The idea is it's not just a clinic, it's a community center.",ted
"This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community, so it can be a self-sustaining project.",ted
That's not because I'm a tree-hugging green person.,ted
"It's because when you live on four dollars a day, you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable.",ted
"You have to know where your energy is coming from, you have to know where your resource is coming from, and you have to keep the maintenance down.",ted
"So this is about getting an economic engine, and then at night, it turns into a movie theater.",ted
"And these ideas developed into prototypes, and they were eventually built.",ted
"And currently, as of this year, there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya.",ted
"The community came to us and said, The problem is that the girls don't have education.",ted
And we're working in an area where young women between the ages of 16 and 24 have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate.,ted
"And that's not because they're promiscuous, it's because there's no knowledge.",ted
So that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care.,ted
"And we picked nine finalists, and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region, and then the community picked their design.",ted
"They said, this is our design, because it's not only about engaging a community; it's about empowering a community, and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process.",ted
"And then, of course, we actually go and work with the community and the clients.",ted
"He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba.",ted
"I work at the Africa Centre, I'm an IT user consultant.",ted
"I'm also the national football player for South Africa, Banyana Banyana.",ted
"And I also play in the Vodacom League, for the team called Tembisa, which has now changed to Siyathemba.",ted
Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time.,ted
"This was a connection, just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center, in Tanzania.",ted
"This was a matchmaking, thanks to a couple of TEDsters - Sun Microsystems, Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli, who connected me with this amazing African woman.",ted
"And we start construction in June, and it will be opened by TEDGlobal.",ted
"So when you come to TEDGlobal, you can check it out.",ted
"But what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development, and we've been involved in a lot of issues, such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina.",ted
"And what that means is we actually live and work with the community, and they're part of the design process.",ted
The kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be.,ted
"And then eventually, the community, through skills training, end up building the building with us.",ted
This is what the UN gave these guys for six months - 12 plastic tarps.,ted
This was the replacement; that's supposed to last for two years.,ted
"When the rain comes down, you can't hear a thing, and in the summer, it's about 140 degrees inside.",ted
"So we said, if the rain's coming down, let's get fresh water.",ted
"The kids are out there on-site, building the buildings.",ted
"And it opened a couple of weeks ago, and there's 600 kids that are now using the schools.",ted
"We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that, but we don't see the good stories.",ted
"Here is a community that got together, and they said no to waiting.",ted
"They formed a partnership, a diverse partnership of players, to actually map out East Biloxi, to figure out who's getting involved.",ted
"Figuring out what FEMA regulations are, not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild.",ted
"Working with residents, getting them out of their homes, so they don't get ill.",ted
This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker.,ted
They're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years.,ted
"That was their home, and these are the photographs they took.",ted
"And we're helping, working with them to create a new building.",ted
It took 20 years to design this and get it implemented in the field.,ted
There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work.,ted
"More hemp houses - it's a theme in Japan, apparently.",ted
"This is a Grip Clip, designed by somebody who said, All you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams.",ted
"I'm going to whip through this quickly, because I know I've got only a couple of minutes.",ted
And this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years.,ted
"From Brazil to India, Mexico, Alabama, China, Israel, Palestine, Vietnam.",ted
The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is 32 -,ted
"So it's a young - I just have to stop here, because Arup is in the room, and this is the best-designed toilet in the world.",ted
"If you're ever, ever in India, go use this toilet.",ted
I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party.,ted
"But the future is not going to be the sky-scraping cities of New York, but this.",ted
"If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen, in 20 years, one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp.",ted
"Look left, look right: one of you will be there.",ted
So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone.,ted
"You have a diverse community of participants - and we're not just talking about inventors and designers, but we're talking about the funding model.",ted
My role is not as a designer; it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world.,ted
"And what we need is something that replicates me globally, because I haven't slept in seven years.",ted
"Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis, but they don't want some company in the West taking their idea and basically profiting from it.",ted
The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it.,ted
"As soon as that is built, anyone in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free.",ted
"So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this, but still protect their rights here?",ted
"We want to have a community where you can upload ideas, and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake, in flood, in all sorts of austere environments.",ted
The reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works.,ted
So doing that globally - and I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually.,ted
"When you look at the face of an architect, most people think a gray-haired white guy.",ted
I don't see that; I see the face of the world.,ted
So I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development.,ted
"The idea of needs-based competitions - XPRIZE for the other 98 percent, if you want to call it that.",ted
"We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together, and the idea of integrating manufacturers - fab labs in every country.",ted
When I hear about the $100 laptop and it's going to educate every child - educate every designer in the world.,ted
"I write with Worldchanging, and the one thing we've been talking about is, I learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here.",ted
"So let's take those ideas, adapt them, and we can use them.",ted
These ideas are supposed to be adaptable; they should have the potential for evolution; they should be developed by every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world.,ted
"I don't have time to read this, because I'm going to be yanked off.",ted
"I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing, because those guys are the best in the world.",ted
"I just should note: I have two laptops and one of them is there, and that has 3000 designs on it.",ted
"So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there, easy to use, easy to get ahold of.",ted
"My mom once said, There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers.",ted
We've changed FEMA guidelines; we've changed public policy; we've changed international response - based on building things.,ted
"So for me, it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation, and that it's free innovation.",ted

"It is a promise to pay equivalent value at some time in the future, except the holder of the money can call on anybody at all to fulfill that promise-",reddit

"This is important to understand: I just spent money on shoes, which you spent on deer meat, that *has never been printed",reddit

"Now, you are issuing *debt*: a promise to provide apples.",reddit
"The worker gets fish from the fisherman, not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use, but in exchange for an IOU that the fisherman can redeem anywhere.",reddit

"There is no thermodynamic law of the conservation of monetary value- just as you and I created it by creating transferable debt, it can also be genuinely destroyed.",reddit
"I could also issue promises to catch deer, the fisherman could issue promises of fish, and so on.",reddit
"Once again, value has been destroyed people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that doesn't exist, and will never exist.",reddit
"All that stuff they made is gone, you consumed it, and there is nothing to show for it.",reddit
"The above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later, and probably sooner.",reddit
"This leads to the question of *credit*, which is, at its most basic, a measure of *credibility*.",reddit
"Every time you issue an apple-certificate, you are *borrowing*, with a promise to repay from future apple-harvests.",reddit
"After the first couple of town scandals, people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer.",reddit
"Now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato-grower a lot of credit, compared to other farmers in town.",reddit

"After many months, while searching the ocean below, he found a sunken pillar.",reddit
"In the distance, he saw the glowing lights of what seemed to be a school of fish and swam toward it.",reddit
"As he came closer, though, he saw that the lights were not many fish - they were the tentacles of one great creature.",reddit
"And slowly, it's massive eye, larger that the whole cathedral, opened, and stared directly at him.",reddit
He swam up in a panic and found a passageway up at the top.,reddit
"He climbed through it and found himself in a cave, with a staircase leading up in the stone.",reddit
"They turned and saw him, inexplicably aged by nearly a year, transported behind them.",reddit
"The cave was collapsing, and so they climbed to top in a panic without waiting for answers.",reddit
"As they reached the surface, the entrance collapsed behind them, locking the cave and its secrets for eternity.",reddit

"The early history of paper money did not evolve the way I described in the earlier posts (although it could have, and would have got to the same place).",reddit
"Instead, the early history of paper money was certificates issued by storage-vaults of precious metals (i.e., early banks ).",reddit

"It is a promise to pay equivalent value at some time in the future, except the holder of the money can call on anybody at all to fulfill that promise-",reddit

"You call me up (cellphones have been invented in this newly-efficient economy),",reddit

"This is important to understand: I just spent money on shoes, which you spent on deer meat, that *has never been printed",reddit

As someone who *was poor when they were young adult* and stayed away from all credit.,reddit
It takes 3 hours to get to and from work on the city bus which would only take 15 minutes with a car.,reddit
So I wake up at 7am to get ready for work and to catch the 8am bus.,reddit
Get to work at 10am work until 7 or later get home between 9pm and midnight depending on when I got off from work.,reddit
Barely enough time to clean the house and eat a properly cooked meal.,reddit
I couldn't work another job without a car that I can't afford because I'm stuck at $8 an hour.,reddit
So I can buy $60 shoes that will last or $15 walmart shoes.,reddit
So I buy the walmart shoes and some groceries instead of just the $60 shoes and no groceries.,reddit
But I'll also have to pay rent and my light bill is due.,reddit
So I'll pay the light bill and buy some shoe glue for $4 to fix my shoes for another few weeks until I can buy the $15 ones again.,reddit
So I'm down to 20 hours a week and now my day is filled with riding the bus to different interviews and then finally on to work.,reddit
"Now, I'm spending more money and time on the bus and interview clothes and making less money at work.",reddit
But* if I had a car* I might be able to pull it off.,reddit
But based on my circumstances if I did have a car it would be a shitty one and either break down all the time or be a gas hog.,reddit
So now I'm (theoretically) working that 2nd job of 20 hours a week just to pay for the car to take me to my 1st job.,reddit
I'm working a 2nd job but my shitty car is costing me money,reddit
"Finally getting a car allowed me to work more jobs, go to college etc and obtain a better lifestyle.",reddit
That I was only able to do because I lived at home with my parents rent free at the time.,reddit
Edit: for those saying why didn't I ride a bike when I was poor all those years ago.,reddit
"Also It's not ideal to show up to work after an (11 mile trip to work for me back then) bike ride sweaty, tired and needing a shower.",reddit
Also I lived in the midwest so it would be 85-100 degrees in the summer with 80%+ humidity.,reddit

My post was from when I was a younger man a few years ago.,reddit
"This is actually a good question that can illustrate something: When you are poor, the system is set up to keep you that way.",reddit
"For example, how much do you pay to cash your paycheck?",reddit
"If you aren't and have never been poor, you probably said Pay? , because you don't.",reddit
Your check probably goes via direct deposit right into your checking account.,reddit
"Well, now you have to go to a check-cashing service and pay money to get it.",reddit
"This means that, out of your already low check, you get to a few dollars down.",reddit
"If you are lucky, you can find a grocery store that will give you fee back in certificates to the store, but even then they might charge you a small fee on top of that.",reddit
"So, now that you are poor, you get to pay *more* money for your insurance.",reddit
"If you need a car, you will have to go to one of *those* lots.",reddit
"I mean, put 200k miles on it and drive it until it just doesn't want to go anymore?",reddit
"Then you take your jalopy into the local, reputable Honda dealer and they give you 20 bucks and a Snickers bar for it.",reddit
"They certainly don't sell it at their lot, that's for damned sure.",reddit
"They aren't going to park your ridiculous hoopdie next to their brand new Accords and Civics, just being in the same vicinity of it drops their value.",reddit
"No, they usually have a deal with (or ownership in)",reddit
They offer financing at rates that would make a loan shark uneasy.,reddit
Their cars usually have a lot of miles and are guaranteed only to make it off the lot.,reddit
Some of them will even rig up the cars with tracking devices so their repo men can find you easier.,reddit
"That lot will sell this hunk-a-junk to the kind of person who, more than anyone else, needs it to start every day and get them to work.",reddit
And what if you were a week into a job in which you were as replaceable as a number 2 pencil?,reddit
At least then you might be able to call a friend or family member to help you out.,reddit
"If you don't have kids, you can probably at least take a cab today.",reddit
And then you can fall into another trap: You can get a short-term loan!,reddit
People who have credit don't get these loans because they are predatory and shitty.,reddit
"Ordinary people may know a little about them, but usually just say What kind of stupid person gets themselves into that?",reddit
This is one of the fatal flaws of the bootstrap-mentality in which fixing poverty is simply a matter of will.,reddit
"When you're that far down, the deck is stacked entirely against you.",reddit
I'm also not trying to say that there is a cabal of evil people actively rigging the system and stacking the deck.,reddit
"The deck is stacked, but it is a product of culture, not a conspiracy against the poor.",reddit
"When someone who doesn't really swim well jumps into the deep end, it's what we call a bad decision .",reddit
"Still, the lifeguard doesn't stand on the edge of the pool and lecture them about prudent swim-related decisions.",reddit

"You'd also have to be an idiot to look at them and say Look, it's easy:",reddit
"True or not, it's insensitive and shows a complete lack of understanding to the situation at hand.",reddit
"Great idea, if the town they live and work in has a branch, and that branch is not on the other side of town.",reddit
"This is looking at the problem in a vacuum, ignoring the several other problems around it that make the situation worse.",reddit

"I've seen MIT admissions from the perspective of the applicant, a student, a teacher, and now as an alumnus conducting interviews of prospective students.",reddit
The fact that you mentioned MIT specifically really made me feel like I should take the time to produce a good response!,reddit
"While all that is true, the problem you're dealing with is so much bigger than that.",reddit
The problem you're coming up against is one I've seen so many of my fellow students encounter.,reddit
"If I could set up a wavy-fade flashback, I'd show you my freshman year.",reddit
I moved into one of the dorms at MIT thinking I was hot shit.,reddit
Registration went by easy enough and I was pleased with my decisions.,reddit
"I wasn't the greatest student in high school, and whenever I got poor grades I would explain them away by saying I just didn't care",reddit

I ended up pulling a B+ at the end of a semester and avoiding that train wreck.,reddit

But none of this has to do with my intelligence; I'm just rambling.,reddit
You got A's because you studied or because the classes were easy.,reddit
You got a B probably because you were so used to understanding things that you didn't know how to deal with something that didn't come so easily.,reddit

"By the time I graduated MIT, I had become the person I looked up to when I first got in.",reddit
"You're so young, way too young to be worried about not being smart enough.",reddit

"One Saturday, I decided I would grab a steel can and fill it with Gasoline and head to the woods.",reddit
"Now, this wasnt just your typical ol' can of spegetti-O's",reddit
I took it to the woods and decided it would be cool just to light it on fire and see what would happen.,reddit
I lit it and it caught like I expected and kept burning inside the can.,reddit
After about 15mins I got bored and went to try and put it out.,reddit
"In the process, I knocked the can over spreading gasoline all over the forest floor and it erupted in a ball of flame.",reddit
By this point the fire had spread tremendously and my efforts were useless.,reddit
I decided my best bet would be to run inside and play video games.,reddit
Luckily this spot in the woods was pretty good ways away from my parents house,reddit
"After about an hour or so, the entire fire department is on scene battling the 3-4acres of forest fire that is roaring.",reddit
There was a road that runs behind my house and the fire basically engulfed all of the forest separating my parents house and this road.,reddit
"While the firefighters are trying to battle the flames, it is discovered that the house closest to the fire is a rather large cook house and cops show up and a huge bust goes down.",reddit
"Naturally, the fire was blamed on them and my parents just accepted that.",reddit

Do some quick calculations and realize that crossing where I intended would make me cross the road aprox.,reddit
"Worried about hurting the guy's feelings, making him think I was avoiding him, so I walked PAST him, then doubled back to go to the store.",reddit

Do you want some real data on how the benefits of minimum wage increases are not cancelled out by increases in cost of living?,reddit
Take this OECD source that lists the comparative price level of each country (Measures PPP),reddit
Countries with low minimum wages like the United States are much lower.,reddit
The minimum wage in Australia is $13.85 USD per hour ($16.87 AUD),reddit
This means that the Australian wage is 1.91 times greater than the U.S wage.,reddit
"Similarly, according to this TIL the minimum wage (for McDonald's workers as example - Denmark doesn't have an 'official' minimum wage)",reddit
In the U.S the comparative price level is $100 (As it is the baseline comparison country for this measurement).,reddit
"This means that the cost of living, and prices for general goods, is only 1.36 times more in Australia than in the U.S.",reddit
"The OECD comparative price level for Denmark, the fifth most expensive country world, is a staggering $140 USD.",reddit
Hence this means the cost of living in Denmark is 1.40 times greater than in the U.S.,reddit
"But the minimum wage in Denmark, as demonstrated by this TIL, is a whopping 2.89 times greater than in the U.S.",reddit
So in reality the McDonalds workers of Denmark possess far more purchasing power than their counterparts in the U.S.,reddit
"Combined with their free healthcare, and cheap education; they're leaps and bounds ahead.",reddit
From the data of GDP growth between countries(  the GDP growth in high minimum wage countries like Australia is 2.50%.,reddit
However Denmark's GDP growth in the same period was only 0.10%.,reddit
So perhaps minimum wage is not considerably accountable for a countries growth or collapse.,reddit
So why are we in U.S still faced with a pauper's minimum wage?,reddit
"Well maybe it's because, as you said, the facts are hushed and all the data has been cherry picked.",reddit
"This source(  shows that a minimum wage worker in the U.S would take home about $13,328 after tax.",reddit
"This source shows(  that a minimum wage worker in Australia would take home $27,760 USD after tax.",reddit
The Australian and Dane will take home 2.08 and 2.01 times more salary than the U.S minimum wage worker after tax.,reddit
The increase is still greater than the increase in cost of living between these countries.,reddit
"However tax money in Australia and Denmark goes toward subsidised tertiary education, free healthcare, subsidised pharmaceuticals, and welfare (money for the unemployed/disabled/retired).",reddit
"So that should theoretically further increase the income of Australians and Danes, if isolated and factored out.",reddit
I have changed the CPI comparisons with the OECD sourced comparative price levels data.,reddit
After doing so the comparisons in cost of living between Australia and Denmark and the U.S changed only slightly; by about 0.1 times.,reddit
"You hush with your facts, these things only work if you cherry pick the data.",reddit

Grandpa cleared his throat and pulled a stained handkerchief from his flannel shirt pocket.,reddit
"He blew his nose, balled up the handkerchief, and put it back in his pocket.",reddit

I was able to stay in because I contented myself recalling the showers of my youth.,reddit

"In this period, walls in fashionable houses were paneled from floor to ceiling and divided horizontally into three parts to represent the classical proportions of the column.",reddit
"Walls would have been painted in a single colour, although a darker shade might have been used to emphasise details such as the skirting and door (stronger colours were expensive).",reddit
Ceilings were divided into segments defined by moldings around the ceiling rose with details highlighted in white against delicate muted tones.,reddit

"As an architectural style, 'Edwardian' refers to the period 1901 to 1918.",reddit
"As a period, it covers the years between 1901 and 1910.",reddit
"The Edwardian era was a period of revivalism, taking ideas from the mediaeval and Georgian periods, among others.",reddit
"Houses had wider frontages so there was often more room for a hall, in larger houses this was even used as a living room.",reddit
"For example, it would be furnished with a desk and perhaps even a fireplace.",reddit
The underlying themes of buildings and interior design of the Edwardian era were for expensive simplicity and sunshine and air.,reddit
"Colours and detailing were lighter than in the late 19th century, looking back to the Georgian era of a century before.",reddit
"As gas and then electric light became more widespread, walls could be lighter as they did not get so dirty and looked better in the brighter light.",reddit
"Decorative patterns were less complex, both wallpaper and curtain designs were plainer.",reddit
Displays of flowers were placed to complement the floral fabrics and wallpapers.,reddit

I intend to get new glasses soon so I'll show your post to the optician.,reddit
"First, I'm kind of disappointed with whomever made you those glasses.",reddit
"There are several things they could have done to make them more aesthetically pleasing, less thick, etc.",reddit
You have a very strong prescription characterized by a very thin lens center that increases a lot as the lens size gets bigger,reddit
"Because of this, you should always try to get the smallest, ROUNDEST frame you can tolerate.",reddit
"The edges will be beveled thinner (like in the picture again) and will not have a prescription,",reddit
Adding an anti-reflective coating on that lens will keep the rounded-over edge from causing annoying reflections.,reddit
All of this will give the illusion of a thinner lens and give you less of that coke-bottle look.,reddit
"Done well, a polished and rounded lens looks no thicker on the edges than the frame itself.",reddit
You can also hide some of the outer lens thickness by selecting a frame with a thicker edge itself.,reddit
"A variation on this is to have a black frame, and then paint the very edges of the lens black as well to make them look like part of the frame.",reddit
"Again, this is just aesthetics, it just minimizes the look of a thick lens.",reddit
Another thing you can do to increase the aesthetics is to have the entire lens coated with an anti-glare coating.,reddit
"Finally, there are lens materials that have a high index of refraction.",reddit
"That simply means that they curve light more, so you don't need as thick a lens to get the same prescription.",reddit
"Of course, the best way to deal with a prescription this powerful is to wear contact lenses, if you are capable to doing so.",reddit
"Naturally you can't keep your contacts in 24/7/365, so you should always have a pair of back-up glasses.",reddit

So I was laying in the middle of the road doing what looks like trying to pedal a bike sideways.,reddit

All I can say is I am so glad I'm not you right now.,reddit
Because of this I have gotten to know my brother in law and his wife quite well.,reddit
While her clothes were in the drier we sat and talked with her in nothing but a towel.,reddit
I don't know how it got started since we had gotten pretty drunk but the towel ended up coming off and the next thing I know we were having sex.,reddit
I wish we could just pretend it never happened and get on with our lives,reddit
"Her and her husband had been trying for a while but apparently his equipment hadn't been up to the task, he had been gone for a week by the time me and her slept together",reddit
"He was with her when she got morning sickness and made her take a pregnancy test, he is out of his mind excited and has already told everybody.",reddit
"We have somehow kept our cool so far and nobody suspects anything, but sooner or later it will come out.",reddit
Especially since my wife and her brother are Asian and both me and my sister in law are white.,reddit
She is now 4 months along and to compound things more my wife is currently 3 months pregnant.,reddit
"I don't know what to do, I can't sleep and every day is torture while I wait for my life to implode around me.",reddit
I got both my Asian wife and white sister-in-law (my wife's brother's wife) pregnant within a month of each other.,reddit
With all the pain it would cause I am somewhat considering doing what many people consider the evil thing and just praying nobody finds out.,reddit
People say what I did is evil and lying about it is worse,reddit
To make matters worse I have realized that until I made this post I had almost suppressed the whole thing.,reddit
"I mean I had to work so hard to act like I was happy for them, that everything was fine that I had almost convinced myself.",reddit

Women are just a smart and of course should have all the same opportunities as men.,reddit

"The man was pretty rude to me, he'd do things like snap his fingers to get my attention and hound me for refills when his drink was 75% full.",reddit
After he got his burger he returned it to the kitchen several times for reasons like 'it's not seasoned enough'.,reddit
The woman didn't say anything the entire date and looked at the floor whenever I'd come by to check on them.,reddit
"The man got upset that I brought the check while they were still eating their dessert, complaining to my manager that I was rushing him.",reddit
The manager took some percentage off of their bill and in the end they paid and tipped me two pennies.,reddit
I was pretty irritated but people like that just come with the territory of waiting tables.,reddit
She apologized and said that it was the worst date she had ever been on and assured him that I didn't do anything wrong.,reddit
She left $60 with the manager to give to me and wrote me a nice review on Yelp.,reddit

I took it to the woods and decided it would be cool just to light it on fire and see what would happen.,reddit
I lit it and it caught like I expected and kept burning inside the can.,reddit
After about 15mins I got bored and went to try and put it out.,reddit
"In the process, I knocked the can over spreading gasoline all over the forest floor and it erupted in a ball of flame.",reddit
By this point the fire had spread tremendously and my efforts were useless.,reddit
I decided my best bet would be to run inside and play video games.,reddit
Luckily this spot in the woods was pretty good ways away from my parents house,reddit
"After about an hour or so, the entire fire department is on scene battling the 3-4acres of forest fire that is roaring.",reddit
There was a road that runs behind my house and the fire basically engulfed all of the forest separating my parents house and this road.,reddit

As soon as the lady in the red dress walks past them the old lady also without moving anything else moves arm next to the old man and slams her elbow into the side of the old man.,reddit
It was all I could do to not stop and laugh out loud.,reddit
Stewardess has placed extra pillows and blankets on seat across from me.,reddit
She was wearing a garter and stockings and nothing else under her skirt.,reddit
Would have been even more exciting except all I could do was imagine.,reddit
"I am 6'-2 tall and weighed about 95 pounds at the time, I had lost so much weight due my illness.",reddit
So all I could do was think about sex but even if she had been willing nothing I could have done.,reddit

There's more attention given to animal shelter conditions than prisons because the idea that the prisoners deserve this treatment is so common.,reddit

"His siblings all seemed to play with language, gibbering and trying out different sounds, but he would do very steady, consistent bursts.",reddit
"But again, a baby, you try not to let yourself put your kids into pigeon holes especially not that early.",reddit
Because he was the youngest it was hard to spot at first that he'd lean on his older siblings to let them think for him.,reddit
When he was struggling with a task they would simply take over and complete it for him.,reddit
The first time the thought occurred to me that something was actually wrong was when he hit 9 years old.,reddit
"We had gotten a new microwave, it was very basic, but a completely new set up.",reddit
"I asked why, he said he couldn't figure it out.",reddit
"He stared at the buttons: instead of trying to figure out the functions in THIS microwave, he was just trying to recreate the button layout of the PREVIOUS microwave.",reddit
"He kept looking for a specific button, it didn't help when I told him it wasn't there.",reddit
He only started using the microwave again once he could memorize the steps.,reddit
"Still, I thought this was just him learning to rely on his older sibling's problem solving.",reddit
I asked the most helpful of our kids to take a step back,reddit
"Problems with his video games, homework, chores, it didn't matter.",reddit
"Once he hit a wall he stopped, or would attempt fruitlessly to fix it, then stop.",reddit
"But he's not going to solve it for himself, almost certainly.",reddit
"He's an incredibly kind, generous and (thankfully) good looking young man.",reddit
"Not being intelligent is not the worst thing, but it does make me worry about his ability to function independently.",reddit
"We pay far more attention to his friends than his older siblings', knowing how *their* critical thinking is going to become *his* new life patterns.",reddit
I'm pinning my hopes on him finding a trustworthy life partner who has his best intentions at heart.,reddit
Either that or hopefully our oldest two will continue to keep an eye out for him.,reddit

"I arrived at my 2500 foot stop and jumped out to spray paint the railroad tie, to mark that spot for the rest of the crew.",reddit
"I then realized I had no spray paint, nothing in the whole truck.",reddit
I searched for a little flag I could put up but had none of those either.,reddit
I ended up searching the ground for something like a stick or garbage that I could just leave there in the middle of the tracks for the time being.,reddit
"Anyway, you always find crazy shit along the tracks there, if it's not a body, it's 500 hypodermic needles.",reddit
"So in this giant pile of garbage, I find an old bbq, complete with a set of bbq tools like tongs and brush etc.",reddit
I thought it would be pretty funny if I just set up a bbq in the middle of the tracks,reddit
It was at least 3 feet long and had to have been almost a foot in circumference.,reddit
I decided this would be the best thing to mark the location with.,reddit
"I ended up finding a couple old random shoes in that pile and, armed with my tongs",reddit

"I really wish I was able to have my phone at work, I would have had a good picture for you guys.",reddit
"Anyway, with that spot marked for the next guy, I put my truck into reverse and headed back to the crossing we were working at.",reddit
"I arrived and the foreman at the time was asking how I marked the footage without taking the paint, I told him that he would eventually find out when we got there.",reddit
We packed everything up and were waiting for a train on the opposite track to go by us when the trains brakes hammered on and started screeching.,reddit
"Now when a train goes into emergency, everything stops and the traffic controller is on the radio immediately.",reddit
We were all told to stay where we were as there had been a person struck by a train just half a mile from our jobsite.,reddit
We took our truck off the tracks and headed down the parallel road to see what had happened.,reddit
"When we arrived we found a CP police officer and 3 port authority vehicles there, all parked right beside where I had left my uh.. marker",reddit
"With the way that it had looked, how thick it was and the fact that the top of it was red",reddit

The Dursley s had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.,harry
"The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.",harry
They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.,harry
The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street.,harry
"The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.",harry
This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.,harry
"Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.",harry

Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind.,harry
As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.,harry
"But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else.",harry
"As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about.",harry
Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes - the getups you saw on young people!,harry
He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.,harry
"Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak!",harry
"The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.",harry
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor.,harry
"If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.",harry
"He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead.",harry
"Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning.",harry
"He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.",harry
He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's.,harry
"This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin.",harry
"It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.",harry
"He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.",harry
He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.,harry
"Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry.",harry
There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.,harry
"Sorry, he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.",harry
It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak.,harry
He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground.,harry
"On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare,",harry
"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!",harry
"Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!",harry
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.,harry
"He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was.",harry
"He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.",harry

She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word ( Won't! ).,harry
"When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:",harry
"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today.",harry
"Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise.",harry
Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.,harry
"Well, Ted, said the weatherman, I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.",harry
"Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars!",harry
"Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early - it's not until next week, folks!",harry
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea.,harry
"Er - Petunia, dear - you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?",harry
"After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.",harry
Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name Potter.,harry
"Instead he said, as casually as he could, Their son - he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?",harry
"Oh, yes, said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly.",harry
He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.,harry
"While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.",harry
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.,harry
"Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.",harry
"His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley.",harry
"Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness.",harry
"It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive.",harry
"It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead.",harry
"In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.",harry
"A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently",harry
"He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.",harry
"He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.",harry
"His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice.",harry
Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome.,harry
"But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street.",harry
"For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him.",harry
"He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.",harry
"Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him.",harry
"If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement.",harry
"Dumbledore slipped the Put- Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat.",harry
"He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.",harry
"He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone.",harry
Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes.,harry
"She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one.",harry
"My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.",harry
"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day, said Professor McGonagall.",harry
I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.,harry
"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no - even the Muggles have noticed something's going on.",harry
She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window.,harry
Shooting stars down in Kent - I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle.,harry
"People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.",harry
"She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on.",harry
"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all.",harry
"No, thank you, said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops.",harry
"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -",harry
"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name?",harry
Know-Who' nonsense - for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:,harry
"Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.",harry
It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-Know-Who.',harry
I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.,harry
"I know you haven't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.",harry
Only because you're too - well - noble to use them.,harry
I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.,harry
"Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.",harry
"It was plain that whatever everyone was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.",harry
"Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.",harry
"What they're saying, she pressed on, is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow.",harry
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are - are - that they're - dead.,harry
"They're saying he tried to kill the Potters' son, Harry.",harry
"No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke - and that's why he's gone.",harry
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.,harry
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it.,harry
"It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge.",harry
"It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, Hagrid's late.",harry
"I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?",harry
"And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?",harry
You don't mean - you can't mean the people who live here?,harry
"And they've got this son - I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.",harry
His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older.,harry
"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?",harry
"Exactly, said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.",harry
"Can't you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?",harry
"Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, Yes - yes, you're right, of course.",harry
She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.,harry
You think it - wise - to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?,harry
"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place, said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, but you can't pretend he's not careless.",harry
"If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.",harry
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide.,harry
"In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.",harry
"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir, said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke.",harry
"No, sir - house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around.",harry
"Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.",harry
"Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.",harry
"Well - give him here, Hagrid - we'd better get this over with.",harry
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.,harry
"Could I - could I say good-bye to him, sir?",harry
"He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss.",harry
"Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.",harry
Lily an' James dead - an' poor little Harry off ter live with,harry
"He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two.",harry
"Yeah, said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, I'd best get this bike away.",harry
"Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.",harry
"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall, said Dumbledore, nodding to her.",harry
On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put- Outer.,harry
"He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange",harry
He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.,harry
"He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.",harry
"A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen.",harry
"He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices:",harry
"Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.",harry
Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.,harry
"The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.",harry
"Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.",harry
His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.,harry
Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove.,harry
He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having.,harry
He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before.,harry
"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon.",harry
"And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.",harry
"He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on.",harry
"Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.",harry
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen.,harry
"It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike.",harry
"Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise - unless of course it involved punching somebody.",harry
"Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him.",harry
"Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age.",harry
"He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was.",harry
"Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes.",harry
He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose.,harry
The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.,harry
"He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.",harry
"In the car crash when your parents died, she had said.",harry
Don't ask questions - that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.,harry
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.,harry
"About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut.",harry
"Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference",harry
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother.,harry
"He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.",harry
"Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room.",harry
"Thirty-six, he said, looking up at his mother and father.",harry
"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.",harry
"Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.",harry
"Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today.",harry
"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. '",harry
He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.,harry
"Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap.",harry
"Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies.",harry
"Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away.",harry
The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.,harry
"The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there - or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug.",harry
"What about what's-her-name, your friend - Yvonne?",harry
"I won't blow up the house, said Harry, but they weren't listening.",harry
"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!",harry
He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms.,harry
He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them.,harry
"His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.",harry
"I'm warning you, he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's",harry
"The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys",harry
"Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.",harry
"Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off.",harry
"He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.",harry
"Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls).",harry
"The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry.",harry
"Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.",harry
"On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens.",harry
"Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney.",harry
The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.,harry
But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors.,harry
Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.,harry
It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere,harry
"I had a dream about a motorcycle, said Harry, remembering suddenly.",harry
"He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!",harry
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families.,harry
"It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond.",harry
Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time.,harry
"They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one",harry
"Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.",harry
"It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls.",harry
"Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone.",harry
"Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.",harry
It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can - but at the moment it didn't look in the mood.,harry
"Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.",harry
"Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge.",harry
"Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.",harry
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake.,harry
He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself - no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long.,harry
"It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.",harry
"Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.",harry
"The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling.",harry
It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: I get that all the time.,harry
"I know, Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him.",harry
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass.,harry
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo.,harry
"As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.",harry
"Out of the way, you, he said, punching Harry in the ribs.",harry
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished.,harry
"The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor.",harry
People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.,harry
"But the glass, he kept saying, where did the glass go?",harry
"The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again.",harry
"As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car",harry
"But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?",harry
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry.,harry
"Go - cupboard - stay - no meals, before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.",harry
"Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch.",harry
He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.,harry
"Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.",harry
"He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash.",harry
He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died.,harry
"Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead.",harry
"This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from.",harry
"His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions.",harry
"When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family.",harry
Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him.,harry
A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley.,harry
"After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.",harry
A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.,harry
A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.,harry
The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.,harry
"Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.",harry
The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment.,harry
"Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day.",harry
"Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader.",harry
The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.,harry
"This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope.",harry
"When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley.",harry
"Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings.",harry
"Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school.",harry
"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall, he told Harry.",harry
The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it - it might be sick.,harry
"Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said.",harry
"One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's.",harry
"It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before.",harry
She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years.,harry
"That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform.",harry
"Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters.",harry
"They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking.",harry
"As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life.",harry
"Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up.",harry
He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.,harry
There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast.,harry
It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink.,harry
The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.,harry
Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.,harry
"Oh, he said, I didn't realize it had to be so wet.",harry
I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you.,harry
It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished.,harry
"Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue.",harry
He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall,harry
"High - like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.",harry
"Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform.",harry
"Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.",harry
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.,harry
"Get the mail, Dudley, said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.",harry
"Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band.",harry
"No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him.",harry
"He had no friends, no other relatives - he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back.",harry
"The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald- green ink.",harry
"Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter.",harry
"He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.",harry
"Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.",harry
"Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.",harry
His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights.,harry
"Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach.",harry
"They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room.",harry
He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.,harry
"I want to read it, said Harry furiously, as it's mine.",harry
"Get out, both of you, croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.",harry
"Vernon, Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, look at the address - how could they possibly know where he sleeps?",harry
"Watching - spying - might be following us, muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.",harry
Tell them we don't want - Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.,harry
"But - I'm not having one in the house, Petunia!",harry
Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?,harry
"That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.",harry
"It was addressed to you by mistake, said Uncle Vernon shortly.",harry
"It was not a mistake, said Harry angrily, it had my cupboard on it.",harry
"He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.",harry
It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room.,harry
They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched.,harry
Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.,harry
Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall.,harry
"When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it.",harry
They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall.,harry
"Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive - ' With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him.",harry
"Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.",harry
"After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.",harry
"Go to your cupboard - I mean, your bedroom, he wheezed at Harry.",harry
Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter.,harry
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first.,harry
His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door - AAAAARRRGH !,harry
Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat - something,harry
"Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do.",harry
He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea.,harry
"Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.",harry
"I want - he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.",harry
"See, he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, if they can't deliver them they'll just give up.",harry
"Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me, said Uncle Page | 43",harry
"Rowling Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.",harry
"As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.",harry
"After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out.",harry
"He hummed Tiptoe Through the Tulips as he worked, and jumped at small noises.",harry
"Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window.",harry
"While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.",harry
"Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets.",harry
"The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one - Out!",harry
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.,harry
"When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.",harry
"They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.",harry
"That does it, said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time.",harry
I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave.,harry
He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue.,harry
"Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.",harry
"Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.",harry
Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.,harry
"He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.",harry
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city.,harry
"Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets.",harry
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day.,harry
They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. ',harry
Only I got about an 'undred of these at the front desk.,harry
"I'll take them, said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.",harry
"Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.",harry
"He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again.",harry
"The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.",harry
"Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.",harry
"If it was Monday - and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week, because of television - then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday.",harry
"Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun - last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.",harry
"He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought.",harry
Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.,harry
Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine.,harry
"A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.",harry
"I've already got us some rations, said Uncle Vernon, so all aboard!",harry
Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces.,harry
"The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty.",harry
Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas.,harry
He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.,harry
Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail.,harry
"Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.",harry
Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows.,harry
Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa.,harry
"She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.",harry
The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on.,harry
"He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger.",harry
Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight.,harry
"The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time.",harry
"He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.",harry
"He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.",harry
Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.,harry
"Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that?",harry
And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise?,harry
"The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door.",harry
There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room.,harry
"He was holding a rifle in his hands - now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.",harry
The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.,harry
"His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.",harry
"The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling.",harry
"He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame.",harry
He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.,harry
"Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.",harry
"Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.",harry
"Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh've got yer mom's eyes.",harry
"Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.",harry
"Anyway - Harry, said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, a very happy birthday to yeh.",harry
"Got summat fer yeh here - I mighta sat on it at some point, but it'll taste all right.",harry
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box.,harry
"Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.",harry
"He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, Who are you?",harry
He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm.,harry
"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind.",harry
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted.,harry
He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he was doing,harry
It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.,harry
Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage.,harry
"Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little.",harry
"Uncle Vernon said sharply, Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley.",harry
"He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the giant.",harry
"Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are.",harry
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.,harry
"Do you mean ter tell me, he growled at the Dursleys,",harry
"He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad.",harry
"But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, About our world, I mean.",harry
"Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like Mimblewimble.",harry
"But yeh must know about yer mom and dad, he said.",harry
"My - my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?",harry
"Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.",harry
"A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.",harry
Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him?,harry
"Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh, said Hagrid.",harry
"With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be?",harry
"Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea.",harry
"Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.",harry
"Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which to ask first.",harry
"After a few minutes he stammered, What does it mean, they await my owl?",harry
"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me, said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat",harry
With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:,harry
"Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm.",harry
Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.,harry
"I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him, he said.",harry
"A Muggle, said Hagrid, it's what we call nonmagic folk like them.",harry
"We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish, said Uncle Vernon, swore we'd stamp it out of him!",harry
"How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was?",harry
"Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that - that school - and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats.",harry
I was the only one who saw her for what she was - a freak!,harry
"But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!",harry
She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on.,harry
It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.,harry
"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange,",harry
"As soon as he found his voice he said, Blown up?",harry
Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!,harry
"I never expected this, he said, in a low, worried voice.",harry
"I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin'",harry
"He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, It begins, I suppose, with - with a person called - but it's incredible",harry
Well - I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it.,harry
"Anyway, this - this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers.",harry
"Got 'em, too - some were afraid, some just wanted a bit",harry
"Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches . . .",harry
"Course, some stood up to him - an' he killed 'em.",harry
Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of.,harry
"Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway.",harry
"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew.",harry
Who never tried to get 'em on his side before . . .,harry
"All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago.",harry
"An' then - an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing - he tried to kill you, too.",harry
"Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then.",harry
"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders.",harry
Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there.,harry
"I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured - and as for all this about your parents",harry
"But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat.",harry
"In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.",harry
"That's better, said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.",harry
"Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.",harry
"Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it.",harry
Don' reckon they could've done if he was cornin' back.,harry
Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers.,harry
There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on - /,harry
"Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.",harry
"If he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?",harry
"Hagrid, he said quietly, I think you must have made a mistake.",harry
"Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.",harry
"Harry Potter, not a wizard - you wait, you'll be right famous at Hogwarts.",harry
But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight.,harry
"I've read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish - spell books and wands and - If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him, growled Hagrid.",harry
He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world.,harry
"He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled - I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT",harry
"When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers.",harry
"Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.",harry
"Shouldn'ta lost me temper, he said ruefully, but it didn't work anyway.",harry
"Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig",harry
"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts, he said.",harry
"Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that.",harry
He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.,harry
"Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.",harry
I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards.,harry
When I open my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard.,harry
"Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him.",harry
"The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up.",harry
The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid 's coat.,harry
"Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.",harry
"There's an owl - Pay him, Hagrid grunted into the sofa.",harry
"Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it.",harry
"Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London",harry
He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.,harry
"Don't worry about that, said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head.",harry
"But if their house was destroyed - They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy!",harry
"As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore.",harry
"Fetchin' you - gettin' things from Gringotts - knows he can trust me, see.",harry
The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight.,harry
"The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.",harry
"They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.",harry
"Seems a shame ter row, though, said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks.",harry
"If I was ter - er - speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?",harry
"Of course not, said Harry, eager to see more magic.",harry
"Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.",harry
"Spells - enchantments, said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke.",harry
They say there's dragons guardin' the high-security vaults.,harry
"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual, Hagrid muttered, turning the page.",harry
"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o' course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.",harry
"So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice.",harry
"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up",harry
"Blimey, Harry, everyone 'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems.",harry
"Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.",harry
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station.,harry
"Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, See that, Harry?",harry
Wanted one ever since I was a kid - here we go.,harry
"Hagrid, who didn't understand Muggle money, as he called it, gave the bills to Harry",harry
Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.,harry
"Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night before, and read:",harry
One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 4.,harry
Please note that all pupils' clothes should carry name tags COURSE BOOKS,harry
All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert,harry
One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander,harry
"Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way.",harry
"He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.",harry
"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic, he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.",harry
"They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand.",harry
Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them?,harry
Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up?,harry
"This is it, said Hagrid, coming to a halt, the Leaky Cauldron.",harry
"If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there.",harry
Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all.,harry
"In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.",harry
"A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry.",harry
"A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut.",harry
"Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, The usual, Hagrid?",harry
"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business, said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.",harry
"Good Lord, said the bartender, peering at Harry, is this - can this be - ?",harry
"He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.",harry
The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.,harry
"Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.",harry
"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last.",harry
Always wanted to shake your hand - I'm all of a flutter.,harry
"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle.",harry
Harry shook hands again and again - Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.,harry
"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.",harry
"P-P-Potter, stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, c-can't t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.",harry
"Against the D-D-Dark Arts, muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it.",harry
"You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose?",harry
But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself.,harry
"At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.",harry
"Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.",harry
"They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag - never been the same since.",harry
"Scared of the students, scared of his own subject - now, where's me umbrella?",harry
"Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.",harry
He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.,harry
"The brick he had touched quivered - it wriggled - in the middle, a small hole appeared -",harry
Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.,harry
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.,harry
"Cauldrons - All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver - Self-Stirring - Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.",harry
"Yeah, you'll be needin' one, said Hagrid, but we gotta get yer money first.",harry
"He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping.",harry
"A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, Dragon liver,",harry
"A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium - Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy.",harry
Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it.,harry
"Look, Harry heard one of them say, the new Nimbus Two Thousand - fastest ever -",harry
"There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments",harry
They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops.,harry
"Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was -",harry
"Yeah, that's a goblin, said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him.",harry
"He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet.",harry
"Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:",harry
"Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn.",harry
"So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there.",harry
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall.,harry
"About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.",harry
"There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these.",harry
"Got it here somewhere, said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.",harry
Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.,harry
"Got it, said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.",harry
"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore, said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest.",harry
It's about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.,harry
"Very well, he said, handing it back to Hagrid, I will have someone take you down to both vaults.",harry
"Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.",harry
What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?,harry
It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor.,harry
Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them.,harry
They climbed in - Hagrid with some difficulty - and were off.,harry
"Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.",harry
"The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering.",harry
"Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open.",harry
"I never know, Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?",harry
"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it, said Hagrid.",harry
"He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.",harry
"A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped.",harry
The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking.,harry
How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep?,harry
"And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.",harry
Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle,harry
"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?",harry
The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners.,harry
He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.,harry
"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there, said Griphook.",harry
"About once every ten years, said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.",harry
Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor.,harry
"Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.",harry
"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way back",harry
Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money.,harry
"Might as well get yer uniform, said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions.",harry
"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron?",harry
"He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.",harry
"Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.",harry
"Got the lot here - another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.",harry
"In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes.",harry
"Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.",harry
"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands, said the boy.",harry
Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms.,harry
I don't see why first years can't have their own.,harry
"No, Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.",harry
"I do - Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree.",harry
"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been - imagine",harry
"Mmm, said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.",harry
"Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.",harry
"That's Hagrid, said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.",harry
I heard he's a sort of savage - lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now,harry
He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy.,harry
"Oh, sorry, said the other, not sounding sorry at all.",harry
"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean.",harry
"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you?",harry
"They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways.",harry
"Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine.",harry
"But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, That's you done, my dear, and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.",harry
"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose, said the drawling boy.",harry
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).,harry
Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.,harry
"When they had left the shop, he said, Hagrid, what's Quidditch?",harry
"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know - not knowin' about Quidditch!",harry
If he'd known who yeh were - he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk.,harry
You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh.,harry
It's like - like soccer in the Muggle world - everyone follows Quidditch - played up in the air on broomsticks,harry
"Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but - I bet I'm in Hufflepuff, said Harry gloomily.",harry
There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.,harry
"Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these.",harry
Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses,harry
"An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet",harry
"Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either ( It says pewter on yer list ), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.",harry
"Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages.",harry
"Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling.",harry
You don't have to - I know I don't have to.,harry
"Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an",harry
"Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes.",harry
"Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing.",harry
"He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.",harry
Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys.,harry
"Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh",harry
Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382b.,harry
A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.,harry
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside.,harry
"It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait.",harry
The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.,harry
"Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.",harry
"An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.",harry
"It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand.",harry
"Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow.",harry
"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand.",harry
"Well, I say your father favored it - it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.",harry
Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose.,harry
"Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger.",harry
"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it, he said softly.",harry
"He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.",harry
But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?,harry
"Er - yes, they did, yes, said Hagrid, shuffling his feet.",harry
"I've still got the pieces, though, he added brightly.",harry
Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.,harry
He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket.,harry
"Er - well, I'm right-handed, said Harry.",harry
"He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head.",harry
"As he measured, he said, Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter.",harry
"We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons.",harry
"No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same.",harry
"And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand.",harry
"Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own.",harry
"That will do, he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor.",harry
"Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.",harry
"Try - Harry tried - but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.",harry
"No, no - here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.",harry
"The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.",harry
"Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, Oh, bravo!",harry
"He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, Curious . . .",harry
"It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather - just one other.",harry
"It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother - why, its brother gave you that scar.",harry
"I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.",harry
"Must-Not-Be-Named did great things - terrible, yes, but great.",harry
"He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.",harry
"The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty.",harry
"Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.",harry
"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves, he said.",harry
He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them.,harry
I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for.,harry
Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.,harry
"Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine.",harry
"But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts - I did - still do, 'smatter of fact.",harry
"Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.",harry
First o' September - King's Cross - it's all on yer ticket.,harry
"Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.",harry
THREE-QUARTERS Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun.,harry
"Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty.",harry
"Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.",harry
"Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company.",harry
"He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic.",harry
"He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased.",harry
"It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice.",harry
"Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.",harry
"He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.",harry
Er - I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to - to go to Hogwarts.,harry
He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.,harry
"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train.",harry
"I don't know, said Harry, realizing this for the first time.",harry
He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.,harry
"I just take the train from platform nine and three- quarters at eleven o'clock, he read.",harry
"Barking, said Uncle Vernon, howling mad, the lot of them.",harry
"We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother.",harry
Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.,harry
Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep.,harry
He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes - he'd change on the train.,harry
"Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.",harry
Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him.,harry
"Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.",harry
"Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they?",harry
"There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.",harry
"Have a good term, said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile.",harry
"He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig.",harry
"He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters.",harry
"The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose.",harry
"Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one.",harry
"In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters.",harry
"Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley.",harry
He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.,harry
At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.,harry
"The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair.",harry
Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him - and they had an owl.,harry
"They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.",harry
"Nine and three-quarters! piped a small girl, also red-",harry
What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.,harry
"I'm not Fred, I'm George, said the boy.",harry
"Only joking, I am Fred, said the boy, and off he went.",harry
"His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone - but how had he done it?",harry
"Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier - he was almost there - and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere.",harry
"He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.",harry
I don't know how to - How to get onto the platform?,harry
All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten.,harry
"Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important.",harry
Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.,harry
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people.,harry
"Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three- Quarters on it.",harry
"Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs.",harry
Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.,harry
Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.,harry
"He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, Gran, I've lost my toad again.",harry
"The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.",harry
Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train.,harry
He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door.,harry
He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.,harry
It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier.,harry
"With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.",harry
"Thanks, said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.",harry
"The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red.",harry
"Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.",harry
"With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.",harry
"Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying.",harry
"The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.",harry
"He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it.",harry
"I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves -",harry
If I get one more owl telling me you've - you've blown up a toilet or - Blown up a toilet?,harry
You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station?,harry
"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom,",harry
"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo.",harry
He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.,harry
"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?",harry
As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.,harry
"They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry.",harry
"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls.",harry
"Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.",harry
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner.,harry
He didn't know what he was going to - but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.,harry
The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.,harry
"He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked.",harry
"Oh - well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes, said Ron.",harry
"Well - I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.",harry
"He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.",harry
"I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him.",harry
The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.,harry
You could say I've got a lot to live up to.,harry
"Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny.",harry
"Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first.",harry
"I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.",harry
"Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.",harry
"Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff",harry
"He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.",harry
Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl.,harry
"After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.",harry
"You said You-Know-Who's name\ said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed.",harry
"I'd have thought you, of all people - I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name, said Harry,",harry
"I bet, he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately",harry
There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.,harry
"While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.",harry
"They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.",harry
"Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, Anything off the cart, dears?",harry
"Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches.",harry
"Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.",harry
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.,harry
"Starving, said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.",harry
"He pulled one of them apart and said, She always forgets I don't like corned beef.",harry
"Swap you for one of these, said Harry, holding up a pasty.",harry
"Go on - You don't want this, it's all dry, said Ron.",harry
"She hasn't got much time, he added quickly, you know, with five of us.",harry
"Go on, have a pasty, said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with.",harry
"It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).",harry
"Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect - famous witches and wizards.",harry
"I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy.",harry
"He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache.",harry
I might get Agrippa - thanks Harry turned over his card and read:,harry
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times,harry
"Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore 's face had disappeared.",harry
"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, said Ron.",harry
Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.,harry
"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.",harry
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile.,harry
"Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them.",harry
"Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.",harry
"He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.",harry
"When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor - you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe.",harry
"Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.",harry
"Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.",harry
There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in.,harry
"Sorry, he said, but have you seen a toad at all?",harry
"When they shook their heads, he wailed, I've lost him!",harry
If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could.,harry
"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference, said Ron in disgust.",harry
"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work.",harry
He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand.,harry
It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.,harry
Anyway - He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again.,harry
"The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him.",harry
"She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.",harry
"We've already told him we haven't seen it, said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.",harry
"Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.",harry
I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me.,harry
"I've heard - I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough - I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?",harry
"Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.",harry
"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me, said Hermione.",harry
"I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor",harry
"Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad.",harry
I don't know what they'll say if I'm not.,harry
"I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.",harry
"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter, said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off Houses.",harry
"So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?",harry
Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school.,harry
"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing something for Gringotts, said Ron.",harry
"It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you get that with the Muggles - someone tried to rob a high security vault.",harry
"My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don't think they took anything",harry
"He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying Voldemort without worrying.",harry
"He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.",harry
"Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop.",harry
He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.,harry
They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment.,harry
"Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.",harry
"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle, said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking.",harry
"Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.",harry
"My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.",harry
"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter.",harry
You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort.,harry
"He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.",harry
"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks, he said coolly.",harry
"Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.",harry
"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter, he said slowly.",harry
Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents.,harry
"You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you.",harry
"Say that again, Ron said, his face as red as his hair.",harry
"Unless you get out now, said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.",harry
"But we don't feel like leaving, do we, boys?",harry
We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.,harry
"Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.",harry
"Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.",harry
"I think he's been knocked out, Ron said to Harry.",harry
No - I don't believe it - he's gone back to sleep.,harry
They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-,harry
He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.,harry
"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there.",harry
"Scabbers has been fighting, not us, said Ron, scowling at her.",harry
"All right - I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors, said Hermione in a sniffy voice.",harry
"And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?",harry
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.,harry
"Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.",harry
A voice echoed through the train: We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes' time.,harry
"Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.",harry
"Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles.",harry
They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.,harry
"People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform.",harry
"Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: Firs' years!",harry
"Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path.",harry
It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there.,harry
"Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.",harry
"Yeh'll get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec, Hagrid called over his shoulder, jus' round this bend here.",harry
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake.,harry
"Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.",harry
"Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore.",harry
Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.,harry
"And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass.",harry
It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.,harry
"They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.",harry
"Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.",harry
"They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.",harry
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.,harry
"A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there.",harry
She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.,harry
The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it.,harry
"The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.",harry
"Rowling standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.",harry
"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses.",harry
"The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts.",harry
"You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.",harry
"The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.",harry
Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards.,harry
"While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- breaking will lose House points.",harry
"At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor.",harry
I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.,harry
The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school.,harry
I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.,harry
"Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose.",harry
"I shall return when we are ready for you, said Professor McGonagall.",harry
"Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.",harry
But he didn't know any magic yet - what on earth would he have to do?,harry
"He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too.",harry
"No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need.",harry
"He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teachers wig blue.",harry
"Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.",harry
Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air - several people behind him screamed.,harry
"Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years.",harry
"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves?",harry
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.,harry
"One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.",harry
"Now, form a line, Professor McGonagall told the first years, and follow me.",harry
"It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.",harry
At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.,harry
"Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.",harry
The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight.,harry
"Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver.",harry
"Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.",harry
"He heard Hermione whisper, It's bewitched to look like the sky outside.",harry
"It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.",harry
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.,harry
On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat.,harry
"Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing - noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat",harry
A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth - and the hat began to sing:,harry
"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, But don't judge on what you see, I'll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.",harry
"You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall,",harry
"The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.",harry
"You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry",harry
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song.,harry
It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.,harry
"I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.",harry
"Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching.",harry
The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment.,harry
"If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.",harry
"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted, she said.",harry
"A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down.",harry
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table.,harry
Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.,harry
The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.,harry
"Brocklehurst, Mandy went to Ravenclaw too, but Brown, Lavender became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.",harry
"Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.",harry
He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.,harry
"He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.",harry
"Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide.",harry
"Finnigan, Seamus, the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.",harry
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.,harry
"A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous.",harry
"What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake",harry
"When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool.",harry
"When it finally shouted, GRYFFINDOR, Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to MacDougal, Morag.",harry
"Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, SLYTHERIN!",harry
"Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.",harry
"As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.",harry
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him.,harry
Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat.,harry
"Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.",harry
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall.,harry
He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table.,harry
"He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet.",harry
"Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, We got Potter!",harry
Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier.,harry
"The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.",harry
"At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up.",harry
"And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore.",harry
Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train.,harry
Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.,harry
"Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron.",harry
"Thomas, Dean, a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.",harry
"Turpin, Lisa, became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn.",harry
"Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, GRYFFINDOR!",harry
Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.,harry
"Well done, Ron, excellent, said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as Zabini, Blaise, was made a Slytherin.",harry
Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.,harry
"He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.",harry
"Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words.",harry
"The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.",harry
"Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick.",harry
Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.,harry
"That does look good, said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.",harry
"I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years, said the ghost.",harry
"I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it.",harry
My brothers told me about you - you're Nearly Headless Nick!,harry
"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy - the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.",harry
"Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted.",harry
His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.,harry
"Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly.",harry
"Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, So - new Gryffindors!",harry
I hope you're going to help us win the House Championship this year?,harry
The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable - he's the Slytherin ghost.,harry
"Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.",harry
"He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.",harry
"When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before.",harry
"As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.",harry
Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married.,harry
"Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue",harry
But I bounced - all the way down the garden and into the road.,harry
"Rowling really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy.",harry
"And you should have seen their faces when I got in here - they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see.",harry
"On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons",harry
"Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again.",harry
"Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.",harry
"The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes - and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead.",harry
Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look - a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all.,harry
"No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape.",harry
"He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to - everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job.",harry
"Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.",harry
"At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again.",harry
Ahem - just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered.,harry
I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.,harry
First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils.,harry
And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.,harry
Dumbledore 's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.,harry
"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.",harry
Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term.,harry
Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.,harry
"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third- floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.",harry
"Rowling Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.",harry
"It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere - the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that.",harry
"I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.",harry
"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!",harry
Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.,harry
"Everyone pick their favorite tune, said Dumbledore, and off we go!",harry
"Dead flies and bits of fluff, Page | 143 Harry Potter and the Philosophers",harry
"Rowling So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we've forgot,",harry
"Just do your best, we'll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.",harry
"At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.",harry
"Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.",harry
"The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase.",harry
"Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food.",harry
"They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.",harry
"A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.",harry
"A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.",harry
"There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.",harry
"Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head.",harry
"They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.",harry
"You want to watch out for Peeves, said Percy, as they set off again.",harry
"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects.",harry
At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.,harry
"Caput Draconis, said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall.",harry
"They all scrambled through it - Neville needed a leg up - and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.",harry
Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another.,harry
At the top of Page | 145 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K.,harry
"Rowling a spiral staircase - they were obviously in one of the towers - they found their beds at last: five four- posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains.",harry
"Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.",harry
"Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.",harry
"Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream.",harry
"He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny.",harry
"He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.",harry
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day.,harry
"People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.",harry
"Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.",harry
Rowling with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump.,harry
"Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending.",harry
"It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot.",harry
"The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.",harry
It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open.,harry
"Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class.",harry
"Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch.",harry
Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning.,harry
Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor.,harry
"Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later.",harry
Filch knew the secret passageways of Page | 148 Harry Potter and the Philosophers,harry
Rowling the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts.,harry
"The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.",harry
"And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves.",harry
"There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.",harry
They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets.,harry
"Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost.",harry
"Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him.",harry
"Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric",harry
"Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk.",harry
"At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.",harry
Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross.,harry
"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts, she said.",harry
Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.,harry
"They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.",harry
"After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle.",harry
"By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.",harry
"The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke.",harry
"His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days.",harry
"His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story.",harry
Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else.,harry
"Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards.",harry
There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.,harry
They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.,harry
They say he always favors them - we'll be able to see if it's true.,harry
"Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.",harry
She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls.,harry
"This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate.",harry
"Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.",harry
"It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.",harry
"At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him.",harry
"By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong.",harry
"It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.",harry
"Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.",harry
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands.,harry
"His eyes were black like Hagrid 's, but they had none of Hagrid 's warmth.",harry
They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.,harry
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making, he began.",harry
"He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word - like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.",harry
"I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.",harry
"I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.",harry
Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.,harry
What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?,harry
"Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione 's hand had shot into the air.",harry
"Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?",harry
"Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.",harry
"He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.",harry
"Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?",harry
"He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?",harry
"At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.",harry
"I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?",harry
"A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked.",harry
"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death.",harry
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.,harry
"As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.",harry
"Over the noise, Snape said, And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.",harry
Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.,harry
Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils.,harry
"He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like.",harry
He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon.,harry
"Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes.",harry
I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?,harry
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.,harry
"Take him up to the hospital wing, Snape spat at Seamus.",harry
"Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.",harry
You - Potter - why didn't you tell him not to add the quills?,harry
"Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you?",harry
"This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.",harry
"Don't push it, he muttered, I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.",harry
"As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low.",harry
He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week - why did Snape hate him so much?,harry
"Cheer up, said Ron, Snape's always taking points off Fred and George.",harry
At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds.,harry
Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest.,harry
A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.,harry
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks.,harry
"Hagrid 's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.",harry
"He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.",harry
"Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.",harry
"Make yerselves at home, said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears.",harry
"Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.",harry
"This is Ron, Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.",harry
"Another Weasley, eh? said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles.",harry
I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.,harry
"The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons.",harry
Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.,harry
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch that old git.,harry
"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.",harry
"D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere?",harry
Can't get rid of her - Filch puts her up to it.,harry
"Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.",harry
Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.,harry
"While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.",harry
"IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 3 1 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.",harry
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.,harry
"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out",harry
"Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.",harry
"There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time.",harry
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.,harry
"Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package.",harry
And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?,harry
"THE MIDNIGHT DUEL Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy.",harry
"Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much.",harry
"Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.",harry
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday - and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.,harry
To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.,harry
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.,harry
"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself, said Ron reasonably.",harry
"Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk.",harry
"He complained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters.",harry
"He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick.",harry
Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom.,harry
"Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.",harry
Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly.,harry
"Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.",harry
"Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one.",harry
"Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.",harry
This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book - not that she hadn't tried.,harry
"Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.",harry
"Malfoy 's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.",harry
"He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.",harry
Gran knows I forget things - this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do.,harry
"Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.",harry
"They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.",harry
"Just looking, he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.",harry
"At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson.",harry
"The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground.",harry
"Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.",harry
"She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.",harry
It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.,harry
"Stick out your right hand over your broom, called Madam Hooch at the front, and say 'Up!'",harry
"Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did.",harry
"Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all.",harry
"Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.",harry
Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.,harry
"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard, said Madam Hooch.",harry
"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly.",harry
"On my whistle - three - two - But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.",harry
"His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.",harry
"Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.",harry
"Come on, boy - it's all right, up you get.",harry
None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing!,harry
You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.',harry
"Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.",harry
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.,harry
"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom? said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl.",harry
I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find - how about - up a tree?,harry
"Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off.",harry
"Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, Come and get it, Potter!",harry
Madam Hooch told us not to move - you'll get us all into trouble.,harry
"He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.",harry
"Give it here, Harry called, or I'll knock you off that broom!",harry
"He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin.",harry
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- face and held the broom steady.,harry
"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy, Harry called.",harry
"Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall.",harry
"Never - in all my time at Hogwarts - Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, - how dare you - might have broken your neck -",harry
"Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle.",harry
"He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice.",harry
Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up.,harry
What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?,harry
"Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him.",harry
She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her.,harry
"He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper.",harry
"His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.",harry
"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?",harry
"But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick's class looking confused.",harry
"Follow me, you two, said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.",harry
"Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.",harry
"Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing.",harry
Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.,harry
"He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.",harry
"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive, Professor McGonagall told Wood.",harry
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.,harry
"He's just the build for a Seeker, too, said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him.",harry
"Light - speedy - we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor - a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say.",harry
I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule.,harry
"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.",harry
Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.,harry
"Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it.",harry
"But first years never - you must be the youngest House player in about - - a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth.",harry
"Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.",harry
"Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.",harry
"Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.",harry
"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year, said Fred.",harry
"We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant.",harry
"You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.",harry
"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school.",harry
"Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.",harry
You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground,harry
"There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.",harry
"I'd take you on anytime on my own, said Malfoy.",harry
Well meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked.,harry
"When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.",harry
"Well, a second's there to take over if you die, said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie.",harry
"Catching the look on Harry's face, he added quickly, But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards.",harry
The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other.,harry
"Throw it away and punch him on the nose, Ron suggested.",harry
"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying - Bet you could, Ron muttered.",harry
"All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep",harry
"Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as If he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them.",harry
"There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today.",harry
"On the other hand, Malfoy's sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face.",harry
"Half-past eleven, Ron muttered at last, we'd better go.",harry
"They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room.",harry
"A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows.",harry
"They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry.",harry
"It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.",harry
He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.,harry
"She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.",harry
Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting.,harry
The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.,harry
"We've got to go, we're going to be late.",harry
They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.,harry
D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?,harry
"I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.",harry
"He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.",harry
"I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed.",harry
"Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later - Don't leave me!",harry
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.,harry
"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.",harry
"Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.",harry
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows.,harry
"At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky.",harry
They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.,harry
"Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness.",harry
"They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room.",harry
Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once.,harry
"He's late, maybe he's chickened out, Ron whispered.",harry
Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak - and it wasn't Malfoy.,harry
"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.",harry
"Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice.",harry
Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.,harry
"They're in here somewhere, they heard him mutter, probably hiding.",harry
"Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.",harry
"Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run - he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.",harry
"I think we've lost him, Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead.",harry
"Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, I - told - you.",harry
"We've got to get back to Gryffindor Tower, said Ron, quickly as possible.",harry
"Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that.",harry
They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.,harry
"Shut up, Peeves - please - you'll get us thrown out.",harry
"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please.",harry
"Should tell Filch, I should, said Peeves in a sanity voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly.",harry
"Get out of the way, snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves -",harry
"Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door - and it was locked.",harry
"Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, We're done for!",harry
"They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves 's shouts.",harry
"She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered,",harry
"Alohomora\ The lock clicked and the door swung open - they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.",harry
"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?",harry
"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please, said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.",harry
Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please!,harry
And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.,harry
For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute.,harry
"For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -",harry
"They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor.",harry
"Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.",harry
"Harry groped for the doorknob - between Filch and death, he'd take Filch.",harry
"They fell backward - Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor.",harry
They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.,harry
"Never mind that - pig snout, pig snout, panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward.",harry
"They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.",harry
"Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.",harry
"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?",harry
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.,harry
"You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?",harry
"I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.",harry
"Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.",harry
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed.,harry
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide - except perhaps Hogwarts.,harry
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.,harry
"Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one.",harry
"In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.",harry
"But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.",harry
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.,harry
"Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.",harry
"All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.",harry
"As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.",harry
They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.,harry
"Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.",harry
"It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick",harry
Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.,harry
Professor M. McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.,harry
"They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle.",harry
"That's a broomstick, he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.",harry
"You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren't allowed them.",harry
"It's not any old broomstick, he said, it's a Nimbus Two Thousand.",harry
"What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?",harry
"Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the Nimbus.",harry
"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle, Malfoy snapped back.",harry
I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.,harry
"Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.",harry
"Yes, yes, that's right, said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.",harry
"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir, said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy's face.",harry
"Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion.",harry
"Well, it's true, Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouldn't be on the team.",harry
So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?,harry
"Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.",harry
"Yes, don't stop now, said Ron, it's doing us so much good.",harry
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day.,harry
"It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night.",harry
"He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.",harry
"Wow, Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.",harry
"Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful.",harry
"Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.",harry
"As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field.",harry
Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on.,harry
At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end.,harry
"They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.",harry
"Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground.",harry
What a feeling - he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field.,harry
The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.,harry
"I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.",harry
"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play.",harry
"Three Chasers, Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.",harry
The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal.,harry
Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops.,harry
"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score, Harry recited.",harry
"So - that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?",harry
"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper - I'm Keeper for Gryffindor.",harry
I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.,harry
"Three Chasers, one Keeper, said Harry, who was determined to remember it all.",harry
"He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.",harry
"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do, Wood said.",harry
"He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle.",harry
Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.,harry
"At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face.",harry
"Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely.",harry
"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms.",harry
"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team, Harry reeled off.",harry
We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that.,harry
And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers - - unless they crack my head open.,harry
"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers - I mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.",harry
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.,harry
"Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut.",harry
"This, said Wood, is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot.",harry
It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see.,harry
"A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -",harry
"I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.",harry
"He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.",harry
"We won't practice with the Snitch yet, said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, it's too dark, we might lose it.",harry
"Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted.",harry
"After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.",harry
"That Quidditch Cup'll have our name on it this year, said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle.",harry
"I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons.",harry
"His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.",harry
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors.,harry
"Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye).",harry
It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this.,harry
She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.,harry
"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!",harry
"And saying the magic words properly is very important, too - never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.",harry
"Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.",harry
Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it,harry
"Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.",harry
"Wingardium Leviosal he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.",harry
"It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.",harry
"You do it, then, if you're so clever, Ron snarled.",harry
"Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, Wingardium LeviosaV' Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.",harry
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.,harry
"It's no wonder no one can stand her, he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, she's a nightmare, honestly.",harry
Harry caught a glimpse of her face - and was startled to see that she was in tears.,harry
Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon.,harry
"On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.",harry
"Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.",harry
"A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.",harry
"The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.",harry
"Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.",harry
"Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, Troll - in the dungeons -",harry
It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.,harry
"Prefects, he rumbled, lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!",harry
"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid, said Ron.",harry
"As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.",harry
"Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom.",harry
They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.,harry
"Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape.",harry
Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?,harry
"Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape 's fading footsteps.",harry
"He's heading for the third floor, Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.",harry
"Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet",harry
"And then they heard it - a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet.",harry
"Ron pointed - at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them.",harry
They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.,harry
"Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut.",harry
"It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet.",harry
"It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.",harry
"It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.",harry
"They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it.",harry
"With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.",harry
"Oh, no, said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.",harry
"It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?",harry
"Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic.",harry
"Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint.",harry
"The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.",harry
"Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.",harry
"It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise.",harry
"It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.",harry
"The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.",harry
"Come on, run, run\ Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.",harry
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk.,harry
"It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.",harry
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind.,harry
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand - not knowing what he was going to do,harry
"The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over - and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head.",harry
"The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.",harry
"Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.",harry
"I don't think so, said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out.",harry
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose.,harry
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.,harry
"They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars.",harry
"A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear.",harry
"Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.",harry
Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.,harry
"Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air.",harry
"I went looking for the troll because I - I thought I could deal with it on my own - you know, because I've read all about them.",harry
"If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now.",harry
Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club.,harry
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.,harry
"Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble.",harry
"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this, said Professor McGonagall.",harry
"If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor Tower.",harry
"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll.",harry
They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up.,harry
"It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.",harry
"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione 's. Good of her to get us out of trouble like that, Ron admitted.",harry
"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her, Harry reminded him.",harry
"Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them.",harry
"Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said Thanks, and hurried off to get plates.",harry
"There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.",harry
The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel.,harry
"Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.",harry
"On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.",harry
"If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the House Championship.",harry
"Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret.",harry
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend.,harry
"He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last- minute Quidditch practice",harry
"She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.",harry
"Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.",harry
"They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard.",harry
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed.",harry
"He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.",harry
"Library books are not to be taken outside the school, said Snape.",harry
"He's just made that rule up, Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away.",harry
"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him, said Ron bitterly.",harry
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window.",harry
"She would never let them copy ( How will you learn? ), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.",harry
"He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow.",harry
"Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.",harry
"Better you than me, they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.",harry
He pushed the door ajar and peered inside - and a horrible scene met his eyes.,harry
How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?,harry
Snape 's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg.,harry
"Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor.",harry
"In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen.",harry
He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween!,harry
That's where he was going when we saw him - he's after whatever it's guarding!,harry
"And I'd bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!",harry
"I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.",harry
"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something, snapped Ron.",harry
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question.,harry
The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.,harry
In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.,harry
Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.,harry
"Thanks, Seamus, said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.",harry
By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch.,harry
"The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.",harry
"Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row.",harry
"As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined.",harry
"It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath.",harry
Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.,harry
"Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) .",harry
"We know Oliver's speech by heart, Fred told Harry, we were on the team last year.",harry
"He glared at them all as if to say, Or else.",harry
"Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.",harry
"She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.",harry
"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you, she said, once they were all gathered around her.",harry
"Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year.",harry
Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him.,harry
"Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.",harry
"The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.",harry
"And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve - back to Johnson and - no",harry
"Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.",harry
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.,harry
"Bin watchin' from me hut, said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, But it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd.",harry
"Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch.",harry
"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch, Wood had said.",harry
"When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings.",harry
"Slytherin in possession, Lee Jordan was saying, Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the - wait a moment -",harry
"A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.",harry
In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold.,harry
Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch - all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.,harry
"Harry was faster than Higgs - he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead - he put on an extra spurt of speed - WHAM!",harry
"A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below - Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.",harry
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor.,harry
"But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.",harry
"Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, Send him off, ref!",harry
In soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!,harry
So - after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating - Jordan!,harry
"I mean, after that open and revolting foul - Jordan, I'm warning you -",harry
"It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened.",harry
"For a split second, he thought he was going to fall.",harry
It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off.,harry
But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off.,harry
Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts - he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out - and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control.,harry
"It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.",harry
"Spinnet - passes Bell - hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose - only joking,",harry
"No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.",harry
"Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands.",harry
"His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on.",harry
Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it.,harry
"He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.",harry
Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic - no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.,harry
"At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid 's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.",harry
He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.,harry
"His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer.",harry
"The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -",harry
"They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell.",harry
Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.,harry
"Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked",harry
"Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words.",harry
Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape 's robes.,harry
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire.,harry
"Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row - Snape would never know what had happened.",harry
"Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.",harry
Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.,harry
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick - he hit the field on all fours - coughed - and something,harry
"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it, Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -",harry
Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results - Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty.,harry
"He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.",harry
"It was Snape, Ron was explaining, Hermione and I saw him.",harry
"He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.",harry
"Rubbish, said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands.",harry
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him.",harry
He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween.,harry
"Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort.",harry
The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.,harry
"I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them!",harry
"You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all",harry
"I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student!",harry
"Now, listen to me, all three of yeh - yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh.",harry
"You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore",harry
"One morning in mid- December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow.",harry
"The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban.",harry
The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.,harry
"While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.",harry
"Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.",harry
"I do feel so sorry, said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home.",harry
"Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them.",harry
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match.,harry
"Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next.",harry
"Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick.",harry
"So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.",harry
It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.,harry
"Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once.",harry
He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had.,harry
"Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.",harry
"When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.",harry
Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.,harry
"Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose - that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to.",harry
"He was provoked, Professor Snape, said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree.",harry
"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid, said Snape silkily.",harry
"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.",harry
"I'll get him, said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, one of these days, I'll get him -",harry
"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas, said Hagrid.",harry
"Tell yeh what, come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat.",harry
"So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.",harry
"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree - put it in the far corner, would you?",harry
"Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.",harry
"And that reminds me - Harry, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.",harry
Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is.,harry
"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all, said Hermione.",harry
Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?,harry
We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere - just give us a hint -,harry
"Just have to find out for ourselves, then, said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.",harry
"They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal?",harry
"The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book.",harry
"And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.",harry
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random.,harry
He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there.,harry
"Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one.",harry
"These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.",harry
"Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library.",harry
"He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel.",harry
"They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to.",harry
"Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful.",harry
"They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments between lessons",harry
What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.,harry
"Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.",harry
"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?",harry
"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is, said Ron.",harry
"Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.",harry
"They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire.",harry
"This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle.",harry
"Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family - in this case, his grandfather.",harry
"Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all.",harry
"He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing.",harry
"Don't send me there, can't you see his knight?",harry
"On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.",harry
"When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.",harry
"Merry Christmas, said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.",harry
"It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid.",harry
"You can keep it, said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.",harry
"I think I know who that one's from, said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.",harry
"I told her you didn't expect any presents and - oh, no,",harry
"Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand- knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.",harry
"Every year she makes us a sweater, said Ron, unwrapping his own, and mine's always maroon.",harry
"That's really nice of her, said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.",harry
His next present also contained candy - a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.,harry
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds.,harry
"I've heard of those, he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione.",harry
"If that's what I think it is - they're really rare, and really valuable.",harry
"It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.",harry
"It's an Invisibility Cloak, said Ron, a look of awe on his face.",harry
Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.,harry
"Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible.",harry
He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.,harry
"Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died.",harry
"Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in.",harry
"Hey, look - Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!",harry
"Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. Harry's is better than ours, though, said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater.",harry
She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.,harry
"Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm.",harry
"I hate maroon, Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.",harry
"He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.",harry
"Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one.",harry
"I - don't - want - said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.",harry
"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either, said George.",harry
"They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.",harry
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner.,harry
"These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.",harry
"Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.",harry
Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice.,harry
The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.,harry
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds.,harry
"Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron.",harry
He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.,harry
Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day.,harry
Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it:,harry
"Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster.",harry
Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.,harry
"He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air.",harry
"Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.",harry
Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence.,harry
"He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.",harry
Something held him back - his father's cloak - he felt that this time - the first time - he wanted to use it alone.,harry
"He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.",harry
"He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.",harry
"He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked.",harry
Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books.,harry
"The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.",harry
"Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.",harry
One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood.,harry
"Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.",harry
"Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book.",harry
"He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.",harry
"A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence - the book was screaming!",harry
"Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note.",harry
"He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once.",harry
"Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside - stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it.",harry
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor.,harry
"He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going.",harry
"Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all.",harry
"There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.",harry
"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library - Restricted Section.",harry
"Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, The Restricted Section?",harry
"Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them.",harry
Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.,harry
"They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him - the cloak didn't stop him from being solid.",harry
"He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything.",harry
"They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away.",harry
It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.,harry
"It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.",harry
There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.,harry
"His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again.",harry
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming.,harry
"His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed - for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.",harry
"There he was, reflected in it, white and scared- looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others.",harry
"Harry looked over his shoulder - but still, no one was there.",harry
"Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?",harry
A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving.,harry
"If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air - she and the others existed only in the mirror.",harry
"The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her.",harry
"It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.",harry
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.,harry
"The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them.",harry
"He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.",harry
The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.,harry
"He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed.",harry
"He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, I'll come back, and hurried from the room.",harry
"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.",harry
"I'd like to see your mom and dad, Ron said eagerly.",harry
"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.",harry
"Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?",harry
He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight.,harry
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again.,harry
"With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night.",harry
"They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.",harry
"They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else.",harry
"Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.",harry
Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.,harry
"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.",harry
"Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.",harry
I am - I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to - and I'm holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup,harry
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.,harry
"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.",harry
Don't push me - A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.,harry
Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door.,harry
"Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -",harry
"This isn't safe - she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.",harry
"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror.",harry
"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -",harry
"But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.",harry
"And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily.",harry
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror.,harry
There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family.,harry
Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore.,harry
"Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.",harry
"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you, said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.",harry
"So, said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.",harry
"I don't need a cloak to become invisible, said Dumbledore gently.",harry
"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?",harry
"The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is.",harry
"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.",harry
"You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you.",harry
"Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them.",harry
"Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.",harry
"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again.",harry
"If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared.",harry
"It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.",harry
"Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?",harry
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful.,harry
"But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.",harry
"NICHOLAS FLAMBL Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk.",harry
"Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't.",harry
"Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.",harry
"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad, said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.",harry
"Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.",harry
"She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row",harry
"They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere.",harry
"Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks.",harry
"Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.",harry
Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits.,harry
"The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side.",harry
"If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship for the first time in seven years.",harry
"Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.",harry
"Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news.",harry
"He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.",harry
That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match!,harry
"Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!",harry
He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.,harry
"The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.",harry
"We've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us.",harry
"Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.",harry
"Don't talk to me for a moment, said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, I need to concern He caught sight of Harry's face.",harry
"Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape 's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.",harry
"How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse.",harry
He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.,harry
"Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse.",harry
"Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.",harry
"Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.",harry
He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on.,harry
"He's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.",harry
"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy's already done that, Neville choked out.",harry
"Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas.",harry
"He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.",harry
Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.,harry
"D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?",harry
"As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.",harry
She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.,harry
"Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.",harry
I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.,harry
"Nicolas Flamel, she whispered dramatically, is the only known maker of",harry
"She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.",harry
"It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.",harry
"There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover.",harry
"Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).",harry
"I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends",harry
"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry, said Ron.",harry
"He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?",harry
It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.,harry
"If I don't, all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape.",harry
"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field, said Hermione.",harry
"As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione.",harry
"The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?",harry
"Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went.",harry
"At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own.",harry
"Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry.",harry
Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the Sorcerer's Stone?,harry
Harry didn't see how he could - yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.,harry
"Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again.",harry
Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.,harry
Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.,harry
"They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.",harry
"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis, Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.",harry
"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it's now.",harry
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.,harry
"Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.",harry
Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time?,harry
Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him.,harry
"Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.",harry
You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?,harry
"See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money - you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains.",harry
Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.,harry
"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, You tell him, Neville.",harry
"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something.",harry
Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.,harry
"Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd.",harry
"Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.",harry
"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!",harry
"Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground.",harry
"Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.",harry
"The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.",harry
"As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped - then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.",harry
"Well done, said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.",harry
Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror . .,harry
"Jc Jc Jc Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed.",harry
He'd really done something to be proud of now - no one could say he was just a famous name any more.,harry
"He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.",harry
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.,harry
"Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest.",harry
"Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner - what was going on?",harry
Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run.,harry
The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone.,harry
"He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices.",harry
He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.,harry
"He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.",harry
"Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone.",harry
"Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever.",harry
"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private, said Snape, his voice icy.",harry
"Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after all.",harry
Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?,harry
"B-b-but Severus, I - You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell, said Snape, taking a step toward him.",harry
"An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree.",harry
"He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, - your little bit of hocus-pocus.",harry
"Well have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.",harry
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing.,harry
"It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.",harry
"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-",harry
He's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he'll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin!,harry
"Everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.",harry
"He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard.",harry
"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it.",harry
He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus-pocus' -,harry
"I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through -",harry
So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?,harry
"THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought.",harry
"In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet.",harry
"Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.",harry
"Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe.",harry
"Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.",harry
"Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone.",harry
She had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all her notes.,harry
"Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.",harry
"That's not ages, that's like a second to Nicolas Flamel.",harry
"But we're not six hundred years old, Ron reminded her.",harry
"Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it all.",harry
You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year?,harry
"They're very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten into me.",harry
"Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione.",harry
They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones.,harry
It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements.,harry
"Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.",harry
It was the first really fine day they'd had in months.,harry
"The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.",harry
"Harry, who was looking up Dittany in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, Hagrid!",harry
"Jus' lookin', he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once.",harry
"Oh, we found out who he is ages ago, said Ron impressively.",harry
"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact, said Harry, about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy - SHHHH!",harry
"I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know.",harry
"They'll think I've told yeh - See you later, then, said Harry.",harry
"I'm going to see what section he was in, said Ron, who'd had enough of working.",harry
He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.,harry
"Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide.",harry
"Hagrid 's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, said Harry.",harry
"Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that.",harry
"It's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous.",harry
You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania.,harry
"The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you.",harry
"Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget.",harry
"When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed.",harry
"Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate.",harry
"Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.",harry
We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone apart from Fluffy.,harry
"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here, said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.",harry
"We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.",harry
"Professor Sprout - Professor Flitwick - Professor McGonagall - he ticked them off on his fingers, Professor Quirrell - an' Dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course.",harry
"Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it.",harry
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was.,harry
"If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it.",harry
"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren't you, Hagrid?",harry
"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore, said Hagrid proudly.",harry
"In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.",harry
"Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.",harry
But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?,harry
"Well, I've bin doin' some readin', said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow.",harry
"Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on 'em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour.",harry
So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.,harry
"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life, Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting.",harry
"Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too.",harry
"Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.",harry
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut.,harry
"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?",harry
"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what Hagrid 's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing - Shut up!",harry
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen.,harry
Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.,harry
"Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break.",harry
"When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest.",harry
Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.,harry
They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.,harry
All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open.,harry
"It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella.",harry
"Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.",harry
"Hagrid, said Hermione, how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?",harry
Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face - he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.,harry
Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains - it's a kid -,harry
"Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous.",harry
"They spent most of their free time in Hagrid 's darkened hut, trying to reason with him.",harry
Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy.,harry
There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.,harry
"I've decided to call him Norbert, said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes.",harry
"He's lost his marbles, Ron muttered in Harry's ear.",harry
"Hagrid, said Harry loudly, give it two weeks and Norbert's going to be as long as your house.",harry
Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!,harry
"And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him.",harry
"Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.",harry
The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open.,harry
Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's Invisibility Cloak.,harry
"He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.",harry
I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week.,harry
"I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit.",harry
The three of them put their heads together to read the note.,harry
"Thanks for the letter - I'd be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here.",harry
I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week.,harry
"Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon.",harry
Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday?,harry
They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark.,harry
It shouldn't be too difficult - I think the cloak's big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.,harry
It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him.,harry
"By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size.",harry
He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey - would she recognize a dragon bite?,harry
Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.,harry
"It's not just my hand, he whispered, although that feels like it's about to fall off.",harry
Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me.,harry
"He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me - I've told her it was a dog, but I don't think she believes me - I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match",harry
"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday, said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all.",harry
"On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.",harry
"Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert.",harry
"Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.",harry
"It's too late to change the plan now, Harry told Hermione.",harry
"We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert.",harry
"And we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that.",harry
"They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.",harry
Norbert's at a tricky stage - nothin' I can't handle.,harry
"When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.",harry
"The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle.",harry
Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.,harry
They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do.,harry
An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.,harry
From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.,harry
"Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.",harry
"How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew.",harry
Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.,harry
"Up another staircase, then another - even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier.",harry
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.,harry
"Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away.",harry
"Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.",harry
"Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you -",harry
"Come on - I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!",harry
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that.,harry
"Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again.",harry
"Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate.",harry
"About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.",harry
"They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.",harry
"They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them.",harry
No more dragon - Malfoy in detention - what could spoil their happiness?,harry
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs.,harry
"As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.",harry
"Well, well, well, he whispered, we are in trouble.",harry
"Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other.",harry
"Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last.",harry
He couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time.,harry
How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak?,harry
"Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.",harry
She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.,harry
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question.,harry
"She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.",harry
"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on, said Professor McGonagall.",harry
"You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and- bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble.",harry
"I suppose you think it's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?",harry
"Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt.",harry
"Poor, blundering Neville - Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.",harry
"As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this.",harry
"Harry gasped - they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in the last Quidditch match.",harry
"Fifty points each, said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.",harry
"Professor - please - You can't- Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter.",harry
"In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the House Cup.",harry
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.,harry
He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours.,harry
What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done?,harry
"At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the House points",harry
How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday?,harry
"From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated.",harry
"Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup.",harry
"Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him.",harry
"Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, Thanks Potter, we owe you one!",harry
"Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like them.",harry
"They've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?",harry
"It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on.",harry
He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.,harry
How are we going to get any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?,harry
"The rest of the team wouldn't speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him the Seeker.",harry
"They didn't have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either.",harry
"Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.",harry
All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery.,harry
"Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test.",harry
"Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead.",harry
"No - no - not again, please - It sounded as though someone was threatening him.",harry
"Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban.",harry
He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry.,harry
He strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him.,harry
"He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom.",harry
"It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.",harry
Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling.,harry
"Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy.",harry
If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell -,harry
"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid, said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them.",harry
I bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog.,harry
"The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.",harry
If we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure.,harry
Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -,harry
"It's not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore 'll think we made it up to get him sacked.",harry
"Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think.",harry
"And don't forget, we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy.",harry
"If we just do a bit of poking around - No, said Harry flatly, we've done enough poking around.",harry
He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.,harry
"The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table.",harry
They were all the same: Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight.,harry
Professor M. McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost.,harry
"He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word.",harry
"At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville.",harry
"Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.",harry
"Follow me, said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.",harry
"I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again,",harry
It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out . .,harry
"Right, off we go, and don't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do.",harry
"It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.",harry
"The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness.",harry
"Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut.",harry
Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn't be so bad.,harry
"His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf?",harry
"Well, think again, boy - it's into the forest you're going",harry
"At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.",harry
"We can't go in there at night - there's all sorts of things in there - werewolves, I heard.",harry
Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise.,harry
"Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?",harry
"Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel.",harry
"He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.",harry
"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid, said Filch coldly, they're here to be punished, after all.",harry
"I'll be back at dawn, said Filch, for what's left of them, he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.",harry
"I'm not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.",harry
"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts, said Hagrid fiercely.",harry
Yeh've done wrong an' now yeh've got ter pay fer it.,harry
"But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do.",harry
"If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack.",harry
"Right then, said Hagrid, now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight,",harry
"Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees.",harry
A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.,harry
"Look there, said Hagrid, see that stuff shinin' on the ground?",harry
"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang, said Hagrid.",harry
"Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions.",harry
"There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least.",harry
"I want Fang, said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang's long teeth.",harry
"Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right?",harry
"A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.",harry
Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.,harry
"It's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures.",harry
Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by.,harry
There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.,harry
"Don' worry, it can't've gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then well be able ter - GET BEHIND THAT TREE!",harry
Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak.,harry
"He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire.",harry
Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground.,harry
"Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.",harry
"To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail.",harry
"Oh, it's you, Ronan, said Hagrid in relief.",harry
"Can't be too careful, Ronan, said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.",harry
"Listen, I'm glad we've run inter yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt - you seen anythin'?",harry
"So it has been for ages past, so it is now.",harry
"Yeah, said Hagrid, but have yeh seen anythin', Ronan?",harry
"Mars is bright tonight, Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently.",harry
"A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.",harry
There's a unicorn bin injured - would yeh know anythin' about it?,harry
"Well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh?",harry
"Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.",harry
"Never, said Hagrid irritably, try an' get a straight answer out of a centaur.",harry
"Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're good enough about turnin' up",harry
"Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's bin killin' the unicorns - never heard anythin' like it before.",harry
He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.,harry
They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid 's arm.,harry
"They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.",harry
"Harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.",harry
"Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke.",harry
"Well be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'.",harry
So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang.,harry
"They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick.",harry
"There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.",harry
"Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.",harry
"Look - he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.",harry
"Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.",harry
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood.,harry
"Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast.",harry
"The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animals side, and began to drink its blood.",harry
Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted - so did Fang.,harry
The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry - unicorn blood was dribbling down its front.,harry
It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry - he couldn't move for fear.,harry
Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire.,harry
"He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.",harry
The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees.,harry
"A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.",harry
"He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.",harry
The forest is not safe at this time - especially for you.,harry
"My name is Firenze, he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.",harry
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing.,harry
"Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.",harry
"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens.",harry
Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?,harry
"I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, he said in his gloomy voice.",harry
It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!,harry
"Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.",harry
"I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.",harry
"And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.",harry
"Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question.",harry
They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore.,harry
"They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.",harry
"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?",harry
"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn, said Firenze.",harry
"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime.",harry
"The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price.",harry
"You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.",harry
"Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.",harry
"If you're going to be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?",harry
"Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?",harry
"But I don't understand who - Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?",harry
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart.,harry
"Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: Some say he died.",harry
"Do you mean, Harry croaked, that was VoZ - Harry!",harry
"Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.",harry
"I'm fine, said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying.",harry
"The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there.",harry
"This is where I leave you, Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn.",harry
"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs.",harry
"He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.",harry
"Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.",harry
He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake.,harry
"In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide- eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.",harry
So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,harry
"Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.",harry
"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of.",harry
"With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you.",harry
"It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic.",harry
"When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them.",harry
"In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment.",harry
"Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.",harry
"It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers.",harry
"They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell.",harry
Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk.,harry
"Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox - points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers.",harry
"Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.",harry
"Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest.",harry
One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented self-stirring cauldrons,harry
"When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest.",harry
"That was far easier than I thought it would be, said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds.",harry
I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.,harry
"Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.",harry
"The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.",harry
"No more studying, Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass.",harry
"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet.",harry
"My scar keeps hurting - it's happened before, but never as often as this.",harry
"Harry, relax, Hermione 's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around.",harry
"Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy.",harry
"He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry.",harry
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.,harry
"Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important.",harry
"When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, That's just the exams.",harry
I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one.,harry
"Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though.",harry
"He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth.",harry
Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy . . .,harry
How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law?,harry
"Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.",harry
"Yes, please, said Ron, but Harry cut him off.",harry
"Dunno said Hagrid casually, he wouldn' take his cloak off.",harry
He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.,harry
"Mighta come up, said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.",harry
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.",harry
"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak - it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk.",harry
"They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction.",harry
"They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.",harry
"Well just have to - Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.",harry
"We want to see Professor Dumbledore, said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.",harry
"Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do.",harry
"It's sort of secret, he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared.",harry
He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.,harry
"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time -",harry
"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?",harry
"Look, said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, Professor - it's about the Sorcerer's Stone - Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that.",harry
"The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up.",harry
"Professor, I think - I know - that Sn - that someone's going to try and steal the Stone.",harry
"I don't know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected.",harry
"But Professor - Potter, I know what I'm talking about, she said shortly.",harry
"It's tonight, said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot.",harry
"He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way.",harry
"He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.",harry
"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this, he said, with an odd, twisted smile.",harry
"We were - Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.",harry
"Hanging around like this, people will think you're up to something.",harry
"And Gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?",harry
"Be warned, Potter - any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled.",harry
"Right, here's what we've got to do, he whispered urgently.",harry
One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape - wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it.,harry
"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.",harry
"He put on a high voice, 'Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried,",harry
I think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . ',harry
"Oh, shut up, said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.",harry
"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor, Harry told Ron.",harry
"No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.",harry
I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!,harry
"If I hear you've come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor!",harry
"Harry had just said, At least Hermione's on Snape's tail, when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.",harry
"Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I've only just got away",harry
"If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back!",harry
Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over?,harry
"He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts!",harry
D'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup?,harry
I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me!,harry
"You're right, Harry, said Hermione in a small voice.",harry
"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?",harry
How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us?,harry
"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.",harry
Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam.,harry
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.,harry
"Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all.",harry
This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it.,harry
"Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break.",harry
Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.,harry
"Better get the cloak, Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning.",harry
He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas.,harry
He pocketed it to use on Fluffy - he didn't feel much like singing.,harry
"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us - if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own - What are you doing?",harry
"Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.",harry
"Nothing, Neville, nothing, said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.",harry
"They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.",harry
"You can't go out, said Neville, you'll be caught again.",harry
"I won't let you do it, he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole.",harry
"Neville, Ron exploded, get away from that hole and don't be an idiot -",harry
And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!,harry
"He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.",harry
"Neville, she said, I'm really, really sorry about this.",harry
"His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.",harry
"We had to, Neville, no time to explain, said Harry.",harry
"You'll understand later, Neville, said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.",harry
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen.,harry
"In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them.",harry
"At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.",harry
"As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.",harry
They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor.,harry
"Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.",harry
"Know you're there, even if I can't see you.",harry
"He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.",harry
"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen.",harry
"Peeves, he said, in a hoarse whisper, the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.",harry
He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.,harry
"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir, he said greasily.",harry
"My mistake, my mistake - I didn't see you - of course I didn't, you're invisible - forgive",harry
"I will, sir, I most certainly will, said Peeves, rising up in the air again.",harry
"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you.",harry
"A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor - and the door was already ajar.",harry
"Well, there you are, Harry said quietly, Snape's already got past Fluffy.",harry
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them.,harry
"If you want to go back, I won't blame you, he said.",harry
"You can take the cloak, I won't need it now.",harry
"As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears.",harry
"All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them.",harry
"It must wake up the moment you stop playing, said Harry.",harry
"It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop.",harry
"Slowly, the dog's growls ceased - it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.",harry
"Keep playing, Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor.",harry
"They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads.",harry
"I think we'll be able to pull the door open, said Ron, peering over the dog's back.",harry
Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs.,harry
"He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.",harry
"Nothing - just black - there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop.",harry
"Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.",harry
"In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.",harry
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips.,harry
"Then he looked up at Ron and said, If anything happens to me, don't follow.",harry
"Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?",harry
"Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and - FLUMP.",harry
"With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft.",harry
"He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom.",harry
It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.,harry
"There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped.",harry
"She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles.",harry
"As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.",harry
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her.,harry
"Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.",harry
"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help",harry
"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!",harry
"Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.",harry
"In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.",harry
"Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.",harry
"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione, said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.",harry
"Yeah, said Ron, and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis -",harry
"This way, said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.",harry
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls.,harry
"With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank.",harry
A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.,harry
"They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them.",harry
"It was full of small, jewel- bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room.",harry
On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.,harry
Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?,harry
"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . .",harry
"He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room.",harry
"He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened.",harry
"They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm.",harry
"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one - probably silver, like the handle.",harry
"They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys.",harry
"They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.",harry
"Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century.",harry
"After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.",harry
"That big one - there - no, there - with bright blue wings - the feathers are all crumpled on one side.",harry
"Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.",harry
"Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing.",harry
"Ron, you come at it from above - Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down -",harry
"They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand.",harry
"The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.",harry
"Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle.",harry
The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all.,harry
"But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.",harry
"They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone.",harry
"Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces.",harry
"Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly - the towering white chessmen had no faces.",harry
"I think, said Ron, we're going to have to be chessmen.",harry
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse.,harry
The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.,harry
Do we - er - have to join you to get across?,harry
I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces.,harry
"Finally he said, Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess -",harry
"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.",harry
"White always plays first in chess, said Ron, peering across the board.",harry
"The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.",harry
"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.",harry
"Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.",harry
Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.,harry
"Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger.",harry
"He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.",harry
"Ron - Look, if you don't hurry up, hell already have the Stone!",harry
"She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side.",harry
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet.,harry
"With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.",harry
"He'll be all right, said Harry, trying to convince himself.",harry
"A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses.",harry
"Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.",harry
"They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway.",harry
"At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.",harry
"Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, whichever you would find,",harry
"One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.",harry
"Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:",harry
"Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and",harry
"A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever.",harry
"Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.",harry
"Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them.",harry
The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire - toward the Stone.,harry
"There's only enough there for one of us, he said.",harry
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.,harry
"Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy - go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him.",harry
"I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really.",harry
"Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.",harry
"I'm not as good as you, said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.",harry
"She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.",harry
"Here I come, he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.",harry
"Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.",harry
"Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-",harry
Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match.,harry
"I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.",harry
He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again.,harry
"All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular . . .",harry
Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.,harry
"Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.",harry
I have a special gift with trolls - you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there?,harry
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.,harry
"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone, Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame.",harry
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.,harry
I saw you and Snape in the forest - he blurted out.,harry
"Yes, said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.",harry
"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got.",harry
Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.,harry
"Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give.",harry
He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.,harry
"Oh, he does, said Quirrell casually, heavens, yes.",harry
"He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know?",harry
"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing - I thought Snape was threatening you.",harry
"For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.",harry
"Sometimes, he said, I find it hard to follow my master's instructions - he is a great wizard",harry
"A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil.",harry
"Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times.",harry
"When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased.",harry
Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley - how could he have been so stupid?,harry
"He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.",harry
"What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does.",harry
"So if I look in the mirror, I should see my self finding it - which means I'll see where it's hidden!",harry
But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to?,harry
"He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over.",harry
"And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.",harry
"He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off.",harry
"I must look and lie about what I see, that's all.",harry
Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban.,harry
"He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.",harry
"He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first.",harry
It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood- red stone.,harry
"It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket - and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket.",harry
"As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer's Stone against his leg.",harry
"But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn't moving his lips.",harry
Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot.,harry
"Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban.",harry
"Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound.",harry
"Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen.",harry
"It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.",harry
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move.,harry
I have form only when I can share another's body . . .,harry
"Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him.",harry
"I killed your father first, and he put up a courageous fight . . .",harry
"Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.",harry
"Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed SEIZE HIM!",harry
"The pain in his head lessened - he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers - they were blistering before his eyes.",harry
"Master, I cannot hold him - my hands - my hands!",harry
"Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face - AAAARGH!",harry
"Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could.",harry
"He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.",harry
"Sir, I - Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.",harry
"He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.",harry
"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.",harry
I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat.,harry
"Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.",harry
"Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.",harry
"But sir, the Stone - I see you are not to be distracted.",harry
"I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.",harry
No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left.,harry
"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer - Not the Stone, boy, you - the effort involved nearly killed you.",harry
"But your friend - Nicolas Flamel - Oh, you know about Nicolas? said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.",harry
"Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best.",harry
"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?",harry
"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.",harry
"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day.",harry
"You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing.",harry
"The two things most human beings would choose above all - the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.",harry
"Sir - even if the Stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who - Call him Voldemort, Harry.",harry
"Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he?",harry
He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.,harry
"Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt.",harry
"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.",harry
"However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you 11 forgive me.",harry
Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me.,harry
But why would he want to kill me in the first place?,harry
"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you.",harry
"If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love.",harry
He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark.,harry
"Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason.",harry
It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.,harry
"Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet.",harry
"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.",harry
"Yes, him - Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father.",harry
"Funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it?",harry
I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even.,harry
"Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.",harry
"It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something.",harry
He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth.,harry
"Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.",harry
"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different.",harry
"Harryl Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.",harry
"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to - Dumbledore was so worried -",harry
It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors.,harry
"Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.",harry
"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that - what was it? - 'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.'",harry
"I always said he was off his rocker, said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.",harry
I mean to say - that's terrible - you could have been killed.,harry
"I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know.",harry
"I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help.",harry
I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked.,harry
"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right, said Ron proudly.",harry
"Listen, you've got to be up for the end- of-year feast tomorrow.",harry
"The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course - you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you - but the food'll be good.",harry
"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT, she said firmly.",harry
"After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.",harry
"I want to go to the feast, he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes.",harry
"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go, she said sniffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize how risky feasts could be.",harry
"As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed.",harry
"He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.",harry
"It was the only thing he didn't know, an' I told him!",harry
I should be chucked out an' made ter live as a Muggle!,harry
"Hagrid, he'd have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him.",harry
"Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying.",harry
I've met him and I'm calling him by his name.,harry
"Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it.",harry
"Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, That reminds me.",harry
Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.,harry
Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night.,harry
"He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full.",harry
It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin 's winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row.,harry
A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.,harry
"When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once.",harry
He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.,harry
And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast.,harry
Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were . . .,harry
A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.,harry
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.,harry
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears.,harry
Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves - they were a hundred points up.,harry
Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points - exactly the same as Slytherin.,harry
They had tied for the House Cup - if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.,harry
"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.",harry
"Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table.",harry
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him.",harry
He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.,harry
"Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.",harry
"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, we need a little change of decoration.",harry
"In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place.",harry
"Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile.",harry
He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape 's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot.,harry
"It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.",harry
"Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did.",harry
"To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.",harry
"Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one.",harry
"They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too.",harry
"It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.",harry
It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform.,harry
"A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes",harry
"You must come and stay this summer, said Ron, both of you - I'll send you an owl.",harry
"Thanks, said Harry, I'll need something to look forward to.",harry
People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.,harry
"Not where I'm going, I promise you, said Harry.",harry
"It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron.",harry
"I can see Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point.",harry
"It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people.",harry
"Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.",harry
"Hope you have - er - a good holiday, said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.",harry
"Oh, I will, said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face.",harry
They don't know we're not allowed to use magic at home.,harry
"His bald pate, colored like a palm tree in the middle of an oasis of hair, shakes dandruff sequins from the desert mirage onto the floor.",medium
"His hollow eyes, the size of a vulture's balls, penetrate me.",medium
"Franz, I say, what are you doing at an hour like this?",medium
"Franz winks and smiles wide, revealing what remains of his two teeth.",medium
They are the color of ointment extracted from a baby's behind three days after its deposit.,medium
"I've been talking all my life, he says, but no one listened.",medium
"There he sits, in a Halloween costume: a white sheet with boogie monster eye-slits beneath his forehead, trapped inside a boy's body, frozen at the age of twenty-two.",medium
"If you'd let me marry you, he continues with my rhyme, I wouldn't be so blue.",medium
"We've made great strides since your time in the realm of poetry, and you don't stand a chance of catching up with us.",medium
"He seems to think it strange that I speak with him on such familiar terms, my being a woman and all, but I explain to him the sexual revolution and finally comprehension's light bulb flickers.",medium
Now it resembles a blob of chewing gum that expands as you add one more blob to the mixture.,medium
"We keep chewing, chewing, chewing, until some nasty fink comes along and rips it out of our mouth.",medium
"I lean against him to make him smell the beer on my tongue, the froth still fresh on my lips.",medium
"Franz keeps me up, in the middle of night, refusing me sleep.",medium
"I tell him that I deserve sleep, having worked all my life.",medium
"His steady voice grates heavy on my ear, an ax that hurts so much that finally I ask him what's the point.",medium
This is the first time that I have interrupted him in the middle of a speech.,medium
The books we need are the kind that act upon us like a misfortune.,medium
They make us suffer like the death of someone we love more than ourselves.,medium
They make us feel as though we were on the verge of suicide -,medium
"Franz, I interrupt again, worried, why do you say that?",medium
A book should serve as an ax for the frozen sea within us.,medium
"Franz's voice is a lonely trumpet in the middle of the sea, but his loneliness is a matter of indifference to him, as well as, perhaps, to me.",medium

Almost every person I've met has thought about changing some aspect of their life.,medium
"Some people merely wish for better days without doing anything about it, but a significant proportion of people will take some sort of action because they want to improve their lives.",medium
Undoubtedly the most popular form of self-improvement is setting goals.,medium
"Living by goals has a yo-yo effect, bouncing between accomplishing goals and the time in between these accomplishments.",medium
Goal-setting is inefficient if the time between goals is spent reverting back to old habits instead of developing long-term solutions.,medium
"Once a goal is reached, it is easy to revert back to old habits.",medium
"This is because in order to accomplish a goal, many people will take steps that don't align with their normal behavior.",medium
"For example, a recent goal of mine was to lose weight until I hit a certain number on the scale.",medium
"After about two months of consistent effort, I was able to reach my goal.",medium
"However, after hitting that goal, it became increasingly difficult to maintain progress.",medium
"I lost the healthy habits I had previously attained - I stopped working out every day, allowed myself to snack more, and slept later.",medium
This is a classic example of the yo-yo effect in action.,medium
"While I was able to reach my goal, maintaining it was much more difficult because I had not grown to love the process.",medium
It was difficult for me to continue making progress after accomplishing the goal because I no longer had my source of motivation.,medium
"When actions are dependent on accomplishing a goal, results become everything.",medium
Prioritizing the goal over the system makes it more difficult to continue on a healthy trajectory after accomplishing the goal.,medium
"While setting goals as a form of motivation is a great way to get a sense of direction for where you want to be in the future, they should not be the main focus of your energy.",medium
Two opposing teams in a sports game both have the same goal - to win.,medium
Thus the goal does not make the difference between winners and losers.,medium
"In the same way that it's not enough just to set a goal, it's not enough to just want to win.",medium
"While the desire to win is an important aspect of success in a game, it is insufficient without skill, practice, teamwork, and a little bit of luck.",medium
"Similarly, focusing on the goal is an important step in the process, but it's not sufficient without consistency and practice.",medium
"Instead of trying to accomplish a goal, seek to optimize the habits that you live by.",medium
These little changes to how you live your everyday life will deliver results on a much grander scheme than focusing on accomplishing goals.,medium
"They make extreme temporary changes to their lifestyle - working later, practicing longer, eating healthier - to accomplish a notable feat, just to revert back to old habits after their goal has been reached.",medium
"By setting goals and accomplishing them, we use the gratification of these small wins as motivation to accomplish the next goal.",medium
"While gratification from accomplishments can and should be used to propel you forward and help you gain traction, it is often overhyped as a means to achieve long-term change.",medium
"When steps taken to reach a goal require a great deal of willpower and sacrifice, it will likely not result in long-term change.",medium
"To change your behavior, you first have to define an image of the type of person you want to be.",medium
Expecting yourself to stick to behaviors that are unnatural or difficult is unreasonable.,medium
"But this doesn't mean that change is hopeless - rather, we must change our conception of ourselves so that good behaviors come more easily.",medium
Notice that this subtle difference in language demonstrates two completely different responses.,medium
"By saying I'm trying to quit, Person 1 is insinuating that they are still a smoker.",medium
"In other words, they are still living the identity as a smoker.",medium
"Unhealthy behaviors will start to feel incongruent with this new version of yourself, and many old habits will fall away with time.",medium
The region described in this article is the traditional territory of the Northeastern Yavapai and Northern Tonto Apache.,medium
The dwellings at Walnut Canyon were created by people that archaeologists call the Sinagua.,medium
"I think of people who, under a younger sun, planned for the day ahead or smiled at a memory.",medium
"Long before it was a national monument, or a state park, or a plaque at the side of the highway, someone - many someones - stood there when that place was simply home.",medium
"I've gone through this mental exercise in many places, but none of them connected with me quite as strongly as this one.",medium
"Ten miles east of Flagstaff on I-40, Walnut Canyon - Wupatupqa, in Hopi - slices 400 feet into Permian Kaibab Limestone.",medium
"This reveals the dark vein of the Toroweap Formation and, below it, moon-white Coconino Sandstone.",medium
"It was carved by Walnut Creek, which advances to meet the Little Colorado River on its journey toward the Grand Canyon.",medium
"On north-facing slopes that are cloaked in shade most of the day, there are the Douglas firs and ponderosa pines that dominate the Mogollon Rim.",medium
"On south-facing slopes, drier and more exposed, juniper and piñon mingle with prickly pear and yucca.",medium
"So named for the island of rock around which it circles, Walnut Canyon's Island Trail starts with a long climb down 240 concrete steps.",medium
"The path is a mile long and loops fully around this outcropping of land, bounded on three sides by the negative space of the canyon.",medium
The deep stillness here is punctuated by the continuous climb and fall of hawks.,medium
"They're hunting jays, tracing weightless arcs through the air with their pursuit.",medium
"The trees and stone seem to emit an incongruous chill that, at least when I was there in April, helps to offset the desert sun.",medium
"The first time I reach a pueblo, it's almost jarring.",medium
The miles of woodland between here and the nearest city lend the feeling that this is a nature preserve.,medium
"But beyond its natural beauty, this national monument is, in fact, an archaeological site.",medium
"But it is a site of archaeological significance, evincing as it does the lifeways of past humans.",medium
"What strikes me most are the smoke stains on the rock, 800-year-old relics of heat and light.",medium
"I try to picture the faces that were lit by those fires, how the orange flicker would have thrown shifting patterns across those who sat by its warmth as they spoke and gestured and laughed.",medium
"On the other side of this chasm is a steep, tiered expanse of canyon wall.",medium
"It's just a plane of pathless rock, laden with stubborn pines.",medium
"I imagine standing here as dusk settles, the smell of woodsmoke drifting on the wind.",medium
"I imagine seeing the glow of a fire in each of those five pueblos across the canyon, each of them a comforting point of light as the evening shadows deepen and snag on the pine tree branches.",medium
"And I try to imagine being here not as a visitor, not as an uninvited guest, but as someone for whom this was home.",medium
"It's an uncommon thing, to have this kind of opportunity to connect with the history of the landscape.",medium
"I'm grateful to be reminded that, although it's rarely as tangible as it is in Walnut Canyon, the past is always a part of the fabric of the present.",medium
I want to share my journey and share my key learnings from living as a digital nomad so far.,medium
"The idea of living in a sailboat sailing around the world, propelled by the wind, sounds like music in my ears.",medium
Living on a boat is a lot of joy but is also frustrating at times.,medium
What made me swap the safe life on land with a rough life at sea playing by the rules of mother earth?,medium
But why?It all started with me feeling that something was missing in life.,medium
"Every day I woke up, went to work, went home again, met some friends or watched some tv, went to bed.",medium
I wanted a life with more contrasts - you need to feel the ups and the downs to appreciate the peaks!,medium
"In the summer of 2018, we chartered a sailboat in Croatia and I immediately fell in love with sailing!",medium
My boyfriend thought it just was a short time of inspiration after the holiday in Croatia.,medium
We have had some minor issues with the apartment we lived in and the situation changed in April 2019.,medium
The marked looked good and it was time to sell the apartment.,medium
Buying a new house or apartment felt so wrong because it felt so permanent.,medium
Am I just going to keep the loop going or am I going to do something about it?My boyfriend,medium
"At Easter 2019, we finally sold our apartment and had no plans for the future.",medium
"Quite bold, but we knew our limits - at least we thought so",medium
"For sure, we did have some quite scary situations on our way and the learning curve was as steep as a wall.",medium
Anyway - we did manage to sail our way down Europe and cross the Atlantic ocean getting to the Caribbean all in one piece!,medium
Before buying a boat we sold all of our possessions that we would not bring to our new floating home.,medium
Selling things we didn't need anymore gave us some money to keep us floating for a while.,medium
"Also, as software developers, we are (usually) fortunate that we have a good salary",medium
"Before, I used to work as a consultant in a Norwegian consultant company making software for clients.",medium
About a year ago I leaped and started my own company working as a self-employed developer.,medium
I wanted the flexibility to pick the clients with interesting projects - not just working for the clients a company has obligations to.,medium
I also wanted more time with family and more time to travel.,medium
Being the boss of my own company makes it easier to live the life I wanted.,medium
At one point I simply didn't see why I couldn't just be a self-employed developer.,medium
If some company hired me through a big consultant company - why did they not want to hire me for a project from my own company?,medium
"In the end, we are just humans with knowledge and what company I work for does not change my knowledge.",medium
This decision made it possible to save up some buffer in my company,medium
I have not had any income in my company for a while now-,medium
The virus ruined all our future traveling plans and it forced us to be creative and make the best out of our situation.,medium
We are now working full-time programming while living on the boat.,medium
We quite like it and see ourselves continuing this lifestyle in the future.,medium
So how is my new office space compared to living on land?First of all - I do not always work from the boat.,medium
"You need your basic tools like a computer, keyboard, coffee, etc.",medium
But there are some basics that a landlubber probably takes for granted - like power and Wifi.,medium
We also depend on a good 3G/4G reception that is not something that follows us everywhere we go.,medium
"Because of our basic needs, we often spend our office day on land where we have wifi and unlimited power.",medium
One solution to the reception problem is what I call Pirate style wifi .,medium
You go to a bar - buy a beer - get wifi code - go back to the boat and enjoy the wifi.,medium
"Unfortunately, we do not have a wifi repeater but we are planning to get one.",medium
"Usually, we try to find a cafe or somewhere offering wifi.",medium
When I used to be a landlubber I took public transport to get to work.,medium
I do not have space for a car in my boat nor have I prioritized to fit a bike in there either.,medium
And a bike will not take me from the boat to land anyway.,medium
That's like a small rib that acts like our small floating car.,medium
It has caused us a lot of frustration but it does it job - getting us from the boat to land and back again.,medium
A laundry is where I currently sit right now writing this article.,medium
Like I started the article: wherever good coffee and wifi exist is my office.,medium
I have a MacBook and sitting on a table only using this every day might not work well for your body.,medium
I have a laptop rooster stand to raise my computer to a height where my neck can be straight.,medium
"I also added a wireless keyboard, wireless touchpad, and a noise-canceling headset.",medium
You simply can't ask people at a cafe to be quiet like you can in an office,medium
Everything I use is small in terms of size and weight and fits perfectly in my backpack together with my MacBook.,medium
You know - a cafe does not necessarily make good coffee because they sell coffee.,medium
I bring it in my big coffee container to keep me going.,medium
Other options like checking into a co-working space are also possible.,medium
"Unfortunately, they are not quite common in the Caribbean and it usually requires you to spend some time in one place.",medium
When traveling we usually have prioritized to explore islands rather than work.,medium
While living on a sailboat it is more budget-friendly to work from the boat,medium
"I guess this is one of the sentences you have been told before: you can do it , if I can, you can , you are the director of your life - blah blah.",medium
I knew I could do whatever I wanted - but after eventually doing it made me realize that what is normal is not by default something you have to follow.,medium
"In retrospect, I now see that I have done what I thought I had to do - not what I truly wanted to do.",medium
You will stress test your relationship while sailing and living together in a small place like a sailboat.,medium
If you get back home together after a year of sailing you know you can live your life together for the rest of your life.,medium
I am so grateful that I can bring my hobby and my work with me wherever and whenever I want.,medium
"What a blessing!After corona, more companies have some practice in working remotely.",medium
I look forward to seeing if I can get more projects working remotely from the boat.,medium
Norway has not been leaning forward on this remote work but maybe things will change in the future?,medium
Maybe I don't have to work from a Norwegian company at all?,medium
"Buying a laptop stand, good headset, wireless touchpad, and keyboard made it easier to work in a dynamic surrounding without getting back pain or damage your workflow.",medium
You are most of your time alone working because your colleagues are not there.,medium
"It is not all true since I live with my boyfriend, but sometimes I miss the feeling of getting excited about getting home to see him after a long day at work.",medium
They say that the happiest moment for a sailor is when the new owners leave with the boat.,medium
"The todo-list of maintenance is a never-ending story and can be quite overwhelming, especially in the beginning.",medium
The ocean is a rough place and you need to endure whatever weather mother earth throws at you.,medium
Did you know that a small piece of salt can make a hole in a can of soda (or empty your beer before you manage to drink it yourself)?,medium
Yes - I know because I regularly find soda and beer floating around where I store my cans.,medium
What set me out on this journey was the fear of the repeating circle of my everyday life.,medium
When living on your boat you meet new people all the time and you travel through different countries and cultures.,medium
Just heading to a grocery store on a different island is a new experience.,medium
"Together with the big accomplishments, the sum of small things breaks the circle and gave me the contrast I needed.",medium
I found myself just feeling the joy of seeing a bird after being out at sea for 17 days after crossing the Atlantic sea.,medium
The sudden importance of the sun because your solar panels and the sun is your power supply.,medium
The clean water because you make water from the sea to keep you going.,medium
The feeling of a freshwater shower - the boat is not magically supplied with unlimited amounts of water!,medium
You have to make the water from seawater and a shower is not something you can do every day.,medium
Some friends expressed their worries about what if I just realize that home is simply the best place to be? .,medium
I think it is a good thought - because the travel might give you the perspective you needed to break the repeating circle back home.,medium
You now know how to appreciate the small things when you get back home.,medium
You don't have to spice up your life by selling everything you own and you sure don't have to buy a sailboat!,medium
"You see, there are lots of things you can do to break the repeating circle.",medium
"We want to earn the 6-figure salary, work more flexible hours, and achieve career milestones.",medium
"At the same time, we want to spend time with friends, pursue our passions outside of work, and have experiences.",medium
Every minute you spend with your friends is another minute you can't grow in your career.,medium
Every minute you're working is another minute you can't be with your family.,medium
Work gives us purpose and can be very meaningful if we choose the right work.,medium
"Family, friends, and the things that make us happy are incredibly important for living a complete life.",medium
"While most of us can't work on personal and professional aspects of our lives at the same time, we can operate under different seasons.",medium
"If you have a deadline coming up a big project, you should spend extra time on that big project.",medium
"Once that project is over, you should spend extra time with friends and family.",medium
"Even when you've got deadlines surrounding you, it's still possible to make room for 15-30 minutes per day to have conversations with people you care about.",medium
"Whether it's a quick phone call, family dinner, or some other occasion, make room for those conversations.",medium
You can go on fun experiences and spend more quality time with those people when the timing is right.,medium
You can also reserve more time during the weekend for your personal life.,medium
The reason most people struggle with this balance is because they don't know what they want.,medium
"What does a successful career look like?These opinions differ from person to person, so you shouldn't listen to or model people who have different definitions for happiness and success when making your own life decisions.",medium
I strive to write at least 1 article per day on Medium and another article each day for my blog.,medium
"Get detailed with this list as the more accurate it is, the better.",medium
Most people don't know what to list for personal goals because they're more vague.,medium
"Spending time with friends and family and having experiences are qualitative goals, but you can get quantitative with them.",medium
You can quantify how many vacations you want to take and how many hours you want to spend time with your family (at the minimum.,medium
"If you want to write 1,000 words each day for your upcoming book, it doesn't matter if you write that many words in 30 minutes or 1 hour.",medium
"Growing our careers is important, but so is getting the same tasks done sooner.",medium
"Writing 1,000 words 30 minutes sooner gives you extra time to focus on a different task or stop working sooner.",medium
Look at your existing workflow for opportunities where you can improve your efficiency.,medium
"You should embrace your professional work, but not for longer than you should.",medium
"If you get distracted as you work, you'll spend too much time working and end up with a lower output.",medium
"Don't surf the web at the same time, take phone calls, or do anything else that takes you away from your work.",medium
This will help you get the same tasks done faster and therefore have extra time to spend with family and friends.,medium
"On some days, you'll work more than you wanted to, and on other days, you'll work less than you wanted to.",medium
It's okay to be imperfect as long as you learn from the mistakes you make.,medium
"When most people think about the work-life balance, they see work as a vice.",medium
"However, both are important elements of a life that feels whole.",medium
Work gives you purpose and self-discovery while the relationships and experiences are what you'll remember the most.,medium
"On some days, you'll be more work oriented and on other days you'll be more oriented towards relationships and experiences.",medium
"It's not meant to be a perfect balancing act each day, but rather over the long-term.",medium
The goal is to be okay with leaning more in one direction than the other during certain timeframes but to maintain a net even position in your lifetime.,medium
Want to learn how to make money investing in the stock market?,medium
"By the time today's kids become adults, they'll likely have to budget in deciding for what, where, and when to buy attention.",medium
"For years, circumstances have forced marketers to step up and pay for our attention.",medium
The recorded changes in advertising are evident in the impact this has on how people consume media today.,medium
"Hence, to remain competitive, all had to recognize and adapt to these changes, and the attention game has only gotten more expensive by the day.",medium
Prankvertising (a mash-up of the words prank and advertising) has been prevalent as far back as a decade ago.,medium
It is a marketing tactic that utilizes visuals to capture the reaction of the commoner in a particular occurrence (prank) to feed the online media.,medium
"These performances include actors, hidden cameras, and effects that are out of the ordinary.",medium
"Agencies in charge of these pranks can then later edit, compile, and share the video to the ever-thirsty internet.",medium
"An excellent example is Heineken's The Candidate, a stunt in which an interviewer pretended to be having a heart attack right in the middle of an interview.",medium
"There are a lot of these, and when done perfectly, no one can ignore them.",medium
"To date, the most viewed video on the internet in under 24 hours is a prank video, garnering an impressive 247 million views in two days.",medium
This is in a world where legends like Eminem are still releasing hits.,medium
"While it seems like a peaceful day-to-day activity in viral marketing, prankvertising comes with not-so-pretty baggage.",medium
"For one, pranks cost the lives of many over the years.",medium
"So, orchestrating this tactic into advertising calls for revising how much technology has fueled our thirst to get noticed, cluttering our vision to neglect our humanity.",medium
"If marketing is about making a change, and disrupting people's culture for the better, then this discovery calls for a complete halt in serving with such a strategy.",medium
A sizable number of pranks pulled by brands and individual pranksters - even though startling to experience - often end up with the victim laughing it off.,medium
"Often, some people even tweet about it in dismissal of how embarrassed, confused, or terrified, they were.",medium
The question then is: how far can one go to be too far?,medium
What is the line in pulling up a prank before we term it as too much and perceived negatively by the audience you set to entertain?It might be hard to truly answer.,medium
"But as you might have guessed, anything with the potential of leading to death should be off-limits.",medium
The last thing your brand needs is getting sued for taking a life for internet points and petty recognition.,medium
"For aside from death, there are plenty of other ways to earn your brand a blow you'll hardly ever recover from.",medium
"You also do not want to come off as offensive, racist, misogynist, and other qualities that can lead the market to dethrone you from whatever height you attained.",medium
"Thank you, Internet!To their bones, pranks might be risky endeavors, but it is no reason we can't strive towards a happy ending when all is over.",medium
"Toys R Us, an American toys and clothing retail company, learned this the hard way.",medium
"In a prank they pulled in 2013, they outraged a lot of moms at the worst possible time imaginable- the approaching holiday shopping season of the year.",medium
"Will Burns, a contributor to Forbes magazine, while writing about the incident, observed how reality pranks are not designed to generate responses with phrases",medium
And one need not know what the campaign was about to realize: nobody wants that for their brand.,medium
"To avoid making a similar timely mistake, always study the variables at play in your campaign, and then aim for a positive reaction.",medium
"Organized by Thinkmodo, an agency known for creating some of the most viral videos in the world, this prank was for the movie",medium
"Dead Man Down, an American crime thriller released in 2013.The video confused me when I first watched it.",medium
"To me, it is both brave and unsettling for a sane person to see murder in progress and then take out their phone to snap a picture.",medium
"When an old woman tried to help the guy being murdered, I felt the descent of something unexplainable that bought tears to my eyes.",medium
I didn't find the prank in the least funny because I couldn't tell what I was supposed to be laughing at.,medium
"When I showed the same video to my friend, however, he spilled his drink on his shirt and fell off his seat in laughter.",medium
"While I found Weather Channel's Bus Shelter prank amusing, others might be frustrated for getting wet in what they will later regard as a stupid prank.",medium
There will always exist a lot of people who might feel offensive and others entertained in the same targeted market for the same prank.,medium
"Our sense of humor is as vast as the languages we speak, if not wider.",medium
"One man's meat is another man's poison, goes the saying.",medium
"Watch and learn from previous pranks, but remember to never copy them.",medium
Research has revealed that the world is sadder and angrier than ever.,medium
"And like every great adventure, this makes prankvertising both exciting and terrifying to venture into.",medium
"At the end of the day, says the marketer, Dave McMullen,There is no reason you can not be those exceptions.",medium
"The year is 2021, and there isn't any sign of prankvertising going anywhere.",medium
"The newer, more sensational your campaigns are, the more likely your audience will share them.",medium
Pranks can be a great way to boost your brand's image or introduce a new product to the market.,medium
"But, like a joke, a terrible one will have you wishing you'd never bothered trying.",medium
Why won't you listen to me that red is just not your color?,medium
Martha scrunched her nose and waggled a finger from the screen of my tablet - teasing me with feigned snootiness.,medium
"I've decided that I'm wearing red exclusively now, I poked back matter-of-factly.",medium
"She beamed her usual squinty-eyed smile, and I couldn't help but smile back.",medium
"Well, she said, For once I'm glad I'm not around to see that.",medium
"Afterall, I still didn't fully understand what I was dealing with.",medium
"This wasn't Martha, but an AI that had been programmed in her likeness.",medium
"I quickly found, however, that the AI model was surprisingly true to Martha - right down to her ever-so-slight southern drawl.",medium
"Considering the limited amount of data - profiles, text convos, pictures, videos - I was able to gather and submit, she - it - was unbelievable.",medium
A hollowness crept into her eyes as she waited for my response.,medium
"So I told her how I woke to Millie barking at the wind again, and about my day at work.",medium
"Seeing her on my tablet felt as if she was just gone on business, chatting to me from the hotel bed before turning out the lights.",medium
"Speaking of groceries, don't forget to stock up on Cherry Coke!",medium
She tapped her side of the screen and a Target ad appeared on mine.,medium
She wasn't wrong: I used to buy a lot of Cherry Coke.,medium
"I need to get going, Martha, I said, forcing a polite smile.",medium
It was an evening event that was held to inaugurate the Sistine Chapel after Michelangelo had finished four years of toil painting frescos on the ceiling.,medium
"If you have ever visited the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, you will have heard the guards saying, at regular intervals,",medium
There are signs everywhere forbidding both photography and video and this is enforced every few seconds by the staff.,medium
I have personally been told off there when I checked my phone and a largely disinterested guard just tapped me on the shoulder.,medium
"I was one of 6 million visitors that year and from what I saw, nearly everyone else was snapping a picture and then being told off.",medium
It is actually down to a deal with a camera company and then kept in place for several valid reasons.,medium
"In 1980, the Vatican decided it was time to undertake a comprehensive restoration of the Sistine chapel and Michelangelo's art in particular.",medium
It also came with a hefty price tag that forced them to seek outside financial assistance.,medium
The winning offer came from the Nippon Television Network Corporation of Japan (NTV).,medium
They offered $3 million (which eventually increased to $4.2 million) and no one was able to match them.,medium
"In fact, at first, the deal was ridiculed by many.",medium
"However, in return for funding the project, Nippon TV got exclusive rights to all photography and video relating to the work.",medium
This meant the process of restoration itself and all the final restored art.,medium
A photographer called Takashi Okamura was commissioned and he set about recording it all.,medium
"When Nippon started to share the high-resolution photos showing the detailed processes going on behind the scaffolding, the ridicule soon dried up.",medium
"Since making the deal, Nippon TV has made over a dozen documentaries, including a few in English, and coffee-table books of the art, translated into several languages.",medium
"Although NTV has never announced if they made any profit, it seemed like they had made a good deal.",medium
"As reported in the New York Times, the deal only lasted for the restoration period for each section and the three years that followed completion.",medium
The exclusive NTV rights ended in 1997.There is nothing underhanded going on from Nippon's side.,medium
"In fact, they originally stated that the photo and video ban didn't apply to 'ordinary tourists'.",medium
"However, at the time, authorities understandably instigated a broad policy of 'No photos or videos'.",medium
They worried a cunning professional photographer could sneak in and get off some snaps.,medium
"Once the exclusivity period ended, Vatican officials decided to keep the ban in place.",medium
"Why?In 2012, an Italian literary critic called Pietro Citati caused a storm when he wrote an open letter to a major newspaper denouncing the crowds.",medium
He argued that the chapel and its art was supposed to be a place of quiet contemplation.,medium
"In the popular summer months, around 30,000 people visit the chapel every day.",medium
The temperature can reach 40 Celsius and that can lead to safety issues.,medium
Only the Sistine Chapel itself is air-conditioned and it is claimed that at least 10 visitors faint a day just while queuing to get in.,medium
"As anyone who has been to a gallery that allows photography will testify, people snapping pictures get in the way and block things up.",medium
"With that many visitors, it makes sense to keep people moving.",medium
The main reason people think there is a ban is down to the damage flash photography does to art over time.,medium
"While it is pretty easy to turn off a flash, there are a surprising amount of people who 'forget', even though a flash wouldn't make any difference in a room that size.",medium
But the mere presence of that many people brings other problems that damage the art.,medium
It is the sheer numbers that are causing the problems and allowing photography would exacerbate the problem.,medium
There have been numerous calls demanding a limit to the numbers for over a decade.,medium
"Promises and plans have been made but so far, it has not happened.",medium
"I went to the Sistine chapel years ago, on a cold January morning",medium
"There is no need to take a picture, just pause and admire the work.",medium
You will never be able to capture it with just a holiday camera or phone.,medium
"Then, on your way out, don't forget to visit the souvenir shop.",medium
"Laying on a beach somewhere tropical, sipping a drink while updating your travel blog.",medium
"Now you can spend the rest of your time looking at beautiful vistas, sampling exotic cuisine, and flirting with locals.",medium
"Every day for you is a vacation, a friend back home once told me while I was living abroad.",medium
The image of expat life that many think of is terribly romantic.,medium
"It seems like a wonderful fantasy because for 99% of people who live in other countries, it is.",medium
This idea is also based on a privileged viewpoint that sees countries with less economic power as a sort of playground for wealthy first-worlders to take advantage of.,medium
"But if you can't afford to only work a couple of hours a week in your home country, it's still unlikely you'll be able to do so abroad.",medium
I still worked a full 40+ hours a week and often lost out when it came to sending money home to pay off my student loan debt.,medium
"When I see so many people discussing a move abroad as the solution to their pandemic fatigue or feelings of burn out at work, I feel it's worth offering a caution.",medium
"In my time living abroad, I met several digital nomads - people who lived off of travel blogging and vlogging, photography, and freelance.",medium
There's a lot of competition online so making your ideas stand out and get click-throughs and sponsorships is a real challenge.,medium
Creating content and building up brand relationships is a full-time job for most of these people.,medium
Many of them choose to make countries like Vietnam their home base because the visa requirements aren't too strict and the cost of living is low.,medium
It can be hard to afford to go back to your home country in these cases too.,medium
"Right now, with many upper-middle-class people working from home, the idea seems even more appealing to go live in another country with a lower cost of living while maintaining your current job.",medium
"For some companies, you must be a US resident to work for them.",medium
"If you must be present for regular meetings and work sessions, time zones will have you living an offset life.",medium
Will you still be able to take advantage of all the supposed benefits of living abroad then?,medium
Not to mention the everyday logistical challenges of living in another country.,medium
Are you fluent in the language of whichever country you would like to move to?,medium
"And while English is a global language, having no knowledge of the local language puts you at a severe disadvantage when it comes to daily tasks, making friends, and getting involved in the community.",medium
"If you would expect that someone moving to your home country should learn the language, you'd better get on Duolingo yourself or face your own hypocrisy.",medium
"While some people thrive in a setting that challenges them, others long for comfort and familiarity on a regular basis.",medium
"Of course, some places have neighborhoods, stores, and restaurants that are geared toward tourists, but you'll pay a premium for them.",medium
"If the goal is to lower your cost of living, you'll have to do what the locals do at least some of the time.",medium
"If you think that a move abroad at this time is right for you, take a moment to evaluate why you want to go and what you're looking for in these other places.",medium
"Even if it's a country you've visited before, perhaps for a vacation, there may be issues you haven't anticipated.",medium
Many people are looking for a break by going somewhere else during this pandemic.,medium
They find life in their home country to be too stressful and they want to put their problems aside and pretend that life is normal again.,medium
"Even countries where numbers are better, the effects of Covid have still changed life in other countries.",medium
Restrictions might even be stricter than in the country you're coming from.,medium
It's important to ask yourself what exactly it is you're hoping to get from this other place.,medium
Then evaluate whether or not it's realistic to expect it from wherever you're going.,medium
What will be the consequence to your life in your home country?,medium
"Will it be possible to return home when the situation changes?If, after considering everything, you decide that moving abroad is what you truly want - not just an escapist whim, you should prepare yourself.",medium
Living abroad can be extremely enriching and rewarding despite all the challenges.,medium
"More than just a temporary bandaid on a deeper problem, living abroad is a serious lifestyle choice.",medium
"Study the language, be prepared to become part of a new community, and do the research to know what to expect.",medium
"But also know that work is still going to be part of your life, not just play.",medium
"For the past years, I've been studying what high-performers in any field or industry do differently than mediocre performers.",medium
"To me, it's fascinating to see how high-achievers tend to have different beliefs, habits, and ways of thinking compared to most others in their industry.",medium
"What's even more fascinating is that, in most cases, this is learned behavior - not genetics.",medium
"This means anyone can learn the beliefs, habits, and thought-models of high-performers and use them to elevate their personal and professional lives.",medium
"Therefore, in this article, I'll share four things that the pros (the high-performers from any walk of life) do differently than the amateurs (the mediocre performers).If",medium
"Anyone can put in the work on the days where they feel motivated, inspired, and everything seems to flow easily.",medium
"But what about those days where you don't feel motivated, where inspiration seems lightyears away, and when work feels like an uphill battle?On those days, most amateurs give up.",medium
"When the going gets tough, they tell themselves a hundred excuses why it's okay to escape to Netflix, social media, or other easy distractions.",medium
"The pros, on the other hand, put in the work regardless of how they feel.",medium
They follow their schedule - even if the metaphorical weather is terrible.,medium
"This makes them ultra-consistent, which is why they perform at the top of their field.",medium
"In fact, I had quite a terrible night of sleep, so I'm pretty low on energy.",medium
"Before I knew it, ideas started to flow, inspiration struck, and I'm writing this piece right now.",medium
"It might get a ton of views, it might get zero.",medium
"It might be valuable to you, or maybe you hate it.",medium
"And with consistency, I know one of my articles in the next few weeks will be a big hit.",medium
"The pros understand that mastery is the name of the game, and mastery can't be achieved when you go too broad.",medium
You need to focus deeply on just a handful of skills - sometimes even just one.,medium
You can't just hop from idea to idea - or from opportunity to opportunity.,medium
"If you do, however, you'll never develop the level of skill necessary to stand out in your field.",medium
"Most amateurs tend to get distracted by every new opportunity, idea, or exciting piece of information.",medium
"They suffer from the 'shiny object' syndrome, which is the belief that the secret to success can be found in the next thing, the next idea, or the next piece of information.",medium
"I used to believe in this idea for years, and I was hopping from business idea to business idea.",medium
I was impatient and thought I could strike gold with the next business idea.,medium
Only when I focused my time and effort deeply on writing articles and creating productivity courses did I start achieving the success I so desperately desired for years.,medium
You need to develop the focus and discipline to really go deep and become so good at your craft that you can't be ignored anymore.,medium
You don't need to do many different things; you need to do one thing really well.,medium
"Whether you're a pro or an amateur, working towards big, ambitious goals requires a lot of effort.",medium
"The difference between the pros and the amateurs, however, is that amateurs are overly focused on how much effort it takes to achieve great things.",medium
"And thus, they try to escape from it by inaction, excuses, and distractions.",medium
"The pros, however, are also deeply aware of the effort it takes to achieve great things, but they focus a lot more on their 'why'.",medium
"Instead of being intimidated by the effort, they get inspired by a clear and compelling 'why'.",medium
They focus more on the results their efforts will yield than pondering over the effort it takes to get these results.,medium
"For example, they focus on how writing a great book will positively impact their readers' lives - not on how much personal effort it takes to write it.",medium
They remind themselves of the impact their business might have on society - not on how much personal effort it takes to build it.,medium
"This difference in perspective makes the pros continue to put in the work, achieve great things, and be rewarded exponentially.",medium
Failure is a natural part of the process of pursuing worthwhile things.,medium
"If you're not making mistakes or screwing up now and then, you're simply not challenging yourself enough.",medium
"When they make a mistake, they think they are a mistake.",medium
"When they screw up, they think they are a screw-up.",medium
They also fear that others perceive them as a failure when they fail at something.,medium
This is why they'd rather avoid failure simply by not taking any action at all.,medium
"The pros, however, understand that making a mistake is not the same as being a mistake.",medium
And that screwing up doesn't mean you are a screw-up.,medium
They've also learned not to care about how other people think of them.,medium
They simply think of it as gaining experience or gathering new data.,medium
"The more you learn about what doesn't work, the closer you come to discover what does work.",medium
Each failure is another step forward - another stepping stone towards success.,medium
"Personally, I dare to say it is because of my business failures that I've achieved certain milestones and successes - not despite these failures.",medium
"Each failure contained a valuable new lesson that allowed me to come better smarter, stronger, and better.",medium
"Of course, it's not easy to go from failure to failure, but you should not fear it.",medium
"It should never become a reason for inaction, staying in your comfort zone, and letting your dreams pass by.",medium
"If you want to become a pro, you need to learn how to embrace it and view it as an essential part of the process.",medium
"Therefore, as an action point for this article, pick at least one of these concepts and apply it today!",medium
"Whether this means journaling about it, meditating on it, or taking raw action - it's totally up to you.",medium

"One day Warren Buffett walked to the pilot of his private jet and jokingly said to him, The fact that you are still working for me means I've not done my job right.",medium
You should have been out by now chasing your goals and dreams.,medium
Buffett then gave him one of the most powerful time management advice.,medium
He walked his pilot through a three-step strategy to give more clarity about his life goals.,medium
"Here's what the three-step strategy was:Warren asked his pilot again, What are you going to do with the rest 20 goals? .",medium
"Warren, these 5 are the most important thing in my life , the pilot hesitantly responded, The other 25 are not my primary focus",medium
This is what Buffett said in his own words and that's the key to Buffett's success.,medium
Focus on the things that really matter and avoid things that don't really help you to achieve your top goals.,medium
"When you have 20 focuses on your life, it's likely to achieve none.",medium
"If you focus on the long-term, you may really be able to accomplish 3-5 goals, at most.",medium
All those remaining 20 goals on your list act as a potential distraction from your top 5.To-do-list can make you feel overwhelmed if you have a problem saying no or delegating tasks.,medium
Having multiple tasks on your to-do-list will also make you more stressed.,medium
"Also, there are people who are prone to bad habits and distractions that take their time away without them noticing it.",medium
The momentum so created after finishing task after task also distracts you from making progress on the important tasks.,medium
It's easier to get distracted from tasks that you really need to do.,medium
"Because you get in the excitement, joy, and temporary pleasure of things that aren't simply as important.",medium
"For example, you might want to use Facebook or Instagram to take a break from work just to realize you have already wasted 1-hour scrolling on social media mindlessly.",medium
It's easy to get caught up and lose track of time when you get into that zone.,medium
The basic idea of making a not-to-do list is to help yourself have more time and manage your time more effectively.,medium
This helps you to eliminate bad habits and low-value tasks that don't serve any purpose in your life.,medium
"When you add something to your not-to-do list, you simply say no to it no matter what.",medium
"Every day you feel like you shouldn't do certain things, but you can not stop yourself from doing these things.",medium
Writing these things down on your to-do-list will help you to systematically take care of all of these things.,medium
The basic idea of a not-to-do list is to help yourself with self-discipline.,medium
Creating a not-to-do list helps you to avoid unnecessary tasks by giving your mind a signal.,medium
What to write on your not-to-do list depends on your personal behaviors.,medium
"It can be as simple as not browsing the Facebook feed needlessly, not searching for news, or not going to parties.",medium
Here's my personal not-to-do list as of now.,medium
Here's a not-to-do list of Tim-Ferriss(Author of the Book 4 Hour Workweek):1.,medium
Don't email first thing in the morning or last thing at night.3.,medium
Don't agree to meetings or calls with no clear agenda or end time.5.,medium
Don't check email constantly - batch and check at set times only6.,medium
"Don't over-communicate with low-profit, high-maintenance customers7.",medium
The idea that a person could see and predict the future was nothing short of amazing to my young mind.,medium
I read as many short novellas on the subject as I could get my little hands on.,medium
And I ate them up as fast as I could devour my sacks of Halloween loot every year.,medium
"I read books voraciously at that age, and these were just a few of many.",medium
Of all of the magical books I was reading at the time - these were the only ones that were true.,medium
Frank is trying to find a devoted audience for his newsletter on stock markets.,medium
Frank read all the advice and books about True Fans and how to turn a newsletter into a business.,medium
"In his research, Frank came across a method to get 10,000,000 real email addresses.",medium
"Sure, it required a few bucks to purchase from a dubious source, but Frank didn't mind - Frank had a mission to accomplish.",medium
"He had a few goals:On the first day of the month, Frank sent out his initial prediction.",medium
Millions of people viewed his short email and didn't pay much attention.,medium
"After 12 months of insanely accurate predictions, Frank now had his followers.",medium
"Although by this point, they should probably be referred to as worshipers.",medium
"In fact, Frank had lost almost all of his subscriber base.",medium
"Of the 10 million initial email addresses, he only had a few thousand left.",medium
But these few thousand were quite willing to pay a monthly fee of $250 to keep hearing his predictions.,medium
"I'm sure they would've spent considerably more than that, too, if he had asked.",medium
"On the second anniversary of his newsletter, Frank shut it down with no notice.",medium
"Shockingly, his subscriber base had shrunk down to just one person.",medium
And he made that one last person an incredible amount of money as well.,medium
"Did you figure out what happened?Frank was undoubtedly a devious messiah, but he was also a clever one.",medium
"When he first started out with his 10 million email addresses, he divided them into two groups.",medium
"To half, he sent a letter saying the stock market would go up the next month.",medium
"The next month, he split the winning group in half again.",medium
"After every month, his potential subscribers would go down in half.",medium
"The negative predictions moving to the trash bin, the positive predictions staying on.",medium
Now imagine you were in that lucky remaining group sometime in the second year.,medium
How long would it take before you'd be on your hands and knees praising this guy that made Warren Buffet look like The Count from Sesame Street?,medium
"Maybe you'd start paying attention, and certainly by the eighth.",medium
"After 12 months, you'd be very willing to give this clairvoyant profit a meager $250 just to keep hearing his advice.",medium
Sign over my house today because I'll get a mansion tomorrow.,medium
"After one year of free and accurate predictions, only 5,000 people would be left to receive Frank's email.",medium
But those few remaining people wouldn't know his newsletter was going out to fewer and fewer people.,medium
They wouldn't know why Frank was able to see the future.,medium
They're lapping up his newsletter the minute it gets sent out.,medium
"Month after month, they do this and only get more confident, wealthier, and happier.",medium
"All those months while people were dropping off like flies, Frank was smiling.",medium
Frank's most accurate prediction was the most important one - people are greedy.,medium
Thousands of people invested in a mysterious digital newsletter with the name Frank attached at the end.,medium
They didn't need to know why or how the email was making these foretellings.,medium
"As for that last lucky member of Frank's newsletter - the one in 10,000,000 - he was probably just as happy as Frank.",medium
Twenty-four straight months of accurate predictions in the stock market can bring a smile to the most miserable among us.,medium
"Arjun tapped away at his keyboard, changing a few model parameters, and started the simulation.",medium
"He was testing out a new powertrain configuration, the result of months of research.",medium
"The electric vehicle startup he had joined a year ago had ambitious goals, but he liked his work and the general company culture.",medium
"He was surrounded by people smarter than him, and learnt a lot every day.",medium
He waited for a minute and glanced at his watch - 5.56 pm.,medium
"He had dinner plans soon, and it would take a while to get there in Bangalore traffic so he'd need to wrap up.",medium
"He shut down his PC, grabbed his bag and waved goodbye to his teammates with a quick Happy weekend!",medium
"He and some friends from university had set up a new weekly tradition - dinner every Friday night, taking turns to choose the location every week.",medium
He got out of the elevators and waved bye to the doorman before heading to where his bike was parked.,medium
"A few seconds later, at exactly the moment his watch ticked to 6 pm, the equilibrium of the world shifted.",medium
"Arjun nearly tripped and fell, and stopped in his tracks to regain his balance.",medium
"Sluggish, almost imperceptibly heavier in some way, like he was holding a pair of dumbbells.",medium
Those who hadn't had a dazed expression on their face - probably the same one he had on his own face a second ago.,medium
"He helped a couple of people up, but everyone just seemed confused.",medium
"That's when he heard it, a sound he would never forget.",medium
"The building that housed his startup and a number of other companies, all 25 stories of it, was wobbling.",medium
The building shook for a few more seconds and then it happened.,medium
"He snapped out of it and joined them, adrenaline propelling him despite the new sensation of heaviness, as the deafening sounds of a collapsing building continued behind him.",medium
"Once he had made it to the entrance of the complex, he finally stopped running and turned around.",medium
"He could barely see anything, a huge dust cloud obscuring his vision and forcing him to shut his eyes.",medium
"About a minute later, it cleared enough for him to open his eyes again.",medium
"The space where his office building had just been was completely empty, with only a pile of rubble and the remnants of the dust cloud indicating that it had ever been there.",medium
"The adrenaline started to wear off and the shock and nausea hit, making him feel faint.",medium
"He stood up and started walking back to his home, still in a daze.",medium
"He paid no attention to his surroundings, his mind shutting down to avoid thinking about what had just happened.",medium
"If he had been paying attention, he would have seen chaos on the street.",medium
"Vehicles stopped in the middle of the road, people collapsed on the ground, and more dust clouds like the one he had just witnessed off in the distance.",medium
"After he had walked for about ten minutes, his phone rang, snapping him out of his reverie.",medium
"It had only been about ten minutes, and his parents lived in Mumbai.",medium
How had they found out about something happening in Bangalore so soon?,medium
Your father and I were at home when the house suddenly started shaking!,medium
"It settled down quickly, and we thought it was an earthquake, but the news says it's been happening all over the world.",medium
"Not yet, your father is trying to get her on the line now",medium
"Don't leave the house until we know more, and be prepared for more earthquakes.",medium
"Yes Ma .He hung up, and immediately tried to call his sister.",medium
"She had moved to New York for work a little over two years ago, but she was still one of the closest people in his life.",medium
He talked to her every other day and they told each other everything about their lives.,medium
He tried again a few more times but couldn't get through to her.,medium
"He tried to call his sister one more time, and when it failed again the feeling of dread intensified.",medium
"Mumbai, Beijing, Seoul, San Francisco, London, Paris, Tokyo, Sao Paolo, Moscow, Johannesburg - the list was endless.",medium
The exact thing he had witnessed before his very eyes was happening all over the world.,medium
"No one understood what was happening, and the governments of the world were yet to make a statement about the global calamity.",medium
"His eyes snapped back to his phone as it started to ring, showing the one caller he was desperately hoping to see - Didi'.",medium
I was taking the subway into Manhattan when the train stopped in the middle of the tunnel!,medium
It took a while for them to rescue us and there was no cell signal inside.,medium
"It's not great here, but from what I heard, Brooklyn is still doing way better than Manhattan.",medium
"They talked a little longer until Asha reached home as well, and then they hung up after promising to each other that they would be careful, and would keep each other updated if anything happened.",medium
"The family that owned the house lived on the ground floor, and he lived in the 2 bedroom flat on the first floor with a friend from university.",medium
"The family wasn't home at the moment, having left to visit relatives in Hyderabad a few days earlier.",medium
"There were a few books strewn on the ground, probably from the shaking earlier, but it looked mostly all right.",medium
"He took a moment to reply to all the concerned messages on his phone from friends and relatives asking if he was okay, and sent out a few of his own.",medium
"He then turned on the TV and flipped it to the news, and put the displaced books back on their shelves.",medium
"In half an hour, he heard a lot of raised voices and confused opinions, but no one seemed to have any more idea about what was going on than he did.",medium
"World governments and the media may not have any idea what was happening, but his WhatsApp groups were already ripe with theories and speculation.",medium
This is a COSMIC EVENT that happens once every TEN MILLION YEARS.,medium
The alignment of the sun and the moon make all matter on earth BRITTLE for 24 hours!,medium
Please share this with friends and family and stay safe during this dangerous time!,medium
"Normally Arjun paid no attention to forwarded messages like this, but considering the sheer scale of global events over the last hour, who could say what the real explanation",medium
I was on a bus on the way back from work when the buildings started collapsing.,medium
"The street was absolutely chaotic, people panicking and crashing into each other.",medium
"This may sound a little weird, but have you been feeling a little strange?",medium
"He almost felt foolish doing it, but got up and walked over the weighing scale they had in their bathroom.",medium
He had happened to measure his weight at the gym just a few hours earlier.,medium
"How had he gained 1.5 kg in 4 hours?Sai measured himself, and also noticed a surprising increase in his weight since the last time he had measured it.",medium
"Now even more confused than before, Arjun and Sai went back to the couch, spending the rest of the evening",medium
The government was setting up temporary relief shelters to house all the people displaced by the disaster.,medium
"Over the hours, the TV stations brought on everyone from an environmental scientist to an ex-military general to give their opinions on the crisis.",medium
"But while the theories got wilder and wilder, no one could say for sure what was happening.",medium
"It wasn't clear if no one else had noticed it, or whether they were too skeptical to bring up the topic on the air.",medium
"After a few hours, they decided that they needed to get some sleep and went back to their rooms.",medium
"After checking on his family again, Arjun settled in for the night, his mind still racing from the events of the day.",medium
He looked up to see his family on the other side of the floor.,medium
"He stood up and started walking towards them, but the whole floor seemed to lengthen so that the distance between them stayed the same.",medium
"He became more and more desperate, and as he reached out a hand, he felt the earth start to shake.",medium
"It was barely noticeable, but he could still feel mild tremors.",medium
"He ran out of his room and barged into Sai's room, yelling Wake up!",medium
Then Sai abruptly stopped talking as the shaking seemed to intensify slightly.,medium
"They both ran outside, still in their pyjamas and slippers and bolted down the stairs and onto the street.",medium
"Just as they got there, the shaking intensified to the point that it was unmistakable.",medium
"It kept growing in intensity, until they could no longer stand and had to drop to the ground.",medium
They watched in despair as the roof of the house came crashing down.,medium
"Telephone poles and street lamps crashed to the ground around them, some narrowly missing them.",medium
They heard the panicked shouts of other people who had run out onto the street.,medium
"After another minute or so, the shaking came to a stop.",medium
"The buildings were crumbling, poles and wires strewn across the ground, people on the road in a state of shock.",medium
The last time Bangalore had suffered a large earthquake was in 2001.,medium
This was one of the strongest earthquakes in the city's history.,medium
"Arjun and Sai sat on the ground, slowly recovering from what they had just experienced.",medium
"They didn't have anything on them except for their phones, and they obviously couldn't go back into their apartment.",medium
"After talking about it for a bit, they decided to walk to the government shelter nearby.",medium
"On the way, Arjun saw on his phone that the disasters were intensifying around the world.",medium
"Earthquakes everywhere, and coastal cities being hit the hardest with tidal waves.",medium
"He tried to call his family, but he couldn't get through to any of them.",medium
"Apparently cell towers were being knocked out everywhere, and cellular connectivity was taking a hit.",medium
He was lucky to still be able to use mobile data to read the news.,medium
"It was sturdy however, and though parts of it had caved in from the earthquake, it was mostly intact.",medium
"Inside, there were blankets laid out all across the floor, but the earthquake had woken everyone up.",medium
"People were clustered in little groups, not saying much, apparently still in a state of shock at what was happening to them.",medium
Everyone's meagre belongings were strewn across the floor of the warehouse in a jumbled mess.,medium
"Arjun and Sai settled into a corner and sat on the floor, not saying anything.",medium
"It wasn't comfortable, but exhaustion overtook Arjun and he dozed off, sleeping fitfully.",medium
"He woke up a few hours later, and Sai told him that they would be handing out breakfast in an hour.",medium
All of the news was pointing to the same thing - an announcement made by ISRO about ten minutes ago.,medium
"No, my phone died a little while ago , he replied.",medium
The ISRO chairperson stood at a podium in front of a room full of reporters.,medium
We have spent the last 12 hours working tirelessly to understand what has caused the disasters around the world.,medium
All of these occurrences have the same cause - the Earth's gravity has increased .Arjun and Sai gaped at the little screen.,medium
"At exactly 6pm IST last evening, the universal gravitational constant appears to have increased by precisely 2%.",medium
"The Earth's core and crust are now adjusting to this change, causing massive tectonic shifts and earthquakes around the world.",medium
"The moon's orbit around the Earth has started to tighten, increasing tidal forces.",medium
This along with the earthquakes has caused the tidal waves wreaking havoc to our coasts,medium
The repercussions of this are more far-reaching than just on Earth.,medium
"If this change continues, the equilibrium of the cosmos itself will shift.",medium
"The Earth's orbit around the sun will change, along with all of the planets in our solar system.",medium
It's hard to predict exactly what the universe will look like after it has stabilized from this change.,medium
"We will continue to investigate this shift, and will provide a more comprehensive analysis soon.",medium
"For now, all we can advise is that you stay inland, and remain outdoors and avoid large buildings as far as possible.",medium
"Arjun and Sai looked at each other, eyes wide and disbelieving.",medium
Panicked shouts started from around the warehouse as the ground started to tremor again.,medium
He took down a couple of notes from this run: Time until collapse of human civilization:,medium
He set the gravitational constant perturbation parameter even higher this time - 5%.,medium
He had signed up for the History of Computing course because he had heard that it was interesting (and it was supposed to be an easy A).,medium
"The professor had decided to increase the workload this semester though, and he'd spent way more time on the course than he had expected.",medium
They had to choose a specific sub-field within computing and write a detailed history of it.,medium
The first HRS had been run by the ENIAC 7 supercomputer 22 years ago to simulate the whole planet.,medium
"It had broad models for the ecosystem and environment, but it modelled 10 billion humans individually.",medium
"It became a hot field after the first supercomputer simulation, generating plenty of academic interest and military funding.",medium
"The field progressed rapidly, with the resolution increasing to model every living being on the planet, and the scope broadening to include the entire solar system.",medium
Computing power had continued to grow exponentially under Moore's law for long enough to bring high-resolution simulations to personal computers 10 years ago.,medium
It was around then that interest in the field started to decline.,medium
"The simulations were a stunning technical achievement, but it became increasingly clear that they had no real practical value and funding dried up.",medium
Academic pursuit continued at a slow pace for a few years until the human modeling element became precise enough for ethical questions to start cropping up.,medium
At what point did the humans in the simulation stop being just pieces of code and start being actual beings with feelings and rights?,medium
"Finally, a study hinting that the human models in HRS had achieved sentience ended up being the final nail in the coffin for the field.",medium
"It was never proved definitively, and so it was still legal to run a HRS.",medium
"It was, however, looked down on by most people, and academic interest and funding turned to more relevant (and less controversial) problems.",medium
"The field may no longer be relevant, but Kass found it fascinating that there was a complete solar system running on his computer at this very moment.",medium
"To complement the history, he had decided to run a few simulations varying some universal physical parameters to see their impact on human society.",medium
"Broadly speaking, he wanted to show human civilization's dependence on these parameters.",medium
"However, this was a widely accepted fact and not particularly novel.",medium
In all honesty he just wanted an excuse to try running a few simulations.,medium
He wrote a quick conclusion and submitted the assignment with just a couple of minutes to spare.,medium
"As soon as it became midnight, the auto-grader evaluated his assignment and gave him comprehensive feedback.",medium
"He scored well on the history itself, but he actually ended up being docked a few points for running the simulations when it was generally discouraged.",medium
"Bellingham, Washington is 85 miles north of Seattle, Washington, and 50 miles south of Vancouver, British Columbia.",medium
"I had lived in Seattle when I was younger, and moved here after graduate school.",medium
"I moved here for urban culture, thinking I'd bop down to Seattle to see friends or up to Vancouver for shows and restaurants.",medium
"And I stayed in Bellingham for violence, dogs, and love.",medium
"Bellingham's official motto is A Refreshing Change, but that official saying is used so seldom that I'd literally never heard it until I started writing this.",medium
"Bellingham is a city between, and much of what defines it is that position between.",medium
"Bellingham Bay is itself between, this time between the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.",medium
"This means you can go north by water from Bellingham, via Victoria San Juan Cruises, to Victoria, on Vancouver Island.",medium
"The substantial freshwater lake of Lake Whatcom, often full of pleasure boats, kayakers, stand-up paddleboarders, moist pit bulls, and the occasional otter.",medium
"Its waters feed one of Bellingham's gems, Whatcom Falls Park.",medium
"When the rains have been heavy, like they have been this week, you can hear the falls from across the 240 acre park.",medium
"In the summer, when it is dry, you may have to walk across the old stone WPA bridge to really hear them trickling.",medium
"Miles of trails wind through the park, and an amazing network of trails spiderweb through Bellingham.",medium
"You can walk or bike from the bay through the woods to most neighborhoods, and beyond the town up into the hills and mountains beyond.",medium
"Besides your fellow Bellinghamsters, you'll see deer, coyotes, and more menacing things.",medium
"Bear scat has been found less than half a mile from my house, and there's an owl who lives across the street.",medium
"Bellingham has a good state university (Western Washington University) and a community college, and a technical college, but most people move hear for the feel and the activities.",medium
"We've got tons of microbreweries, some good local restaurants, a moderate arts scene, and lots to do.",medium
"I was in Boulevard Park, a city park on the water, situated between downtown Bellingham and Fairhaven, a cool older neighborhood to the south.",medium
"These names still persist, as well as other named neighborhoods.)",medium
"It was a summer evening, and I was enjoying looking out at the waves, until I saw people trying to hit each other with sticks.",medium
"It was a small but dedicated group practicing bojutsu, a Japanese art of staff fighting.",medium
"I was hooked for about 10 years, but if sticks aren't your thing, you can find truth fencing, aikido, tai chi, BBJ, MMA, tae kwon do, and others.",medium
I've taken tai chi classes as well as self-defense classes.,medium
"And if you're less violent, well, there's a range of movement and entertainment arts, too.",medium
"You can study papercrafting, yoga, gymnastics, sacred dance, visit the climbing gym, and join the circus, or at least, the circus guild.",medium
For almost 50 years the Ski to Sea race has been run.,medium
It's a team multi-sport race that starts at Mount Baker - a local ski attraction - and ends in Fairhaven.,medium
"Team members ski, bike, kayak, and run, and do other things to cover 93 miles in seven legs.",medium
"And while a lot of adults take advantage of those offerings, one thing that's true - and important - about Bellingham is that it's great for both kids and dogs.",medium
"Not only will you find people walking dogs on them, there are companies who will pick your dogs up and take them for a trail romp while you're at work.",medium
"I've taken part in Dog Days of Summer, as well as a pit bull parade around Lake Padden.",medium
"There are dog off leash areas in many parks, and my dog knows hundreds of dogs by name, and thousands by smell.",medium
"And if Bellingham is good for dogs, it is even better for kids.",medium
"Again, everyone uses the parks and trails, and so do the kids, but in the summer, two of the parks are sprinkler parks, full of wet, squealing kids.",medium
"Some of the elementary schools offer extracurricular activities that sound like something you'd find at a small liberal acts college, like mountain bike clubs.",medium
"The schools have bike rodeos, and the community has safety fairs where kids get to climb into fire engines, Coast Guard boats, and helicopters.",medium
"There's a bakery where kindergarten classes tour regularly, a local ice creamery where they do the same, and things like a kids building club hosted by the quite fine public library.",medium
The fact that Bellingham is a patchwork city formed by four towns growing together means that streets often stop and start.,medium
I can't tell you how many times I got lost when I first moved here.,medium
"I'd be on a road, and it would just merge or end or change names, and I'd be like oh crap, here I am again, or rather, here I'm not.",medium
"The fact that Bellingham is up the road from Seattle means we continually get people moving up here from Seattle, as well as the general influx from elsewhere.",medium
The result is a ferocious housing market that isn't matched by the job market.,medium
Median house price in Bellingham itself in the last quarter of 2020?,medium
"A cool $550,000.Everything you've heard about how much it rains in Washington?",medium
"They are very cool, but it also means sometimes cats disappear and coyotes are happy.",medium
"That's an active volcano, one of several in the state.",medium
"Shoo!Leave me here, with my aging pit bull, my violent hobbies, and those I love.",medium
I'd like to thank my dad (Garth Beatty) for the pictures in this story.,medium
"Award-winning poet and story writer (  PhD in English, assistant pit bull, keppa to rockstars.",medium
Setting a schedule to go about your day is a not so secret technique to make sure you get everything done.,medium
The problem with schedules arises when you write down way too many things you need to get done.,medium
Looking at all of these tasks is definitely overwhelming and results in not getting anything done.,medium
"A to-do list has no boundaries, no priorities, and no designated times for the tasks you're trying to accomplish.",medium
Time blocking is the practice of scheduling periods throughout your day to finish different tasks.,medium
"Instead of sitting down at your desk trying to respond to emails, logging into Facebook, and drinking your coffee, your time block 8:00",medium
This helps because you're less likely to get distracted by impending tasks,medium
Distractions are a part of our daily life and often hard to ignore.,medium
"Cutting out distractions can be difficult because more often than not, the things we distract ourselves with are more fun than what we're currently doing.",medium
"By time blocking your day, you can actually give yourself time during the day to indulge in those distractions.",medium
Time blocking your workday can be exhausting but having something to look forward to like answering messages or playing games can be the motivation you need.,medium
Time blocking gives you permission to engage in the distractions but only after you've finished your more pressing tasks.,medium
"If distractions are still a big issue, try time blocking only every half hour.",medium
"In a perfect world, you would begin to time block more than 30 minutes of work to increase productivity because you know that you're",medium
"On Mondays, you may be bombarded with emails while Tuesdays are quiet.",medium
Having a good idea of how your weeks typically play out is a good way to start.,medium
Knowing what priorities you should emphasize on each day of the week is an amazing way to begin your time blocking habit.,medium
"By acknowledging your priorities, you'll know how much time to assign to each task, especially if those tasks have a deadline.",medium
It may be a good idea to avoid looking at emails on a certain day when you know you have something else due.,medium
I've gone through waves in my life where I'm a morning person.,medium
"If you're needed at an office and have a 9-5, try playing around with different times to do things.",medium
This one may sound silly but you should also time block your breaks.,medium
Having an extensive list of things to do can be mentally draining.,medium
"Working towards a goal, in this case, a break is a mental trick.",medium
Your brain knows that there is a break coming so it doesn't get burnt out.,medium
"During your time blocked break, don't limit yourself to just one thing.",medium
Use your break in a way you'll know that it will make you more effective after it's done.,medium
"If you know you cant bounce back from an afternoon nap, try playing a video game instead.",medium
Your brain will still be active but in a more relaxing way.,medium
"If you find yourself struggling to keep up with the predetermined schedule you made for yourself, it may be time to change your time blocking habits.",medium
"Similarly, it's not necessary to time block sleep from 10 PM-7 AM .",medium
Tight schedules with no flexibility can be overwhelming and feeling like you didn't accomplish a certain goal can be taxing to your mental health.,medium
You know yourself best and the ideal way to start new habits is to ease into them.,medium
It has been proven that color can affect someone's memory and the way they react to things.,medium
Color-coding your tasks is a simple way to visualize how much you actually have to do and how long you have to do it.,medium
There's no harm in lightening how long you think a certain task will take.,medium
This will give you the flexibility you need to begin time blocking while also giving yourself boundaries.,medium
"If there's a bathroom emergency during one of your time blocks, you're not going to ignore it just to stay on schedule.",medium
Be sensible and realize that it's not realistic to plan things to the minute.,medium
"Extend the length of your tasks and look at time blocking as an aid to your day to day life, not a life or death schedule.",medium
"If you don't suffer from chronic procrastination, this may not be the thing for you.",medium
"Time blocking is what you make it and at the end of the day, no one will force you as much as you force yourself.",medium
Time blocking can be wise if you use it appropriately and if you ease into it.,medium
Give it a chance and ease your way into it for better results.,medium
"Your job, whatever it is - writer, artist, gizmo maker - is to make content that people want to share.",medium
You want to create something that's so attention-grabbing and sensually appealing that people will engage with it and then get their friends and followers to engage with it.,medium
"Malcolm Gladwell has already explored the tipping point of when something goes viral, and a lot of that has to do with how sticky something is.",medium
But what gets people to interact with it in the first place?,medium
What motivates people to give something their time and consideration?The answer is in something called Cultural Cartography.,medium
I'm going to appall you by mentioning a name: BuzzFeed.,medium
"Whether you like to admit it or not, you can't deny their appeal.",medium
There are two types of people: those that admit to clicking on BuzzFeed videos and articles and those that lie about not clicking on BuzzFeed videos and articles.,medium
"To give you an example, 104,000 people on Facebook shared this BuzzFeed video: 4 Mesmerizing Marbled Clay Projects.",medium
I would call that engagement!Publications had declined my linked-article above about Malcolm Gladwell because I mentioned a popular YouTube personality.,medium
The editors gave me specific feedback about not using that YouTuber's name.,medium
"They know how to make viral content, and we can learn something by paying attention.",medium
"Three years ago, BuzzFeed's Publisher Dao Nguyen gave a TED talk entitled What makes something go viral?",medium
"They streamed the setup on Facebook Live, where online viewers could watch in anticipation",medium
"They ended up with 90,000 people watching a 30-minute-long video in real-time.",medium
How did they get thousands of people to tune-in at the same time to watch a video about goats?,medium
"Nguyen's answer is Cultural Cartography, a mapping of what influences culture.",medium
This map illustrates content that engages people and makes them want to share that same content.,medium
"The map of viral, audience-engaging content spreads out over five main areas: humor, identity, shared connection, participation, and emotion.",medium
People love to laugh and they love to make other people laugh.,medium
"Kohl's rewarded Payne with $2,500 of gift cards and piles of Star Wars toys and Kohl's points.",medium
"Human beings are pretty much the same and carry the same pattern of concerns: aging, dieting, being wanted, having sex, etc.",medium
These pieces of content include things that make you say this is us or you are not alone or even WTF? .,medium
"You want to do something, even if that something is sharing the content.",medium
"It is about TikTok user Katie Schieffer, who couldn't afford to buy her son insulin.",medium
"So far, a share on Twitter has 89,000 likes, 22,700 retweets, and 1,600 comments.",medium
"See if it makes you feel:This content doesn't have to apply specifically to the individual audience member, but it does have to help them learn something or live vicariously through it.",medium
"Another YouTuber (who I won't name, but you probably know) is famous for building mini-bombs of glitter that capture porch pirates unaware.",medium
The YouTuber uploads one video a month and usually gets 36 million views per video.,medium
"I don't plan on making a glitter bomb, but I feel like I'm learning something.",medium
I watch and share the videos because I feel like we are all doing something together.,medium
"Powerful emotions include those that people empathize with, make them feel good, or make them curious.",medium
Example: How about I get a few songs stuck in your head?,medium
Ed Sheeran's Shape of You video has 5.14 million views on YouTube.,medium
Mark Ronson & Bruno Mars's Uptown Funk has 4.06 million views.,medium
"Another selection, not too far away is Katy Perry's Roar with 3.25 million views.",medium
"In each example above: humor, identity, shared connection, participation, and emotion, the audience engages by either saying, I need this or you need this.",medium
"Through Cultural Cartography, attention is grabbed, held, and shared.",medium
"As I said above, your job is to make content that people want to share, no matter what your job is.",medium
"They've had massive success in Kickstarter, raising funds to make their games.",medium
"In 2019, their game Wingspan sold 44,000 copies in three months globally.",medium
"It would have sold even more, but they didn't have enough copies available - Stonemaier had to issue an apology for being unable to keep up with demand.",medium
Stonemaier makes a specific reference to cultural cartography in their blog post about breaking the internet to build a community.,medium
"Wingspan became one of the 20th best-ranked games on BoardGameGeek's list of 18,000 games.",medium
"It also took home the prestigious 2019 Kennerspiel des Jahres, akin to the Oscars' best picture award.",medium
You don't have to sell your soul to make something go viral.,medium
"If anything, it involves digging into yourself and finding something that will make a human connection.",medium
"Look around at things that are trending or have multiple views, shares, and comments.",medium
"In every case, it probably has one or more of these five things from Cultural Cartography in common: humor, identity, shared connection, participation, and emotion.",medium
"I write about being unproductive, breaking habits, and getting lots of sleep, AND still getting things done.",medium
And we all have this inner desire to stay on the path and get to where we want to go.,medium
There are several obstacles on the path which need to be overcome.,medium
"In his book Mastery, George Leonard shares some of these obstacles that we may encounter on our journey.",medium
"Of course, we may not be able to overcome all of them.",medium
"However, it's good to know they're there so we can learn to conquer them when they do show up.",medium
What most of us fail to realise is that the journey to becoming the best at anything doesn't exist in a vacuum.,medium
"Instead, we have to dig up our way through a landscape of lively obligations.",medium
"It'd be really convenient if you can simply focus on your craft and forget about everything else; however, that's just not the way it is.",medium
"You have work, relationship, health, spirituality, finance, etc.",medium
"Or if you need to work insanely hard for a few months to get your startup off the ground, yet your health sucks, you simply won't have the energy to do so.",medium
"However, the point is when you're facing resistance in achieving your goals, try to examine and take care of the rest of your life.",medium
"As they say, The chain is only as strong as its weakest point.",medium
Don't let other areas of your life be a hindrance to your goals.,medium
"Instead, work on them so they support you in your path to greatness.",medium
Perhaps the deadliest enemy to our path to greatness can be our obsessive desire for the destination itself.,medium
"Because, when we get overly attached to results, we want to witness quick growth.",medium
"Due to our desire for instant gratification, we start working excessively.",medium
"And all of this pays off, but only for a while.",medium
"But soon, our excessive efforts lead to disappointment and burnout as we don't get the results we desired as fast as we want them.",medium
"It's fine to have ambitious goals but we need to remember that on a day-to-day basis, growth is slow, almost invisible to the short-termed-eye.",medium
"As George says - When you're climbing a mountain, be aware of the peak, but keep your eyes on the path.",medium
"And when you reach the top, as the Zen saying goes, keep on climbing.",medium
The second option is a much quicker and better way to walk the path.,medium
"However, it's important to recognize a good teacher in the first place.",medium
There's a lot of inexperienced noise on the internet trying to teach people how to do something when they don't know how to do it themselves.,medium
"If we listen to such people, we'll surely be walking the wrong path, and end up on the wrong destination.",medium
"First of all, according to George Leonard, instruction is the first key to mastery.",medium
"Hence, find a teacher who knows what they're talking about.",medium
Here are a few tips from George to find a good teacher -Competition,medium
"However, mild competition can be healthy and in fact, a necessary source of inspiration.",medium
"If you don't look around once in a while to see what's possible, how will you even begin to walk the path of doing the impossible?On",medium
"The mindset of Winning isn't everything, it is the only thing is sure to take a toll on your mental health.",medium
"Be competitive, but not to the point that it messes with your mental health.",medium
A simple way to find the balance is to try to sublimate envy into inspiration.,medium
"Hence, whenever you feel envious, try to be inspired instead.",medium
We're animals and we're hardwired to save energy for emergencies.,medium
That is why it's hard to spend energy when it's not a question of survival.,medium
"In fact, from an evolutionary and a mere goal of 'survival' laziness is the best tool you possess.",medium
"However, humanity has outpaced evolution to the point that survival is not much of a concern anymore.",medium
"And forgive me for stating the obvious, but, inaction and laziness are truly the enemies of greatness.",medium
A simple way to overcome laziness is to - and Nike would back me on this - just do it.,medium
"Besides that, I personally like to use two tools to overcome laziness effectively.",medium
Studies show that rewarding gold stars to students initially speed up their learning.,medium
"Ergo, external motivation is not effective when it comes to producing lasting results.",medium
And god knows the journey to greatness is a long and arduous one.,medium
"Which is why, if you're not internally motivated to stay on the path, rewards alone will never be enough to support the long journey.",medium
"It's okay to be motivated by external incentives, however, only if there's a solid foundation of internal motivation.",medium
One of the reasons we may have decided to become the best at something is to look good.,medium
"However, we fail to realise that getting to the point of looking good takes a lot of looking stupid.",medium
"Many times, because we're afraid that we'll fail and that people will know, and hence, we don't even try.",medium
"Since there's no action, there'll be no failure, but there'll also be no lessons.",medium
"Suffice it to say, if we succumb ourselves to vanity, we can bid goodbye to the path to greatness.",medium
"Michael Jordan once said, I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career.",medium
"Twenty-six times, I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed.",medium
I've failed over and over and over again in my life.,medium
"Even at that level, Michel Jordan and other players like him have to fail and look stupid and that too in the sight of millions.",medium
"Hence, it only makes sense that we should be willing to fail and look stupid in front of a few of our friends and colleagues.",medium
The path to greatness at anything is already a tough one to bear.,medium
"And yes, it takes a certain amount of seriousness to keep walking on it.",medium
"However, when we begin to take our goals way too seriously, even minor setbacks and failures can hurt us deeply.",medium
And all of this seriousness leads to a vicious circle where our mental health is chopped into pieces.,medium
There's scientific evidence that shows that laughter helps boost your mental well-being.,medium
"Life is short, and not meant to be taken too seriously.",medium
"In fact, with laughter and fun, the pressure of the difficult journey becomes bearable, and hence the journey becomes easier.",medium
George says - Consistency of practice is the mark of the master.,medium
"Quite obviously, inconsistency leads to loss of practice time and keeps you stuck.",medium
"However, excessive inconsistency might even regress your growth and lead to the dissolution of the progress you had made earlier.",medium
"Interestingly, consistency is actually easier than inconsistency if you follow some basic rules.",medium
"Due to the hyper-connectedness of the world, we're often subjected to what perfect looks like.",medium
A budding artist sees the extraordinary paintings of Van Gogh in a museum.,medium
"We have examples of perfect shoved into our faces when in our journey, we are mediocre at best.",medium
"We may think if we'll never get to perfect, is there even a point at trying?Perfectionism can be paralysing.",medium
We often hold such a high picture to aim to that we're afraid of even starting.,medium
"However, we fail to see that people who have reached those levels were just as mediocre as we are.",medium
They have years and years of hard work and failure before they got to perfect.,medium
"Besides, as we discussed earlier, the journey is not about the destination but the journey itself.",medium
Unlocking your highest potential is about avoiding what chips away at your potential.,medium
We're offering a free course to all of our new subscribers as a thank you for your continued support.,medium
"When you sign up using this link, we'll send you tips on how to boost mental clarity and focus every two days.",medium
"I've gained some valuable experience over the years, resulting in high payouts and consistent performance bonuses.",medium
"The thing is, it doesn't take much to excel in a sales-related position.",medium
"By applying these strategies, even the most mediocre salesperson has a chance of genuine success.",medium
"When working in sales, you must focus on building a relationship with your customers.",medium
It's your job to identify what the client needs before they know they need it.,medium
"To identify the needs of your customer, get to know them better.",medium
"As a rule of thumb, I always ask at least three questions during our transaction: these questions should somehow relate to the customer.",medium
"This is a great question, especially if you have kids, but even if you don't, knowing whether the customer's a parent or not can make a huge difference when personalizing the sale.",medium
Talking about something other than sales is a great idea because it takes pressure away from the sale.,medium
"If you can't find a show to relate to, try recommending something good to watch.",medium
"Above all else, however, people love to talk about themselves, specifically, what they do for their 9-5.",medium
"Sometimes, you'll even discover that your client owns a business, which opens up a whole other world of opportunities.",medium
"If a customer has a poor first impression of you, it could take a while to earn their trust.",medium
"As a rule of thumb, I aim to dress my best every day, whether I'm working or not.",medium
You don't need a fancy suit or an expensive dress to look nice.,medium
"Start with the basics: take showers often, groom yourself, and make sure your clothes are clean and free of stains.",medium
"To make a quality first impression, you must dress nice; however, you could adopt a few other strategies to increase your chances.",medium
"It doesn't matter who I'm dealing with: my customers always leave happy, regardless of how they felt before entering my store.",medium
"I've got regulars that'll stop by to buy something, though I'm 90% sure they're just having a bad day and needed someone to chat with.",medium
"As a rule of thumb, you should always do something to make your customers feel important.",medium
"If you can make somebody feel important, they'll want to be around you more, they'll trust you more, and - most important - they'll buy more from you.",medium
"Most sales positions are commission-based, which means that you're in control of your money.",medium
The amount that you make and your level of success in the field are highly dependent upon whether you know your numbers.,medium
"I make it a habit of mine to review my numbers daily, and I'll ask myself questions like; in what areas am I doing well this month?",medium
How much do I need to sell by the end of the month to hit my quota?,medium
"After asking myself these very crucial questions, I'll move on to design my game plan for the rest of the month.",medium
It's a well-known fact that salespeople like to talk.,medium
"Yet, the most successful individuals understand that in sales, sometimes, the best thing to do is to shut up and let the customer decide.",medium
Say what you need to say and let the customer decide the rest.,medium
"After a successful sales pitch, I always end with, so if you're ready to move forward, I can get the process going.",medium
"Unfortunately, I've seen hundreds of talented salespeople mess this part up by continuing to talk after closing.",medium
It means that your client's thinking - they didn't say no,medium
"But if you take away anything from this post, let it be this:",medium
"I have lived in 4 countries: Portugal, France, the UK, and Hungary.",medium
"Moving to a new country is one of the most exciting, rewarding experiences you can have in life.",medium
"It pushes your boundaries, it forces you to grow, and it turns you into a much richer person.",medium
"But, let's be honest, it can also be hard.",medium
"Leaving behind your comfort, your home, your people, is something only the brave do.",medium
But even the brave ones can use a little help when making such a move.,medium
"Here are my tips to ease the transition to a new life, coming from personal experience.",medium
"In the 50s and 60s, thousands of Portuguese men and women crossed borders illegally, trying to reach France, where they heard life was much better.",medium
"For some of them, life in the new country corresponded to their imagination.",medium
"But we live in the 21st century, you can do much better than just having a vague idea of the place you are moving to.",medium
"Type on Google moving to Berlin , or wherever you're going, and you will find a gazillion pages with useful tips.",medium
Take a step further and join Facebook groups of expats in your destination city.,medium
"I have received some messages from people moving to places where I lived, and I always answer their questions in detail.",medium
I know how important this is for them because I was in their shoes once.,medium
"Depending on where you move to, it might be a nightmare, or a dream come true.",medium
"My sister lived in France, where she worked as a 3D artist, with a one-year contract.",medium
They demand stable jobs and high incomes to even start thinking about letting someone near their property.,medium
"All they required from me was my ID - no work contract, no bank statement, nothing.",medium
There are a few things to consider when renting a place in a new country:This will take time but it will transform your whole experience for the better.,medium
"A place is about the life you live in it, and life is better with friends.",medium
"When I lived in the UK, I overlooked the power of community.",medium
I focused on my relationship at the time and had very few friends outside that circle.,medium
"But now, living in Budapest, I created my own circles.",medium
I have Hungarian friends who introduce me to the culture and help me learn Hungarian.,medium
"And I have my expat friends, who share the feeling of being a foreigner in Hungary.",medium
"One of the scariest feelings you can have in a foreign country is to think that, if you get sick, there is nobody to help you.",medium
"Create strong relationships with some people, so you feel the constant support if you need it.",medium
"Even if you do all the necessary preparation, you still need to give yourself time to adjust to the new reality.",medium
"In the first few months, you will feel overwhelmed with all the tasks you need to do.",medium
"When I moved to Hungary, going to the supermarket was a tiring adventure.",medium
"The feeling you have on a trip, where everything is new and exciting, is one of the things that make holidays memorable.",medium
Treat these first few months in the new life as a long holiday.,medium
"Don't expect to feel at home immediately, don't get mad because you can't sort out everything alone, and don't push yourself when you get homesick.",medium
Moving to a new country is something you should at least once in your lifetime.,medium
"It opens up your mind and spirit in ways you never even realized were possible, and it transforms your views on life and the world.",medium
"It's a deeply personal journey, but it is also an experience shared by millions of other people who have switched their home countries for a life across the border.",medium
"Follow their footsteps whenever you get lost, for a better chance to find your own path.",medium
I start this article by making a minor excuse: the title you see above is not 100% true.,medium
"There are exceptions, subordinated to specific contexts, where expatriates become like a native.",medium
"However, two points make these exceptions.1st - The United Kingdom and France are neighbors with centuries of cultural, social, and economical entanglement.",medium
"And if you arrived here in this article, congratulations: you already know how to go through the worst phases of your new life.",medium
"The German firm Archer Relocation designed the Expat Adjustment Curve, where the first stages remind what I described in a previous article, but with a different end:​The fundamental difference here is the sixth phase.",medium
Whoever reaches the Integration overcame the culture shock (this article help you with it) and recovered to run the show in their new life.,medium
"As much as achieving this stage of adaptation is a brilliant victory, there are different levels of it.",medium
We can break down the concept of integration into 4 different types.,medium
"They add their contribution both as supply, by their products, and demand, by their consumption.",medium
"Skilled expats often achieve this type quickly, but for students or non-working spouses, it can take longer.",medium
"Although the personal efforts to achieve social integration are important, how fast you will achieve depends also on how friendly is the population.",medium
"To reach a full cultural integration, it is indispensable to have a good understanding of the local language and go across all its components (music, literature, beliefs, and celebrations).",medium
"Cultural integration can be even harder than social integration if your original country and the new one are from different civilizational foundations, for example, India and Eastern Europe.",medium
I may take longer to explain emotional integration because it is essential for understanding this entire article.,medium
This term is almost untranslatable but fits very well in this description.,medium
"We may define Saudade as the presence of absence, the yearning for something or someone that right now is unreachable, and whose absence creates a void in your inner self.",medium
It is not only missing and does not have a completely negative meaning because it brings sadness and joy together.,medium
"It is, as deciphered by older generations, the love that remains.",medium
We can translate a partial emotional integration as loving your new country and shaping your personality by its influences.,medium
"The fully integrated, however, will go beyond this and not feel any Saudade from his origins.",medium
"If you are already living abroad for some time, you probably are thinking how far you are in those four different dimensions.",medium
The good news is that you don't need to achieve all of them.,medium
"In Chile, I was very well-integrated economically, socially, and culturally.",medium
I didn't need to do much effort since they are close to Brazil in all those components.,medium
"That is why in Poland, to reach the same level of assimilation from Chile, it took much longer.",medium
"In Qatar, I achieved economic integration, but the social and cultural aspects were distant from my daily life.",medium
"Even though I had part of my personality changed by every country that I lived in, my core is still the same, and it is Brazilian.",medium
"Therefore, differently than the British mentioned in the initial paragraphs of this story, I am still not 100% emotionally integrated, and maybe I will never be.",medium
"In an article of Humanity in Action Denmark, I read two stories that exemplify it.",medium
"One from Savas Coskun and the other from Sabeena Din, who moved, respectively, from Turkey and Pakistan to Denmark.",medium
To make the best efforts to integrate into a new country is not only good for you.,medium
"If you plan or already have children, this will have an enormous positive impact on them.",medium
"Descendants of first-generation, well-assimilated immigrants growing up in the company of local children will carry the advantage of youth years shaping them when compared to their parents.",medium
"This will allow them to adjust (economically, culturally, socially, and emotionally) to a much greater degree.​ Even doing your best attempts, still there is a chance you will never be like a native",medium
"Even after learning the language, you still will speak with an accent that will persist for decades.",medium
"You will still have your tastes for food, music, and traces in your personality shaped in your fatherland.",medium
"If you are moving to a homogeneous country like some in Asia or Eastern Europe, you will also be the person looking different.​",medium
I have some splendid news for you: all those things can turn into opportunities.,medium
Your varied taste for food and music can give way to very interesting conversation topics.,medium
Your accent and knowledge of a foreign language can be useful to understand the so common loanwords from a globalized world.,medium
Those holidays you celebrated back in your country can double the opportunities for fun.,medium
This is a point that people miss when trying to understand how to adapt to a new culture.,medium
The same would be if a westerner moved to Thailand and mastered Thai.,medium
"Inside homogeneous countries, with a quick look people will know you are a foreigner and while this may scary some expatriates, it is a significant chance to surprise and earn the local admiration.",medium
Nobody likes the arrogant expatriate that prefers to show off his differences at every point while despising the social and cultural features of his new home.,medium
"On the other side, the complete opposite of him-the expatriate wishing to cut his roots and be like a local in every aspect- also risks entering a road to frustration because of unachievable goals.",medium
"In countries where people expect you to be just another foreigner without interests in common, you will be in high-regard if you go beyond their expectations.",medium
Levi Borba is the CEO of expatriateconsultancy.com and a best-selling author.,medium
"The inspiration for this article comes from the book Moving Out, Working Abroad, and Keeping Your Sanity.",medium
"AS MATT PLACED THE GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE IN FRONT OF HER, he said, You need to stay here today.",medium
"He was drinking out of an espresso cup with a thin gold band around the rim, holding it daintily above her head.",medium
"She could smell his aftershave, the prep-school essence of synthetic roses and a splash of lavender.",medium
It was the smell of soft hands that picked up nothing other than the cheque at a restaurant.,medium
The sunshine reflected dully off his immaculate white shirt as he sat opposite her and needlessly adjusted his cufflinks.,medium
"He wanted to draw attention to them, how heavy they looked.",medium
"His voice signposted the class of company he kept, the kind of muted executive swagger one collects when ascending multiple wage brackets.",medium
"He was still undoubtedly Australian, but an educated one: he pronounced his t's as t's and didn't slice off the ends of his words.",medium
"It was war-ter not waw-dah, and it was going and not goin'.",medium
"I need to go out and do something, you can't just keep me stuck in here.",medium
What could I do to get myself in trouble at ten in the morning?,medium
"Matt raised his eyebrows as if to say, You'll think of something.",medium
"Of course he didn't say this, and smoothly redirected conversation: I've got a meeting today at eleven.",medium
"You aren't needed for any of it, but I do need you to stay here.",medium
"For a moment Hannah wanted to throw the glass at his face, watch it explode over his glossy expensive skin.",medium
"Blood and orange juice would splatter all over his blue suit, a grand's worth of tailoring ruined and the potential for permanent facial damage.",medium
"It was a promising idea, but she thought better of it and instead picked at the sleeve of her - Matt's - dressing gown.",medium
"They both knew what happened when thoughts like these became regrettable, irreversible actions.",medium
"I didn't bring a book with me, and it's not like you've got any good ones here.",medium
"Hannah hooked a thumb over her shoulder toward the bookshelf, which was mostly empty.",medium
"Matt's eyes narrowed and seemed to darken, a sharp transition from hazel to black that Hannah found disquieting.",medium
"I didn't ask you here for your opinion, he said.",medium
"Matt laid his ankle on his knee and placed his hands on his calf, one smooth motion that suggested it had been performed on repeat occasions.",medium
"I like my own space, so I'd prefer it if you weren't here.",medium
"You always did stay in your room a lot, Hannah said.",medium
"I think you still like living inside your own head, the only difference now that you've got a big fuck-off apartment to hide out in.",medium
You say that as though all this just fell into my lap.,medium
"Well with the job you've got, yeah, seems that way.",medium
"You earn more in a year than I reckon I would in four lifetimes, and I really can't say what exactly the fuck it is you do, Matt.",medium
He looked into his espresso cup as though a fly were drowning in it.,medium
Hannah remembered that he had always been fascinated by small animals in enclosed spaces.,medium
She certainly felt like one in this apartment: the floor-to-ceiling windows made it feel like a fish tank.,medium
"Matt finally emptied his cup with one quick sip, and as he stood up the steel chair grunted quietly across the wooden floorboards.",medium
"He checked the time on a small Omega with a blue dial, an ocean on his wrist.",medium
Matt said nothing and she retorted to his silence by draining the glass.,medium
Matt took his espresso cup and walked to the narrow island of marble planted beside the kitchen table.,medium
"He placed the cup in the sink and, flicking the tap on, a soft white bolt of water exploded the residual coffee grains out of the bottom.",medium
"He wiped his hands on a tea towel, even though they weren't wet.",medium
"He grabbed his bag off the kitchen counter, threaded his hands through his jacket.",medium
"It was ten am, only ten am, and the day felt vastly unpromising.",medium
"She had been here two days in this shiny white purgatory, channel-hopping and eating away the hours with Indian takeaways charged to Matt's credit card.",medium
"Their words were quick, each voice sewn together by the same questions: where to have lunch, where to drink that night.",medium
Saturday had at once become available and these were the men could afford it.,medium
"Striped ties, some silver, some red, the colours of metal and ore.",medium
"Matt emerged from the tide with a small blue ripple at his side, while the mass of high-quality tailoring flowed in the other direction.",medium
"Aw, pretty shit, Matt replied, wiping his nose with the back of his wrist as they rolled further along the corridor.",medium
"Just sits on her arse all day watchin' TV, makin' a bloody mess most of the time.",medium
"In under a minute the two men were sixty-four floors below, rolling over the lobby like a high wave toward the shore.",medium
The revolving doors spun beneath tall black letters printed across the windows: RIO TINTO MINING,medium
"The men pooled once again and spoke of food, of drink, before flowing backwards into the tarmac stream of St Georges Terrace.",medium
"The ripple thumbed a message on its iPhone and asked, What'd she do again?",medium
"Got pissed and spilled the beans about Danny and Sara, told everyone how long they'd been havin' a go with each other.",medium
"The ripple looked up from his phone for a moment, saw Matt staring hard ahead, breathing through his nose, and returned to the screen.",medium
"What was it, your mate Danny had fucked the bride or some shit like that?",medium
"I tell ya what, royally fucked up things between Ben and Sally -",medium
All because my shit-for-brains cousin can't handle her drink.,medium
"Matt looked down to his feet and watched the warped reflection of the sky moving in his polished shoes, thinking of Hannah in his apartment.",medium
"Ah, Mum's got the idea in her head that I've got more money than I know what to do with.",medium
"Reckons I should use it to take in me cousin, look after me own kind, y'know?",medium
Matt chewed on the inside of his cheek and breathed through his nose.,medium
"The street ahead was clustered with small packs of thin men in tight suits, the crests of shiny dark hair flipping back in the wind.",medium
"The more athletic ones dared to open a second button, a tuft of chest hair inhaling the cooler air outside the slim-fit shirt.",medium
A beggar seated outside a supermarket asked for change and was summarily ignored.,medium
"None of these men lifted a finger from their iPhones or turned their head a single degree from the tanned, unlined faces of their peers.",medium
"The way I see it, Matt said, hand stuffed in his pocket, it takes a load off",medium
"Besides, it's not like Auntie Gina wants a fuckin' thing to do with her",medium
"I mean, it's not like she can stay with any of her friends.",medium
"The only ones she had were at that party, and now they won't fuckin' touch her with a four-foot pole.",medium
"Matt continued walking for a few moments, thinking of how badly he wanted a smoke right now, before realising the small ripple had left his peripheral vision.",medium
"The creator of the Bullet Journal is Ryder Carroll, an American digital product designer and art director.",medium
And what you may not know (yet) is that he initially created this method to better structure his learning efforts while he was still in college in the late 1990s.,medium
In 2013 he started sharing his own life-hack on his website.,medium
"As he explains it his website went viral in the summer of 2013, since then he has turned his personal routine into a full-time job.",medium
"It is indeed even more surprising with today's perspective, as bullet journaling has become a widespread routine for many persons who want to better structure their daily life and achieve their life goals.",medium
I am not talking about a minority of people who have a special interest in personal development.,medium
"As I have just started my 2021 Bullet Journal, I would like to share with you the 3 main reasons why I have taken up this daily habit.",medium
I used to write all kind of things that seem important to me on several writing supports:,medium
It made me lose track of the content but also the priority levels of my various bullet-point lists.,medium
One advantage of a bullet journal is that it gathers all your thoughts in one place.,medium
Anything that is written in your BuJo is something less to keep in mind.,medium
Hence you will get more free head space and you will be able to - literally - keep an eye on all your notes.,medium
"By pushing you to write down any kind of ideas, thought and to-dos, bullet journaling helps you organizing your thoughts and getting them out of your head.",medium
The second reason why 2021 is the perfect year to start writing your own bullet journal is that it represents a fresh start.,medium
As reported by the WHO in October 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted or halted critical mental health services in 93% of countries worldwide while the demand for mental health is increasing .Bullet,medium
"Personally I revised my ambitions and re-ordered my priorities this year, as I experienced unexpected changes in my life during 2020.",medium
"Finally, one of the big advantages of bullet journaling is that it suits you and you only.",medium
"There are many tools available that you can use to fill your bullet journal (e.g. future log, vision board, mood tracker): you decide which ones are best for you.",medium
The incredible variety of bullet journaling supplies makes your personal journal necessarily customized.,medium
"Whether you choose to buy a ready-to-use bullet journal or you decide to build your own journal from scratch, what ultimately matters is that it corresponds to your special needs.",medium
"At the end of 2021, you will reflect on what you achieved during this year.",medium
"Not only will you see all the crossed out items, you will also have gathered a picture of your own personality during this year.",medium
Suzuki Roshi's quote and that of his colleague are about karma and the nature of problems.,medium
"When the tiger is hunting, he is totally focused on the job at hand.",medium
"If a problem arises he deals with it then, not later, and eats.",medium
"Some days he eats well, others not, but with each hunt he eats something.",medium
It is easy to procrastinate about problems especially if they are minor.,medium
Maybe you made a small promise to a friend but didn't get around to doing it.,medium
Maybe you put off a bill because 'it's not that important'.,medium
These small things can blow up into major problems if you let them by simply not taking action when they are manageable.,medium
"When I started freelancing, for example, I would often procrastinate until I found myself up against a deadline with no ideas and too much work ahead of me.",medium
"I occasionally lost a job because of it and worse, a client.",medium
"So I made a personal rule: I always start a writing job right away, even if it is only opening a browser tab and starting a doc with a project name.",medium
That way it is staring me in my face every time I open the browser.,medium
The tab doesn't get closed until the job is billed or published.,medium
"Doing things for people when they need them, not on my schedule.",medium
"Don't get me wrong, it took a long time to figure out that using your whole strength on small things helps you avoid needing it for really hard things later.",medium
"I had three months to write a trade paperback, about 80,000 words.",medium
I couldn't get started even though the entire thing was outlined on a page by page basis.,medium
And every day that mouse was turning into a giant cow I had to kill and eat.,medium
My worrying was as much about my reputation as it was about the project.,medium
"I started writing more and more and I made my deadline, and got paid.",medium
"But the payment was not the big thing, nor was the book.",medium
There is a notion that karma has to do with good deeds.,medium
"I think it has to do with being an honorable person, a respected person with a good reputation.",medium
Suzuki Roshi was a revered Zen teacher who was instrumental in raising awareness of Zen Buddhism in America.,medium
"Shunryu Suzuki came later* and one of the most famous books about Zen, Zen Mind Beginner's Mind consists of his short lectures to his students at the San Francisco Zen Center.",medium
"Almost the entire focus of Zen, and Buddhism at its core, is living in this moment at all times.",medium
Meditation is a practice at doing this and Buddhism is itself far more of a training regimen than a conventional religion.,medium
"And karma, the law of cause and effect, is central to this training model.",medium
When you address the situation at hand instead of putting it off you are living in the present and you will see the nature of karma.,medium
"It's not some mysterious Asian concept, it is a core aspect of life.",medium
"Your actions now determine the direction of your life, even the small ones.*Interesting anecdote: When Shunryu was asked about D.T., he said, He is the big Suzuki, I am the small Suzuki .",medium
"Moreover, it's an investment that Scandinavian governments, and citizens, take very seriously.",medium
"After all, a secret to a happy adulthood is in a happy childhood.",medium
"Perhaps, it's one of the main reasons why these Northern European countries top the list of the world's happiest nations year after year.",medium
Since the birth of my (Danish-American) daughter I've been giving a lot of thought to the major differences in how Danish and American societies accommodate their children's needs.,medium
Here are just a few things that I noticed Danish parents prioritize for their kids.,medium
My Danish husband and I were walking through Brooklyn's Prospect Park when we noticed a boy of around 5 years old leaning over a rail of a small bridge in curiosity.,medium
"Neither of us paid much attention, until we noticed a woman who suddenly stopped and stood frozen, eyeing the boy and nervously looking around, searching for his parents.",medium
"I could tell she was getting agitated when, luckily, a busy-with-two-other-kids mother appeared and asked her son to step down.",medium
"The stranger lady barely held back from making a comment and walked away, shaking her head.",medium
"Not only was she a neurotic New Yorker, but also a fear-driven American, to whom a child exploring alone in the park, even if for a minute, is a dangerous game.",medium
"While I wasn't surprised at all, my husband was perplexed by the woman's reaction.",medium
"He said that no one in Denmark would think the boy was in danger, trusting him to be careful and mindful of his actions.",medium
Danish children are treated with respect and allowed to make their own mistakes.,medium
"And since getting hurt is a part of life, you might as well teach your kids about that right from the start, their parents say.",medium
"Forget children wearing helmets in rubber-floor playgrounds, so often seen in America.",medium
"For them, playing with saws and hammers, making fire or climbing trees with minimum supervision or interference are all perfectly normal activities, meant to make them resilient and life-proof.",medium
"While certainly no one wants to see their child get hurt, fear-driven parenting, so common in the U.S., is not always the best solution to keeping our kids safe.",medium
Teaching them common sense and trusting them to do the right thing might be a much better investment in the long term.,medium
"When I think of my childhood, I remember occasional bike rides as some of my happiest and most adventurous moments.",medium
One of the things that struck me the most upon my arrival in Denmark's capital was the number of bicycles in the streets.,medium
"No one in Copenhagen seemed to be without a bike, including children.",medium
"The youngest ones were pedaled around by their parents, the rest biked on their own along the city's many bike roads and paths.",medium
"Since bicycling everywhere is a big part of Danish culture, children are taught to ride at an early age and cycling lessons and exams are a part of the school curriculum.",medium
"Due to fantastically developed biking infrastructure, riding a bike in Denmark is stress and danger-free, making it the healthiest, and happiest, way to commute.",medium
"Even in Copenhagen, children of all ages use bicycles to get to their schools, arriving rosy-cheeked and energized.",medium
"Unfortunately, commuting by bike is not a safe option for most children, or even adults, in the U.S., especially those living in the cities.",medium
"Yet it's still possible to incorporate cycling into kids' lives by seeking out safe and accessible routes, even if only on weekends.",medium
"When my 10 year old step-daughter joined a (well-ranked) public school in Brooklyn, she asked me why schools in New York looked like jails.",medium
"Bleak corridors, colorless rooms, barred windows, lack of fresh air, metal fences around the building - nothing about her school was cozy, the word so loved in her home country.",medium
"Back in Denmark, famous for its architecture, my step-daughters' public school looked like a building out of a design magazine.",medium
"It wasn't a repurposed structure, as it's often the case in America, but a well thought-through environment, meant to stimulate children's development and growth.",medium
"There were areas for play and relaxation, nooks for reading, and various outdoor spaces for playing and studying.",medium
"It reflected the Danish belief that growing up, especially for younger kids, is not about academic success but about playing, exploring, taking risks and connecting with the outdoors.",medium
"Likewise, Danish playgrounds are world-famous and known for their unique and creative designs.",medium
"Everywhere you look, children's environment in Denmark is given a lot of thought.",medium
"While not all schools in America look, and feel, like jails, many of them do resemble institutions for mini-adults, rather than those for kids.",medium
"And while we can't always control the American school system, we can make sure that at least children's home environment is full of coziness and opportunities for relaxation.",medium
"Open windows, gentle lights, warm colors, soft blankets and hiding nooks don't cost a lot and can give your child that sense of comfort",medium
This is a belief that parents in all Northern European countries share.,medium
"Despite, or because of, their infamous climate, Scandinavians are obsessed with fresh air.",medium
"Babies sleep outside in their strollers for hours each day, even in the coldest months.",medium
"Bundled up, they gradually develop resistance to cold, while receiving all the benefits of fresh air.",medium
"In general, people across all Scandinavia believe that connecting with nature and the outdoors of any kind is an essential part of growing up healthy and happy.",medium
"In Danish kindergartens and schools children spend a lot, if not all, of their time outside, in any weather, both playing but studying.",medium
"Forest schools, where children's entire study is conducted in a forest, originated in Denmark and is now quickly gaining traction around the world.",medium
"On the contrary, in her Brooklyn school, my step-daughter often spent her days in poorly, if at all, ventilated rooms, with short outdoor breaks and alarmingly short recess times.",medium
"And while not much can be done to take the lessons, or at least play, outside in any weather in American schools, there are many opportunities to increase our kids' outdoor time.",medium
"After all, fresh air is the best, and cheapest, way to improve moods and overall productivity in children.",medium
"As for my own family, while we certainly struggle to maintain our lifestyle since arriving in the U.S., we're aware of the differences and gaps that need to be filled in.",medium
"And I'll find a way for her to bike daily, even if it means that there won't be a Starbucks around the corner for me.",medium
"When I first started selling online courses in 2018, I thought all I needed was a blog, some course modules, and a few emails before I started making sales.",medium
"At the time, I saw so many influencers and entrepreneurs selling courses about everything from Pinterest, email marketing, social media, and more.",medium
I realized the world was moving online and figured it was now or never to bet on myself.,medium
"If you didn't know, the online course business is booming.",medium
"While I'm getting the hang of it now, I'll be the first to say it's nothing like you think.",medium
"But at the same time, it is 100% possible, if you have the right strategy.",medium
"While I am not a six or seven-figure course creator (yet), I have had some success and keep learning from several seven-figure mentors like James Wedmore.",medium
"If you're someone who wants to start selling online courses, here is what you need to get started.",medium
The number one thing you need to sell online courses is experience in what you're selling.,medium
This obviously gives the e-learning industry a bad name and can taint digital courses to buyers in general.,medium
"While you need experience, I want you to know that you don't need to be world-class or the best in your field to succeed.",medium
"While mastery is great, you really just need to be a few steps ahead of your ideal audience.",medium
You do not need to have a fancy degree or decades of experience to sell online courses.,medium
Thinking that you do is probably why you haven't created an online course yet.,medium
You just need to be able to help others get results more than anything else.,medium
"Personally, I think it's your obligation to share what you know with the world, especially if people are asking you for it.",medium
"For example, when I quit my job in 2017 I had only made $200 ever from my blog.",medium
"Eventually, people started asking me how I did it and wanted to learn how they could as well.",medium
"Now, I have a program that teaches people how to do just that and several have already quit their jobs as well!",medium
"If I never took the time to create my program, tons of other writers would still be struggling to build an online business and stuck in jobs they hate.",medium
"While you need expertise in your subject, this isn't enough anymore as there is more competition.",medium
"In the past few years, online courses have become more common, which means there is more competition in pretty much every niche imaginable.",medium
"But competition is not a bad thing, instead, realize people clearly are interested and use it as an opportunity to stand out.",medium
"Now, it's not about creating more content to prove you're an expert either.",medium
And your personality isn't going to differentiate you from competitors either.,medium
"Instead, you need a unique framework or methodology to help get people results.",medium
"A unique framework does three things:By coming up with a framework or methodology, it forces you to get clear about what a new student would need to get results.",medium
"It will also help you create the roadmap for success by taking a 30,000-foot view of what worked for you and basically hand them the blueprint for success.",medium
"For example, there are a ton of different writers out there promoting a freelance writing course.",medium
"To differentiate myself from all the others, I created my own unique system called The Confident Writer Framework.",medium
This is a three-part system that I used and have taught my students to help them speed up their writing success.,medium
"Second, it will help you make unique content in your niche and pre-sell your product.",medium
"Finally, it will help you differentiate from others in your niche.",medium
A unique framework will help you stand out from your competitors and make it easy to spot if anyone is trying to copy your program.,medium
"Once you have a unique framework, people will associate that with you and your brand.",medium
"Once you have nailed down your framework, it's time to start building your email list.",medium
"If you think you can depend on social media followers for consistent course sales, you are dead wrong.",medium
"With social media, you are only one internet apocalypse away from losing everything.",medium
"Every successful course creator I know makes an overwhelming majority of their sales from their email list, not social media followers.",medium
You can't rely on social media as they are a third party platform (just like writers shouldn't rely 100% on Medium followers).,medium
"If the president of the United States can get removed from Twitter and Facebook, no one is safe.",medium
You need to build your email list so that you control your list and are protected in case your social media accounts get shut down.,medium
Here's how I keep building my email list:Please notice that I put content strategy after email list.,medium
So many course creators start putting out social media content before having a list and are missing out on tons of subscribers.,medium
"Instead, sign up for email software before releasing content so you can capture as many leads as possible.",medium
"Once you do, then you should start putting out content that attracts your ideal audience.",medium
"Also, when it comes to content creation, don't try to be Gary Vee either.",medium
You don't need to be on every single platform 15X per day to become a successful course creator.,medium
I know because I tried to become omnipresent and it led to burnout and little results.,medium
"While I might schedule some old content on Pinterest or Twitter, I focus more on my big two than anything else.",medium
"When it comes to creating content, use these strategies:Once you've nailed your content strategy, you need to find a way to sell your offer.",medium
Gone are the days of posting a course to a page on your website and hoping people will just find it and then somehow magically buy it.,medium
"Trust me, I know from first-hand experience this doesn't work.",medium
"Instead, you need to do launches to grow your email list, gain awareness about your offer, and get it in front of people.",medium
"Personally, I love webinar launches, but it's probably because I'm the most familiar with them and been a writer for EasyWebinar for two-plus years.",medium
But there are myriad ways to run launches including:Pick one that resonates with you and give it a shot.,medium
"If you like the launch vehicle, keep doing it over and over again.",medium
"Don't try it once, have a bad launch, and then switch to a new style.",medium
"Instead, learn from your mistakes and keep tweaking a few times before looking for a new strategy.",medium
"Finally, you need tons of patience selling courses and can't expect to make it overnight.",medium
"When I first started selling online courses, I was under the impression that I was one funnel away from millions of dollars and massive success.",medium
"While I'm all about staying positive, if you try to rush the process, you'll never make it.",medium
"One of my mentors, James Wedmore, preaches patience and is a shining example of how patience and consistency can pay off.",medium
"His signature program, Business by Design, made around $19,000 on his first launch a few years ago.",medium
"Fast-forward to June 2020, he had a $5,000,000+ launch selling the same product.",medium
"If you're an expert in pretty much anything, you can build an online business around your passion and help others succeed.",medium
"Not only is this a great way to work at home, but your work can actually mean something too.",medium
"Sure, making money online is great but helping people achieve their goals is even better.",medium
"When you get emails from students telling you how much your program changed their lives, it's addictive.",medium
It's fun to know that you're making a difference and positively impacting others.,medium
I never had any of this fulfillment from my boring corporate job and am grateful for everyone who works with me.,medium
"While it won't happen overnight, I promise selling your expertise is 100% worth it.",medium
People out there are waiting for you to share your gifts with the world.,medium
"Short bursts of breath slowly re-oxygenate my red backlit eyes, coating the rear hemisphere of my brain.",medium
His dirty tan hoodie plainly visible against the contrasting Prussian blue of the night.,medium
"The serial lamps on the streets creating ignominious globules of visibility that told me to stay away out of sight, use the cover of darkness.",medium
Doors used by students to leave after a late night at the lab.,medium
I gave up on the windows after the first few revealed they only opened about 2 inches.,medium
"If I stay away from the lights, I might make it.",medium
"I exit on to the side street, walking quickly, head down.",medium
I look down the next street and a surge of bile constricts my throat.,medium
"He's there, looking around, mapping routes in his head, searching.",medium
Thuds of panic slam in my head like tall church windows crashing in waves.,medium
"I can hear his sneakered feet, the sound pulsing up in amplitude as he reduces the distance between us.",medium
"Water from my eyes and nose mix with sweat as I hang my head down, wanting to disappear into the earth.",medium
"My face slams shut, like a ventriloquist's dummy that has consumed its master.",medium
"There is no language, no words, that could come remotely close to a satisfactory articulation.",medium
"I feel beaten, dehydrated like a dead flower stuck in a claustrophobic library book.",medium
The skies were clearer than they had been for months the day they arrived.,medium
There was no large spinning disk in the sky that shot laser beams.,medium
"Every now and then, it'd stop, send out a light on an area, and move on.",medium
"He tried to pull me up by my arm to join the ones who ran down the other side of the hill, screaming.",medium
"My friends Jules, Madrona, and Shelly were still on the hill watching the ship go this way and that in the sky.",medium
"You can go if you want, I said firmly, but I'm staying.",medium
I made the face my mother said reminded her of my grandfather who I never met but heard was an awful man.,medium
His brown skin blushed deep shades as he looked away from the girls and me and the UFO skating through the air.,medium
"Yeah, Shelly chirped in, but not to humiliate Billy, her back-porch boyfriend.",medium
"That thing looks lost not deadly, B. Maybe it needs directions.",medium
"Grass and dirt stained her rainbow shorts, but she didn't care because it was only grass and dirt.",medium
No one noticed but me that she shot him in wink under the glare of the sun.,medium
"It was gross, annoying, cute, everything they were, and I was not.",medium
They were whispering about whatever girls like them whisper about and nothing else matter.,medium
Shelly left Billy sore and smiling on the ground to return to calling the UFO over.,medium
"There was a small space between Shelly and Madrona, I took it and watched to see if the cube would come anywhere near us.",medium
"It's not about being scared, Billy said from the dirt.",medium
Dad says it's about being smarter than the idiot before you.,medium
"Well, I don't think there's any idiots before us.",medium
"I'd say we are the first to experience this, I said.",medium
"Shelly listened to Jules and ignored Billy as she sat back down, frowning.",medium
"Yeah, filled with people like us but better, smarter, kinder.",medium
"Yeah, dude, way to steal someone's idea and while the world is witnessing its final day.",medium
"The sunscreen on her skin shined brightly, reflecting the lights now whirling from the floating cube.",medium
"This time instead of trying to yank me up, he went for Shelly.",medium
The look in Shelly's eyes was enough for Billy to release her and put his hands in his pockets.,medium
"Suddenly, the cube shot out a strong light that blinded me and knocked me on my ass.",medium
"When I came to, it was gone, and Shelly was staring at Billy the way she does when they're alone",medium
Jules was ripping grass from the dirt and tossing it to get caught in the wind while Madrona examined her body.,medium
"Billy said, quickly getting up to his feet and helping Shelly up.",medium
Jules stood up with a handful of grass in her hand and dumped it on Madrona's head.,medium
"I feel that, Jules said, gazing down over the town.",medium
He pulled Shelly closer and began to walk toward our home on the other side of the hill.,medium
"Yeah, alright, Shelly said, letting him lead her away.",medium
I glanced back to see if there was anything I could see different about the town.,medium
I followed it down the hill toward the world and away from my home.,medium
"Aigner Loren Wilson is a queer Black SFWA, HWA, and Codex writer.",medium
She was listed on the honors list for the Otherwise Fellowship award for 2019.,medium
"Her work has appeared in Tor Nightfire, Rue Morgue, Arsenika, and more.",medium
She offers a writing craft newsletter to people who want to become better writers and publish quality pieces.,medium
"Sometimes I even wondered whether he was adopted, because there's no way that he shared the same blood as the rest of my family.",medium
For starters he didn't go to college like the rest of them.,medium
Let's just say the gap year he took after completing high school still hasn't ended.,medium
"At 18, along with two friends, he went backpacking across the country.",medium
"For 3 months, no one had the slightest idea where he was or how he was doing.",medium
"He turned up at the front door after a few months with his hair bunched up into a man bun, sporting a rugged thick beard and no footwear.",medium
"My grandmother, who would be considered archaic even in the 1800's, nearly had a heart attack seeing him this way.",medium
"To date, she still holds him responsible for her heart condition.",medium
"Unconcerned, he borrowed some money from my granddad and disappeared again for a few weeks.",medium
"The next they heard of him, he had set up a bookstore somewhere in Delhi.",medium
Kabir (he insisted I call him by name) was perhaps the only one in my family who treated me like an adult.,medium
"Nothing was ever off the table when I was with him, so you can imagine the number of times",medium
"Kabir always had a story to share, either from his school days, his trips, hikes or even just some of his past experiences.",medium
Like when he bunked a week of school just to watch the India-Australia test match or when he smoked weed with a group of monks he met on his hike in Manali.,medium
"I saw him as the epitome of 'cool', my mother saw him as a bad influence.",medium
I think both these points of view are pretty self-explanatory.,medium
The words 'gap year' were taboo in my house because of Kabir.,medium
"Kabir would spend half his time hunched over a book, and the other half bent over his type-writer.",medium
"Yes, he was one of those people who still owned a type-writer.",medium
"Not because he didn't believe in technology or anything, just because he felt a type-writer brought a certain aesthetic and made him seem smarter than he actually is.",medium
"I remember one day, back when I was in the 10th grade",medium
This was the first reason I loved him; he made me read The Kite Runner.,medium
"And he was right, it did change my life, because that was the book that made me want to be a writer.",medium
"His words were all that he had, there was no place this man could have worked than at a bookstore.",medium
Between The Lines was a bookstore which was as quirky as its owner.,medium
"It didn't only serve as a bookstore, but also as a library of sorts.",medium
You could borrow books from Between the Lines and keep it for however long,medium
It was a system that was similar to a game I had played back in 5th grade.,medium
"One student would go to the front of the class and start telling a story, then they'd be stopped midway and the next student had to takeover from them and continue the story.",medium
"Each time a person borrowed a book, they'd have to tell a story, not in front of everyone, but write a page out on the laptop by the store exit.",medium
The next person who borrowed a book would have to continue it from where it was left off on the laptop.,medium
"At the end of each month, Kabir would compile it all and get it printed.",medium
I'd always lurk around the laptop and the minute a person finished writing I would go read it.,medium
The people I'd least expected to have any sort of writing prowess would write stories that would blow my mind.,medium
Everyone who's had a childhood has a story to share Kabir always said.,medium
The books at BTL weren't arranged according to genres or sections.,medium
"You could find Kane and Abel seated comfortably next to a Steve Jobs autobiography, or a Dan Brown thriller",medium
Another thing about Between The Lines was that no song that was played in the store could ever be repeated.,medium
"Now, this was both a blessing and a boon for me.",medium
"If I liked a song, I had to find its name immediately otherwise my chances of hearing it again would be next to none.",medium
"We used to go to Delhi only in the summers, so I'd spend a large part of my vacation reading in Between the Lines.",medium
"I used to spend long hours curled up in a corner, hunched over some book.",medium
"The bookstore also held some special memories of mine, including my first kiss.",medium
"I knew every nook and cranny of the place, and knew where exactly each book was.",medium
I guess this was why Kabir would have me work at the store from time to time.,medium
"BTL didn't have a large customer base, so I got a lot of time to just sit and write.",medium
"Trust me, there are few experiences as liberating as writing in a bookstore.",medium
"It's quite ineffable to describe the feeling, but it used to make me feel oddly superior.",medium
"Palakh walked into my life in the same way she walked into the store; with poise, grace and purpose.",medium
"She popped by the counter and asked, Hey, do you have Private Peaceful by Michael Morpurgo by any chance? .",medium
"Being the charming, suave man I am, I replied quite eloquently, Uhhh..",medium
That was the first time a girl had left me tongue tied.,medium
"She took Morpurgo on the first day, Archer on the second and my heart on the third.",medium
"Aside from her name, there wasn't much I really knew about her.",medium
"Maybe it was the mystery that drew me towards her, maybe it was her glasses.",medium
"She was a regular at BTL, and we had struck up a friendship of sorts.",medium
"Our conversations were mainly restricted to books and authors, and aside from the fact that she despised Harry Potter",medium
How can you be so engrossed in a screen when you're in a bookstore like this?,medium
"Oh, I'm actually working on a story, and I enjoy writing here",medium
"By now, a certain coherence had entered by speech when I talked to her.",medium
"Anyway , she continued, I want to listen to your story. .",medium
"Just as I started to lift my laptop to hand to her, she stopped me, Nuh",medium
"It was a simple story I'd written, about how a seasoned footballer goes to visit the stadium the night before his last game ever to relive his memories and take it all in one last time.",medium
"I would have forgotten that she was standing in front of me, had it not been for her eyes.",medium
"She didn't take her gaze off me for even a minute, and let it linger there for a few seconds after I had finished.",medium
"She was silent for a moment, and then she said in a soft but clear voice It was passionate. .",medium
"Before, I could even process her critique, she had collected her books and left.",medium
I stayed up the whole night thinking about what she had said.,medium
"She didn't come by for a week after that, and I grew more and more anxious.",medium
I couldn't stop thinking about her and became more and more sure of my feelings.,medium
"I decided that the next time I see her, I was going to make my move.",medium
"So, when she did finally turn up, I called out to her before she made her way into the store.",medium
"I leaned across the counter, as if it were that of a bar, looked into her eyes, just as I'd seen in countless movies and said, Can I buy you a book? .",medium
"As we walked towards the back of the store, I saw that she was positively smiling now.",medium
It was one minute of pure bliss and my mind and heart were both racing rapidly.,medium
"For years, I've advocated and even profited from preaching about the evils of distractions and enslaving yourself to the crisis news networks.",medium
Productive people don't glue themselves to social media and cable news.,medium
I felt justified in preaching as I had almost universally followed my own advice.,medium
That win-streak ended on January 6 when rioters stormed the capital.,medium
"I became the person I advised not to become, immersing myself in headline news, checking Twitter for constant updates because mainstream media felt like clay-tablet technology.",medium
"Everything passes, even the good times, which always seem to zoom by, while the crises linger indefinitely.",medium
"Even my brain rebelled, surreptitiously contriving justification for my lack of motivation.",medium
"When thoughts like those started to make sense, I knew I had to reassert sanity.",medium
"It took a lesson from a former boss who coached me after 9-11.When the first tower fell on September 11, I left my office and raced back to my apartment.",medium
"There I stayed for a good 48-hours, clinging to the 24-hour news, drinking wine from a bottle.",medium
"The next morning, the scent of burnt ash and charred metal seeped through my window.",medium
"It so consumed me with fear, outrage, and angst; The commentary of pundits and news anchors proved addictive even though I knew it would only worsen the tension.",medium
"Two days into the melee, an exec at my company called, and we spoke for ten minutes.",medium
"That might not sound impressive, but he had over 100 people who worked under him.",medium
"For several days he made sure he spoke with every employee, promising us",medium
It forced him to set an example for everyone else to follow.,medium
It was a brilliant lesson and one I've followed during various crises over the last twenty years.,medium
"It doesn't require any special skill or willpower, only a small amount of effort and a desire to help.",medium
We'll accept it even when we have reason to discount it.,medium
"When the executive calmed me after 9-11, I knew he lacked the power to guarantee his promises.",medium
"Still, I bought his reassuring words because I needed to believe them.",medium
"And as he later told me, fulfilling the role of the leader that everyone else leaned on reassured him as well.",medium
"There are three components to this technique, none of which require more than basic interpersonal skills.",medium
A close friend of mine is the most anxious person I know.,medium
I could walk into her apartment cool as blue and stumble out two hours later as though she'd injected me with an IV of caffeine.,medium
"Always on edge, she lived life as if every decision were a life or death situation.",medium
"When you're in the presence of someone like that, you can't help but absorb some of their angst.",medium
Studies show that other people's emotions can and do infect us.,medium
That's why you need to project an air of calm when you designate yourself as the one others rely on.,medium
It's tough to be productive and creative when you're agitated.,medium
You act out of emotion instead of logic and make less thoughtful decisions.,medium
"When you put out the message you're available for others, you thrust yourself into a leadership position.",medium
"Once anointed, we tend to act in a way that's consistent with that label.",medium
"The Psychology of Persuasion, we have an obsessive desire to act (and appear) consistent.",medium
"Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpernal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.",medium
The mere act of declaring yourself as the person who will be there for everyone else influences you to act in a way that's consistent with that manner.,medium
"Done correctly, it encourages you to demonstrate the skills, behaviors, and diligence your followers expect of you.",medium
You'll destroy your credibility and antagonize the people you mean to support.,medium
"Put on your listening caps, as your school teacher used to say.",medium
"Recognize their concerns, and then shift focus to the post-crisis world.",medium
"By focusing on the future state, you communicate your belief in an imminent post-crisis world without explicitly saying so.",medium
I've found it even helps to show apprehension or nervousness about the post-crisis reality.,medium
But you'll also communicate a subtle certainty that whatever angst stands in their way now will soon end.,medium
"A crisis, even a short one, can throw off even the most disciplined.",medium
"Once you find yourself off your game, take a deep breath, and remind yourself that as the adage goes, this too shall pass.",medium
It forces you to set an example for everyone else to follow.,medium
"Here, you're out of reach of the wandering Mudgelwangk and any other ground predators.",medium
The moon is on the rise and you have a clear view of the forest floor by the silvery light.,medium
It might be easier to spot Geoffrey from up here if he's anywhere nearby.,medium
"The twigs scratch your skin as you clamber over it, trying to keep to the edge.",medium
"Unlike other animals, they're known to track a threat far beyond their own territory.",medium
"Not only do they kill it, but then they eat it to ensure it won't return.",medium
You shove yourself away from the cracked eggs and crawl to the far edge of the nest.,medium
"Just as you climb onto the branch beyond, a rustling shadow passes over you.",medium
There's a ferocious shriek from above as heavy wings beat the air.,medium
"Your heart plummets into your stomach as you spiral up, up, up.",medium
You clear the canopy and arrows higher into the star-studded night.,medium
The last thing you see before the mawt feasts on your flesh are the moonlight-kissed branches of the forest below you and the lights of your village glowing in a clearing half a league away.,medium
"If you'd like to start at the beginning, here's the opening scene:",medium
The suspension of disbelief is the readers' willingness to accept as credible facts and characters they would ordinarily consider incredible.,medium
"They know that events and characters aren't real, even when they look like they are.",medium
Yet readers accept them as real for the duration so to be able to enjoy the story.,medium
British author and literary critic Samuel T. Coleridge was the first to call this attitude suspension of disbelief in 1817.,medium
"The concept was of special importance for a Romantic like him because Romantic authors wrote stories that not only weren't real, but they also didn't look like they were.",medium
"Coleridge theorised that this happened because of a conscious, temporary act of belief on the readers' part.",medium
"In modern storytelling, the focus of the suspension of disbelief has increasingly shifted from the reader to the author.",medium
But authors must do all they can to make it easy for their readers to suspend their disbelief.,medium
"Good stories don't just allow the suspension of disbelief, they encourage it.",medium
"When readers come to think that a story may be real, somehow, somewhere, they become willing to believe, if only for the time it takes to consume that story.",medium
"Then their involvement becomes complete, and a strong emotional bond is born.",medium
There isn't just one element that makes the suspension of disbelief acceptable to the reader.,medium
"Rather, this is a process that works at all levels of storytelling and is utterly pervasive.",medium
"Whether it is New York City or Middle-earth, if the reader may place themselves there, they are likely to believe all the rest.",medium
Sometimes one well-chosen word specific to a place or a situation will do more than any long description.,medium
"If the setting is where the reader is transported to, characters are the reader's travel companions.",medium
They know the way and will accompany the reader in the journey that is the story.,medium
"Whether soldiers from WWI or little mermaids with a dream, characters need to be coherent.",medium
"Handling characters' actions and reactions is one of the trickiest aspects of storytelling, but also one of the most powerful.",medium
"If a reader comes to consider a character as good as a real person, and maybe one of their friends, investment in the story (and so the suspension of disbelief) will be almost unbreakable.",medium
The relation cause/effect that propels the story has to make sense regarding both the plot and reality.,medium
This means that most readers will accept it because they have experienced something similar in their lives.,medium
They'll be likely to take it no matter the circumstances of the story.,medium
"Random events that don't cause a forward movement in the plot will weaken the story, its likeliness and therefore the reader's willingness to suspend their disbelief.",medium
"It could seem that the suspension of disbelief is easier with stories that mimic reality, but is more needed with speculative stories with magical elements.",medium
It may be tempting to think that readers will accept stories that mimic reality more readily than speculative stories.,medium
Readers are indeed more likely to accept stories that happen in actual locations.,medium
"Besides, when a place does exist, readers expect to 'recognise it'.",medium
"For example, if I've visited New York, inaccurate details may break my suspension of disbelief and cause me to abandon the story.",medium
"A speculative story generally needs more work on the suspension of disbelief, because the reader needs to make an initial step, conscious and hard, towards the fantastical environment.",medium
"But other important elements, such as coherence in characters' behaviours and logic in plot development, work in the same exact way whether the story is mimic or speculative.",medium
What convinces the reader to suspend their disbelief isn't the genre of the story.,medium
"It is the skill with which the author creates characters, plots and conflicts.",medium
"Fourteen years ago, when she started her job in a bookshop, she discovered books that address the structure of a story and she became addicted to them.",medium
"Today, she's a dieselpunk author who writes fantasy stories historically set in the 1920s.",medium
Her life-long interest in Tolkien has turned quite nerdy recently.,medium
"My partner and I, among our other roommates, decided to celebrate unconventionally, in hopes of fending off COVID for our families' and essential workers' sakes.",medium
"Instead of risking going home for the holidays, we booked an air bnb and headed west.",medium
"And let me tell you that Moab, Utah in the winter is a truly unique sight.",medium
"You'd think you were on Mars if it weren't for the dustings of snow, desperately lingering Trump signs, and 40,000 Watt Christmas spectacles.",medium
We awoke on day one with a blazing sense of purpose in this wonderfully strange terrain.,medium
"Suddenly exposed to famous trails known around the world, gear quickly began flying around the living room of our poor air bnb.",medium
"The dogs followed right at our heels, on to us and our uncovered, adventuring spirits.",medium
"Like anyone reading this, we had been locked indoors for months now.",medium
"Whether that be exploring the expanses of the west, or the sweaty throttles of clubs, we all miss something from our pre-quarantine world.",medium
"Moab was our gateway to feeling alive again, and we were bursting over the threshold.",medium
"Soon enough, we plugged a trailhead into Google Maps and set off.",medium
"My partner and I were driving up towards the grand La Sal mountains, to a trailhead known as Porcupine Rim.",medium
"Part of what's known as The Whole Enchilada, the ride consists of 15 miles of epic decent over slick, red rock, and crisp, desert scenery.",medium
"My partner Kyle had ridden it once years before, and we were on a mission to ride it together.",medium
"I don't remember any of this drive, it must be taking us up a back way, Kyle figured.",medium
"Although, I was one of four people crammed into the backseat of a truck, so I can't say I saw much of anything.",medium
"As we rose a few thousand feet, we neared the trailhead.",medium
"Suddenly, the Subaru Outback rocked back and forth as we swerved onto a fire road.",medium
"There were no tracks on the patches of snow, but the road itself had frozen tread marks of travelers past.",medium
"I scrolled the digital map, But it's also a fire road.",medium
"We were only a few miles out, and GPS estimated 6 minutes.",medium
"And suddenly, we were down a snowy hill, perched beside a barb wire gate.",medium
"As we got out to look around, one option became clear.",medium
"The winding road we were on seemed to connect to a dirt road, father down the canyon, although the intersection was obscured by the hills.",medium
"As long as we could keep going down, there seemed to be a way out.",medium
"Looking around, that was the only option among the minefields of rock and unruly terrain.",medium
"Luckily, we could unhinge the gate to get the car through.",medium
My mountain biking shoes were covered in snow when I got back in the car.,medium
"Kyle drove us through, parked, and got out to re-hinge the gate, So the farmer doesn't loose his cattle.",medium
"Their angry, incredibly dry branches clawed at my poor Subaru relentlessly.",medium
"I lied, I was feeling each blood-curdling screech in my gut",medium
"We sure as hell didn't know how to get out, and Google Maps certainly didn't either.",medium
These fire roads were merely remnants of trails created to mend the fences that kept in cattle of generations past.,medium
I was starting to mentally log what kind of food and blankets we had in the car.,medium
"Could we hike out and look for other winter mountain bikers, on their way to the trailhead?",medium
Do we leave the car and come back for it in the summer?I,medium
"He was accustom to being that guy, the one who finds himself in impossible situations; Once he was forced into a three point turn on an unguarded, cliff-side mountain road.",medium
"Another time, his brakes failed at the top of, you guessed it, a mountain road.",medium
"So yeah, Kyle had a history with unforgiving situations (mountain roads seem to be his forte).",medium
"He wasn't particularly optimistic, but he sure as hell was going to be resilient.",medium
"We soldiered on, opening and closing cattle gates, flooring it up single track hiking trails, cursing the branches and Siri who kept trying to allure us into death traps.",medium
The ditch ahead was far deeper than my little Subaru would prefer.,medium
"Strangely, I felt like a kid building a fort in the snowy backyard.",medium
It was as if we had nothing better to do as my gloves clawed at the frozen rocks to haul them to the ditch.,medium
"We fit them together like puzzle pieces, as I'm sure I did on multiple lazy winter days in my childhood.",medium
"Needless to say, it was a jumping high-five moment.",medium
"Abandoned-chic, a skull hung ominously on the aged door.",medium
"Double pad-locked, the steel bars were chained with a purpose.",medium
"Of all things to bring on a bike ride; you could always trust Kyle to be prepared, especially when bikes are involved.",medium
"Thus, we proceeded to take the heavily locked gate off its hinges, drive the car through, and put the gate back together.",medium
"I'm glad we didn't have to destroy your gate, or get arrested for trespassing,",medium
It was much funnier when Micheal and Dwight found themselves following GPS into a lake; sheer frustration soon gives way to panic as their car descends into a pond.,medium
"Sure, we have all followed GPS down a wrong alley or two.",medium
We would never take automated directions into such an over-the-top demise.,medium
"No matter how experienced you think you are, it is more than possible to make a few wrong turns; to become dangerously lost.",medium
"As we drove out of the canyon to real road, the immensity of what almost happened set in.",medium
What if we didn't have a wrench?What if we had a little Honda instead of a Subaru?What if we had to hike out of there?,medium
"Is it possible to sue google, to soogle, if you will?",medium
"Ever since we started dating I've gotten you into these oddball, crazy situations.",medium
"You know, I think its weirdly, in a backwards way, a blessing, I countered.",medium
I have never been so grateful for safety and routine as I am now.,medium
"Sure, the highs of canyon views and steep descents on two wheels are viscerally satisfying.",medium
But maybe the lows exist because they put the highs in perspective.,medium
"They feel extra good because you evaded that discomfort, when you realize you could have, but didn't fall.",medium
"To put it crudely: The worse the bad gets, the better the good feels.",medium
"Despite the consequences, I realized that pushing this envelope of risk now and again is essential.",medium
Because good adventures are not the only ones that amount to something.,medium
"I came out of that death-trap with a renewed appreciation for my partner, and respect for the outdoors and risk-taking.",medium
"I developed a hatred for google maps, sure, but I also a rejuvenated my love of even the most dull, predictable qualities of life, even in quarantine.",medium
"Hit me with hot chocolate and zoom calls, I've never been more ready.",medium
"The quiet felt ominous, like he was being watched with eager appetite.",medium
"He squinted up at the stars, the sun-blessed clouds.",medium
Van Gogh hadn't been crazy - or even mildly delusional like Brophy.,medium
The sky really was waves of energy pulsating the music of the universe.,medium
It was too dark to take a picture to send to Audrey.,medium
"She would see Brophy did not need an intervention, was not another one of her broken artists to coddle and flatter into yet another gallery show.",medium
"Genius sells, but mad genius shatters sales records and builds her brand.",medium
A slobbering hound from hell knocked him flat and panted drool on his chest.,medium
"She was thirties-young, tall, lithe, and dark blonde.",medium
She definitely had a dog who couldn't wait to mangle him.,medium
My name is Brophy James and I'm trying to find Wild River Cabins.,medium
"She hacked a long, serious cough and spat into the leaves.",medium
She was shorter than she looked when he knew he was going to die.,medium
He couldn't believe he'd have to hack through the woods again to get to a warm fire and featherbed luxury.,medium
We live with the rest of the world until we can't take it any longer.,medium
"Believe me, my man, I have no problem attracting exactly what I need exactly when I need it.",medium
"The dog slumped onto the ground, lay his head on his paws.",medium
"A month later, Brophy's entire Hermit Series sold out the night of the opening.",medium
"After the show, Audrey sent him to Wild River Cabins for another intervention/inspiration weekend.",medium
"Our first clue that things weren't going to be easy was at the Del Rio, TX Border Patrol station when the agent asked us where we were going.",medium
"In the summer of 2020, my family drove to West Texas, first to visit Davis Mountains State Park and then on to Seminole Canyon State Park & Historic Site.",medium
"This is Texas, remember, so these two places - both in the western part of the state- aren't exactly close.",medium
"I was a little suckered in by the photos too, so I agreed.",medium
"The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department purchased the 37,000 acres, once part of a working ranch, in 1988.",medium
"Devils River State Natural Area is in Val Verde County, near Del Rio where we were staying.",medium
"According to the park description, it contains three ecosystems: the Edwards Plateau, the Tamaulipan mezquital and the Chihuahuan Desert.",medium
"Dolan Falls, the highest volume waterfall in Texas, is there too.",medium
"And the Comanche, Kiowa and Kickapoo tribes once called the area home.",medium
"In 'The Devils River: Wilderness Area Map Service,' Louis Aulbach wrote that pictographs of red panthers can be found in the area's 53 rock shelters, which archeologists date back to 3000",medium
"There is apparently a Buffalo dancer pictograph as well, representing a Native American.",medium
"Also in 1873, Texas Ranger Captain Pat Dolan clashed with native residents, at the falls named for him.",medium
I didn't appreciate why until we made our little day trip.,medium
"In the little window of time I had cell service, I called the park.",medium
"The ranger said that once we turned off the main road, there was a gravel road that would take about 45 minutes to drive.",medium
"Maybe now is the time to mention that Del Rio was the hottest U.S. city on record that day, at 113 degrees.",medium
The gravel road turned out to be more like a big rock road.,medium
"After five minutes of bouncing up and down, I was so damn grateful that the idea had not been mine.",medium
"If the trip was a complete bust, it wouldn't be my fault.",medium
"One hour, one baby javelina, three roadrunners, and 10 ranch entrances later, we made it to the ranger station.",medium
I was greeted there by name since I was the only person who had bought a day pass for the river on that day.,medium
"Once parked in the lot, there was another mile walk to get to the river.",medium
I thought to turn it into a game for my kids and said the first person to see the water was the winner.,medium
I've only seen water that color along 30A in Florida and the Caribbean.,medium
"And except for the birds and fish, we had it all to ourselves.",medium
"Because the land on either side was privately owned, there was no looking for cave art.",medium
"But that was OK because as I mentioned, it was fry-an-egg hot.",medium
"Eventually, we made it down to Dolan Falls, and then back up to where the spring water flows into the river, a shock of welcome cold.",medium
"At one point, I left my crew downriver and came back to our starting point.",medium
"Alone, watching fish at my feet and a cliff rising in front, I felt perfectly content.",medium
"The drive out wasn't any better than the drive in, but we were all in agreement.",medium
"Who gives a boy a name like that growing up in a tiny river town of less than a thousand residents in Jefferson County, Missouri?",medium
"With most boys running around the softball field with names like Jimmy and Johnny, Boyce Brady didn't have half a chance but to stand out as different.",medium
But different would finally be OK where he was heading in a few days.,medium
"At 19, Boyce Brady would break away from Grandma Ronnie's clutches and board a bus to his destiny.",medium
"Gam, he'd said to Grandma Ronnie, I'm a misfit in this town",medium
I won't be no 'Double B Coming and Going' no more!,medium
He made that declaration at Christmas just before his last semester at Festus High.,medium
"Public school would be good enough for Boyce, she decided, maybe even straighten up his quirks.",medium
"She held on to a secret, though, that a fund had been established years ago in Boyce's name for college.",medium
She had been putting her coins away in a special place for years just for him.,medium
"And for that, she could be patient and help him get through the high school days.",medium
"But for Boyce Brady, high school was one long, tormented day after day of being the source of everyone's laughter.",medium
"It was nothing Gam could help him with, he was on his own.",medium
"You're not a boy, you don't play football or go out with girls.",medium
"Then by the ninth grade it turned into Double B Coming and Going, and it stuck because no one could make heads or tails of Boyce Brady.",medium
"Now, in just a few days he was headed to Missouri State in Springfield.",medium
"In the summer after eighth grade, Boyce Brady went to camp at Bear River Ranch, back when his mom was still alive and was able to save her tips from waiting tables at the Stoplight Cafe.",medium
"She thought it was important for Boyce to go to camp with the other boys, hoping for a blossoming to occur.",medium
"He watched as the boys paired off with girls behind the latrines to kiss and tell about it in their A-frame cabins each night, bragging about things they didn't actually do.",medium
"Boyce just sat in the corner listening, hoping not to be noticed.",medium
Anh had explained his name to Boyce on a walk home from school one day when they happened to walk the same route and might as well walk together.,medium
"But the kids calls me Andy, he said, flashing a bright toothy smile set inside delicate brown features, shining eyes and thick black hair.",medium
Anh was the son of a Vietnam vet and his bride from Hanoi who settled in Missouri to work in a nearby factory and raise their son.,medium
"A few weeks later, Anh invited Boyce over one afternoon during spring break.",medium
"When it was time for Boyce to go home, Anh walked him to the door and reached in for a hug.",medium
"Taken by surprise, Boyce stood with his arms at his sides then gradually reached around to hug Anh back, feeling a kind of warmth he had not known before.",medium
"As they pulled apart, Anh kissed Boyce lightly on the cheek.",medium
"Every day that week Boyce returned to Anh's house to play cards or Yahtzee, get in the pool or watch TV and make sandwiches after.",medium
They talked about how they were both going to get out of that town one day.,medium
Don't you think we can be anyone we want to be?,medium
I do not want to pretend to be someone I'm not.,medium
Boyce wasn't sure what Anh meant exactly but he could feel its meaning somewhere deep in the sanctuary of his heart.,medium
"That this was, in fact, precisely true but something he could not yet articulate was enough of an answer to that question.",medium
"And a silent nod to Anh was confirmation, Defiant and firm.",medium
"Let me tell you more about my name, Anh said softly, pulling a piece of errant hair back off Boyce's forehead as he spoke.",medium
"Thuong means One Who Loves Tenderly, he said, looking deeply into Boyce for understanding.",medium
"Boyce didn't hesitate, he knew just what he wanted with Anh, that it was mutual and without shame or prejudice.",medium
"They giggled and hugged afterwards, sharing a new-found freedom together, a liberating moment of long-awaited peace and understanding.",medium
"Though Boyce never wanted to say the word out loud, he knew he was at the very least bisexual because he sometimes liked to watch the Miss America Pageant with Gam.",medium
"He didn't know anything for certain, not yet, but he knew that Springfield was an open door to find out one way or another just who Boyce Brady was.",medium
Anh had helped him get part of the way there and now the rest was up to him.,medium
"As senior year approached, they accepted their fate and honored each other's needs and choices.",medium
"And holding all that they shared together, tightly and dearly in mutual respect and gratitude.",medium
"It's time we get you to the bus station, Boyce, gather up your things, Gam yelled out from the kitchen where she was washing up the last of the breakfast dishes.",medium
"Boyce was excited, nervous, happy and sad all at once.",medium
Leaving his grandmother alone made him anxious but he knew his time to shine was now.,medium
"Gam, I just need to make one stop on the way to the bus station.",medium
"Pulling up to Anh's house, he got out and walked slowly to the mailbox, gazing across the lawn at the front door to Anh's home and heart.",medium
"As he made his way back to the car and forward towards his new life, he recited in his head the simple message to his friend who was the illuminating light in his life:",medium
"My Dearest Anh Thuong, Intelligent One Who Loves Tenderly,Thank you for showing me I can be anyone I want to be.",medium
I received an email the other day that said Let the spin machine go into action.,medium
"While I understand the order, I'm not a fan of the sentiment.",medium
"Spinning is great for turntables, spiders, and the aptly named spinning wheel.",medium
"Heck, I'm even OK with Dead or Alive telling their object of affection that they spin them right round.",medium
"But when it comes to public relations or marketing, spin is bad.",medium
"The term spin doctor started appearing in the late 1970s and was used largely to refer to public relations professionals working in politics in the US and UK (Valentini, 2016).",medium
"Basically, it refers to the act of putting a positive light on something that's not so great.",medium
"If a politician has some unsavory history, a spin doctor could push it under the rug and highlight all the positives things someone has done.",medium
"As a result, the term spin is associated with shady behaviour - making something bad seem not so bad.",medium
Public relations practitioners and communications professionals (I tend to use the term interchangeably) follow a code of ethics.,medium
"In each one of these codes is a commitment to be honest, to communicate accurate information.",medium
"As we have seen with the rise of 24-hour news channels and social media, the truth will eventually come out.",medium
"If you tell a story and fudge some facts because it will distract from the positive points, that's spin.",medium
"When used out of context, the term spin only serves to reinforce the belief that public relations practitioners are untrustworthy.",medium
"In my case, the story I was asked to put in the spin machine was already a positive story.",medium
But the person who said it to me wanted the story to be promoted and shared.,medium
"I understood that, but using spin was not the way to make that point.",medium
"Using outdated language to describe our work makes it even harder, and only perpetuates the stereotype that all communications or marketing professional are untrustworthy, always trying to sell something, or hide from the facts.",medium
"Instead of Let's spin this, say Let's tell this story .Instead of Let's put a positive spin on",medium
A stroll up Walnut Street to the farmer's market would take her under five minutes from her northside apartment.,medium
"Hey, Viv! Franklin yelled out to her from his front balcony on the third floor.",medium
"I have to take Tilly to the vet, so no, Franklin said.",medium
"Sitting on the opposite corner of her apartment building, seemed to beckon her attention.",medium
It was an old wooden thing with part of its wicker seat missing.,medium
"I suppose it's for the taking, just sittin' there like that.",medium
"Remembering that she was on another mission at the moment, she let it go and headed for the market.. .",medium
He could hear her shuffle as she approached from the other side.,medium
"Smiling, she opened the door with his strawberries set into a paper box in her left hand.",medium
"Peering over Franklin's shoulder, Vivian could see the chair was no longer on the corner.",medium
Franklin turned around to see what she was looking at and saw nothing unusual.,medium
"Sliding her cycling gloves on and securing the velcro, she did a double take as she caught sight of it.",medium
"There it was, but a few feet down the street from its original perch.",medium
"Maybe someone took it and changed their mind, didn't quite fit, she pondered.",medium
She didn't have much time as she was already running late for a doctor's appointment.,medium
"As she was stepping through her bike, she noticed a swath of pink on the right arm of the chair.",medium
"Why did she think she had any right to it any more than the next person, anyway?",medium
"She found herself peeking through her living room curtain in the direction of the chair as sunlight filtered through the trees, landing on the empty spot where the chair used to be.",medium
"The moon would be almost full tonight, she knew, she could check on it later.",medium
"Cleaning, cooking, enjoying a strawberry dessert with Franklin upstairs in his apartment.",medium
Listening to Miles Davis wafting on a warm breeze from a neighbor's living room through open windows.,medium
"Monday rolled around and as she left for work in the morning, there it was.",medium
"Making another southward movement from the corner of its origin, the chair was now a few more feet from its previous perch.",medium
"Looking up, she heard her bus approaching, pulled her pass from her pocket, crossed the street and got on board.",medium
"Taking a seat near the back, she turned to get a last glance at the chair.",medium
"Once again, it would have to await its fate with her.. .",medium
"At mid-day, she had even considered phoning Judith, her elderly neighbor.",medium
"She walked down the street to the end of the block, just in case someone had moved it again",medium
"Defeated, she sauntered home, changed into her sweatpants, poured a glass of wine, began to draw a bath and sat down on her couch to contemplate the chair.",medium
"Leaving her phone behind, she checked the bath, dropped in some essential oils, turned off the faucet and climbed in, sinking into the welcome depth of relaxation and wandering thoughts.",medium
"Emerging later from the bath and throwing on her robe, Vivian shuffled to her front window, pulled back the curtain and peered out.",medium
"Sitting down on the couch, she noticed a text had come in on her phone from two hours ago.",medium
It was a terse message simply requesting that she call her first thing in the morning.,medium
"Scrolling through her phone briefly, she set her phone down and wandered into the kitchen to throw some dinner together.. . .",medium
"It may be nothing at all, but we should do the other tests to be certain.",medium
"I mean, should I be worried, or what should I be worried about?",medium
"Until then, she would just have to be patient and calm.",medium
"There was a genetic pre-disposition, she knew, but she couldn't think about that now.",medium
The day dragged on and she did her best to stay occupied.,medium
"Getting off the bus carrying groceries she'd picked up on her way home from work, she was walking slowly towards her building when it came into view.",medium
"That's it, isn't it?It had continued on its journey south and was now at the top of the next block under the stop sign.",medium
Picking up her pace she arrived at the chair with a laugh.,medium
"Its seat was fully restored now, the arms painted in turquoise.",medium
"The legs were still a tan color except for one, the rear right leg had been partially painted in pink and gold.",medium
"Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back! . .",medium
She wished she had made her appointment for the morning instead of having to wait all day.,medium
"Going back inside and closing the door, she got ready for work, a bit perturbed about the missing chair.. .",medium
"Vivian got off the bus that afternoon, her medical tests done, the alarming results revealed, she had all but forgotten the chair.",medium
"As she approached her building, she saw Judith in her front garden, on all fours.",medium
"The elderly woman was pointing out how well her roses were doing along the front fence, the warming weather, the extra watering that would need to be done, when Vivian noticed the chair.",medium
"Having moved back up the block towards her, not quite at its original starting place but somewhere in between.",medium
She excused herself from Judith and walked down the street for a good look.,medium
"It's the same chair, isn't' it?It seemed so, yet someone had changed its colors again, it sat dismal in muted grays and brown.",medium
It would hardly be of any use to her now.. . .,medium
Franklin had arrived home just as she was sitting down on her front stoop.,medium
"He had joined her on the steps, the two of them facing out towards the street, talking idly.",medium
"Yeah, you're kind of a master of that, Vivian said.",medium
"A waiter by day, and so much more the rest of the time.",medium
"Vivian started to tear up, leaning her head onto his shoulder.",medium
"She began to reveal her story to him, the test results, what was ahead of her in the coming months.",medium
"They sat quietly then, watching the world go by, the sun slowly lowering in the sky.. . .",medium
"Thanks for the lift, Alison, Vivian said, slowly getting out of her friend's car, returning from her usual treatment.",medium
"Alison asked, leaning down to look through the passenger side window from her seat behind the wheel.",medium
"As the car pulled away from the curb, the chair was revealed.",medium
"Vivian went over for a look, to say hello to a long-lost friend.",medium
"It had been months since she'd seen it, where must it have been!",medium
"The seat had been completely gutted, the arms and legs, the back of the chair discolored by someone, a novice someone, having attempted to strip it clean of its paint.",medium
"Vivian stood with the chair, under the stop sign, face to face with it, in solidarity.",medium
"The weather was changing again, getting cool enough for a sweater, even for late morning.",medium
"Franklin came out the door of the main part of the building, coffee mug in hand.",medium
They often met up there on a Saturday morning if the timing was right.,medium
"Sitting next to her on the stoop, he noticed the new addition to her porch.",medium
"That's a fine-looking chair, Viv, he said, nodding at it then looking back to her with a smile.",medium
"That she had turned a corner, moved forward just a little bit.",medium
"Aren't you worried someone will come and steal it off your porch, though?",medium
"How a nearly imperceptible change - a little tweak here, a bit of color there, can change the way you see a thing, Vivian said.",medium
"I thought it was so important for me to have it, to give it new life.",medium
"But every time I saw it again, it was never the same chair.",medium
"Franklin scratched his chin, not quite grasping her meaning or how to respond.",medium
She looked at him then turned her gaze across the street to the corner across from their building.,medium
"Do we feel the passage of time, the incremental movement farther and farther away, second by second . . .",medium
She turned to look him squarely in the eyes for an answer.,medium
"I'm not sure how awake I really am half the time, he said, with a little laugh, releasing his arm from her and reaching for his mug.",medium
I think we're just sittin' there watching the world go by.,medium
For something or someone to come along and make us feel of use.,medium
"If we're lucky, we find a good collaborator or two to help things along, she said.",medium
"Franklin nodded, looking over at her staring off across the street.",medium
A woman in a Toyota slowed down at the stop sign opposite their building.,medium
"Getting out of her car, she ran to the back, opened the trunk and pulled a small table out and set it on the sidewalk.. .",medium
"Ever since Hossein Malekzadeh turned in his visa application, any knock at the door, any phone call, and any time he heard his name yelled in public made him jump.",medium
"When the IRGC inevitably arrested him, would he be so lucky to get released a second time?So",medium
He straightened his posture in a way he thought an innocent person might.,medium
"Then, he cracked it open to find Mariam, his old girlfriend.",medium
"She was holding bananas, mangos, and his favorite: pomegranates.",medium
"She breathed a sigh of relief, as if she were glad he was still alive.",medium
"Since the recent death of Hossein's father the lacquer box maker, Miriam was the only person who risked coming to see him.",medium
"He took the bag of fruit, and backed away from the threshold.",medium
"He decided to take a journey to Darband, his favorite place in Tehran, in the north of the city near the Tajrish bazaar, overlooking the city's chaos and pollution.",medium
Here he had passed the best - and worst - days of his life.,medium
"Here he held hands with a girl for the first time, and here a year later, right by the fountain, he kissed Miriam gently on the lips when no one was watching.",medium
"Khatami was president, and every month gave birth to new possibilities.",medium
But the most important change was not about clothing: reform was underway.,medium
"Here too, during the years of darkness, after he graduated from the University of Tehran, had he sought consolation in poetry.",medium
"Sure, he experienced discrimination when universities refused to hire him because he would not cooperate with the IRGC, but he consoled himself that many brave souls before him had faced greater challenges.",medium
"So long as he kept a low profile, he knew he could avoid arrest.",medium
"When he arrived at the Tajrish metro station at the end of line #1, he hurled himself into a taxi headed in the direction of the park.",medium
He opened the door before the taxi stopped and rushed up the steep slope leading to the park.,medium
"He perched himself above a waterfall, and gazed at the foothills of the Alborz mountains in the distance.",medium
"With all this fear, he said aloud to himself, after checking that no one could hear him, Why do I even bother?",medium
"After a pause, he added, Soon, I'll be thirty-five.",medium
"By the time dad was this age, he had a career and a future.",medium
"Although no one had been listening at first, passers-by had begun to stare at him as if he were possessed.",medium
It felt good to be uttering the words that had been buried in his heart for too long.,medium
"His audience was the river, the trees, and his beloved Darband, where the river flowed like champagne.",medium
"The park even had its own theatre, Tamashakhaneh, right in the center.",medium
No law had the power to destroy his life or to deny him a career.,medium
He then consoled himself: surely the theatres of St. Petersburg were just as captivating as those in Tehran.,medium
"Exactly two years ago, he had been arrested for his cartoons of the Ayatollah.",medium
They were not intended to cause offense; he had hoped to show the human side of this revered figure.,medium
"He thought of it as a way of paying homage, to humanize the leader of his country.",medium
Hossein did not publicize the cartoons himself; he knew better than that.,medium
"But once at a party with university friends, they were sharing what they did for fun.",medium
"When the students asked what they were about, he could not resist telling the truth.",medium
"Perhaps it was his bragging, or perhaps it was the simple yearning of an artist to have his work known.",medium
Everyone at the party expressed admiration for his courage and promised to keep his secret.,medium
He had no reason to believe that anyone who heard him speak had any particular reverence for the Ayatollah.,medium
"Still, Hossein could easily guess the culprit: one of the more obsequious students who gushed over his talent and asked if he could copy some of the images for himself.",medium
He had always dreamed that someday somewhere his images might give someone pleasure.,medium
"The next thing he knew he had a huge following on all social media, including those banned within Iran:",medium
He was arrested and handed a ten-year sentence in Evin for defaming the Islamic Republic.,medium
"Then suddenly, in one of those arbitrary miracles that made life in the Islamic Republic so unpredictable, the prison authorities decided to have mercy on him.",medium
"It was Nowruz, the beginning of the Iranian New Year when prisoners were typically selected for pardons.",medium
"Citing his compliant behaviour while in prison, they let him go three months after he entered.",medium
There was only one catch: he had to promise to never draw cartoons again.,medium
He remembered all the friends whom he was leaving behind in their cells.,medium
"When would they be free?The prison guard yelled at him from a distance, Go home!",medium
"Vicariously, he had relived the executions of Mandelstam and Gumilyev, the suicide of Tsvetaeva, and the banishment of Brodsky.",medium
He knew what awaited poets who felt compelled to speak the truth to power.,medium
"Hossein was confident that he would be spared such a fate, not because he did not fear his jailors, but because he knew he was not made to be a martyr.",medium
"If he was ever to have a career, to become a man like his father, that could only ever happen outside Iran.",medium
It took him more than fifteen years - and his father's death - to fulfill his plan.,medium
"Finally, one bright Friday morning, a letter arrived from the embassy, wrapped in bright blue tape.",medium
"He tore open the envelope to find a one-month tourist visa to the Russian Federation, but he would extend it once he got there.",medium
He would do whatever he had to do in order to stay.,medium
"All his life he had refused to carry on his father's craft, but now his father was dead and it was all he had.",medium
"And maybe, just maybe, his new self would discover freedom for the first time, far from the land of his birth.",medium
He wanted to see his beloved country when no one else was looking.,medium
"Ramsar, the town of his birth, where he lived before he moved to Tehran to attend university.",medium
The Mazandarani dialect that his mother used to speak to him while rocking him to sleep in her arms.,medium
"The Caspian Sea with its fresh fish, that scientists said was becoming radioactive, but which seemed to him to simply be gaining in iridescence.",medium
"The white marble hotel owned by Reza Pahlavi, a relic of an era that had vanished by the time he was born.",medium
"Unlike his parents, he could not feel nostalgia for Iran before the revolution.",medium
"Unlike his friends who had migrated to the United States, the UK, and Germany, he had passed his life in Iran without ever wishing to leave.",medium
"He was not good enough to become a professional box maker for the Iranian bazaar, but in Russia, his boxes might - he hoped - become exotic curiosities.",medium
"He would make a living, finally, as a cliché of himself, a stereotype of the wandering Iranian dissident, shipwrecked in a foreign country.",medium
"He admired the anticolonial ideologies of early revolutionary thinkers like Ali Shariati, and their solidarity with oppressed peoples everywhere.",medium
"What would Shariati think of what the Islamic Republic had become, he wondered?",medium
"Streets were named after Shariati, but wasn't that always what happened to revolutionaries, who die conveniently before the revolution",medium
"What he didn't understand was why it continued, growing more corrupt every year.",medium
"Before you knew it, there was no difference between an atheist state and a theocratic one.",medium
"Given his recent experience in Evin, Hossein was worried about what might happen at the border.",medium
"To his relief, he passed through passport control without being interrogated.",medium
"The line was long, and the guards seemed to be in a hurry.",medium
They barely checked his passport and did not ask where he was headed.,medium
"They did however ransack his bags, as they did with everyone passing through.",medium
"All they found were bottles of sealed rosewater, which he had planned to give as gifts in Russia.",medium
"Or to sell on the black market, if he didn't manage to make any friends.",medium
There was an hour left before his flight was due to depart.,medium
"He wandered through the food court, staring at the different ice-cream flavours displayed behind the glass: pistachio, saffron, sour cherries.",medium
The intercom blared with the number of his flight: Tehran-St.,medium
"He couldn't wait to wander along the Neva under the blazing white sky, accompanied by the ghosts of Mandelstam and Akhmatova.",medium
"Now was the chance to live the dream that had percolated during his university years, back when he imagined himself becoming a university professor, or entering some other respectable profession: lawyer, doctor, banker.",medium
"Now, instead, he was going to become a box maker.",medium
"For one, you were less likely to be spied on by the authorities.",medium
"Petersburg, I don't want to die, he began to hum the lyrics of Mandelstam to the tune of Alla Pugacheva.",medium
"He remembered Mandelstam's poem comparing Stalin's moustache to cockroaches, and told himself he would never write like that.",medium
"I have to try, he told himself, mumbling aloud just as he had done in Darband.",medium
"Revolution might be the only solution, he mumbled, I don't want to get swept up in it.",medium
"He recalled the prophetic words of Lermontov, who had been exiled to the Caucasus in 1837 after writing a poem critical of the tsar.",medium
It was one of the many poems he had memorized during his first year at the university.,medium
"Back then, he could never have guessed what they would mean to him now.",medium
Lermontov's words resounded in him like a prayer to a God unknown:,medium
He composed a variation on Lermontov's poem*:It was the first poem he ever wrote.,medium
"And then, louder, he questioned his words: Will I ever return?",medium
"The closed circuit TV was monitoring him, just as it had been for most of his life.",medium
"As soon as he sat down, he closed his eyes and imagined he was flying.",medium
"He remembered his father and the lessons he had taught him in modesty as they crafted pen boxes together when they lived in Ramsar, before he entered the university.",medium
"The artist must forget himself and his ego, he used to say to his son, in order to create works of beauty.",medium
"Didn't his favorite writer, Dostoevsky, once claim that beauty would save the world?",medium
"As the plane soared above the earth, he regretted how little he had heeded his words.",medium
"Now, all he could hope for was that the plane would make a U-turn in the sky.",medium
"When he was detained at the border soon after his arrival in St. Petersburg, with his bag full of undeclared goods, he was hardly surprised at all.",medium
"The Iranian authorities had been tracking him ever since he left the airport, but had decided to let him cross the border first, before he was arrested by their partners in Russia.",medium
He would be more useful to the Iranian authorities in the prisons of Russia.,medium
"But then again, he'd been let out of prison once for good behavior.",medium
"I arrive at the restaurant to meet my friend, Bob, for lunch.",medium
"He is late, so we immediately sit down and order our $3 Chicks and Eggs special with a couple of steaming cups of joe.",medium
"Our chosen meeting place is ChickenHaus, a Garland staple, at least if the staple was rusted nearly in half and stained with a century of nicotine vapors.",medium
The old vinyl booths have cracks that could pinch a plug out of a bare thigh and the tables are so de-laminated that getting a splinter while enjoying an afternoon meal is a high probability.,medium
"Nonetheless, for those of us that grew up here, it feels like home.",medium
Bob and I catch up in the way that friends do when they're with someone that is truly one of their tribe.,medium
"Six months or six minutes, our rapport returns like a rehearsed Laurel and Hardy routine.",medium
"We've had our differences over the last few years but much like ChickenHaus, Bob is broken and stained but feels like home.",medium
Bob's antiquated flip phone rings and he answers with a Yep.,medium
"ChickenHaus, he cries after a moment and hangs up, smiling triumphantly.",medium
I think Bob plans it this way on purpose because he's afraid to be alone with me.,medium
I think sometimes Bob's passion for life overtakes him and any woman in mating range risks getting caught up in the current of pheromones.,medium
"Our one and only kiss, which surprised us both, ended with a mutually resounding, Yuck.",medium
"We both agreed it felt like kissing a cousin, and by that, I mean a first cousin and illegal, not to mention immoral.",medium
"No judgment though, Bob, if that just felt normal to you.",medium
I'd sell tickets to our meetings if I thought I could get away with it.,medium
A Night at the Improv has nothing on a day out with the Bobs.,medium
"Within 15 minutes, the backup arrives and we move to the corner booth, the big circular one with the vinyl version of spike strips that cops use to stop car chases.",medium
"As we squish in, I feel one, then two, tears in my new tights and at least one I probably want to heavily disinfect after I get home.",medium
"As I settle between the two large men, the warmth of the booth surface reminds me of going down a playground slide in the middle of July and a layer of sticky thigh meat sizzles.",medium
The window above us simultaneously blinds and cooks us with the infiltrating afternoon sun.,medium
"From the corner of my eye, I see Evelyn wink at me awkwardly.",medium
"I look away quickly and listen to Bob finish a story about his latest conquest, the one they call Bob Barker, because she barks like a seal during orgasm.",medium
"I glance back and Evelyn winks again - once, then twice.",medium
She must have caught me staring in alarm because she is quick to explain the sun streaming in above the booth is making her eyes water.,medium
"I offer sweetly to try and climb up and pull the shades, despite my petite height and the fact I'm wearing a skirt.",medium
"Uncle Archie, Evelyn barks to her brother, pull down the shades for me.",medium
"Buford, Archie, a slight unassuming man, asks in his polite, soft voice, please pull down the shades for your wife.",medium
"Well, I don't fucking understand paying 75-damn-dollars to see some women in their panties.",medium
At least not if I'm a damn woman with my own panties I can see for free!,medium
"Besides, they're not panties, they're world-famous dancers in dance costumes.",medium
"But the important question is: Did you catch any fur shots, Mom?",medium
I struggle with the thought of asking my mother the same question.,medium
"Even more so, I am horrified at the thought that my mother would know what fur shot meant.",medium
"Evelyn looks at me, smiles her embarrassment, and reaches over to pop Bob's arm.",medium
She's an elegant woman in her mid-50s with a trendy haircut and a fancy t-shirt embroidered with flowers.,medium
Then WHY in the hell did you pay 75-damn dollars of my hard-earned money to go see that shit?,medium
"Buford hollers, catching the attention of half the establishment, despite the loud whine of Billy Ray Cyrus over the jukebox.",medium
I'm thinking he is surely about to steer the conversation in a more appropriate direction as we continue to draw even more attention as the subject matter and volume escalate.,medium
"What I want to know, Buford, is if that $75 includes the gas to get to Mexico?",medium
I just don't understand why you'd have to pay $75 in New York or Mexico when we have good-looking hookers in Garland.,medium
"I choke on my coffee, not aware Garland has hookers and equally surprised to hear Archie is aware of such things.",medium
Bob pounds me on the back hard enough to make me gag just as the waitress arrives to take the rest of the orders.,medium
"Watch out for that one, Aunt Trudy warns the waitress, pointing a bony finger at Buford.",medium
Everything other than the words eggs or bacon that come out of his mouth are complete bullshit.,medium
Buford makes a rude gesture and turns a charming smile on the waitress.,medium
"Save it, buddy, the waitress quips and turns to Aunt Trudy.",medium
The womenfolk at the table have a good laugh and the waitress leaves smacking the same wad of gum,medium
"It's not that I don't enjoy the special attention, but would you like me to pull the shades for you so you can stop winking at me?",medium
"I carefully rise, protecting the group from a fur shot and reach for the pull cord on the spring-loaded shade.",medium
"I'm wearing a short skirt, semi-sheer tights, and high-heeled leather boots.",medium
"As I reach my full height, a stiletto heel sinks into the cracked vinyl.",medium
I brace a knee against the booth top and balance a hip on Bob's head to avoid splaying my backside smack into the center of a platter of biscuits.,medium
I refuse to make eye contact with Bob and hope he doesn't notice my ass on his head.,medium
I am rewarded for my bravado with the shade nearest me slipping down into place and staying put.,medium
"I shift my weight and switch knees, trying to balance only on my toes to keep from puncturing the vinyl.",medium
"Belatedly, I realize this is a moot point as the booth is more punctures, cracks, and duct tape than actual material.",medium
Each battle wound here in ChickenHaus has been bravely earned over decades of enduring late-night drunks and rowdy locals.,medium
I stretch for the second shade in the far corner but can't quite grab the dingy ring.,medium
I reach one hand behind me to tuck my skirt between my legs and say a little prayer as I lean out over Trudy and Archie.,medium
"I give it a little tug, afraid to breathe and lose my balance.",medium
"I take a deep breath, curse under my breath, and lunge like an Olympic competitor yanking that bastard shade with all my might.",medium
"As if in slow motion, a ripping sound reaches my ears just as the entire shade gives way and comes slamming down on the porcelain nativity display below.",medium
"The nativity scene that is probably older than the Baby Jesus himself, and that I have somehow managed not to notice before now, explodes.",medium
"The small swaddled Jesus antique goes flying across the room, bounces off a bald man's head, and crashes to a halt before resting in a fine white powder on the restaurant floor.",medium
"Mary, Joseph, a donkey, and what looks like a figurine of Winston Churchill, rain down around me like hellfire and brimstone, landing in bowls of picante sauce and sawmill gravy.",medium
"Without looking up or anywhere other than at my feet, I step back attempting to slink down to a sitting position.",medium
My heel catches in one of the cracks and I smash my face against the tar-covered wallpaper while my skirt flips almost to my waist.,medium
My knees buckle and I land with a bounce and a thud back on the vinyl booth,medium
I consider momentarily ducking under the table and crawling for the door.,medium
The deafening silence is broken only by Tanya Tucker and my beating heart.,medium
I didn't know the human mouth could turn that far down.,medium
"I'm sorry about your Jesus, I whisper and wave my hands wildly like a rejected Rockette doing a vaudevillian routine.",medium
"No one says a word until Evelyn graciously puts a hand on my shoulder and says, Thank you, Sweetie.",medium
The laughter finally comes and with it a huge sigh of relief mixed with a wave of hot embarrassment.,medium
"I sit for another 20 minutes with my back to the rest of the patrons, pretending I'm someone else, somewhere else.",medium
"I apologize to Bob, but he is too preoccupied with the picante sauce and eggs on his chin, shirt, and crotch to be concerned with what I am saying.",medium
"Blissfully, the checks finally come, signaling an end to the afternoon.",medium
"I nod, noticing our food is quite literally on him, but am still too embarrassed to even make a joke.",medium
"You can get everyone's ticket, Mr. Moneybags, Buford offers, but Bob politely declines.",medium
"Hey, how about I give you a naked picture of me in exchange for this bill?",medium
"No, I don't think so, she responds, never missing a beat.",medium
"Only with my clothes on, Buford assures her, but she ain't buying it.",medium
"Besides, adds Buford on his way out the door, For $3 a piece, we all finally got that fur shot.",medium
I didn't think a breakable glass object was a good toy for a nine-year-old.,medium
"She was fiddling with a foot-tall hourglass enclosed in a wooden, three-column frame engraved with wild animals.",medium
She opened her eyes wide and offered me her puppy dog face.,medium
It was time to do my parental due diligence and learn more about Magda.,medium
I'll just keep an eye on her while she and Magda play hopscotch.,medium
"If Magda and I jump on the exact same hopscotch squares at the same time, I go to her castle.",medium
"That's why she gave me the hourglass, so we can hopscotch together.",medium
"The first trip was by accident, but now we know how.",medium
She held the hourglass with the now empty upper bulb to the light.,medium
"She waved to me and then jumped through several squares, landed on the ten, and vanished.",medium
I pressed my head into my palms and tried to extract a memory that didn't exist.,medium
"So let's take a look at what effects caffeine, alcohol, and exercise have had on my sleep.",medium
I started this analysis in mid-2018 when I wrote about the results of tracking and modeling my blood caffeine concentration for a month.,medium
"Towards the end of 2018, I shared the results of a more detailed experiment, covering around three months of sleep and related data and attempting to find correlations.",medium
"While providing some interesting insights, the data was far from statistically significant.",medium
"But since then, I have kept up the tracking, measuring my sleep data each night with my Oura ring, and logging every caffeinated beverage I consumed, my workouts, and my daily alcohol consumption.",medium
"In total I accumulated 632 days of data, spanning from September 2018 to December 2020 (with two unfortunate small gaps in the data, more on that below).",medium
"This is a detailed analysis of this data and what I learned from it about my sleep and my stress levels, as well as how my habits and behaviors impact them.",medium
"First, we will take a look at my nightly heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV), which are key indicators for recovery, stress response, and overall health and performance.",medium
"Then we will dive a bit deeper into the science of sleep, its individual phases, and look at how different factors influence my sleep phases.",medium
"Finally, I want to draw some conclusions on what I managed to learn from this experiment.",medium
Later I also started to use rTracker to log my alcohol consumption.,medium
"Ever since their original Kickstarter campaign, I've been a big supporter of the Oura ring, a sleep tracking device I wear constantly.",medium
So getting my sleep data was as simple as downloading a CSV file containing the well over 50 metrics the ring tracks through their Oura Cloud service.,medium
"And while Oura's primary focus is on sleep, it also measures activity during the day, and the app can be used to log additional workouts and activities.",medium
Armed with all this raw data I was almost ready to start my analysis.,medium
So I had to create a model that could take my log of caffeinated drinks and estimate the actual caffeine levels in my body based on it.,medium
"Leading up to the first article mentioned above, I made a model that could roughly tell me the amount of caffeine I had coursing through my bloodstream at any point in time.",medium
For the full details of the model (as well as more info on how exactly I tracked all the data and,medium
"I refer you to my previous articles, or the code itself, but here is the core caffeine model in a nutshell.",medium
"But I believe that the resulting model is still insightful, and simplicity is key for actually turning the tracking into a habit that sticks.",medium
"This seems to be a reasonable estimate, maybe even a touch conservative given that I know from DNA analysis that I'm a fast caffeine metabolizer.",medium
"Even by the time I wake up, I usually still have the equivalent of a quarter espresso in my blood before the cycle begins again.",medium
"Half-life times can mislead our intuition a bit, but seeing it plotted like this makes it clear just how long the caffeine stays in your blood.",medium
"And that's only for my fairly average consumption of three to four cups of coffee a day, and a (probably) shorter than average half-life time given my fortunate genes.",medium
"Just like caffeine metabolism, how much caffeine affects us also depends on the individual.",medium
"I can't speak for everyone (although I hope my results give some good general indications), but my N-of-1 experiment should at least give me some concrete insights about myself.",medium
It's responsible for pumping blood around our body and supplying it with oxygen and other important nutrients.,medium
"For a long time, the heart, rather than the brain, was even seen as the center of the body and the seat of emotion.",medium
"And more and more modern research is suggesting that this was not completely off, that there is at least some kind of two-way communication between heart and brain.",medium
"So the heart is clearly important for physical, as well as mental wellbeing.",medium
The most common and well-known metric related to the workings of the heart is the heart rate (HR) - a simple counter of how many times our heart beats per minute.,medium
"Heart rate variability (HRV) is a less well-known quantity, but it's quickly gaining popularity as a key quantity to keep an eye on if you're interested in your health and performance.",medium
A heart rate of 60 bpm does not mean there is a beat exactly once every second.,medium
Our heart adapts to the slightest nuances in our environment and the ever-changing requirements from our body.,medium
It also speeds up with the in-breath and slows down with the out-breath.,medium
"The more rested and relaxed we are, the stronger this response.",medium
"But if we are stressed, fatigued, or otherwise in a sub-optimal state, our body's response gets dampened.",medium
"It's a sign that our sympathetic nervous system, responsible for our fight-or-flight response, is overactive.",medium
This makes HRV a great metric to measure how well-rested and ready for peak performance our body is.,medium
"In short, the higher our HRV, the stronger our adaptability to stress and the environment.",medium
"The results of this have been quite profound, and deserve a separate article which I'm planning to write soon.",medium
"For the sake of our analysis here, it's enough that we agree that higher HRV is better.",medium
"The Oura ring measures and reports three different quantities related to the function of the heart during our sleep: HRV, as well as the average and lowest heart rate during the night.",medium
"Looking at the plots below, we can see that these quantities are quite strongly correlated.",medium
"Nights during which my heart rate was lower, were also nights with higher HRV.",medium
"Similarly, average and lowest HR follow each other quite closely, with the average usually being around 5-7 beats higher than the minimum.",medium
The plots below show how my heart rate and HRV vary with the amount of caffeine in my blood at the time I went to bed.,medium
"As one might expect, we see that caffeine seems to have a slightly negative impact on my rest, increasing my heart rate and decreasing my heart rate variability.",medium
"Overall, my data seems to suggest that as long as I don't overdo it with the caffeine, my coffee habit doesn't affect my sleep too badly.",medium
The next variable I want to look at is how active I was during the day.,medium
I didn't doubt that exercise had a positive effect on my sleep over the long term.,medium
"One possible explanation could be that exercise reduces stress, and on days on which I exercised a lot, I was considerably more relaxed.",medium
Maybe this mental effect and lower stress hormones more than made up for my tired body.,medium
"Or it might be that I exercised more on days on which I already felt particularly good and well-rested, and this carried on into the night.",medium
One variable that did however behave as expected was the restlessness of my sleep.,medium
"In accordance with my subjective perception, more exercise did seem to lead to more restless sleep (although unfortunately, I'm not sure what unit",medium
"Oura's Restless Sleep metric is in, or what exactly it measures, so I might also be misinterpreting this a bit).Often after a tough workout, especially if it was later in the day",medium
"Despite this, exercise for me seems to have a positive effect not just over the long term, but immediately.",medium
"Next, onto a variable whose effects are less subtle and difficult to interpret: alcohol.",medium
Plotting my heart metrics against the amount of alcohol I consumed shows without a shadow of a doubt that alcohol is bad for my sleep and recovery.,medium
"Beyond a little bit of alcohol, the next day's readiness score drops considerably.",medium
"While the effect is not as strong as on the other variables, my breathing does appear to slightly speed up when I had more than one drink.",medium
"For this reason, I have also excluded days with Quite a bit or A lot of alcohol from all scatter plots presented in this article, such as the activity and caffeine plots above.",medium
"As I've shown in my previous article, not doing this can easily lead to some strange (and faulty) conclusions, like more caffeine appearing to lower my heart rate.",medium
"In reality, most factors probably have long term correlations and effects on each other.",medium
A single particularly good or bad night does not stand in isolation but affects the following days and nights as well.,medium
Fully unraveling and understanding the complicated relationships between these interlinked variables over time is pretty much impossible with the data on hand.,medium
But a simple and hopefully still enlightening first step is to look at moving averages over time.,medium
"The first is due to me not tracking caffeine and alcohol for a while in mid-2019, whereas the second one is due to my Oura ring breaking.",medium
"Once I told them, they immediately sent me a free replacement ring.",medium
Great customer service!)Especially the gap from late December 2019 to May 2020 is particularly unfortunate.,medium
"But while they were intense, it was a very positive and rewarding intensity, much more eustress than distress.",medium
"I poured a lot of energy and focus into it, but also got a lot of energy and a sense of purpose and meaning back from it.",medium
I'm wondering if part of my seemingly increasing stress that's apparent in the data is a result of this.,medium
"With the data gap, it's just speculation, but it looks like my 2020 actually started out pretty well and only went into a steady decline after the book launch in May.",medium
"Ironically, but not too surprisingly, removing the acute eustress of this meaningful project might have led to a slow creep of distress.",medium
"We talk about this in our book, in the form of the ancient concept of Noble Leisure.",medium
The best form of leisure is often very active and infused with a strong sense of meaning.,medium
"In addition to that, I am also aware of some other stressors in my life during this time period, about which I might write in a future article.",medium
"However, on this last point, Oura recently released their own internal study of pandemic trends titled What if Social Distancing is Good For Our Health?",medium
"They also found that, with social distancing in place and most people staying home more, sleep times became longer and more stable over the week, all factors contributing to better sleep and improved heart metrics.",medium
I guess I'm a bit of an outlier in that data.,medium
"I have always been quite fortunate to make my own sleep schedule, possibly even more so in the past than in the latter half of 2020, making me maybe even more of an anomaly.",medium
One other potential contributor to my overall decline in HRV and an increase in resting HR might be found in the following plot.,medium
"Inspired by the above mentioned Oura study, I decided to also look at how my values vary over the average week.",medium
"The results turned out almost comical, with a consistent increase in stress markers over the week.",medium
One thing to note is that the variance is significantly increased on the weekend.,medium
"This is not surprising, since those are the days I'm most likely to go out and have a few drinks, which also explains why the stress markers keep increasing on the weekend.",medium
Removing all days with Quite a bit or A lot of alcohol shows a slightly different picture.,medium
"Now stress markers peak on Friday, or rather in the night from Thursday to Friday, and then start dipping again over the weekend.",medium
This aligns quite nicely with the average presented in the Oura study.,medium
"Saturday to Sunday still has a slight decrease in HRV and increase in HR, suggesting that even with the alcohol removed from the equation my sleep quality is worse during that night.",medium
This might be explained by the fact that this is also the night I'm most likely to spend with my girlfriend.,medium
"Why We Sleep, confirms this and even suggests a sleep divorce.",medium
"He and his long-term partner are practicing it themselves, sleeping in separate bedrooms and during their own ideal sleep window:I know how miserable and awful",medium
The time I go to bed also varies somewhat predictably throughout the week.,medium
"When including the nights I got out and drink, my weekends have by far the most variance and are shifted towards later sleep times.",medium
"Removing the days of moderate to high alcohol consumption, my average bedtime is much more stable throughout the week, sometime between 11 p.m. and midnight.",medium
"In this case, the night from Saturday to Sunday actually has one of my earliest bedtimes (possibly also because I might have been out late and drinking the previous night, and am now having a recovery",medium
Especially in 2020 I rarely went to bed past 1 a.m. and was usually in bed by midnight.,medium
"Part of this is probably due to the fact that going out just wasn't a thing in 2020, and in previous years the occasional night out might have pushed the moving average to later times.",medium
"While at a first glance this might look like a positive development, I'm not so sure about it.",medium
Maybe this positive association just comes from a culture that is built for and around morning people (which I am definitely not).In June 2020,medium
"If boozy nights are included, my weekend nights show significant variation.",medium
"However, once they are removed that variation drops, and Saturday to Sunday night becomes the night of most sleep, with an average of around 9.5 hours.",medium
"In general, my sleep duration is very healthy at around 8 to 9 hours.",medium
"But I know just how important sleep is for me, and how poorly I perform on little sleep.",medium
"Less than 8 hours and the next day won't be great, less than 7 hours and it will be pretty miserable.",medium
"It mostly stays above 8 hours, with 2020 actually appearing to be my year of longest overall sleep (which is again similar to Oura's findings on their average user).But all sleep is not created equal.",medium
"To understand a bit better at what's actually going on, let's take a look at the science of sleep phases.",medium
"To really understand and appreciate what sleep is and how it supports our health and creativity, we have to look at our brains.",medium
"Quoting from my book Time Off, which has an entire chapter dedicated to sleep:In addition, deep sleep is also responsible for memory consolidation.",medium
"It's the diligent librarian that makes sure nothing gets lost, everything is filed in the right place, and memories get efficient tags and cross-references.",medium
"REM sleep on the other hand is the phase during which dreaming occurs, and it's a creative powerhouse, as well as a tool for us to process emotions.",medium
"It makes us more emotionally stable, and as a result, more empathetic and understanding of others.",medium
"Everything that doesn't fall into these two phases can, oversimplifying things a bit, be categorized as light sleep.",medium
"While few people question the accuracy of Oura's heart rate and HRV measurements, there is some ongoing debate about how good it is at identifying the different sleep stages.",medium
"However, even if the data is potentially not 100% accurate, as long as it is consistent there is still valuable.",medium
So let's take a look at how my ratios of different sleep phases change with the total sleep duration.,medium
"While the amount of light sleep seems to be fairly independent of sleep duration, deep sleep and REM sleep definitely show some correlation.",medium
"The longer I sleep, the less deep sleep and the more REM sleep",medium
"Then, as the night progresses, our sleep shifts more and more towards REM sleep.",medium
"The final cycles of sleep, especially if we get a full night of sleep, are dominated by REM sleep.",medium
"Thus, many of us who cut our sleep short on a regular basis, consistently do not get the full benefits of REM sleep, including boosted creativity, better emotional regulation, and stress relief.",medium
"Another factor that can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of sleep, even if we get enough hours, is alcohol.",medium
"Alcohol clearly kills my deep sleep, leading to more light sleep instead.",medium
"Surprisingly, REM sleep seems to be more or less unaffected by alcohol.",medium
"This goes against the academic literature, which has shown that alcohol has a particularly devastating effect on REM sleep.",medium
"Subjectively, I do remember more dreams on nights when I was drinking.",medium
"However, my guess is that this is just due to lighter sleep and more frequent wake-ups, not due to actually dreaming more.",medium
It's possible that some of the effects caused by alcohol look similar to Oura's sensors as REM sleep does.,medium
"From the literature, I would have expected earlier sleep times leading to more deep sleep, and later sleep times to more REM, but this was not the case.",medium
"Similar to alcohol, more caffeine seems to increase light sleep at the expense of deep sleep, leaving REM mostly unaffected.",medium
"Just as for the heart metrics, the negative effects on sleep phases seem to come most strongly above a certain threshold, but even at lower values, there might be some effect here.",medium
"However, as I've mentioned in my last article on this, sleep latency is a metric",medium
I'm particularly skeptical about and don't think Oura is very good at detecting accurately.,medium
"Especially long latencies seem to be drastically underestimated by the ring, probably due to me moving around in bed so much that it thinks I'm not even in bed yet.",medium
"Looking at each day in isolation shows some interesting correlations, but it also misses out on the time-series aspect of the data.",medium
The effect becomes clearer when plotting the total amount of REM sleep I've been getting each night by itself.,medium
"I've noticed this for a while just by looking at my daily values and reflecting on how I feel, but seeing it plotted as a trend like this really drives home this point.",medium
"Whether or not Oura's estimate of REM sleep is actually correct or not, I have subjectively noticed a strong correlation between my energy levels and emotional wellbeing and the amount of REM",medium
I never had to worry about job security or had to directly face any of the other stressors many people were confronted with.,medium
"I'm sure there is some collective level of anxiety that didn't go completely past me, but I don't think all the changes I personally experienced can be blamed on the pandemic.",medium
"While I've presented a lot of data and analysis here, this is only the tip of the iceberg.",medium
"The Oura ring provides a lot of additional variables that I didn't look into here, and the analysis itself was also fairly simplistic.",medium
But this simplicity is the best way to start gaining some valuable insights.,medium
"Overall, I want to be cautious reading too much into these results.",medium
The relations of the different variables are so complex that it's almost impossible to clearly identify any causality.,medium
"And even the correlations that appear in the data might be driven by some hidden third variable, as we have seen when removing high alcohol days from the data.",medium
"Also, both my own self-tracking and modeling, as well as Oura's measurements and models contain some uncertainty.",medium
"But despite the above caveats, I think even beyond this rather obvious observation there are some interesting conclusions to draw from the analysis.",medium
"For caffeine, the effect of my love for coffee is not as bad as I had feared.",medium
"Above around 70 mg of caffeine in my blood at bedtime, I risk higher resting HR, lower HRV, and more light sleep.",medium
"But as long as I keep my caffeine levels below this fairly high threshold, I shouldn't have to worry too much about affecting my sleep in a negative way.",medium
Maybe someone can point out that I just didn't look at the right studies.,medium
Maybe days on which I was already stressed made it more likely for me to drink?,medium
Attempting to answer this particular question would require to also manually track my perceived stress levels throughout the days.,medium
"Overall 2020, or at least the part for which I had data, didn't look too good for me, with many stress indicators seeming to have gotten worse over the year.",medium
"I didn't expect stress to increase so noticeably throughout the week, and I don't think it has to be that way.",medium
"I have some experiments in mind, and would also love to hear your suggestions for hitting my goals.",medium
"Whether through unbridled enthusiasm or the crush of business, work-life balance can take a beating.",medium
"This is an occupational hazard for social media marketers such as Jake Zachariah, who specializes in leadership and personal branding, and digital marketing expert Madalyn Sklar.",medium
"Fortunately for them, they have mastered the appearance of hyperactivity while carving out welcome me time.",medium
"If you're constantly on Twitter, your work and regular life might be out of balance unless being on Twitter is part of your job.",medium
"I daily block off time for rest and personal life, Zachariah said.",medium
Remember 'Do Not Disturb' on your phone along with screen time restrictions to automate quiet time from the noise.,medium
"Many systems create their own kind of chaos and anxiety, for sure, he said.",medium
Knowing which areas cause energy drain and which areas do not is important to diagnosing if there's even a problem.,medium
"Work-life balance is difficult when we're constantly connected to platforms like Twitter since it's always accessible on our smartphones, Sklar said.",medium
We have to be wise about how we're spending our time instead of scrolling and consuming content for hours on end.,medium
"One example is time spent retweeting, quote tweeting and the difference between them.",medium
Retweet as a quote is better because a mere retweet is a simple-non-involved push of a button.,medium
"When I had a smaller audience, I would reply to tweets more to find cool people, Zachariah said.",medium
"Now that I have a few more followers, I love to use quote tweets to expand the audience and involve more people.",medium
"I mostly reply to tweets because the conversation is between me and the other person, Sklar said.",medium
From time to time I do a retweet with a quote because I want to be sure to share the conversation with my community.,medium
Another way to save time online while getting maximum engagement is through polls.,medium
I have used them to play two truths and a lie to get people to know me and our staff better.,medium
Sklar suggested four ways to use Twitter polls:A Hootsuite article details How to Use Twitter Polls to Boost Engagement (Ideas and Examples).,medium
Sklar also uses Twitter polls to get feedback on an idea and learn more about her audience through entertaining questions.,medium
"With all that, people should not live, eat and breathe social media without a break.",medium
"As cool as our brains are, they aren't meant to always be on.",medium
Why do your best ideas come in the shower or at 2 a.m.?,medium
"The entire point of social media algorithms is to keep you on, he said.",medium
"Without rest, you're really being influenced at a psychological level.",medium
Sklar emphasized how important it is to disconnect for everyone's mental health.,medium
"It's not good to be so consumed in what everyone else is doing or sharing, she said.",medium
You're not going to miss anything that important if you step away for a little while.,medium
"Always allow yourself time away from social media to rest and recharge, Sklar said.",medium
It's easy to get caught up in the opinions of others and general negativity online.,medium
Sometimes you just need to be by yourself and shut out the outside world.,medium
Going back to draw on oldies-but-goodies evergreen content gives you a Twitter presence without having to do much work.,medium
Someone else reading may feel inspired to take some time off and balance their work-life schedule a bit more because of what you share.,medium
"Don't be afraid to let people know when you're taking a break from social media, Sklar said.",medium
"This way, they'll know you aren't actively online and checking your notifications.",medium
"You can also share 'real life' content mixed in with business posts to show people what you get up to when you're not working, she said.",medium
It just might inspire them to take a work break of their own.,medium
It helps take a load off so you can achieve work-life balance.,medium
"In the good old days, online work and play could turn into real-life work and play.",medium
"The more stressed out and anxious you are, the lower quality will be for your content and replies.",medium
"If you're overwhelmed and 'go dark,' that's not good.",medium
"I love the idea of life-work balance instead of work-life balance, he said.",medium
Sklar has reinforced her beliefs for constructive pauses through three decades of experience.,medium
"As a social media marketer, I see the value in social media for building your brand, she said.",medium
Scheduling content ahead of time allows me to do this while ensuring I always have new content going out.,medium
"To mindfully reduce time spent on social media, block out an hour or so in the morning to load a day's worth of tweets on TweetDeck.",medium
Then you could scoot out for a day or weekend with few being the wiser.,medium
I love screen time on my devices to limit my exposure to the addiction of always being connected.,medium
You know you're getting the content out there without always running around to create it.,medium
"That's 100 percent the best way to do it, Zachariah said.",medium
Being mindful about your time on social media is as important as being mindful about your time with family.,medium
"If you have an iPhone, the screen time feature can help you reduce the amount of time you're spending on social media and on your phone in general, she said.",medium
"You can use screen time to set time limits for specific apps like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and any others",medium
Listen to what it says to make sure you're home on time.,medium
"To set boundaries, start small and adjust based on how you feel, Zachariah said.",medium
"If you're not feeling a work-life balance right now, you're not going to feel it magically tomorrow after setting boundaries.",medium
"Give yourself a schedule to check Twitter and other social media or work, he said.",medium
Block off small portions of time at first and adjust as you grow comfortable with setting boundaries.,medium
"I have hundreds - and hundreds and hundreds - of muted words, Zachariah said.",medium
Don't get dragged into content and conversations you don't want to have.,medium
"It's beneficial to set certain times during the day to log onto Twitter, Sklar said.",medium
Then you'll be less likely to check notifications randomly throughout the day.,medium
"Maybe set Twitter check-ins for the morning, mid-day and evening.",medium
Get down to work much later as you get acquainted with others.,medium
"Aim for casual know, like and trust before you ever get to the world of marketing.",medium
"Link up with people who value a work-life balance, Zachariah said.",medium
It also can be the 'life' part of the balance.,medium
It helps to carry those connections away from the social platform to boost the rest of life's pleasures.,medium
"Rather than building anxiety, going online can be a welcome relief valve.",medium
"For many people, social media is actually a way to de-stress after a long day, Sklar said.",medium
Who doesn't want to go online and watch a few funny videos after a day of work?,medium
How you spend your time on social media doesn't always have to be work-related.,medium
Avoiding Twitter burnout is as easy - and hard - as putting the phone down.,medium
"Limit how much time you spend on Twitter each day, Sklar said.",medium
"If you allow yourself hours to scroll through your feed, you'll probably do it.",medium
"Take care of your body: eat, sleep, exercise, Zachariah said.",medium
Then get ready for your day - and don't check social last before going to sleep.,medium
"Also remember that you can easily follow too many accounts, he said.",medium
There's only so many people who realistically fit in your brain space.,medium

"Now, I could move on and delete dancing Karo from the Great Wall.",medium
It was a normal afternoon in the office; I was working on an investment memorandum when my phone rang.,medium
"I went outside, picked up, and the voice on the phone said:What the fuck.",medium
The first thing I did was calling my parents and telling them I am moving to China in 2 months.,medium
"For the first time, I didn't follow the safe way.",medium
My perspective changed from a small-town girl to an international professional.,medium
"I learned so much about myself, cultural differences, and of course, I learned to speak Mandarin.",medium
I wouldn't be the same person without all the amazing people I met on my way and all the obstacles and wonderful moments I experienced.,medium
It is hilarious when people hear I lived in China for 5 years,medium
They think I have a talent for languages and I am a high-achiever.,medium
"But the truth is I am still the same average person, the only thing which changed is my mindset.",medium
Here is what I learned since this pivotal moment 8 years ago.,medium
"We are all just normal people, no matter what it says in our CV's.",medium
"When things don't go as expected, then have faith everything will be great just in another way.",medium
"At this moment, you might not understand why things are how they are, but whatever is going to happen, you will be fine.",medium
"Often we think about what we consider crucial decisions forever, but they actually don't matter that much.",medium
"And there is no fixed path, you can reinvent yourself at any time.",medium
I had such a limited perspective before moving to a foreign country.,medium
"To become the best version of yourself, you need to experience things outside your normal circle of influence.",medium
Your learning curve will speed up when you expose yourself to the unknown.,medium
"You will learn to see things from different angles, which makes you a better person and problem solver.",medium
"Everything has a price, an upfront investment you have to make.",medium
"Often we cannot see the fruits of our work directly, but long-term, your action will pay off.",medium
"Writing the application was hard work on top of my job, but it paid off.",medium
"When I was 24, I never imagined my life would turn out how it did.",medium
I could not have come up with this grand plan for myself.,medium
"Trust the universe and your progress and enjoy every second of this amazing gift, your life.",medium
"Take the opportunities given to you, they might change your life in wonderful ways.",medium

Food is a huge part of the experience whenever I go traveling.,medium
"When I'm doing some research before I go to a certain place, I always include top restaurants to eat in or top foods to try out.",medium
"As soon as the plane lands and we're on our way to the hotel or the Airbnb, I'm on the lookout for food stalls or restaurants that are close by.",medium
It's not just because I like eating (although I believe that plays a huge part too).,medium
It's that every country expresses a great deal about itself through its food.,medium
"For example, if you were to visit McDonald's in every country, you'd find that the food tastes different depending on the country you are in.",medium
"In some cases, they even have items on the menu that you wouldn't be able to find in any other McDonald's in any other country.",medium
Their menu and the dishes they serve vary and adapt according to a country's tastes.,medium
You've got countries that always have a certain spice they add to their dish.,medium
You've got countries that build their food around a certain flavor or taste.,medium
You've got countries that have become well-known because of a certain dish.,medium
One of my favorite places to visit and go on a food trip is Taiwan.,medium
"I'm very partial to Chinese food, which has proven to be my comfort food on more than one occasion.",medium
"Here are some X foods I think everybody should try when they go to Taiwan:Of course, we'll start with this controversial dish.",medium
A lot of people avoid stinky tofu when it comes to Taiwanese street food because of the smell.,medium
"However, in my opinion, it doesn't smell too bad.",medium
"It's just fermented, and a little fermentation is good for your stomach.",medium
"Stinky tofu is often served with some spicy sauce and cabbages and carrots on the side, which makes the dish really delicious and healthy.",medium
"I've tried different kinds of stinky tofu in Taiwan, but my favorite is the one in Raohe Night Market.",medium
The stinky tofu is perfect there - crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.,medium
Bomb pancakes are also known as scallion pancakes or green onion pancakes.,medium
"They are deep-fried dough made from green onions and flour, topped with some garlic, a half-cooked egg, and a soy sauce that they say is a secret recipe.",medium
"The result is a delicious, chewy street food you won't easily forget.",medium
They are called bomb pancakes because of the runny yolk in the half-cooked eggs as well as the fact that the word fried egg sounds like bomb in Chinese.,medium
Think of it as a little burrito that is filled with ice cream instead of meat and vegetables.,medium
It's one of the most popular street foods in Taiwan and you'll often see it in popular tourist spots.,medium
"The best place to have it, however, is in Ximending, the place of shops and nightlife.",medium
"There, the line is so long, it sometimes takes 20-30 minutes before your number is called.",medium
"It's worth it, though, but you'd better order everything you want to keep from falling in line again.",medium
"While their most popular item on the menu is their large fried chicken, they offer other items, too, like squid rings, tofu, tempura, mushrooms, and more.",medium
"When my siblings and I were younger, one of our favorite books was Little Pear by Eleanor Frances Lattimore.",medium
"Little Pear was a little boy living in a Chinese village and he was extremely fond of tanghulus, which was described as candied fruit.",medium
Imagine our joy when we got to Taiwan and we heard them calling out Tanghulu!,medium
"Of course, we had to try them and they became an instant favorite",medium
"All of them are coated with sugar so if you eat it fresh off the stall just as they make it, it can be deliciously warm and crispy sometimes.",medium
"Even before we arrived in Taiwan, we knew we just had to have their beef noodle soup.",medium
"Since we don't know the Chinese language very well yet, we memorized the symbol for the beef noodle soup and would keep a lookout for it at almost every restaurant.",medium
They did not disappoint!One of the best beef noodle soups we had was in the food court of Taiwan Main Station.,medium
"They have large bowls of beef noodle soup - some of the spicy, some of them just the regular kind - as well as other dishes.",medium
"This is a very popular dessert in Taiwan and you can have it in two different ways, too - hot or cold.",medium
"Other shops sell it with red bean, grass jelly, tapioca balls, and other toppings, but the best one for me is in Jiufen Old Street.",medium
The taste and chewiness of the taro and sweet potato balls are just perfect.,medium
"In almost every corner you turn or every alleyway or little side street you go through, you will find milk tea stalls.",medium
"Some of them are the more popular ones, like Coco or YiFang, but sometimes, it's the little ones that taste delicious.",medium
"Some of our favorites were in the night markets of Raohe, Shida, and Shilin.",medium
"Not all the teas have milk in them, some are just plain fruit tea, but just as tasty.",medium
"A few years ago, I was about to start a business with a couple of friends.",medium
"The idea was exciting, we were motivated and were ready to launch a successful product in the market.",medium
"Upon looking back, I realized that poor execution was the result of focusing too much on the final output rather than paying attention to the work required to generate the output.",medium
Most of us believe that setting BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goals) at the start of a year will motivate us into taking action that we have been avoiding for a long time.,medium
People working in training and development would understand the meaning of SMART goals.,medium
RelevantT = Time BoundOne can set goals based on the most important outcomes that one wants to achieve.,medium
"The outcomes could be losing weight, getting a new job, starting a business, writing a book etc.",medium
"By following the method of SMART goals, one can define the relevant actions within a defined period of time to achieve one's goals.",medium
"Then, why do people still fail to achieve their goals?Some end up setting the same goals next year.",medium
"Through the SMART goals' method, one can identify the actions that will get us the outcomes we are looking for.",medium
What this method doesn't mention is how to trigger those actions consistently.,medium
"As a result, most people start a new year by taking action to achieve their goals only to lose momentum and consistency.",medium
A more useful way of achieving goals is to form habits that will help one in becoming more consistent with our actions.,medium
"First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use.",medium
"Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional.",medium
"Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.",medium
I have realized that the biggest roadblock that prevented me from taking consistent action towards my goals was not knowing the cues that trigger habits I want to avoid.,medium
"Someone wants to write a book, but they end up spending too much time watching Netflix.",medium
"Someone wants to get in shape, but they can't stop eating cookies.",medium
It is time to introspect the cues that lead us towards actions that do the opposite of achieving our goals.,medium
"Once those cues are identified, only then can we profoundly change our actions.",medium
These existing routines need to be replaced by new routines or habits that will give us a new reward of working towards the goals that we have set for ourselves.,medium
"Now that we understand that we have some control over the actions that we can take, it is time to decide which habits we want to focus on in 2021.",medium
"Using the 80/20 rule, it can be inferred that 80% of the output will be delivered due to 20% of our habits.",medium
"Hence, narrowing down the critical habits that will give us the maximum bang for the buck will save us time from working on developing non- critical habits.",medium
"If the goal is to get leaner this year, then the critical habits to focus on would be exercising, eating, and resting.",medium
Another way to identify a critical habit is to ask the question: how?,medium
Start with your goal and keep on asking the question how till you get a specific action.,medium
We can all vouch from personal experience that changing existing habits or building new ones is not an easy process.,medium
The best course of action would be to focus on 1 or 2 habits at a time.,medium
Working on 3 or more habits at a time could be overwhelming.,medium
"By now, we have narrowed down 1 or 2 critical habits.",medium
"As mentioned from the habit loop, one follows a routine to get some reward that our brain craves.",medium
"Before we change the routine, we need to change the reward our brain craves.",medium
"Strong dopamine response to consuming sugarIn this instance, the reward of strong dopamine response to sugar needs to be replaced by another reward.",medium
A new reward could be dopamine response to engaging with friends online or learning something new.,medium
"In this instance, the afternoon break from work could be spent on spending time on social media or listening to one's favourite podcast.",medium
Adopting the new routine every time on cue will help in developing the habit.,medium
The initial days are always the toughest as the cravings for the old reward are high.,medium
"Once the brain gets used to the new reward, the new routine will become a habit.",medium
"Once a new habit has been built, consistent action will be taken automatically towards the achievement of one's goals.",medium
The only way to find this out is to review this approach at the end of the year.,medium
Try changing a couple of critical habits in 2021 and see what happens at the end of the year.,medium
I will review my results at the end of 2021 and write an article talking about the results in early 2022.If,medium
Or - How to make goals into a process rather than a battleThe New Year is the time of goals.,medium
"Particularly given the hellfire that was 2020, most people in my life are looking to turn over a new leaf in the new year.",medium
"But New Year's resolutions often fail at the first hurdle, and most people end in a circle of trying, dissappointment, and reversion.",medium
"How many times have you set out to achieve a goal, and then failed it?",medium
"Sometimes, this can be because the goal isn't spercific, measurable, or realistic (basically, it isn't a SMART goal).Sometimes, though",medium
"It's a very personal question - for a close family member, not buying soft-drink at the supermarket is a success.",medium
"For someone else, it's not something they even thing about.",medium
"The personal nature of success makes it very difficult to measure scientifically, and to compare different people's successes across goals?It's a problem that occupational therapy has a solution for.",medium
"Occupational therapy focuses looks at what a person wants to do, then helps that person to figure out a way to achieve that goal - generally while working around a limitiation.",medium
"This could be a missing limb, recent domestic violence, mental health, stroke, ect.",medium
"So, how can you measure success of therapy when people's goals are so different.",medium
"Most people don't think about success as a measure, but instead as a goal.",medium
"At this point, people will very often disengage from the idea.",medium
"This is very black and white, and gives no way to measure change.",medium
It only takes into account whether or not you achieved a goal.,medium
"And it doesn't really take into account how you achieved that goal, or how well you did.",medium
"In this example, success is $200, $400, $1000 dollars.",medium
You haven't failed at life because you only managed to save 100 dollars.,medium
And it's not just success if you somehow managed to double that and save 400 dollars.,medium
How can we measure success in a way that makes sense?GAS goals.,medium
"They're used all the time in occupational therapy, and they measure all different types of success.",medium
"By measuring goals this way, you can actually start to see patterns, and progress.",medium
"But the main positive is that they show change, even if you don't reach your ultimate goal .A gas goal starts by defining what success looks like.",medium
Here's the theroy of a gas goal:Let's take the example above:Everything after this is personal.,medium
You will use this goal time and time again - it's made to be used over time.,medium
"So you set the parameters at the start, and then you can measure progress over time.",medium
"So for me personally, I would say saving 300 or over dollars is +2, 250 is +1, 100 dollars is -1, less than 50 is -2.Thus:",medium
"For someone else, it's entirely possible they would struggle to save 100, so they might have -1",medium
Let's say you save 160 because you drank some wine at that one dinner out.,medium
At that is the beauty of gas goals - they only measure success.,medium
"Shame, productivity, self-care (both responsible and self destructive) play themselves out in most millenial's minds.",medium
"It can help you move out of that cycle of self-recrimination, and onto a much more productive question:How did I actually do, and where am I headed next.",medium
"I enjoyed many of the usual comforts - warm weather, sunlight and pool water so warm if shampoo was involved it would have been a bath.",medium
I'm used to all that and frankly am happy to do my part in stifling the spread of the virus.,medium
"Shooting an 86 on a rather tough golf course should have sent me over the moon, but I found myself barely excited.",medium
"Every time I opened my phone, turned on the TV or joined in a conversation, I was reminded of the horrific problems plaguing this country.",medium
"Neighbors, friends, family members constantly at odds with one another.",medium
My sister Emily has an excellent descriptor for what Florida means to our family.,medium
"The nature of my grandfather's house, the restaurants we frequent (in normal times that is), the games we play, the activities we do.",medium
But now the problems of the world have encroached on our sacred place.,medium
The divisiveness and anger and name-calling have made their presence known.,medium
"No, not in bumper to bumper traffic on Chicago's Interstate 90 on a Friday afternoon.",medium
I'm talking about listening to all the music and podcasts you haven't had time for.,medium
"I'm talking about taking in the sights and sounds of the countryside, unseen when flying 6 miles above the Earth.",medium
"I'm talking about the freedom to let your mind wander, to let your imagination run wild, to let your long-since-forgotten desire to explore come to the forefront.",medium
"Bonita Springs, FL to Palatine, IL (30 miles outside Chicago): 1,350 glorious miles.",medium
It's about 350 miles from my grandfather's house to the Georgia border.,medium
"Broken up by bridges and rivers and bays here and there, it mostly involves shooting up Interstate 75 in long, boring stretches with trees limiting your view on both sides.",medium
"It's gray, dull, and snows so infrequently the remnants lay there in giant clumps for weeks on end, nasty from dirt and soot and trash.",medium
"And coming from someone who sees very little green or sun from November through March, this is a welcome respite.",medium
"As I push North at 79 miles an hour, there is very little traffic.",medium
"Aside from Tampa, there are few large cities along the interstate to slow you down.",medium
"Florida might be really long and really flat, but it's also really fast.",medium
I find myself daydreaming about living some place where it's green year round.,medium
Some place where I'm bathed in sunlight 300+ days a year and where it's never too cold to run or bike or be outside.,medium
"I press on, boosted by my thoughts of what if .Georgia.",medium
"First comes Valdosta, right near the state line, then Atlanta, one of the largest Metropolitan areas in the US, then onwards towards Chattanooga and the Tennessee border.",medium
The luscious palm trees and giant maples have been replaced with pines and firs and red clay as far as the eye can see.,medium
The Interstate curves and winds and goes up and down and to the side.,medium
"While the Chicago Loop is high and mighty, Atlanta seems to stretch on forever.",medium
"As I navigate through spurts of intermittent traffic, I look at the faces of the motorists around me.",medium
Do I even know?Mumford & Sons' second studio album Babel comes across my music queue.,medium
"If there was ever an album written for a road trip, it's this one.",medium
"The steady flow of the guitar, banjo and bass, the smooth lyrics and the toe-tapping beats fill my energy bar back up.",medium
I think momentarily about turning around and heading back to Bonita Springs.,medium
My vision is starting to blur from double-digit hours focused on the road.,medium
The lights of the cars behind me dart around like fireflies in the wind.,medium
"The areas surrounding the city of Chattanooga, TN might be one of my favorite spots in the continental United States.",medium
"The moon sits high in the East, casting short shadows over the looming foothills.",medium
The Interstate bends and weaves through the valleys and up the hillsides.,medium
I rock side to side ever so slightly in cadence with the music.,medium
Is she looking up at the moon too?I listen to Ghosts That We Knew for the 7th time as I pull into the parking lot of the hotel.,medium
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the lightCause,medium
I will hold as long as you likeJust promise me we'll be alright.,medium
Interstate 65 between Nashville and Louisville is a truly wondrous part of the country.,medium
The horse farms are different than the bean and corn farms of the midwest.,medium
"Barbed wire and wooden fencing encompass wide plains of grass, trees and mud.",medium
I pull into what has to be the 10th rest stop of my journey.,medium
A sister and a brother and a puppy hop out of the back as mom issues instructions.,medium
Sister and brother shriek in delight as they chase their new best friend around in the grass.,medium
Do I love anything as much as those children loved playing with that puppy on the side of the highway?I pass Indianapolis.,medium
"I'm about an hour North of the city when, in the distance, I catch my first glimpse.",medium
"They're hard to see at first, I have to squint hard in the late afternoon light.",medium
I'm not talking about the thirty-foot rinky-dink windmills you see in the movies.,medium
"Some turbines spin fast, others slow, others not at all.",medium
I'm constantly battling the urge to gaze upward as I continue to weave in and out of the traffic that's slowly building.,medium
And how in the HELL do you stand one of them up?These are,medium
The Chicago skyline beckons in the distance like a long-lost friend as I prepare to cross the Skyway back into Illinois.,medium
"After two weeks in someone else's bed and far too many hours in the car, my one bedroom apartment is starting to feel like Buckingham Palace.",medium
Daredevils shoot in and out of my lane to save mere seconds of drive time.,medium
"The last parts of my journey include flying Northwest on Interstate 294, exiting at Willow Road.",medium
"Then, a few more streets until at last I'm home.",medium
Humanity is really good at solving problems halfway while simultaneously creating new ones.,medium
But what I do know is I felt much better getting out of the car than I did getting in.,medium
"I haven't had that much time for self-reflection and meditation in quite some time, while listening to some truly extraordinary music.",medium
"Turns out, driving across the country is not just driving across the country.",medium

Le Pays Basque is a laid-back part of the world where the smell of the ocean and fresh morning pastries dance in the air at the start of each day.,medium
"I wonder what it's like in Biarritz, France, on a day like today.",medium
"A year and a half ago this place took hold of me like the tide of the sea; once in its grip, I didn't want to let go.",medium
"Being there makes you breathe deep, slow down, and take a look around.",medium
"When we do, I hope we remember this time of longing.",medium
"Every experience, from a trip around the world to dinner with friends, shall be a celebration of life.",medium
Biarritz is one of Southwest France's essential towns and is considered by many the surf capital of Europe.,medium
I can't think of a better place to go when this is all said and done.,medium
My brother and I arrived in Biarritz on an overcast and humid morning.,medium
The breeze from the sea immediately welcomed us after stepping off the plane from Paris onto the small runway.,medium
The unmistakable scent of the Atlantic Ocean filled me to the brim with joy.,medium
We rented a car and drove slowly through the outskirts of town.,medium
"As we did, we passed aged wooden farmhouses and cafes whose pastel colors had faded from the salty air.",medium
Surf culture took over Biarritz in the 1960s and changed the face of this erstwhile whaling town rooted in Basque tradition.,medium
"Surrounding Biarritz are many villages and towns full of rich history, unique stories, and nuanced ways of living.",medium
"Considered one of the oldest spoken languages in the world, perhaps even the oldest, the Basque language is gritty and passionate.",medium
"The spirit of Le Pays Basque is simple, pure, and incredibly beautiful.",medium
The green and brown Pyrenees mountains are speckled with white snow and provide a marvelous backdrop to the region.,medium
"In the cold winter months, the mountain snow may travel to the seaside towns as it had recently.",medium
"On one of our outings, my brother and I spoke with a local surfer while we visited the neighboring village of Guéthary.",medium
"He told us that the winter before we were there, the beaches were covered in snow.",medium
"I'd been waiting to take a page out of one of my favorite books, Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises.",medium
"I had to begin with some shellfish and a beer, followed by a dip in the water.",medium
I outdid myself with a plate of massive shrimp that appeared to have met their maker just moments before arriving at the table.,medium
"Sitting outside on a cobblestone street, eating, drinking, and watching the world go by is one of life's most wonderful pleasures.",medium
"When the world opens up, we mustn't take these moments for granted.",medium
The ocean became a pale grey-blue as we prepared to jump in before a late dinner.,medium
The tide had risen and the waves crashed against the stone staircase leading down to one of the small inlets off the boardwalk.,medium
"I swam far out to sea, taking in the summer rain.",medium
"Being on the Atlantic side of France, the ocean is colder and rougher than the Mediterranean.",medium
My body felt good as I waded in the water and looked back at the city.,medium
The evening festivities began to commence among the charcoal background of dusk.,medium
"Martin's Church sits in Port Vieux, the center of the town, and looms over the surrounding bistros and surf shops.",medium
"The cathedral is a reminder of this city's medieval history, a fascinating cultural blend of the past and present.",medium
The cathedral sitting next to the crashing waves is one of the most beautiful sceneries I've been lucky enough to witness.,medium
"The next morning the aroma of fresh coffee and pastries rose from the bakeries and intertwined with the crisp, damp air.",medium
"I made my way down to the dock, observing the stillness of the fishing boats as their reflections glistened off the algae green water.",medium
"I wanted to get lost among the labyrinthian trails and walkways that make up the city's cliffs, so I bobbed in and out and ran into a few field mice along the way.",medium
"On one side of town is la Grande Plage, the city's main beach to lounge and enjoy the baking sun.",medium
"In 1854, the last French monarch Napoleon III and his wife, Eugénie de Montijo, constructed their summer home in Biarritz.",medium
The estate was originally called Villa Eugénie and is now the Hotel Du Palais.,medium
The city's famed hotel provides a charming site to marvel at on a boardwalk stroll.,medium
Off Port Vieux is an island about a quarter-mile out to sea.,medium
"Mother Mary's statue sits atop a man-made hill, blessing fishers as they set out for the day.",medium
I was there early along with a lone fisherman trying his luck.,medium
"I asked in my best French, so I'm sure it was rough.",medium
"Yes, he replied with a subtle smile, one I wouldn't be able to discern through a mask.",medium
It was connections like this between two strangers enjoying the simplicities of life that makes traveling a bridge between people.,medium
"I henceforth strive to truly appreciate these moments, whether traveling or in my hometown.",medium
This world is all of ours; it's connections like this one I'll always remember.,medium
"They're not biting today, the man remarked as he patiently gazed into the water's glassy surface.",medium
"He returned to his bait, attached a small fish to his line, and kept at it.",medium
"Around the other side of Port Vieux is the beach, La Cote des Basques.",medium
"Extola Bibi sits on the overlooking cliff, a small beach cafe to grab a beer or coffee after a surf or a day at the beach.",medium
My brother and I went for sunset one evening and split a bottle of local wine with cheese and crusty bread.,medium
"We watched the final surf sessions of the day while the golden, darkening sky blended with the shade of the ocean.",medium
The sounds of clinking glasses and lively chatter surrounded my brother and me.,medium
"We spent our days exploring the different beaches, towns, and various unique restaurants.",medium
I'd not known much about the Basque Country before this trip.,medium
"The people who give it spirit, the architecture that gives it charm, and the history that gives it meaning captured my heart.",medium
"After spending time in Southwest France, it's evident what qualities matter in life.",medium
"As I think back on the trip, I'm reminded to let the unnecessary worries, negativity, and fear fade away.",medium
"There's so much to appreciate, no matter where we are.",medium
"On my final night, I went down to the Grande Plage to watch the lighthouse scan the water.",medium
"I walked down the boardwalk towards the lighthouse, laid down on a bench, and closed my eyes to listen.",medium
"Join my Saturday Newsletter to receive my latest published stories and podcast episode, plus all that has me thinking, smiling, and dreaming of more.",medium
"For as long as I can remember, I've been at war with goals.",medium
"Each one of the goals I followed came with a subset of exhausting smaller goals and modest, yet painful, sacrifices.",medium
"I was meeting the goals I'd adopted from my parents, but I wasn't happy.",medium
"To make things harder, by senior year, I'd realized that I was a lesbian.",medium
"In 2009, this meant that not only could I not get married, but I also had to keep my sexuality hidden or risk losing my apartment and my job.",medium
I struggled under the weight of my secret and wondered how I could possibly achieve a goal when the law rendered it nearly impossible.,medium
"Those goals crumbled and, though I grieved them, losing them opened space for me to define new goals completely outside of the framework of what I'd been taught to aim for.",medium
"I wanted to find love, security, and a queer community.",medium
"So I took out a credit card, quit my job, and moved to Los Angeles.",medium
"I'd hated the formal requirements of my desk job, so in LA I learned to bartend.",medium
Tending bar granted me a joy I didn't realize it was possible to feel at work.,medium
I started to make friends and I focused on making sure I didn't regret a moment of my time in LA.,medium
"Within a year, I'd built a life that was the exact opposite of the one I'd had in Virginia.",medium
"For years, I assumed that the happiness I felt in those first few years on the west coast was simply a result of finding my place in the world.",medium
"While I believe that helped, I think something much more universal was at play - something that any person can tap into no matter where they are.",medium
Months of quarantine have afforded me ample time to reflect on the ups and downs of my life in California.,medium
"It started off jubilant but, at some point a few years in, I found myself struggling to maintain my joy.",medium
"After a lot of introspection and a ton of therapy, I learned that when I first moved to LA, I was living a value-oriented life.",medium
"I wanted to have fun, make enough money to live independently, feel safe to be myself, connect with other people, and make a home for myself.",medium
"These were pursuits that I could weave into my daily life, where the success didn't just come from the end result, but included the journey as well.",medium
Each action I took that contributed to the successful expression of these values gave me joy and fulfillment.,medium
"In it, LaPorte walks readers through the process of choosing three to five words that perfectly encapsulate how they want to feel every day.",medium
"After readers determine the precise words that speak to them, those words become a roadmap for daily living.",medium
"For every action and decision, readers learn to ask themselves, Does this make me feel the way I want to feel?",medium
"I didn't realize it at the time, but LaPorte's book provided the guidance I needed to finalize my shift away from goal-oriented living.",medium
My value-oriented life was an organic result of wanting to feel good.,medium
The Desire Map gave me a framework to make that focus on values intentional and maintain it as I continued to evolve.,medium
"For years, I committed to returning to the book annually to update my values and reaffirm my commitment to prioritizing a value-oriented life.",medium
"Without a new framework to keep me focused on values, I shifted back to goal-oriented living.",medium
"I left food service for the perceived security of an office job and I began to strive for flashier titles, higher salaries, and recognition.",medium
"I've achieved a few of my goals, but they only serve to give me a small spark of dopamine as I check off one box and move on to tackle the next.",medium
"As I discussed my difficulty finding joy with my therapist, I realized that I've been struggling to celebrate my wins because I've lost sight of the beauty of the journey.",medium
"In 2020, most of us felt the gravity of the pandemic, isolation, financial uncertainty, systemic racism, and the development of a new normal.",medium
"As we wait for the COVID vaccine to reach the masses and continue to fight for a more equal world, 2021 is likely to carry similar hurdles.",medium
"As uncertainty swirls around us, I suggest that we all find a way to experience joy in our daily lives, no matter how small.",medium
This isn't to say that goals are bad - I think they're incredibly useful for staying aligned with your values.,medium
Figure out the values that guide you and then set goals in service of those values.,medium
Anything too big (like aiming for a specific professional title by the end of the year) leads me to stress and diminishes the fun.,medium
Instead I made a professional goal to play in photoshop a few times a month because I value strengthening my creative muscles.,medium

You're going to associate some of that with relevance and self-worth.,medium

It can be hard to choose the sleeping bag temperature that will be best for you.,medium
"The most important function of a sleeping bag is keep to you warm when it's cold out, but you also don't want to sweat all night when it's warm out.",medium
Finding the right balance can be difficult enough that a lot of serious outdoors-folk have multiple bags.,medium
"However, the normal, a budget-conscious recreationist like myself can't always afford multiple, quality sleeping bags.",medium
"So how can you choose a sleeping bag that will keep you comfortable in multiple seasons?If you're looking for one sleeping bag to use year-round,",medium
"During the winter months, you can add a liner to increase the warmth.",medium
"In warmer climates, you may want to bump the temperature up by 10 °F, or so.",medium
"If you do mostly summer-time trips, a 30 °F sleeping bag should keep you comfortable.",medium
"When you select a sleeping bag, make sure it is rated using EN or ISO testing standards.",medium
If your sleeping bag is not tested by these standards there is a good chance it won't be as warm as advertised.,medium
"I've made a guide about the EN and ISO sleeping bag temperature ratings, so you know what the ratings mean and how to determine the protocols used to test the bag.",medium
To decide what temperature sleeping bag you should get you first need to know when you will be using the sleeping bag.,medium
If most of your camping or backpacking is in the desert during summer you don't need a 0 °F bag.,medium
"On the other hand, if you spend a lot of time doing backcountry ski trips in the winter, you don't want to get a 30 ° F bag.",medium
If you mostly use a sleeping bag while car camping the temperature rating won't be as important because you can easily bring extra blankets and clothes to use if you get cold.,medium
It's also important to consider the terrain you'll be sleeping in.,medium
Temperatures in the mountains can change dramatically as storms quickly roll in.,medium
That's why I usually take a sleeping bag that is warmer than I think I'll need when in the mountains because I want to be prepared if I encounter colder temperatures.,medium
"Desert temperatures can drop a lot at night, but the weather patterns are generally more stable and predictable.",medium
"Think about where you're going to spend the most time sleeping outside, then determine what the weather is like in those locations.",medium
"Once you've decided on those things, picking a temperature rating becomes much easier.",medium
"For single-season use, it's pretty simple to choose a sleeping bag temperature rating.",medium
Look up the average low temperatures for the locations you usually visit during the season you're there.,medium
Then find a sleeping bag with a temperature rating slightly lower than that average low temperature.,medium
"For a summer sleeping bag, a temperature rating between 20 °F and 40 °F should be adequate, depending on your location.",medium
In winter you'll probably want a bag rated between -10 °F and 10 °F.,medium
"For spring and summer, a 20 °F to 30 ° F bag should do the trick.",medium
"Of course, adjust these recommendations for the specific areas you visit.",medium
Choosing a sleeping bag temperature is more complicated when you want to use it across multiple seasons.,medium
"In this case, you need to balance staying warm enough when it's cold against being uncomfortably warm when it's not.",medium
"It's always best to lean toward a warmer bag because you can always unzip it or sleep on top of it, but you can't add extra warmth when it gets really cold.",medium
If you spend time in the mountains from late spring through early fall I would recommend a 20 °F temperature rating.,medium
You can get a 20 °F bag that isn't too heavy or expensive but will still perform in a lot of situations.,medium
If you're in a warmer or colder climate you may want to adjust by 10 ° F or so in either direction.,medium
"For those that regularly sleep outside in both warm summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures, it's probably best to get two sleeping bags.",medium
"Get one with a 20 °F-30 °F rating (again, depending on location) to use in the warmer months.",medium
Then get another sleeping bag with a -10 °F to 0 ° F rating for the cold months.,medium
I've already mentioned that I take a warmer sleeping bag than I think I'll need when I go into the mountains.,medium
"In the backcountry, you only have the supplies you carry with you.",medium
If an unexpected cold front comes in when you're a 2-day hike from resources you have to make do with what you have.,medium
A sleeping bag is arguably the most important piece of gear you carry on a backpacking trip.,medium
If you brought a 40 °F bag on a trip where a cold front brings in 20 ° F overnight lows you're going to have to work to find ways to stay warm.,medium
After you've done a few backcountry trips you'll get a feel for the temperatures and weather patterns in the areas you visit.,medium
"You'll also learn things you like and don't like about the gear you have, and that will help you make informed decisions.",medium
If you're just starting out and don't have a feel for the temperature rating you need I would recommend a 20 °F bag for most backcountry activities from early to late summer.,medium
The 20 ° F temperature rating should keep you warm throughout the summer months while keeping the size and weight of the sleeping bag down.,medium
"Eventually, most of us encounter a situation where we have a sleeping bag that just isn't warm enough.",medium
If you end up in this situation there some simple things you can do to increase the warmth of the bag you have.,medium
"You'll be amazed at how much wearing extra clothes, especially a hat and socks, will warm you up at night.",medium
I've spent a lot of cold nights in a bag that wasn't warm enough (because I was a cheap college student) and stayed warm all night by layering up with clothes inside my bag.,medium
Sleeping bag liners that slide inside your bag can also increase its warmth.,medium
These liners are usually quite affordable and make it easy for your bag to function well in multiple temperatures.,medium
"You can take the liner idea farther by using two sleeping bags, sliding one inside the other.",medium
This is a good option if you're car camping and have two sleeping bags for warmer weather.,medium
I've done this several times with two 30 ° F bags when temperatures were below 20 ° F and have stayed toasty warm.,medium
Choosing the proper temperature rating for your sleeping bag will help you be safe and comfortable whether you're sleeping 30 miles from the trailhead or right next to your car.,medium
The budget-conscious outdoors-person can probably make one sleeping bag work for year-round use by using a liner or extra clothes to stay warm in the winter.,medium
By considering your needs and range of use before purchasing a sleeping bag you can make sure the temperature rating you select will support the majority of your outdoor pursuits.,medium

"Open your browser's JavaScript console (right now, on this page) and set app.message to a different value.",document
Note that we no longer have to interact with the HTML directly.,document
A Vue app attaches itself to a single DOM element (#app in our case),document
"The HTML is our entry point, but everything else happens within the newly created Vue instance.",document
"This example demonstrates that we can bind data to not only text and attributes, but also the structure of the DOM.",document
"Moreover, Vue also provides a powerful transition effect system that can automatically apply transition effects when elements are inserted/updated/removed by Vue.",document
"You may have noticed that Vue components are very similar to Custom Elements, which are part of the Web Components Spec.",document
That's because Vue's component syntax is loosely modeled after the spec.,document
"For example, Vue components implement the Slot API and the is special attribute.",document
One important thing to note is that separation of concerns is not equal to separation of file types.,document
"Inside a component, its template, logic and styles are inherently coupled, and collocating them actually makes the component more cohesive and maintainable.",document
Each rule begins with a name (which is the name defined by the rule) and ::=.,document
A vertical bar (|) is used to separate alternatives; it is the least binding operator in this notation.,document
The * and + operators bind as tightly as possible; parentheses are used for grouping.,document
Rules are normally contained on a single line; rules with many alternatives may be formatted alternatively with each line after the first beginning with a vertical bar.,document

You can't use Visual C++ in a plain command prompt window without doing some preparation.,document
"Fortunately, Visual C++ installs shortcuts for you to launch a developer command prompt that has the environment set up for command line builds.",document
"Unfortunately, the names of the developer command prompt shortcuts and where they're located are different in almost every version of Visual C++ and on different versions of Windows.",document
"A developer command prompt shortcut automatically sets the correct paths for the compiler and tools, and for any required headers and libraries.",document
You must set these environment values yourself if you use a regular Command Prompt window.,document
"For more information, see Set the Path and Environment Variables for Command-Line Builds.",document
We recommend you use a developer command prompt shortcut instead of building your own.,document

One or more inference threads execute a model's forward pass on the given inputs.,document
"Each inference thread invokes a JIT interpreter that executes the ops of a model inline, one by one.",document
A model can utilize a fork TorchScript primitive to launch an asynchronous task.,document
Forking several operations at once results in a task that is executed in parallel.,document
"PyTorch uses a single thread pool for the inter-op parallelism, this thread pool is shared by all inference tasks that are forked within the application process.",document
"In addition to the inter-op parallelism, PyTorch can also utilize multiple threads within the ops (intra-op parallelism).",document
"This can be useful in many cases, including element-wise ops on large tensors, convolutions, GEMMs, embedding lookups and others.",document
"If there's a single input to an operation that requires gradient, its output will also require gradient.",document
"Conversely, only if all inputs don't require gradient, the output also won't require it.",document
