"It pollutes the environment, it's limited in supplies, and the supplies that we do have are mostly controlled by a few key players."
"Of course, nowadays electric cars are undoubtedly more popular than the other alternative sources of mobile energy, with sales that seem to want to grow exponentially forever, and an ever-expanding selection of vehicles."
"Yet, it's worth talking about biofuels, as they've managed to gain quite a foothold in our current energy usage for transportation, and they represent a big part of the carbon reduction strategies of many countries going forward."
"there are many types of biofuels, we'll focus on ethanol and biodiesel, the two that are most commonly used in transportation, at least in terms of ground transport."
"There are also biofuels for planes and boats, but those are quite rarely used in comparison."
"With car manufacturers on board, most modern cars are capable of easily running a 10% blend, often called E10, which explains why you'll often find it at many of the pumps you'll run across."
"Sourced by fermenting the sugars that can be found in biomass, it can be made from a wide variety of crops, such as corn (most popular in the United State), sugar cane (most popular in Brazil), or even wheat (most popular in Europe), making it easy to find a crop that suits the local climate."
"Whereas ethanol is sourced from fermenting sugars, biodiesel comes from vegetable oils, or even animal fats."
"Biodiesel's popularity varies strongly depending on where you are, as diesel vehicles are not as frequently found everywhere."
"For instance, Europe's most common biofuel, by a wide margin, is biodiesel, but it also has one of the largest fleet of privately owned diesel cars anywhere in the world."
"Meanwhile, in the United States, biodiesel production represents only a small fraction of bioethanol production."
"While not all diesel engines can run at high blend levels, with a lot staying under 5%, it is quite common to find vehicles running B20, or a 20% blend."
"As you might expect from the fact that most biofuels are blended with regular gasoline or diesel before being used, there is no way for them to guarantee, on their own, a stable supply of energy."
"In 2018, the United States consumed roughly 143 billion gallons (541 billion litres) of finished motor gasoline, with only about 10% of that amount coming from fuel ethanol."
"As a point of comparison, nearly 27% of Europe's oil imports came from Russia alone."
"There's no denying that biofuels are helping to diversify the sources of energy for transportation, but its total impact remains relatively small when contrasted to how much control certain countries have over the world's oil supply."
"Since biofuels often come from edible crops, it's not surprising that almost any conversation about biofuels will inevitably lead to the question of food prices."
"Fortunately, this also means that a decent amount of thought and research has been put into this issue."
"The answer, while not as clear-cut as you might expect, is that yes, increasing biofuel production also increases the cost of food."
"For instance, a review of 157 estimates on the impact of ethanol production found that increasing the production of corn ethanol by one billion gallon (3.79 billion litres) in the United States would lead to a 3% to 4% increase in the cost of corn."
"Still, as mentioned, there are variables that can make these numbers change in ways that make them a lot less drastic."
"There is also a growing trend to produce biofuels from feedstock that would otherwise have gone to waste, called cellulosic ethanol."
"It makes use of the crop's fibre, rather than its fruit."
It's also possible that rising prices may be partially mitigated by the creation of jobs through biofuels' crops farming.
"Finally, it's worth keeping in mind that the local conditions can affect the impact on food production greatly, and that a well-managed feedstock could very well have a much lesser impact on food prices."
Biofuels are a popular method of reducing carbon emissions because their tailpipe CO2 emissions are lower.
"However, there are many more types of emissions than just CO2, and even that needs more things considered than simply the driving part of the equation."
This is partially due to two things.
"Particulate matter is a major source of breathing problems, so you can see how that would impact healthcare costs."
"As mentioned before, cellulosic ethanol makes use of the plant's fibre, rather than the fruit."
"This leads to much lower emissions overall, and therefore a much better impact on the environment."
"Once again, this can either have a positive effect, or a very negative one."
The potential benefits of biofuels will depend almost entirely on the possibility to make proper use of land for different feedstock.
"If the biofuel is produced on what used to be tropical rainforest, such as is the case in nearly a third of all new plantations in Indonesia, then the resulting negative environmental impacts will speak for themselves, ranging from higher CO2 emissions to desertification and loss of biodiversity."
"Meanwhile, a production that is sustainably added to the regular crop rotation, such as is the case in Germany, will bring about the issue of limiting the potential production, but will also produce less negative environmental impacts."
"There is no doubt that, going forward, biofuels will continue to be an important part of our energy supply for transportation."
Whether this will have a positive or a negative impact will depend entirely on the regulations that will frame the production of feedstock for producing bioethanol and biodiesel.
"As it stands, they bring with them both positives and negatives, and we need to frame their future in very solid, and enforced, sustainability criteria if we want this endeavour to be a good one for the environment, and for our health."
"If you're an academic and you're not on YouTube, why not?"
"In 2011, my then-teenage kids dragged me to VidCon in Los Angeles and kick-started a 10-year journey into exploring how academics can use YouTube more effectively."
"In 2011 it was in its second year, and still small enough (and chaotic enough) for attendees to rub shoulders with some of the world's top YouTube superstars."
"I was, I must confess, initially bemused by the whole experience."
I remember waiting in line at Starbucks with my son for instance and being fascinated by him freaking out about who was in the queue in front of us-and being impressed as the two
But this was nothing compared to the detailed instructions I received from my daughter on collecting video cameo-performances of various YouTube stars for her collaborative YouTube channel!
"(Being the dutiful father, I got a whole bunch of clips of people who were, so I'm told, a big deal.)Despite"
", the experience transformed how I thought about YouTube as a professor in a major research university."
"After leaving VidCon in 2011, I became intrigued by the potential reach"
"YouTube offers for connecting expertise with people who are actively looking for new knowledge and skills, but on their own terms rather than through conventional educational routes."
"Today, YouTube is purportedly the second-most visited website after Google."
"According to the latest figures, more than 2 billion users log in to YouTube each month, and viewers watch more than a billion hours of content on the website every day."
"And yet, with a few exceptions, academics either eschew the platform as being beneath them, post interminably boring videos that hardly anyone watches, or claim that they either have a)"
"no time, b) no talent or c) are not rewarded appropriately for using YouTube to communicate what they know to others."
This would be fine if free access to knowledge and education didn't matter.
Why should we make the effort to make what we know publicly accessible if we're content to restrict it to the wealthy and the privileged?
Why give stuff away for free if we don't believe that universal access to knowledge is necessary for personal and social as well as economic growth?
And why should we worry about who fills the public knowledge-vacuum left by the absence of experts willing to share their expertise online?Of
"course, I'm being provocatively rhetorical here."
It's pivotal to how people develop the skills and the understanding that enable them to build a better future for themselves and their communities.
"It empowers them to learn in their own way, and on their own terms."
"And increasingly, it's where platforms like YouTube are ushering in a revolution in casual, or self-directed, learning."
"Given all this, and inspired by my experiences at VidCon, I set out to see what I could achieve as a time and talent-limited academic."
"The result was the YouTube channel Risk Bites, which launched in 2012.As I describe in the paper,"
"Risk Bites was (and still is) an experiment in how someone like me (plenty of expertise, but little talent) could use YouTube more effectively for making insights into understanding and addressing risk as accessible and useful to as many people as possible."
"It's been an interesting nine years since the channel launched, with plenty of frustrations and pointed learning experiences along the way."
And it has its fair share of clunkers in the 100+ videos that have been posted to date.
"For instance, Risk Bites videos are consistently in the top returns for searches on topics that include Responsible Innovation, Nanotechnology, Epidemiology, AI Risk, The Fourth Industrial Revolution, The Precautionary Principle, Radon."
And these are just some of the topics where the channel's videos are meeting the needs of casual learners.
"Much of this success is down to a meticulously developed and applied approach to video production, and one which aligns with just how tough a task this is for academics who have little time, marginal talent, and minimal training in video production."
It's an approach that's both described in the paper and outlined in a series of online tutorials.
It's also due in part to careful attention to search engine optimization.
"Beyond the underlying process though, the channel has been effective because we've focused less on overall numbers of views and subscribers, and more on whether a video is filling a need, even when there are relatively few people searching for that specific content."
"For example, very few people search YouTube for videos on responsible innovation."
"But when they do, the first thing they see is a Risk Bites video."
"If there's stuff we know as academics, and there are people who might benefit from this but who don't otherwise have access to what we know,"
I believe we have a responsibility to make what we know as accessible and relevant as possible to them-even if we're just talking about a handful of people.
"And this is where YouTube provides an incredibly powerful platform for making accessible what we know, even for content creators who have little time and limited ability."
"And of course, while I'm focusing on academics here, this applies equally to anyone who has knowledge or expertise that others might benefit from."
"Perhaps the most important takeaway for me though since I started down this road in 2011 is that, if we're serious about empowering as many people as possible to play a role in building a more just, equitable and vibrant future, we need to use every avenue possible to achieve this."
"The brain is a miraculous organ, and that's not a secret to anyone."
"Our brains may only be 3 pounds, however, it's the powerhouse of intelligence, interpretation, initiating body movement, and is the steering wheel that controls all of our behaviours."
"Although the brain is one of the most important organs within all living organisms, neuroscientists still don't understand nor can comprehend how some components within the brain work."
"If neuroscientists don't even fully comprehend how information is processed within the brain of a tiny worm with a few hundred neurons, we shouldn't be surprised that the human brain with 80-100 billion neurons, is still a mystery to us."
What if we want to ask more questions about brain activity?
"Like how neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's and ADHD develop?Through the study of connectomics, we can ask better questions about specifics within the brain."
"In order to understand connectomics, we need to have a basic understanding of communication within the brain."
"I don't know about you, but when I hear really good music, I automatically start dancing."
"I don't care where I am, good music calls for a dance party at any moment."
"When someone throws a ball at me, my first instinct is not to dodge it, but rather run towards the ball and catch it."
"Occasionally, when my mother asks me to put away my dishes, I run downstairs to put them away before my mother gets annoyed at me."
How do we instinctively know how to do these tasks?The brain is made up of billions of cells referred to as neurons.
"These neurons carry information that consists of electrical pulses, and whenever you perform any action, neurons in your brain fire off."
"A neuron has branches that look like a tree, and they are called dendrites."
"The dendrites receive signals, and a longer projection that looks like a tree trunk, called the axon, sends signals."
These electrical pulses can jump from neurons to neurons through the use of the nerve releasing chemical signals called neurotransmitters.
"At the end of the axons, we can find synapses that act as a channel for neurons to communicate."
"The neuron transmitters will then use the synapses as a tunnel to travel from different neurons, creating new electrical waves where it travels."
The connectome is a comprehensive map of the neural connections within the brain of an organism.
It's often thought of as a wiring diagram that maps all the neural connections within the nervous system of an organism.
"A connectome can refer to the mapping of a brain of an entire organism, or the mapping of brain subsystems, such as hippocampal connectomes, thalamic connectomes, or cortical connectomes."
"Currently, the only organism that we have a complete connectome for is C. elegans , which is a one and a half millimetre organism."
"This organism has a very small neural network, consisting of around 300 neurons and around 7,000 synaptic connections."
"This means that individual scientists had to follow the organism's neuronal pathways with their own vision, and the convoluted paths were tracked through many microscopic images."
"Unsurprisingly, the human brain is far more complicated in comparison to the brain of C. elegans."
"In fact, our brains have 80-100 billion neurons and an estimated amount of 700 trillion synaptic connections."
"Today, completing the human connectome is out of our reach due to the existing technology we have."
The first reason is that there aren't enough electron microscopes in existence to make imaging of the large amounts of tissue in our brains feasible.
"Second, interpreting these images and tracing projections from each neuron is still carried out through humans clicking through images, which is not efficient what so ever."
"If we want to accomplish building a single human connectome, we will need many electron microscopes and artificial intelligence that can accomplish the task of visually tracing neuronal projections and recognizing and recording synaptic connections."
"Although there are possible challenges related to mapping the human connectome, there are many opportunities that create optimism for this possibility."
"Electron microscopy is rapidly improving and decreasing in cost, and there is a promising future of faster and stronger prototypes of these microscopes."
"Additionally, artificial intelligence is being pursued in many labs to accomplish the tedious task of visualization that comes with mapping a connectome."
"Currently, we lack the tools necessary to investigate such theories."
"However, once we can fully construct human connectomes, scientists and doctors will solve many mysteries related to the correlation between our brain structure and abilities and behaviours."
"By comparing wiring diagrams of different human brains, it is likely that with this information, we will be able to develop target treatments such as better drugs, neural prostheses, and different surgical practices."

US banks dramatically expanded their lending at the onset of the health and economic crisis.
The banks have further capacity to lend.
Post-crisis regulations require larger banks to operate with huge capital buffers above their regulatory requirements.
"As of the end of the first quarter, the largest banks - those with more than $100bn in assets - held more than $245bn in capital above those requirements, including all applicable regulatory buffers."
That translates into lending capacity of more than $2tn.
"US banks also remain highly capitalised, with buffers intact even after taking large earnings charges in the first quarter to establish reserves under the new ' current expected credit loss ' (CECL) accounting standard."
"This new rule, similar to Europe's IFRS 9, requires banks to establish an allowance - basically, a reserve - for every loan, based on its expected losses under the current economic outlook."
The largest US banks added about $60bn to their allowances in the first quarter of 2020 - yet still maintained a high average common equity tier one capital ratio of 11.4 per cent.
That is well above the minimum level of 4.5 per cent.
"Of course, if the recession were to deepen, banks would need to build their reserves further."
"However, banks continue to generate earnings that can be used for this purpose."
"In the US, the Fed also governs the ability of banks to pay dividends through its annual stress test."
"As a result, US banks included in the S&P 500 index are trading at an average of 1.1 times their tangible book value - compared with 9.9 times for the index as a whole."
"Moreover, the European and UK experience provides no support for the US following suit."
"While US banks in 2019 accomplished approximately 73 per cent of capital distributions through share repurchases and only 27 per cent through dividends, European banks distributed 4 per cent through buybacks and 96 per cent through dividends."
"More importantly, the European and UK experience may serve as a cautionary tale."
"The UK's Prudential Regulation Authority announced its dividend ban on March 31, which increased the combined book value of UK banks by about £8bn."
"But at the opening of markets the following day, the market value of the relevant UK banks fell by £35bn, or £43bn including the lost dividends, despite broader equity markets being generally flat."
UK and European banks now trade at an average of just 0.4 times their tangible book value.

"While food delivery apps like Grubhub, DoorDash, and Uber Eats have been a lifeline to the restaurant industry as shelter-in-place orders have kept people indoors, the fact is that they remain expensive options for consumers and restaurants, while also being largely unprofitable for the delivery businesses themselves."
Food delivery has high fixed costs.
The courier requires a minimum wage.
There just aren't a ton of things throughout the food delivery value chain that restaurants can innovate on without significant technological advances.
That's why some ambitious entrepreneurs (like ex-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick) are getting into 'cloud kitchens' to cut the biggest expense traditional restaurants deal with: real estate costs.
"If a kitchen makes its money by delivering food to those who order it over an app, there's no point in paying for premium real estate - or extra staff to take care of customers who visit."
"While cloud kitchens may seem like a new trend, the concept isn't really that new."
"In fact, Domino's Pizza has been reaping the benefits of cloud kitchens for years."
Think about the similarities between cloud kitchens and Domino's:
"And while Domino's is certainly benefiting from the rise of delivery (especially during Covid-19), one of the main reasons they did so well over the past decade has been the alignment of their business and their business model."
"In 2009, Domino's made a number of decisions to align their strategy to their business model."
"First, they completely overhauled their product."
"The food went from tasting like cardboard to tasting like, well, real pizza."
And they even ran an ad campaign owning up to their previously bland product and describing how they had improved it.
It also helped that the product category (pizza) was extremely well-suited to delivery because it's cheap: A single pizza can feed a family of four.
"They were the first to both offer mobile ordering and to build a Pizza Tracker on their website, a concept that delivery startups have since copied."
This not only helped them with ordering and logistics (stores and drivers utilize software as well) but also helped them build a strong digital brand in which they interact directly with consumers.
"This brand advantage is especially important during quarantine, where the customer journey almost always begins online."
"A lot of other big takeout chains rely on aggregators like DoorDash or UberEats, and are forced to suffer the high fees that come with them."
"(We're even starting to see restaurants migrate off these platforms towards building their own apps, similar to what Domino's did a decade"
"ago.)Finally, Domino's stores are optimized for delivery and takeout, not in-store eating."
Pizza Hut has a dine-in focused model and mom and pop pizza shops don't have the technology or delivery infrastructure
"(although Slice is trying to change that).While all of these decisions prepared Domino's for the cloud kitchen era, one of the biggest drivers of investor returns was their franchise business model."
It can't be understated how closely their strategic decisions played into becoming one of the most successful franchises in history.
"Usually, when a business wants to grow, they need to use existing profits or raise new capital to fund that growth."
"However, a franchise business is the opposite."
"The franchisor can add new locations, but doesn't need to front the capital themselves."
"Instead, they can source the capital required to open new locations through their franchisees."
"In return for the brand awareness, trade secrets, and operating best practices, franchisees pay monthly commissions to the franchisor."
"For the parent company, it becomes a cost-free royalty, a perpetual stream of cash."
"And if a franchisor is performing well, they can actually distribute cash back to shareholders even as they grow, instead of needing cash to fund expansion."
"So if franchises are so great, why doesn't everyone run one?"
One reason is that not every business is built to entrust franchisees with quality control.
"One big reason people went to Starbucks was to spend a few hours working in a comfortable place, or to enjoy their coffee with a friend."
"Additionally, many Starbucks customers decide to purchase a coffee because they walk past a store."
Starbucks doesn't do much delivery either: the low price of a coffee (about $5) means that the delivery costs up to 50% of the total order value.
"The consumer value proposition is reliant on in-person experience: sitting in a comfortable lobby while enjoying the music, chatter, and aura of the environment."
And that's much harder to scale through a network of franchisees.
"Starbucks would be relying on independent operators to accurately replicate that unique environment, which is hard to do."
And that is one reason why none of the Starbucks stores are franchised.
Pizza is a cheap and standard product that is easy to make.
"When you think, 'I want to order pizza online,' do you picture the Domino's pizza tracker?"
"It's not as tied to a particular store as it is to the Domino's brand and online portal (which is controlled by Domino's corporate employees).Finally, their stores are optimized for delivery instead of dining in."
"Their store locations are selected based on the best delivery routes, not the most foot traffic."
"And because people typically order more than one pizza, the delivery expense tends to be a small percentage of the average order value."
All these decisions funnel quality control to the parent company and make it much easier to hand off a store to a franchisee.
"When more of the consumer experience is provided by the parent company, the only thing operators need to have is money and grit."
"So while both Starbucks and Domino's needed tasty food and beverages to grow, Domino's structured its business to be much more suited for the franchise model."
"From 2012 to 2019, Domino's not only grew revenue by 12% per year, but also grew net earnings by 20% per year and returned almost $4.5 billion in cash to equity holders through dividends and repurchases."
How did they do it?Domino's opened lots of restaurants through this time period.
"According to their 2019 10-K, capital expenditures totaled less than 1% of revenue for the international segment (the only segment that is 100% franchised).This allowed Domino's to grow their high-margin franchise commissions (3.5% - 5.5% on every franchise) without bleeding very much cash."
"And with interest rates at all-time lows, their interest expense didn't cripple their operations in the slightest."
"They ended up issuing just under $6.5 billion in debt over that period, and while a decent chunk of it went to refinance old notes, another big chunk went to equity holders through special dividends and buybacks."
The result is quite unique: a company growing earnings 20% per year while still distributing loads of cash to shareholders.
"Several of the things that made Domino's a great franchise model and equity investment also made them perfectly situated in a quarantined, delivery-first world."
Domino's and Papa John's are performing a lot better than the chains that are optimized for dine-in or personalized orders.
"They are the pizza chains that are most optimized for delivery and large orders, which is what consumers want right now."
"And while Domino's same-store sales only rose 1.6% in the first quarter, in the four-week period that followed (March 23 - April 19), same-store sales rose 7.1%, with reports that digital orders accounted for 80% of sales in one of those weeks."
"This is a much better fate than a lot of restaurants, some of which have had to shut down completely."
All this is to say that Domino's is the platonic ideal of future cloud kitchens.
"The company's foresight to optimize for delivery, place stores in low-cost and route-optimized retail locations, and build a digital brand and app that really works is now paying off."
"Even before the coronavirus, home delivery was a growing trend that the biggest names in startups and food delivery had been trying to crack and turn into a venture-scale business."
It just turns out that the pizza guys got there first.
Everyone knows famous quotes by Einstein that grant a lot of insights into his miraculous mind.
"And just in case you haven't had the opportunity to read any of his works, you might want to take a look at the following excerpt:"
"Thus, the world has physicists that also delivered valuable views on the planet."
And they either lived long before Einstein or are colleagues in mind.
"The following quotes offer you the chance to reflect on your thoughts, and besides, shatter the belief systems of your audience."
No great enumeration of physicists can call itself great if I don't mention Isaac Newton (1642-1726).And
"this quote is essential as it gives credit to all the predecessors in a specific field:Please keep in mind that Newton's quote achieves a form of humbleness that, in reality, was not his most prominent quality."
"Newton used this quote in a letter to Robert Hooke, another expert in the field of optics."
Isaac Newton believes that Hooke was more like a dwarf in the respective science-field.
Newton was intensely jealous and could not have enough attention to all his achievements.
"Nevertheless, you can use this quote if you:"
"With his work 'Kosmos' (German for cosmos=universe), he laid the foundation for a unification of the diverse branches of science and culture."
It also contributed to developing a unifying explanation of everything - the universe as one interacting entity.
"In his five years of traveling extensively in the Americas, he explored and described them through the eyes of a scientist:"
And this quote has its brilliance as it explains the growth in everyone's life.
"Besides, it shows that we should not rest ourselves on past achievements as we:Wernher von Braun (1912-1977) might be the most controversial person on this list."
"He was first the leading engineer for the Nazi Germany rocket program, and afterward a pioneer for space technology in the United States:"
And this first quote gives kudos to all large projects as it highlights the bureaucracy involved.
Sometimes bureaucracy is so overwhelming that the original goal is not visible anymore.
"Quite interesting is the next quote, especially considering that Wernher von Braun used it:It is needless to say that von Braun played a significant factor in the space program, but one shall never forget where he started his career."
And just like he said: science is like a knife.
"Let us hope that future scientists remember this quote because massive changes are waiting for humans if you look at virtual reality, crypto-currencies, or alike."
Marie Curie (1867-1934) is the first female Nobel Prize winner and the only one who won the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields.
She coined the term radioactivity and received her first Nobel Prize (together with her husband) to pioneer this field.
She got her second Nobel Prize for the discovery of polonium and radium.
The first element might have gained notoriety as it was the poison for Alexander Litvinenko.
And she lived her life like the child in her first quote:
"Sadly, she died due to aplastic anemia."
It is a direct result of her radiation exposure.
Even though she did not fear anything as she was a master in almost any field.
"They conquer the world with fresh minds, virgin eyes, and don't fear anything."
They enjoy the experience itself - something that we should try more often.
"Born in 1858, Max Planch is another recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics."
He got it for his discovery of energy quanta in 1918.His main contributions towards theoretical physics are enormous but fall short compared to his role as the originator of quantum theory.
"Besides his significant triumphs in the world of physics, he loved quotes almost as much as Einstein did."
My favorite does not only cover his territory of physics but the understanding of the world itself:
"As with all lies, the truth will come out one day."
And their enemies will not have the chance to hold up the lies.
You can find examples for it in history and current developments.
"Born in 1564, almost no other ancient person received so many superlatives for his work."
"Known as the 'father of modern physics', he explored or combined fields that shattered the belief systems at that time."
He even argued with the pope (using his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems in 1632).
"If a person is mindful enough and firm in his beliefs, you can expect brilliant quotes."
"The best one might be the following:Before Kant's 'Sapere Aude,' - Galilei used this quote to say the same."
"Aristotle (384-322 BC) was a great philosopher and wrote on physics, among other subjects."
"Especially for Western societies, you cannot ignore his influence on knowledge, problems, and inquiries."
"And one of my favorite quotes by him is used frequently even today:'Stay hungry, stay foolish' is somehow the new interpretation by Steve Jobs that leads in the same direction."
"It is great to play around with ideas, and nobody should take this ability ('to be a bit crazy') away from you - if everyone looks in the same direction, you won't find new paths."
"As with all great literature, the real power lies in the application of the newly obtained wisdom."
Some quotes date back more than 2300 years and are still valid today.
"Sometimes, it is worth looking deeper into subjects as Einstein was not the only genius on the planet."

"I spent a night in a camper van in a Cracker Barrel parking lot, and the experience revealed a surprising side of the van-life movement"
An Insider reporter spent a night at a Cracker Barrel outside Philadelphia.
It introduced him to a side of van life that social media rarely shows.
"By Frank OlitoWhen I rented a camper van for a weekend, I expected a road trip filled with stunning landscapes and unforgettable views, like those shared with the #vanlife hashtag on social media."
"Instead, I spent the night in a Cracker Barrel parking lot."
The strange adventure started when I rented a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van in January from Outdoorsy and enlisted the help of my friend to drive to Philadelphia and spend the weekend in the van with me.
"Together, we endured a cold evening in the parking lot of the restaurant chain."
"Here's how we ended up in a Cracker Barrel parking lot, what the experience was like, and"
how it shaped my view of van life.
"Quickly, I realized that most of these were closed because it was off-season."
"After asking for advice from full-time van-lifers, I learned of the best-kept secrets about van life: Most van-lifers sleep in parking lots."
"In fact, I learned that Walmart is one of the most popular overnight parking spots for van-lifers and RVers - not beaches and national parks, like many might assume."
"After researching overnight parking at Walmart, I learned that I needed permission from a manager to spend the night."
"I called a few Walmarts around Philadelphia, and none could grant me permission to park overnight."
"Luckily, my research also showed that Cracker Barrel was another popular destination for van-lifers."
The first Cracker Barrel I called immediately granted me permission to park overnight.
"On our journey down to Philadelphia, we hit traffic, so the two-hour trip turned into a three-hour road trip."
"While sitting in traffic, I became increasingly worried about sleeping in the Cracker Barrel parking lot."
I wondered if the phone call was enough and whether I needed to go inside the restaurant and ask for permission again.
"I even imagined the police knocking on the door of the van in the middle of the night, forcing us to leave."
I also worried about our safety.
Sleeping overnight in a strange parking lot just outside a city didn't seem like the safest option for two people who had never experienced van life before.
"When I saw the large parking spaces designated for RVs, I knew all my worries were for nothing."
"The fact that the company created these spaces put my mind at ease, and I knew we wouldn't get in trouble for parking there overnight."
"When we arrived, the Cracker Barrel was already closed for the night, so I had to look elsewhere for food."
"Luckily, there was a Wendy's across the parking lot."
"Unfortunately, though, only the drive-thru was open, and the camper van exceeded the height limit, so I had to awkwardly wait in line outside with the cars and walk through the drive-thru."
I decided to eat my Wendy's outside the camper van because the interior was already starting to feel too cramped for two people.
"Many van-lifers have told me that the best part of the lifestyle is how you can do most things outside, and I loved the idea of eating my dinner just outside my temporary home."
"But that night was cold, and I shivered as I ate my chicken nuggets."

"Though it may seem simple to just move the cushions and then unfold the platform, it was much more difficult in practice."
It was nearly impossible to find a place to put the large cushions in the van when I was trying to build the bed.
"Additionally, putting a fitted sheet on a bed that's up against three walls is something I never wish to do again."
I was crawling around the bed for a full 10 minutes attempting to shove the sheet into each corner before it popped out of another.
We had to use our phone's hotspot for WiFi because neither the van nor the Cracker Barrel had WiFi that we could use.
"Since the reception wasn't great, the show did freeze a few times."
"At that moment, I struggled to imagine how people could work full time in their camper vans with such spotty internet (though some vans have WiFi setups).The thermostat on the wall above the bed kept giving a strange error message, which made zero sense to me."
"Slowly, we came to accept that the heat was broken and that we had a cold night ahead of us."
"Almost simultaneously, we also learned that none of the outlets were working, so we couldn't charge our phones."
"We decided we were too tired to deal with these issues, so we bundled up and just went to sleep."
"We were the only vehicle parked in this parking lot, and the van stuck out like a sore thumb."
Was it safe to be sleeping in this spot?
Should we move the van to a spot that's more hidden?Another thought kept bothering me
: I'm about to fall asleep in a parking lot.
It felt like a strange thought.
It felt even stranger that a whole group of people chooses to do this every night to make their van-life dreams a reality.
It upset me even more that there are some people who live in their cars in parking lots during the cold winters involuntarily.
"Read more: 10 safe places to travel with your RV this springUnfortunately, the broken heater was a bigger issue than I had expected, and just bundling up did nothing to protect me from the cold weather."
"All night long, I kept waking myself up because it was so cold."
"At another point in the night, a garbage truck startled me awake."
"The RV parking spots were directly across from the Cracker Barrel's dumpsters, so the banging of the truck sounded like an earthquake inside the van."
"I stayed awake, shivering until sunrise."
"In the morning, my friend and I commiserated over the terrible night's sleep we'd had."
"We also decided it would be too difficult to turn the bed back into a seating area (only to make it a bed again later that night), so we kept the bed folded down."
"Unfortunately, that meant I had nowhere to sit and eat my breakfast, so I stood awkwardly in the middle of the kitchen."
"As I ate my pancakes, eggs, and bacon, I realized that the proximity to delicious food was one of the only positives to sleeping in a Cracker Barrel parking lot."
"During my lengthy FaceTime call with the van's owner, I was told to open one of the benches beneath the bed and to press a bunch of buttons on one of the systems."
"Though I had no idea what I was doing or even what I was looking at, I realized that if I had to live in this van full time, I would have to learn and understand all these systems inside and out, leaving me better prepared for a night in a parking lot."
"In the end, we were able to fix the outlets, but the heater remained out of commission."
"As we pulled out of the parking lot, I realized that my experience was something I'd never seen on social media."
I follow post pictures of themselves parked near a beach or in a beautiful landscape.
They never post pictures of themselves parked in a Cracker Barrel or Walmart parking lot.
They never talk about shivering through the night.
And they never share images of themselves eating in the middle of the kitchen with nowhere to sit.
"When I returned, I talked to Dan Lin, who has been living in a camper van with his family of five since 2008."
He told me that my experience was a more accurate representation of what van life is really like.
"Obviously, social media shows only a small portion of one's life, but the realities of van life were so far from what I had expected."
Read more: Social media makes living in a camper van look like the simple life.
The reality is a lot more complicated.
"Though I didn't enjoy my experience in the Cracker Barrel parking lot, I'm glad van-lifers have this as a safe option when campgrounds or parks are closed and zoning laws are working against them."
"That said, I wish van-lifers were more open about this legitimate form of parking."
But I learned firsthand what van life is really like after staying overnight in the Cracker Barrel parking lot.
"I learned what happens in between glamour shots that van-lifers post on social media, and I didn't love what I saw."
Though many van-lifers don't have any issues with sleeping in a parking lot overnight or repairing their home consistently - and others have a comfortable night with far less
- I quickly learned I am not one of those people who would choose this life voluntarily.

Clubhouse Is Suggesting Users Invite Their Drug Dealers and Therapists
"When you join the fast-growing, invite-only social media app Clubhouse - lucky you!"
- one of the first things the app will ask you to do is grant it
"A finger icon points to the 'OK' button, which is also in a bolder font and more enticing than the adjacent 'Don't Allow' option."
"You don't have to do it, but if you don't, you lose the ability to invite anyone else to Clubhouse."
"Once you've agreed to upload your phone's address book, Clubhouse uses it to recommend people to follow who are already on the app, which is common practice for social apps these days."
"But it soon becomes apparent that Clubhouse also takes it a few steps further, in ways that are both creative and a little creepy."
"When I granted the app access to my contacts, within hours it was nudging me to invite my former pediatrician, barber, and a health worker who once cared for my dying father to join Clubhouse - and sending me push notifications every time someone from my contacts signed up so"
"'Granting an app access to your contacts is ethically dicey, even if it's an app you trust."
"If you're like most people, the contacts in your phone include not just your real-life friends, but also old acquaintances, business associates, doctors, bosses, and people"
you once went on a bad date with.
"For journalists, they might also include confidential sources (although careful journalists will avoid this)."
"When you upload those numbers, not only are you telling the app developer that you're connected to those people, but you're also telling it that those people are connected to you - which they might or might not have wanted the app to know."
"For example, say you have an ex or even a harasser"
"you've tried to block from your life, but they still have your number in their phone; if they upload their contacts, Clubhouse will know you're connected to them and make recommendations on that basis."
"Some social networks even use this sort of info to start building secret dossiers on people who don't use the app, sometimes called 'shadow profiles.'"
"(Facebook is a notable example, though almost certainly not the only one.)"
"the number of a person named C who isn't on the app, and User B also uploads the same number"
", now the app knows that C is connected to B and A, even though C has never used the app at all."
"While Clubhouse did not respond to my request for comment, it seems evident from the app that it is collecting at least some information about non-Clubhouse users, linked to their phone numbers."
There are at least two additional ways in which Clubhouse appears to take users' contact data further than the norm.
"The first is that as soon as someone who was in your address book joins Clubhouse, you'll get a notification from the app that they've just joined, prompting you to 'welcome' them and 'walk them in.'"
"There's some potentially delightful serendipity here - I joined a welcome room for a person I hadn't talked to in years on a whim, and while they weren't actually there, I wound up virtually meeting some other random mutual friends of theirs."
"Which is cool, although you can probably also imagine scenarios in which being thrown into a private room with people you've never met might be less delightful."
"Still, it's a sort of high-touch approach that heightens the, well, clubby feeling that has been a big part of Clubhouse's early appeal."
The second surprising way that Clubhouse harnesses your contact information is revealed when you go to invite others to the app.
The twist is that the list also shows you how many 'friends on Clubhouse' each of those people already has - and ranks them from most connected to least connected.
"Generously interpreted, the feature is probably based on the assumption that people who have lots of contacts already on Clubhouse are more likely to want to join or to find it useful once they do."
"But there's also something a bit icky feeling about ranking the Clubhouse connectedness of people who have not chosen or agreed to have anything to do with Clubhouse-and who may not have even chosen to be in your phone's address book, for that matter."
"Without knowing what other ways Clubhouse might be using this data, it's hard to pinpoint the potential harms, aside from the fundamental lack of consent involved in collecting data on nonusers."
Then there's the matter of who people are finding atop those recommendation lists -
"that is, what the rankings are really optimizing for."
Some of the top names may be friends of yours who are particularly tech- or marketing-savvy or who happen to belong to social groups that are well-represented on Clubhouse and for whatever reason just haven't had the opportunity to join yet.
"But in a lot of cases, at this point in Clubhouse's growth - it was recently reported to have at least 2 million weekly active users - your contacts who are most connected to other Clubhouse users are likely to have already joined, or at least have been invited by someone else."
"And so instead, the names you see near the top of your invite list likely belong to entities that people have intentionally avoided inviting, despite their high connectedness."
"Clubhouse also thought I might want to invite the psychiatrist who used to prescribe my ADHD medication, who I now know has 62 friends on Clubhouse."
"Fortunately, it doesn't show me who those 62 people are - but"
I'm not the first person to find this awkward.
"It was a nudge from Blake Eskin, an assistant professor of journalism and design at the New School, that prompted me to look into this."
"A quick Twitter search turned up plenty of further examples, some queasier than others."
"(All of the following are used with permission of the author.)Again, it's hard to predict the exact ways in which this could go wrong without knowing Clubhouse's policies around this data."
"Even short of that, just imagine that drug dealer's surprise if she knew an app she's never downloaded was compiling a list of all the people who have her number in their phone."
Clubhouse may or may not be the worst offender in terms of how it handles contacts that users upload.
"It's conceivable that the company has thoughtful data-handling practices that mitigate the risks, although its nonresponse to my inquiry isn't the most encouraging sign."
"What's clear, though, is that Clubhouse makes these connections more visible than most - and that new users should think twice before clicking the 'OK' button to grant the app access to your contacts, no matter how urgently Clubhouse nudges you to do so."
"What we didn't know at that time was that whatever we exchanged with/for, can be also referred to as money, mostly due to the fact that we knew the recognized fiat currencies, and they were"
The evolution of money is also very symbolic; it signifies that money in itself can change and we must be open to such changes.
"At first, people bartered - exchanging one valuable item for another corresponding one of similar value, people exchanged silk, salt, metals, etc."
"However, it became increasingly necessary to have a unified measuring system for ensuring no one was cheated by barter,"
"But unlike air and water that occurs freely in nature, money is a human invention."
"And it is the few elites that are in charge of this invention process that controls the distribution of this vital human good, which is to some certain extent wrong."
"Thomas H. Greco said in his 2018 paper, it is those who control the creation and allocation of money that are able to control every other aspect of our society."
The greatest incentive for anyone to do anything is money.
and you can control almost every other aspect of human life.
And this is why these elites have labored to consolidate their grip on the monetary system.
"The currency for any era was one that people always felt would make transactions faster as everyone already knows the value of every currency to be spent, and with regards to speed and productivity, technology(automation) has always been the driver of productivity and speed."
"The same applies to money, not only did the currencies evolved, but the processes involved in producing them also evolved to keep up; presently paper notes are being minted."
"Humans may identify problems but to optimize solutions, technology remains the best tool; automation is the major contributor to human advancement in every sphere of life."
"Firstly, automation speeds up processes, it reduces"
"However, one thing about technology is that as it evolves, it also changes 'face' or platforms."
The internet is the platform by which almost every advancement in technology is built on.
These days everyone prefers anything digital or online; the number of digital solutions and innovations across industries is endless.
"It's no surprise that money has followed suit, with fin-tech one of the most profitable and scalable industries in the world; the fin-tech space has seen a lot of innovation crop up like USSD, mobile banking, tokens, credit cards, financial APIs, and other forms of digital payment and financial solutions."
The internet was created to be a decentralized system that gave everyone equal access and control.
Many people complain that they don't see Instagram posts by their friends and families any longer because the paid adverts are more prioritized by the Instagram algorithm.
The Ponzi like institutionalized VC mechanism in these tech hubs(cities); emerging markets like Africa can barely produce a solution that can compete globally due to systemic market entry barriers.
is now a big problem as complaints of data privacy infringement keeps increasing and a lot of people contemplating boycotting certain services in order to maintain their privacy and safety.
This question is a two-way one because of the two major factors at play here: money and technology (the internet).
The solution or attempted solution for a better money system must also take into consideration the dynamism and importance of technology.
"Hence, the proposed solution in this article is in one sense realistic, well-thought-out but in some other ways also hypothetical and predictive; I acknowledge the constant innovation the internet keeps undergoing and that we can only make predictions about what forms of innovation will crop up in the future around it."
"In view of this, I identified some major factors that simultaneously affect the improvement of money and the internet respectively."
So what are these three key factors that can really provide the money system that we crave for and still be in line with the advancement of mankind in the field of technology ensuring that our money system is not backward?These
"three factors are the security of the money, the reach of the money, and the access to the money."
"Before I tackle each highlighted factor in the previous paragraph, it is pertinent that I first lay a necessary groundwork for any of the proposed solutions to work; centralization remains the major driver of the present money and internet problems; the continual existence of powerful financial and technology gatekeepers will make any proposed efforts to satisfactorily improve the distribution of money, futile."
"Hence, the money system that will be able to actualize the benefits to be highlighted in this article, must be one that is decentralized."
"DeFi (Decentralized Finance) immediately comes to mind with respect to the last sentence, but that's not the point here; this is not an article on the benefits of the present features of DeFi; as I have stated before, technological innovation is something that is hard to predict, so Blockchain may not even be at the heart of the solution that I am even proposing, however, the core concept of Blockchain is decentralization which means we will constantly refer to Blockchain for illustration, simply think of it as me using something you are aware of, to prove a point about what would most likely work in the future."
"I know a few people who refuse to use the ATM or conduct any online transaction and will always visit the bank physically or pay for services in cash always, yes, here in Africa."
"The reality is their money is most likely safer than ours, especially with the recent increase in cybercrimes, internet fraud, and data privacy infringement."
"However, as I said before, it is not possible to have a financial system that is moving in the opposite direction; the whole world is going digital, imagine if everyone had to behave like these people who insist on doing every transaction"
"Hence, it is the duty of the financial system to find a way to keep up with human advancement and simultaneously ensure security."
Presently Blockchain is the only system that can guarantee absolute security and autonomy at the same time for every individual; with Blockchain every individual data is secured.
The technology is at the backbone of digital currency and can be applied to various aspects of online transactions and dealings like identity management.
"By securing the data of every individual, you take away the risks and unethical consequences of money; internet fraud will be absent in an internet that is completely built on a decentralized system like Blockchain."
"This potentially creates a world where every individual in the internet space will look for ways to uniquely create value for other people, which is exactly what the internet was designed to be."
These positive ethical and systemic effects of a secure internet and financial system means we may begin to see more ethical expression and manifestation of money that we hope for.
"In the current monetary system, the safest place to put your money is in the bank."
"Whilst this reduces or completely eliminates the danger of someone stealing your money or even wastefully spending it, it leaves savers vulnerable to inflation."
"If you put $10,000 dollars in your bank, inflation means when you go back to withdraw the money"
"the $10,000 you will be taking home worths less than the $10,000 you put in."
"Another thing is this, your bank might not be able to return your saved money if, for example, many other depositors get in line before you."
This is because banks usually loan out as much as 90% of their total deposits.
"As much as every currency is being influenced by the market forces of demand and supply, there still exists systemic barriers that favor some people than others; a selected few continue to benefit from systemic financial or market barriers, especially the upper class."
"Take for example the respective experience a rich and average business owner has when trying to process a loan from a conventional bank; someone summarized it with the following statement:What this statement points to is the collateral system involved in getting a loan and how an average business owner will struggle to get a loan for his/her business which has made many SMEs fail, while on the other hand, we have even heard cases of some banks that went bankrupt because they failed to ask for collateral all just to make sure that their rich customer has a 'smooth service'."
"Obviously, the internet with the help of Fin-tech platforms have tried to considerably close this gap (another testament to why the internet has been a significant driver of financial inclusion); a lot of payment and digital microfinance platforms have been rising to drive financial inclusion especially in developing countries, however, this financial inclusion will not be total until the structures built to favor accumulated advantages for a selected few are completely removed and everyone is made to be his/her own financial institution."
"When you put, say again, $10,000 in a bank."
The money does not just sit idle in the bank's vault.
They use your money to give out loans to other people with a significant interest rate.
But then the individuals who made this possible by giving these banks their money in the first place do not benefit from the profits these banks make off their money.
This is also similar to people who invest with hedge fund managers.
"When there is a high turnover in profits, the hedge fund takes a large chunk and distribute little to their lower-class investors."
"And in instances when these investments fail, and sometimes they fail spectacularly, it is the individual investors who suffer the brunt of it."
"Some have their entire savings wiped out while the banks and hedge fund takes a less severe hit mostly due to government bailouts like in the great recession of 2008.The control of money goes beyond loans, it has to cover everything from transparency, security, market-entry, foreign exchange, payment, and even trading."
The rise of Blockchain and its digital currencies like Bitcoin is already a pointer to what can happen if we digitalized all currencies and completely decentralized the internet.
"With a completely decentralized currency and the internet, there is the complete removal of systemic barriers or borders (not absolute).This final factor is more of a corollary or consequence of the previous two."
"Provided, there is a completely decentralized internet and a general currency that is built around this technology, the access to money is completely fluid."
"Note, when we mean access to money"
", we mean access to all the forms of 'money value', as I explained in the opening paragraph of this article, it's not necessarily about the money(currency)"
"but the value we place on it, which is obviously dependent on the value we all derive from the money."
"The present system cannot give everyone equal access to the value that money is supposed to give; firstly, the fact that the money is not yet digital means there isn't yet a complete correlation between where the market is heading and the 'language of the market'(money).Secondly, the lack of absolute transparency means not everyone knows and can influence the dynamics of all the value in the 'money value chain' and finally, the uncertainty around financial and data security means a few people are still skeptical about online transactions or eCommerce as in the case of Africa and some exploit the existing security loopholes to cheat or use people's data for completely selfish reasons."
Access can only be achieved when individuals have absolute control and autonomy over their money and feel their money is secured and not vulnerable to the whims of selfish hegemonies.
"This is the reason why the case for a decentralized digital currency is a powerful one, and it is not a question of if but when these switches will finally occur."
"Conclusively, these three factors: access, control, and security which this article revolved around, are not specifically referring to the money itself."
"This is not about a certain currency that everyone should be able to touch, control, and secure, no, that's not the point; the point is if money is a general commodity then everyone should have equal access to all its value, control how these values are fairly distributed and everyone must be able to trust the system because we all know it is secure."
"The emphasis is on value; a currency is only as useful as its value, why then should everyone not have equal say to how these values are distributed?"
"Presently it seems to be the only system that can at least guarantee these three factors, and maybe Blockchain is not the solution, but regardless we must not settle for less, we deserve transparency, we deserve security, we deserve autonomy, after all, its everyone's money."
"It was summer of 2016 when I found myself stranded alone, somewhere in Denmark with"
the train station staff telling me there was no way I was getting ramp assistance to get my wheelchair onto the train I needed.
The famous 'we need at least 24 hours notice' line was relayed (because why would disabled people want to be spontaneous like everyone else).
"Slightly panicked and mentally going through different scenarios in my head, I saw three men on the platform and a light bulb went on."
I approached them and asked them to help carry me and my very heavy powered wheelchair onto the train.
"Now, I wouldn't recommend this, but desperate times call for desperate measures."
"It was either that, or spend my first night solo travelling in a train station."
"A few solo trips and years later, I can't help but reflect on my experience of travelling alone as a disabled woman."

"Whilst many countries are open for travel, many have varying levels of restrictions and lockdowns and it is worth noting that travel may be very limited at this time."
"It's important to prioritise your safety, and this article is meant to inspire and bring hope about the possibility of more travel adventures in the future."
"With some hope for the future of travel slowly creeping in, I can't help but reflect on my previous experiences and how these will help me in my future planning."
"If you've ever caught yourself thinking about travelling alone, but then stopped yourself for whatever reason, here are some lessons I've learnt over the years that continue to give me the push and confidence to just go for it."
No two disabilities are the same and this is worth bearing in mind when reading up on 'accessible travel'.
"The psychological aspect of solo travelling is often underestimated, yet can sometimes be the main reason people choose not to solo travel."
"We often think of the practicalities, which of course matter just as much, (especially when we're talking about travelling as a disabled person), however, I found the psychological aspects just as important as the physical planning."
Below are a few tips that will help you think about travelling alone:
Solo travelling with creativity and planning can really be a life changing experience for everyone.
"Whilst we as disabled women have to take extra steps to enjoy things that society refuses to include us in, the more of us that are out there challenging these barriers and making sure we're seen, the more progress we can hopefully make in making travel more safe and inclusive."

That's the amount of time I've been working from home.
"In the beginning, it was perfect."
"Less commute time, no need to meet face-to-face and therefore more time for myself."
"however I wanted - new skills, online courses, reading more books."
I took a golden opportunity for productivity and squandered it.
There were so many things I wanted to do but just didn't.
"As the coronavirus pandemic became more serious, the formality of my work attire decreased."
What started off as small compromises snowballed into bigger ones.
The virus wasn't the only thing that charted exponentially.
You can call it Michael's Law.
I am not proud to say how many days I wore sweatpants (or 'trackies' for my fellow Aussies out there).
After some weeks I couldn't tell where the pants ended and my skin began.
"On most workdays, the top half was business."
But I slowly witnessed my productivity decline.
I was already in the clothes for it.
I can jump straight into bed with what I have on and no one will know.
"Whether you like it or not, we are all judged for how we look and dress."
And we are our own worst critics.
My outward dress was really a reflection of my inner state.
The standard I accepted was now the standard I lived by.
There is a certain magic about putting on proper pants in the morning for work.
"While wearing pants, I hold myself to a higher standard."
"When I am in my work pants, I am in the mindset to save the world and get things done."
The old advice is to 'dress for the job you want'.
The new advice is to wear the pants that make you feel most productive.
"When we look good, we tend to feel better."
This faux confidence translates into more productivity and creativity in what I produce at work.
But don't take my anecdotes as gospel.
An article by Scientific America details how the clothes you wear can significantly affect your physical and cognitive performance.
They called this phenomenon 'enclothed cognition'.
That is just a fancy way of saying certain clothes bring out certain cognitive performance.
What they found was that:You wouldn't find an Olympic swimmer about to compete wearing a business suit.
Every costume has an appropriate context.
"The old trick of imagining everyone in their underwear to get more confidence, the new trick is imagining yourself in pants to get more productive."
"If you're not convinced, try it yourself."
"If you feel like your productivity working from home has been slipping, wear some nice pants."
"As working from home becomes the new normal, you need to find ways to stay on top of your game, stop complacency and maintain your productivity."
Your environment is important and what you wear to work matters.
"She left him the toaster, the blender, but not the expensive juicer they bought as part of their New Year's resolution."
She didn't leave him a note either.
Bobby called his sister Josie and asked her.
"Why, do you think, there was no note?She told him."
'Bobby didn't like that answer and began to scour the apartment for clues.
Bobby looked under the couch cushions but all he found was the remote.
"Bobby looked in the kitchen cabinets, the dishwasher, the refrigerator and the oven."
It got ridiculous at that point.
"Her drawers were all empty, of course, and how he first realized that she had left, her house key sitting quietly next to the lamp, the drawers pulled open to reveal the emptiness."
"He stood in the bedroom blankly for a moment, remembering that day."
wrong?That was the big question he needed an answer to.
"He wandered next into the bathroom they shared, just off their bedroom, with its step-in shower they used to make fun love in sometimes, the pink wallpaper, dimmer-switch lighting and its double sink vanity."
"You can do anything you want over in that sink, but don't do it in mine, she'd said to him right after they moved in together, a year before they married."
She was possessive that way and what the heck did she think he was gonna do in the sink anyway?
Bobby stood looking at himself in the bathroom mirror.
Am I such a bad guy?
"Where did she go?He ran his fingers through his hair, across his three-day beard growth."
"His eyes, a bit bloodshot around the rims of their sleepy blue orbs, but what did you expect."
Bobby was handsome even when rough around the edges
"He placed both hands on the vanity and leaned in closer for a better look, sizing himself up, tilting his head to one side then the other to take in the full view."
"'Jesus, who's bothering me at this hour"
",' he said aloud to himself."
"Bobby padded out to the living room in his pajamas and wool socks, coming up just a few feet away from the front door."
The white curtain covering the glass door was just sheer enough that he could see the visage of a visitor but just opaque enough that they could not see in.
Like a one-way mirror that cops always use in TV shows.
"But not just any woman, he could tell, as he stepped a few inches closer."
He inched in a bit closer.
Her face was up close to the glass now.
"Bobby took two steps back and stood staring at the door, watching her."
"The paint, that is, the door in need of a new coat years ago."
"The couch she left him, the couch they used to snuggle together on to watch movies and eat ice cream."
Something caught his eye on the coffee table.
"He shuffled quietly over to the center of the room, picked it up and read the title."
"He read the next, and the next and realized it was meant for him."
Or at least he assumed so.
Sometimes a thing is in plain sight but we don't even notice it.
He read through the first page and turned it for more.
Bobby set the magazine back down on the coffee table and stared at it.
He looked towards the door but didn't move.
He had his answer.. . . .
Pokémon's 25th Anniversary Needs to Mark a Pivot for Mainline Games
When the Pokémon company coined the catchphrase 'Gotta Catch '
"Ever since I was young, I've always loved the Pokémon franchise."
"One of the most successful games in the series, Pokémon GO, earned over $1 billion in 2020 alone."
That's a lot of money for a game that's largely played outdoors to earn during a quarantine.
"Despite Pokémon's apparent success, the mainline series of games has stagnated for years."
"They sold handsomely and made a profit for Nintendo, but the games themselves were exceptionally uninspired and, frankly, boring."
"From the music to the story (or lack thereof), the latest entry in the mainline series of Pokémon titles left much to be desired."
It's time for the series to innovate.
"At its core, the mainline Pokémon games are JRPGs."
"Other than the fact that these games are developed within Japan, this is apparent by its turn-based combat systems, character-based parties, and a narrative built around growing as powerful as possible."
"These tropes are fine and well, as even some of the most popular JRPGs to date still utilize them, but Pokémon follows a tried and true path with every release."
You are a trainer in your home region.
You are heading out on a journey at a young age to battle gym leaders across the region.
"By the end, you aim to defeat the Elite Four and become the champion of your region."
"This foundational story structure is and has been vital to the Pokémon series since its inception with Pokémon Red and Blue, but the series' spices the story up with every release."
The original Pokémon games had Team Rocket.
"The comically mischievous partisan group, gang, or company that has an ultimate, idealistic goal holding the faction together."
"These groups often have world-changing beliefs that challenge the current establishment in some way, shape, or form."
"Instead of a group hell-bent on freeing Pokémon from the human grasp, or reshaping the face of the planet, Team Skull was simply a band of misfit teenagers who didn't fit in with the rest of society."
"They cowered away from the rest of the Hawaiian themed 'Alola Region,' banding together in their deviant group as a pestering bunch."
"Instead of being a major threat to the establishment within Alola, Team Skull was simply a flock of lost teenagers who formed into street thugs."
Team Skull is an example of innovation and change within the Pokémon series of games.
"This idea of growth for the series doesn't stop at the faction, though."
"Pokémon Sun and Moon also boasted an introduction of a new type of Pokémon, dubbed Ultrabeasts, which shook up the foundation of what a 'Pokémon' even was."
"Still, even as I played through Sun and Moon, I couldn't help but notice the tiring turn-based mechanics."
"More often than not, the combat itself slowed to drag, and the hype surrounding a battle quickly diminished as I began to painfully await the next story section."
It led to a dry and uninspiring experience that lacked the heart and care seen in other Pokémon installments.
"Textures were flat, gameplay animations were almost the exact same from the previous generation, and the camera (for the most part) was still fixed throughout the game."
"An introduction of the 'Wild Area' (a large, open-area where trainers could catch Pokémon and encounter other players) seemed innovative and daring for the team to tackle, but it fell flat mechanically."
"It was a mile wide and an inch deep, resulting in me avoiding it for most of my playthrough."
"Pokémon Sword and Shield had a story that wasn't fully embraced until the end of the game, resulting in the game feeling half-baked."
"The newly introduced Gigantamax system seemed like a step-down from the more exciting and aesthetically pleasing Mega-Evolution system from Pokémon X and Y, and the world felt hollow."
"Pokémon Sword and Shield resembled a husk of something that could have been an immense feat by Game Freak, but for whatever reason (time crunch, hardware limitations, lack of enthusiasm) the game fell short by a mile."
What seemed to be advertised as the biggest adventure Pokémon has seen ended up being a weakly delivered testament to a loss of passion.
I hope to see better from Game Freak in the future.
"It's easy to pound away on my keyboard everything I dislike about the current state of Pokémon, but it wouldn't be fair to judge the IP without considering the future of the series."
"While I'm not an original fan of Pokémon Snap, it's good to see people pleased with something the Pokémon Company is releasing."
"Game Freak's mainline Pokémon titles still leave much to be desired, but recent games like Pokémon"
Pikachu & Eevee were fun little distractions from the bigger picture games like Sword and Shield.
"Re-imagined experiences of Pokémon Red and Blue weren't quite what I had in mind for Pokémon's first debut on the Nintendo Switch, but it worked well enough while fans waited for Sword and Shield."
"Unfortunately, though, the series feels as if it hit its mark."
"With a series as lucrative as Pokémon, there's no excuse for the lack of innovation and passion behind recent games."
"Perhaps the best way to get Game Freak, or better yet, Nintendo to notice that things need to change with the mainline series of games is a vote with one's wallet."
"If you ask a random stranger about economics - as you do - chances are, they won't know much."
"They will probably be able to tell you that economic growth is important, recessions are bad, and they are likely to have heard of Gross Domestic Product, or GDP.The economy consistently ranks among the top issues for voters, even if it is a somewhat nebulous concept."
"For example, according to YouGov polling, it was the second most important issue in the 2017 UK election and the third most important in 2019 (excluding Brexit)."
GDP represents the total market value of a nation's final goods and services produced over a defined period.
Simon Kuznets developed the concept of GDP for a US Congress report in 1934 and it has been widely used as the go-to tool for measuring the economy for decades.
"Kuznets, however, warned that the measure is an oversimplification with significant limitations and should not be used as a measure of economic well-being."
"Politicians are fixated on GDP, because they know it is important to voters."
"In turn, the media and public focus on GDP, because it is so widely adopted and seems important - in part, GDP is famous for being famous."
"When GDP is growing, politicians brandish their sound economic management credentials; when it isn't, they chalk it up to external factors outside their control."
"Currently, we're in the latter state."
"The International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) April outlook report projects a 3% contraction in GDP over 2020, with advanced economies to be hit harder."
If the projection bears out - or turns out to be understated - it would be the sharpest contraction since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
"For now, the public's focus is on suppressing the virus and minimising deaths - rightly so."
"However, there will inevitably come a time when the public shifts their attention to the state of the economy."
"When that happens, citizens of poorly performing economies are likely to punish their leaders."
Leaders are understandably nervous and will do everything they can to achieve a quick 'V' shaped recovery.
"In all likelihood though, the recovery will be drawn out and is highly dependent on how quickly - or indeed whether - an effective vaccine can be developed and rolled out."
"In May, over 150 global corporations worth over US$2.5 trillion signed a statement urging governments to align their recovery packages with the latest climate science."
A green recovery makes a lot of sense - it would ensure stimulus funds are used to tackle the current crisis as well as the longer-term climate and biodiversity crises.
"However, just because the concept is logical, advocates should not assume it will happen naturally - they will need to fight hard."
"Governments are more likely to default to the quickest and easiest way to restore GDP, which could involve relaxing environmental standards and further entrenching fossils fuels in the economy, as has happened after previous economic shocks."
"The myopic focus on GDP by governments, central banks and the media alike, will not help."
The environment is poorly represented by GDP.
"Looking at green stimulus options through the lens of traditional GDP, will therefore not cast these measures in a flattering light - other measures may appear quicker and more effective by comparison."
"Doing so will give policymakers greater confidence to adopt green stimulus measures, as they will be better positioned to reap the benefits."
"It is widely adopted and easily communicated, partly because it manages to summarise something as complex as the economy into a single number."
"It has significant limitations, however, and so politicians should not rely on it too heavily to measure economic well-being and set policy - not that this stops them."
This article focuses on the limitation that GDP does not value the environment nor penalise its destruction.
"GDP is a flow metric (e.g. a revenue item), rather than a stock metric (e.g. value), so it reflects goods and services extracted from the nature, but does not allow for any associated adverse impact on the environment."
"Often, by the time GDP suffers as a result of severe degradation, it is too late to change course."
"Similarly, GDP does not allow for the adverse impacts of pollution and climate change."
"Rutger Bergman, author of Utopia for Realists, sums up the issue well: 'Environmental pollution even does double duty: One company makes a mint by cutting corners while another is paid to clean up the mess."
"By contrast, a centuries-old tree doesn't count until you chop it down and sell it as lumber."
"Economists, of course, might acknowledge nature's existence."
"Economists assume that nature is a fixed, indestructible capital asset..."
The problem with the notion that nature is indestructible is this: it is wrong.
"Once economists accept that they are mistaken on this count, it could revolutionize the way in which we calculate economic progress."
'Dasgupta goes on to provide historical examples of how the depreciation of nature has led to adverse economic consequences in the long run.
He concludes by making the case for the inclusion of nature when measuring economic growth.
It is oversimplified to explain the concept - the kind of example that economists adore.
"Sven, a fisherman who relishes the simple life, is the president and only resident of a tiny lake bound Nordic country called Sven Lake (sadly, the Bolshoi Ballet are yet to respond to his multiple invitations to perform there)."
"The GDP of Sven Lake consists solely of the value of Sven's catch of trout, which he sells to neighbouring countries."
The lake's trout population is around one million.
Sven catches around 3% of the population per annum (p.a.) and the fish stock regenerates at 3% p.a.
"Sven Lake is in equilibrium and life is good, if not a little dull."
"One day, Sven's son Pyotr, comes to visit."
He's on a summer break after completing his first year of university.
Pyotr achieved a good result in Macroeconomics 101 and imparts his wisdom. '
"You need to be more ambitious, Dad."
"Increase your catch by 1.5% of the lake each year and the economy will prosper', he says."
Sven works hard in 2021 and increases his catch to 4.5% of the population of trout.
The GDP of Sven Lake increases by 50% - an economic growth miracle.
Several online news websites run clickbaity articles with titles like: 'the fastest growing economy you've never heard of'.
"Sven is proud, if he had a bottle of champagne, he would have popped it."
"Sven works even harder in 2022, increasing his catch to 6% of the trout population."
Sven Lake's GDP grows by just over 30%.
"By 2028, despite working harder than ever, the economy is in recession."
The problem keeps getting worse (as illustrated in the chart below).
"In 2030, after a deepening recession, Sven contacts his son."
"Pyotr, who now works as an economist for an NGO, immediately sees the problem."
He does not remember the advice he gave a decade ago and assumes the strategy was cooked up by his Dad.
The fish stocks can't replenish fast enough.
you told me I need to keep increasing my catch to increase GDP.'Pyotr
"explains that the GDP growth experienced previously was artificial, in the sense that it was unsustainable."
"He creates an adjusted GDP metric, which takes into account the depletion of fish stocks via a negative depreciation adjustment."
"Further, persistent over-fishing reduces adjusted GDP over time, as the starting value of the fish stock diminishes each year (i.e. a compounding effect)."
"Under this metric, the Sven's error would have become apparent far sooner."
but it was a red herring.
"'Pyotr suggested other ways to increase GDP, like selling Tom Sawyer style experiences online, where people pay for the pleasure of doing Sven's work."
"Back to life, back to realityAdmittedly, Sven Lake is an extreme and overly simplified example."
"However, sadly, it is not completely detached from reality."
"According to the UN FAO, like Sven, we are over-fishing 30% of fish stocks and a further 60% are fished at the maximum sustainable level."
And the problem doesn't stop there.
Scientists believe that these observations indicate that we are at the start of the Earth's sixth mass extinction event[2].
"Climate change will accelerate the decline of nature, making the planet less habitable for all life, including humans."
"The Global Footprint Network produces a metric called 'Earth overshoot day', which measures our consumption relative to the natural capacity of the planet."
"In 1970, we were just about breaking even."
"By ignoring the value of nature, decisions are not being made based on a full set of information and they are proving to be unsustainable."
"The result is that we are currently living beyond our means and are racking up a large planetary debt, which future generations will pay dearly for."
"Ecosystem services represent the contributions that nature makes to human well-being, including: pollination of crops, regulation of air and climate, decomposing waste and recycling nutrients, regulating diseases, controlling erosion and providing materials."
"For example, what would it cost to pollinate crops if the bee and insect population collapses?"
"in 1997, attempted to put a value on benefits provided by the world's ecosystems."
It estimated the value of tangible benefits provided by just 17 ecological systems to be US$33 trillion per year (on average).
"In 2014, the study was updated for data up to 2011 and the estimate was revised upwards to US$125 trillion value per annum, which exceeds global GDP of c. US$85 trillion in 2018.Some criticise the approach of valuing ecosystems as being anthropocentric."
"The discipline of environmental economics is more developed than you might think, given that it receives little publicity."
"although reporting is piecemeal, obscure and the degree of implementation varies widely across countries."
Perhaps it is because leaders do not like the results.
"Although this estimate is lower than most independent estimates, people still baulked at the figure and by 2007, Green GDP was quietly dragged into the shadows and put to rest."
"Inclusive Wealth is defined as the total value of a nation's stock of: natural capital; produced capital (e.g. infrastructure, buildings, equipment); and human capital (e.g. knowledge, education, skills)."
Changes in IWI provide a more complete and sustainable view of a nation's progress over time.
The 2018 Inclusive Wealth Report found that 44 out of 140 countries have experienced a decline in inclusive wealth per capita since 1992 despite almost all recording positive GDP growth per capita.
"While the IWI has the potential to be a powerful tool for policymakers, it has not received the attention it deserves."
There have been some positive signs that countries are warming to the idea of placing greater emphasis on economic metrics that incorporate nature.
"In 2019, HM Treasury in the UK commissioned Dasgupta - the critical economics professor mentioned earlier - to perform a review of the economics of biodiversity."
"The review will explore the interaction of humans with nature, the economic costs of biodiversity loss, and ways to simultaneously enhance biodiversity and economic prosperity."
"In April 2020, the Dasgupta Review interim report was released, which sets out a framework for assessing the economics of biodiversity."
It is well worth a read.
The report emphasises the importance of nature to the economy and advocates the use of Inclusive Wealth as a measure of sustainable growth.
The interim report highlights that a central weakness of GDP is that it does not allow for the depreciation of capital.
"Dasgupta proposes an adjusted metric called Net Domestic Product (NDP), which equates to GDP less depreciation of natural capital, produced capital and human capital."
NDP can easily be tied back to Inclusive Wealth - the change in Inclusive Wealth is equivalent to NDP less aggregate consumption.
"If the change is positive, the economy is growing sustainably."
We can only hope that it is not destined to gather dust on a desk in Westminster.
There is no better time for change than todayWe are living through unprecedented times.
"Traditional GDP has plummeted, so it is natural and appropriate to take this opportunity to pause and reconsider."
"Rebasing GDP now to Dasgupta's NDP metric, or similar, would almost certainly have a negative initial impact."
"However, the difference will be clearly explainable and any adverse reaction will be somewhat dampened by the abundance of other negative news."
Rebasing GDP to incorporate the environment and other factors would provide a more appropriate tool to measure sustainable economic growth.
"Further, it will put politicians in a bind."
"They will opt for the quickest and easiest option and it will not be green, judging by previous economic recoveries."
Best not to leave politicians to their own devices.
"For more information, I recommend reading Elizabeth Kolbert's book titled 'The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History'."
You Don't Shape Your Recommender System
"A few years ago, before the widespread adoption of AI in our lives, two graduate students were working on an intelligent vacuum cleaner, the anecdote says."
"It was a simple little robot, roaming the dorm room floor and vacuuming whatever dirt it has stumbled upon."
"The training algorithm was simple: picking up dust and dirt was rewarded with a point, and the little robot was told to get as many points as possible."
"Since every machine learning algorithm needs some time to train, the students turned it on in the morning before going to classes, letting it experiment and learn during the whole day."
"When they returned, everything was in disarray."
"Plants and pots knocked down, glasses shattered on the floor."
What happened?It turned out that the robot did exactly what it supposed to do: maximizing the rewards by cleaning dust from the floor.
"However, it also discovered that by smashing tables and cabinets, it can knock things down."
"Once what was on the table were lying on the floor shattered, cleaning it up was awarded with points."
Our little robot learned how to manipulate its environment to gain rewards.
"In our modern society, you are the dorm room and Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other companies are the robots."
"What are your numbers?Even though I am especially conscious about what I watch, I very often find myself watching garbage content just because it popped up in my recommendation feed."
"When I go looking for genuine and useful information on YouTube, I frequently drift away to entertaining content just because I instinctively click on things."
I am 'engaged' with the content.
"To understand this, we have to see where YouTube's revenue comes from."
"You get to watch content for free, but you have to watch ads in turn as well."
"The more ads you watch, the more money they receive."
"Like the cleaning little robot, its recommendation algorithm has to maximize the reward function, which is user engagement in this case."
"But what does it do to you in order to achieve its results?To answer this question, let me present you with a choice."
"Either you watch a lecture about macroeconomics right now, or a video of cats doing funny things."
"If you are not being entirely conscious, this is an easy choice for your brain."
"For evolutionary reasons, we unconsciously prefer easy rewards to those for which we have to actually work for."
"A clickbait content is like candy to our brains, and we are not trained to resist."
"Unfortunately, this is the smaller problem."
"Like our little cleaning robot from before, a recommendation algorithm also prefers shaping the environment."
"In this case, it slowly starts shifting user preferences towards content which can draw them in like a black hole, keeping them engaged for longer and longer periods."
"By eliciting very strong emotional reactions, these videos can trap users in a vicious cycle."
"There is concrete scientific evidence of this: a recent paper studied millions of YouTube comments, showing how users slowly drift from mild to extreme radical content."
"This presents problems not only the level of the individual, but on the level of society."
"When rationality goes out the window and all we have are visceral, emotional responses, cooperation is impossible."
"Although YouTube is a prime example of how users can be pushed to the far-right of the political spectrum, it is not the only player in the game."
Social media also plays a huge role by maintaining intellectual bubbles.
"Once Facebook pinpointed your political preferences, it keeps presenting you posts which reinforce your world view instead of challenging it."
"Progress comes from discussion and disagreement, which is impossible if you are only presented with matching views."
"Although the feeds are archived and not updated as I write these lines, it is worth checking out Blue Feed, Red Feed."
The information you process throughout your life defines who you are.
"Just like what you eat gets processed by your body and builds you up eventually, the pieces of information you obtain puzzle together your personality and belief system up to some degree."
It is our own responsibility to be mindful of the influences we subject ourselves.
"When I call my mother on Mother's Day, we make mild conversation for 30 minutes."
We withdraw from the conversation as soon as good manners allow.
"This is, believe it or not, the healthiest our relationship has ever been."
"This is a victory, and it was hard-won."
My mother refused to give up her maiden name when she married.
"I have only ever known her as a conservative Irish Catholic woman, but by all accounts, she was a real wild card in her youth."
It was my father who filled my arms with books by Robert Frost and Walt Whitman the moment I could read.
But my mother did like Sylvia Plath.
The first thing she ever told me about Plath was that she stuck her head in an oven.
"She said this as only a Catholic could, with a particular disdain rationed toward speaking about suicide."
But there was something else just behind that judgmental tone: a spiteful admiration.
"Later, when I discovered the racism and anti-Semitism rampant throughout Plath's work, I wasn't too surprised."
My sister's favorite poet has always been Emily Dickinson.
We find our mouthpieces for pain in women whose pain resembles our own.
"Emily Dickinson suffered alone and quietly, like my sister."
"Sylvia Plath suffered emotionally and loudly, which is what makes her work enticing to loud and emotional women - something I inherited from my mother."
But Plath was also unforgivably narcissistic and so blinded by her own hurts that she could not recognize the ways she hurt others.
"If it wasn't, prejudice borne from ignorance would not be nearly so widespread."
It's hard to see the pain of others when you're so busy wallowing in your own.
It is easy to poke and prod at your hurts and then feel betrayed when they do not heal.
"Consider a dog, scratching relentlessly at his own stitches until he reopens the wound."
This is why we make them wear cones.
"For ourselves, we pretend at self-discipline."
"An alcoholic says, 'I can still go to the bar with my friends."
"A cutter says, 'I can still keep the knife by my bed."
I just won't reach for it.'
"An addict says, 'I can still go to the party."
I just won't take what is offered.'
"In the novel Sharp Objects, Gillian Flynn writes, 'Sometimes I think illness sits inside every woman, waiting for the right moment to bloom.'"
"This can be physical illness, like the kind the protagonist's mother forces on her daughters."
"And it can refer to mental illness, like the protagonist's own, which manifests mostly in an overwhelming need to cut words into her skin."
"Often, the illness waiting patiently inside each woman is a cyanide capsule put there by another woman."
Pain passed down like an heirloom.
"In Sharp Objects, the protagonist, Camille, received hers from her mother, Adora, who received hers from her mother in turn."
"When I realized this, I set the book down to cry."
"I thought of my abuse at the hands of my mother, who had been abused by hers."
I used to cut words into my skin too.
"I carried a little CD case filled with pocket knives, razor blades, protractor needles, and thick shards of glass; I preferred glass shards because they cut on each end and their cuts burned longer."
"I kept this case for some time, even after I'd stopped cutting."
Just looking at it was a comfort of its own.
"There is a lot to be said about the inherent pain that comes with being a woman, especially generational trauma based in fear of sexual violence and lack of bodily autonomy, which our mothers, aunts, grandmothers, gave to us rather than questioned."
"We see this in women at salons, crying as their daughters cut or dye their hair."
"From Tess Morgan, the pseudonym under which a mother wrote a whopping melodrama to The Guardian when her child had the indecency to get a tattoo: 'I will never look at you in the same way again."
"She said 'your body,' but really she meant 'our body."
"'In Sharp Objects, when Adora sees the extent to which Camille has mauled her own skin, she treats this as an attack against her, because Adora cannot see Camille as anything but an extension of herself."
My mother's own reaction to my cutting was similar.
"When I had my lip pierced, she refused to speak to me for two weeks."
"When she discovered I was sexually active, she put me on house arrest and then disowned me."
"And so in their search for control, they turn to their children's bodies."
"Of course, mothers who feel some sadness at watching their children change - or hurt - themselves are not automatically bad mothers."
But sometimes this sadness becomes a seed that can grow into a manipulative grief and a malignant need to exert power.
It does not have to be dissected and examined and redistributed for the consumption of others.
Your pain can belong to you only.
This idea that when a woman is born she is gifted pain and she will always have this pain until she dies because she is a woman makes me weary.
I would like to see women feel their pain but also recognize the causes and try to move forward and find happiness and self-fulfillment.
"Maybe the pain never dissolves, maybe it always exists inside us, but it can exist alongside a future that is painless."
A scar is nothing but pain healed over.
I have never related so viscerally to a protagonist as I relate to Camille Preaker from Sharp Objects.
"Here is a woman in pain, a pain so inherent that she cannot remember ever not feeling it."
"She is not unkind, but she is not particularly kind either."
"She is not a good victim, but she is an easy one."
"But she is trying, desperately, in a way that no one else can see."
"She is me in another life, with a different sister."
"Camille, who lost her sister at 13, imagines a world where Marian had not died."
"As someone whose Marian did not die, I believe the answer is yes."
Camille represents a particular victim that I don't often see: the female victim of a female abuser and - even more specifically-the child victim of a maternal abuser.
Evil mothers written by men are usually propaganda.
"Camille hates women because of what a woman has done to her, though of course she does not recognize that."
"And, what's more, Camille does not recognize the multitude of ways other people, primarily men, have hurt her because the hurts they dealt have never been as devastating as the pain from her mother. '"
"A child weaned on poison considers harm a comfort,' she says."
"In one scene, Camille describes how as a blackout-drunk 13-year-old girl she was 'passed around' four football players."
"She says, 'Sometimes drunk women aren't raped; they just make stupid choices - and to say we deserve special treatment when we're drunk because we're women, to say we need to be looked after"
"She chose to go to those woods, she chose to drink, and she chose to put herself in that position."
"Whatever happened afterward, well, those are just the consequences of her actions."
At least that's what she's been taught to tell herself.
"Last summer, I went to a bar in Milwaukee with two other flight crew members I did not know well."
"I repeated these things to myself throughout the following day, as if I were my own interrogator."
We arrived at the bar around 3 or 4 in the afternoon.
We left around 9 or 10.
I had four drinks over five or six hours.
All of us went to the bathroom multiple times.
"There was someone asleep in the bed, who I later realized"
"was the other flight attendant, though without my glasses, I could not make her out."
"Wrapped in a towel and dripping wet, without my clothes, phone, glasses, or key card, I stumbled out into the hallway, only to realize I could not get into my own room."
Another flight attendant woke up to me knocking on her door.
"She gave me my clothes, my phone, my key card."
"She explained that we had gone to our captain's hotel room to watch something, and she wanted to leave"
"I vaguely remembered she and I kissing in his room, though I was too drunk to really move at the time."
This was a situation I can feel righteous indignation about: I did not ask for drugs.
No one offered me a choice.
I did not drink enough to put myself in that position.
"And yet, I still feel a shallow amount of shame, like standing ankle-deep in dark water."
I did go to the bar with people I didn't know.
"I did leave my drink alone, even though I know better. '"
"I know better,' the mantra that's followed me from my childhood. '"
"You know better' turned into 'I know better,' but it's still said in my mother's voice."
"A month later, while visiting Boston with my mother, I gave her a general summary of what happened."
"I'm not sure why I mentioned it, and I regretted it immediately."
"I don't mean to keep testing my mother, offering these scraps of myself as feathered lures, hoping she might surprise me while knowing she never will."
"She said, 'Can you now understand why as your mother I have trouble trusting your choices that led to this?'"
"Lure swallowed, she sank, and I still don't know what I expected."
"When I told my sister about the incident in Milwaukee, she held me close."
She said she was glad I was alright and that she loved me.
"I hated women for a long time because of what my mother did to me, though of course I didn't recognize it for what it was."
It was hard for me to empathize with women.
"My own dragon was a woman, a self-proclaimed feminist even, and no matter how many times I cut off her head, there were always more."
"To me, all these towering, powerful women wore the face of my mother, who was a towering, powerful force of her own."
"This was probably unfair given that the most positive figure in my life, my older sister, was also a woman."
"My abuser was a woman, and so I could not trust women."
Underneath this was the fact that I also loved women - but in a way that was 'wrong.'
I thought about women as I had sex with men.
I thought only about women when I watched romantic scenes between women and men.
"I thought about women in locker rooms, in shopping malls, in train stations."
"Because I could not think about them rightly, I made these thoughts mean."
I imagined the girls I liked as I let men fuck me:
"I was uncomfortable with my own lust, so I turned it into a competition."
This was what I told girls when I kissed them. '
Let's see who can do it better.'
"By the end, I always announced that I'd won, though during the actual act of it, I would forget we were supposed to be competing."
I struggle to relate to womanhood as defined by heterosexual women.
"encourages us to acknowledge the loving deepness of friendship between women, which will always be stronger than marriages women find themselves falling into. '"
"Not if you marry a woman,' I think to myself. '"
Not if you fall in love with your best friend.'
"Never mind the fact that the women penning these think pieces and articles were often the teenagers screeching, 'Why are you looking at me?"
at girls like me in middle school locker rooms.
"When Camille Preaker goes back to her hometown, she is forced to reconcile not only what was done to her, but what she did to other people."
"Often, people who are hurting like to hurt."
"As a teenager, I had a specific response to whenever my mother would hurt me."
"After she was finished, I would go looking for something she loved."
My mother always loved 'things': shelves filled with knickknacks and figurines and ceramic plaques and fragile pottery.
She always knew it was me.
And I would break another thing she loved.
"In this way, I was not a good victim, although I was easy."
"All children make easy targets, even the loud and spiteful ones like me."
It makes sense in terms of access.
"In traditional mother/father households, mothers are commonly the primary caregiver."
They are left alone with the child more often and for longer.
"In a single-parent household, the parent is usually the mother."
People cannot accept that a mother might abuse her own child without first having been a victim herself.
"And my mother was a victim, long before she decided to pass that pain along."
"And her mother had been a victim too, molested by her father while her mother allowed it to go on."
"I wonder if that brings my mother any comfort, if it helps her 'try empathy' when she looks at the scars her mother gave her."
"Gillian Flynn writes women who do horrible things, and she does not expect or even want us to forgive them."
She writes women who hurt other women in poignant ways that cannot begin to compare to any crimes the men in her stories commit.
"The men in Flynn's stories are inconsequential, easily supplanted by any other man."
They hurt in the usual ways.
Women expect men to hurt us.
"When women hurt other women, it is deep and lasting and influential."
"In Sharp Objects, Camille's younger sister Amma says, 'Sometimes, if you let people do things to you, you're really doing it to them.'"
And sometimes you're doing it to yourself.
"When Camille drank her mother's milk, even knowing it was poisoned, she was thinking, 'Come on."
Is that the best you've got?'
"As a teenager, I constantly pushed back at my mother, dared her to yell louder, to hit harder, to bruise more."
"One evening, my mother choked me in the kitchen, and as my vision began to blacken around the edges, I thought, 'At least if she kills me, she won't get away with it."
"'Last year, I spent 10 days visiting my sister in Okinawa."
"We went to the beach, a pastoral painting of white sand and cotton sky and crystal-blue water, a color scheme I had not believed was based in reality."
"We went through the cities, architectural spiderwebs of coral roads and geometric buildings freckled with spots of sprawling forest gnawing at the red-tiled roofs."
My brother-in-law had several bottles of different kinds of sake for me to try.
"The habu snake is a type of pit viper, related to the rattlesnake and very venomous."
"The snake is inserted into the liquid, and the aging process dissolves the venom, making it nonpoisonous."
There are two methods for inserting the snake:
"Either the maker simply submerges the snake and lets it drown, in which case its body will not be coiled and posed, or they can freeze the snake."
"As it thaws and gains consciousness just for a moment before succumbing to its injuries, the habu snake will coil and prepare to strike."
I held the bottled snake in my hands as my brother-in-law explained this.
"With each movement, some of the snake's scales began to flake from its body."
"I tried to imagine the horror of waking up to find that, in your unconsciousness, your body had been so mutilated."
"Cut into, emptied, and sewn back together like nothing happened."
"In Sharp Objects, Camille dreams that her mother has cut her open and taken everything out, sewing her initials into everything before putting it back in again, orderly and clean."
"My own mother would often comb through my room while I was gone, or even sleeping, taking anything she thought I shouldn't have, innocuous things like skirts and candy."
"When I asked her if she had seen the missing items, she blamed me. '"
"You never take care of your things,' she scolded."
"These are the things you have to do, when you cannot trust the person who is supposed to care for you: Dig through dumpsters and dirty clothes, searching among the trash and filth for proof"
"On my last day in Okinawa, my sister packed me a bento box to take on the plane."
"She filled it with golden kiwi, naan, and beni imo, an Okinawan sweet potato with flesh as purple as a cracked geode."
"She said, 'I don't want you to be hungry.'"
"My sister, a mother, is the bar by which I compare all others."
"When my niece announced she wanted to shave her head of beloved auburn curls, my sister gamely fetched a pile of hairstyle magazines for her to thumb through and choose between."
Anne Sexton wrote about the pain of womanhood and motherhood.
Sexton sexually abused her daughter Linda for many years.
"She wrote: 'Linda, you are leaving / your old body now, /"
"it lies flat, an old butterfly, / all arm, all leg,"
She wrote this poem for Linda's 18th birthday.
"To Linda herself, as a teenage girl attempting to place boundaries around her molested body, Sexton said, 'There is no wrong way for a mother to love her child."
there is a specific architectural pain built between mothers and daughters.
"To deny this is to deny the victims their own voices, their own articulation and excision of pain."
"so visceral that when I woke, I spent the morning believing it was a memory."
"In it, my mother and I lived together in an old house, and we knew each other in a way I now realize we never will."
The dream itself was innocuous: We watched a movie.
I fetched her pain medication for her knees and held her hand as she fell asleep.
But the love and the trust that swelled between us was overwhelming.
It was all I had ever wanted.
"On realizing it was not real, I began to wonder about that gentle dream mother who looked like mine."
Had she had a mother who loved her too?
This is always the question we ask ourselves when we are mistreated: What would have to change for them to love
How high up on the ladder of familial abuse must I climb before I can finally see what brings a mother to hate her daughter?I have so much love and faith in women and in our ability to heal and help and grow.
"We cannot erase these scars completely, but the skin can learn new memories."
My mother and I now have matching tattoos.
"Mine is on my shoulder blade, the same skin she once bruised."
She kept laughing as I was getting it done because I couldn't stop dancing to the music playing over the speakers.
"When I see it in the mirror as I undress for the shower, I no longer think of the pain of my adolescence, the fear of my mother's shadow."
I think about my mother's laugh.
"For those who missed the previous lessons, check them out here."
"Today, for the final lesson, I want to talk not about making changes, but about making them last."
Productivity is especially prone to bursts of enthusiasm followed by burnout.
"You get an idea for a new working routine, schedule or system."
Maybe you even stick with it for a couple weeks.
"How can you make focus last?Part of the problem is simply that the initial commitment to focus needs to be long enough, to have a chance to sustain long-term habits."
and I chose to make Life of Focus a three-month course was to give students the time to build a solid foundation.
"While twenty-one or thirty days is often cited as the 'correct' time to make a new habit, researchers that studied this found the average was actually over sixty days.[1]"
"And this was only an average, harder habits required almost a year before they felt effortless."
"The lesson is simple: if you care about making a change in your life last long-term, you need to make it a priority for your life for more than a few weeks."
It's true that time makes a big difference in the transition between new ways of life.
"The reason willpower is needed initially is that the old behavioral patterns get triggered automatically, and they require conscious reflection to override."
"Yet, I would argue that this is actually not the most important factor in whether a change lasts."
"Instead, the problem is that most new systems we dream up and implement for our lives are actually broken."
They have broken parts that snag when we try to use them.
"With effort, you can use them for a while."
But eventually they break down and you retreat back to an easier default.
"Let's look at a concrete example: A few years ago, I decided I was using Twitter too much."
"I'm off it now, but at the time it mattered for my work"
What should I do?My first plan was simply to limit my total time for checking the service.
I installed Leechblock on my computer and had it shut off the website whenever I used it for more than five minutes in a four-hour period.
"Now I'm only able to use it for around half and hour per day, which was about how much time I thought was appropriate."
"Except, I found myself frustrated when I would open up a browser, try to check the website and it was blocked."
"This happened often enough, that one day, a couple months after I started, I simply removed all the restrictions."
What went wrong?My plan wasn't unsophisticated.
"It even lasted for a few months, which is much better than most people's half-hearted promises to 'use my phone less.'"
"In retrospect, one of the major problems was simply that the context for checking Twitter was never restricted."
"Since any moment in the day could potentially be a time to check (as long as I hadn't used up my five minutes), then checking was always salient."
The impulse was always there and this created a snag that pulled at my plans.
These days I'm not using Twitter at all.
"But suppose I did want to keep up about twenty minutes a day for work purposes, what system could have worked better?If I had decided, instead of random five-minute intervals, to enable Twitter only at very specific times a day (say right after work or during lunch), then my impulse to check the service would be more likely restricted to those contexts."
Certainly such a small difference can't matter much?A small snag may not matter if its only encountered once.
"But repeated every day, for months at a time, and even small differences in friction can grind your plans to a halt."
This suggests a change in mindset is required.
"In the last homework for this lesson series, I want you to consider your own plans for focus."
How are you trying to guide your attention?
What are the systems that allow you to do that?Try this:
"In Life of Focus, we guide you through a process of redesigning the systems that govern what you pay attention to and why."
"All of this, of course, is to give you more power over how you spend your time and energy - back onto things that you really care about."
"I woke up, fried an egg in a pan, tossed in some hot peppers, tomato, and onion."
I let them all cook for a bit before throwing in spinach.
"Then I added some Tamari sauce, toasted a piece of Rye bread, and put it all on a plate."
do you think things will go back to normal.
"But I wanted to answer later, after I had enjoyed my breakfast."
I knew my honest response would trigger rage.
Normal wasn't a thing that existed outside.
Normal was not stores being open.
"Even before this, I worked from home and hardly bought anything that wasn't essential."
It just wasn't normal for others.
"But I still woke up and ate by 7:30 a.m., took a walk, showered, wrote, cleaned, worked from 12-4 pm, then exercised, ate dinner, and relaxed."
That was still my schedule...practically unchanged.
"Normal was just a combination of what you were used to doing, and what you wanted to do."
"Sometimes the two worked together, and sometimes they didn't."
Sometimes what you're used to is more comfortable than what you want.
And sometimes what you want is a destructive monster.
"more, cleaning more, working more, working less..."
When was it going to dawn on them that there really was no pause?Time kept on.
