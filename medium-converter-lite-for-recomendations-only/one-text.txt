Wow, she is really a good person.

But why did she do it?

Gave me an expensive coffee as a gift.

I don’t understand…

Well, today, in this city I try coffee for the first time!

I still don’t feel excitement about it.

Anyway, let’s try this...

(tries a sip)

Wow, it’s like cacao, but for adults.

(sips)

I feel like I have already grown up!

Wait..

The girl said “I hope you’ll find the right way”.

How did she know that i’m lost?

Anyway.

You first need to get lost to find yourself, ha?
