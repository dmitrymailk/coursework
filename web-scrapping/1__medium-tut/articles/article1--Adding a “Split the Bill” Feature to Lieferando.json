It\u2019s late, it\u2019s Netflix time o\u2019clock, and you are starving. What better moment to order a good old Pizza Margherita online. You\u2019re ordering two pizzas and your friend\u2019s also wants a starter on top \u2014 both of you don\u2019t have cash, so you pay the whole thing via Paypal and your friend tells you he\u2019s paying you back asap. You\u2019re a bit short on money these days, so you reluctantly give him a nod. You know your friend \u2014 he will forget and you will have to run after your money. Meh."

The company was founded in 2009 in Berlin and in 2014 it was bought by Dutch company Takeaway.com. In the last few years some other companies joined the food delivery race, including Delivery Hero and Deliveroo\u2026 well, Delivery Hero was bought by Lieferando in 2019 and Deliveroo left the German market. So precisely, direct competition is non-existent."

      "type": "sentence",
      "content": "The feature solution described above involved the integration in the app in various places. During the checkout process, users have to select their payment method. At this point it makes sense to let the user opt for splitting the costs. In addition to that the account menu should have a new page listing contacts, so users can start saving contacts that they repeatedly order food with. This will speed up the checkout process even more. When a payment request is sent to a user this will happen directly via Paypal, but also within the Lieferando app \u2014 that\u2019s where the Inbox is coming into the game."

The new feature is coming into action after the appearance of the \u201cYour Order\u201d page, when the user decides to split the bill, who to split it with and how to split it. Here he or she has two options \u2014 to split it equally or to select items per person. By confirming the order and receiving the order confirmation, a Paypal payment request is sent to the email (and/or saved contact) indicated in this process."
