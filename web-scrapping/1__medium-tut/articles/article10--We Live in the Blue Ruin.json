Pairs are a technicality \u2014 feet, hands, kidneys, ears, and eyes \u2014 you may keep the plurals with some restrictions. For example, you may retain your feet, but you\u2019ll have to make tough decisions regarding the toes. Eyes may be preserved, but sight isn\u2019t guaranteed. We\u2019re not unreasonable people, but there are limits to our generosity. Some of The Originals try to invent loopholes, they lobby for shared items and fractions \u2014 if we each preserve 2.5 fingers we\u2019ll have an entire right hand!

We had an incident \u2014 you might have read about it in the papers \u2014 concerning @grady. We miscalculated the appropriate dosage of desire, and as a result we experienced an unfortunate situation, a contagion. His banal encounter with Super User @felsull was misinterpreted; affection developed (one-sided, of course, because @felsull really didn\u2019t have the time since she accumulated one million Likes, Hearts, and Fans!) that resulted in a virus that plagued all of The Blue.

All the rules of engagement are detailed in your Packet. The goal is to be popular, be liked, and you do this by being what people wish they could be. Pictures and inspiring quotes only go so far \u2014 we merely give you the tools in the toolbox, it\u2019s up to you to build your kingdom.

So we read about a program that promised a rebirth. Imagine being born into a virtual world where pain ceased to exist. There would be no pestilence, famine, corruption, environmental catastrophe, or war. The whole of your life would exist within the confines of a seven-by-seven room \u2014 a virtual bunker that would shield us from the physicality of the natural world.

How could we explain the negligence that occurs when whole parts of our bodies vanished? How could we comprehend that we don\u2019t remember the children we spent 10 years in a room trying to reclaim? Was it worth it? When we were paraded out in front of our children to say our goodbyes, some parents blinked onto their screens: I\u2019m sorry. Do you belong to me? I don\u2019t remember you.
