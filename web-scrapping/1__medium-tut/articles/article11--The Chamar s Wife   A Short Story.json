I didn\u2019t tell anyone. I left it there, crying and drowning in the dirt again. I was a few years older when I learned that many fathers here chose to bury their girls. It was old news \u2014 centuries-old \u2014 but it was still new to me. I must have wondered over a hundred times what had stopped my father from doing the same. I\u2019ve never asked. I soon learned he doesn\u2019t do the same things as all the other fathers: he refuses to lower his head when the Thakurs talk back to him, he rarely pauses when he enters a sacred space not meant for us and he never accepts money from uncomfortable men even when he\u2019s got nothing but the clink of a few rupees in his shirt pocket."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "His defiance has become an annoyance."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cFather, please.

The worst had happened and I no longer had no-one to worry about. I thought solitude would be liberating but it\u2019s overwhelming. So I\u2019ve set up on a small patch of balding grass near a block of suburban flats. I like to observe the life of its female residents. Their daily routines bring me comfort. Although, their maidservants do most of the hard work. Every morning, their glass balconies are adorned with freshly-washed clothing: vibrant salwars and sarees, fancy undergarments and white shirts that hang beside different styles of school uniforms. Toward the top of the building, I can hardly make out whether the clothes belong to a girl or boy. I also get to speak with other women \u2014 of my kind, who go about tending to the communal gardens outside the flats. The building\u2019s white walls provide relief from the midday sun when I bathe. Sometimes, I notice the female residents watching me from their balconies. What pleasure they get I do not know. Perhaps, they wonder why I bathe outside. I\u2019m sure they can see how small my shack is, it barely fits a charpoy and a few cooking utensils let alone space to freshen up. Still, I don\u2019t mind the women, it\u2019s when their husbands look that I wish I could crawl into myself. The wives are pretty, I can only imagine their butter-soft skin. Some wear gold necklaces that glide down the middle of the curves of their chest. Curves that look like they\u2019ve been obtained from feasting on more than a healthy amount of food. The sight could make you believe goddesses lived on earth. Mother used to tell me I have a nice face. \u201cYou have the perfect amount of space between your eyes that when it comes to marriage, no one will even notice your stick-thin form. Just stay away from those city men. They want nothing from you except your vagina.\u201d Mother wouldn\u2019t be too pleased with my setup here."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I don\u2019t pick up dead animals anymore. I didn\u2019t refuse. I just left it. Who\u2019s going to come and find me? No-one. Only the men get hassled to take such jobs. Lucky for me, the government doesn\u2019t care about me. Also lucky for me that my father kept my mother\u2019s old sewing kit. Only a few items remain now: a slightly-curved needle, black, red and white thread \u2014 the essentials, and a few bobbins. Not that I\u2019d need them because they are no use without a machine. Father brought them for mother on what he thought was her birthday. Even my mother didn\u2019t know the date of her birthday. He\u2019d promised that one day he\u2019d buy her a sewing machine, a second-hand one, of course, but he\u2019d buy her one nonetheless. It doesn\u2019t matter now. The threads I own are enough to make the money I need. The work comes in bits and pieces from the women who tend to the building. A little wear and tear don\u2019t bother them, it\u2019s only when the holes in their blouses reveal more flesh than they\u2019d like that they are forced to have them mended. Once in a while, they\u2019ll bring around their husband\u2019s clothes; missing shirt buttons and unruly trouser hems. Small things that they can afford to get done. I\u2019m sure they can do it themselves but they take pity on me. And I\u2019m grateful because their clothing calamities are enough for me to buy myself some rice. The boy whose vegetable stall I pass on the way to buy the rice saves me leftover scraps of coriander and spinach. Gives them to me for free. When his father mans the stall, I come back with just the rice. Last week, the boy gave me a few tomatoes. I don\u2019t like tomatoes but I can hardly tell him that when he\u2019s kind enough to give them to me, so I threw them to the stray dogs when he wasn\u2019t looking."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cEy.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I look up to find a formal figure standing over me.

Manoj\u2019s uncle had also instructed Sheetal to go and pick up an outfit for me. The saree was an explosion of crimson with burnt gold embroidery; the prettiest piece of clothing I have worn in my life. We sold it after the ceremony. I would have liked to keep it but Manoj said we need the money more than we need an attachment to memories. \u201cYou want to eat life when all we taste is death,\u201d he\u2019d repeated. Sometimes, I think he awaits the liberation of death just so he\u2019ll be free from having to decipher his existence. Unlike father, he has no desire to fight. Not that he has to fight much. These days, he roams around town a lot more than usual. Mostly, he is out with Sheetal. After his uncle died the two of them became close. They drink a lot when they are together because I can smell it on his breath and his clothes. The first time he came home drunk I told him I didn\u2019t like it and that he shouldn\u2019t do it again. I told him how my father never drank. Father said that men who had troubles shouldn\u2019t drink because every glass will add more trouble and subtract none. Father never had a death wish either \u2014 at least not from alcohol. It\u2019s dangerous in a dry state like ours. Who knows where it comes from or how it\u2019s made, especially for people like us. Manoj didn\u2019t appreciate me looking out for him because he told me to stay out of his business. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you were born a girl, otherwise you\u2019d get a slap,\u201d he\u2019d said. I didn\u2019t push him on the topic again."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I focused my efforts on getting better at skinning. The trick lies in a sharp knife and steady hands. Although, my hands are never steady anymore. The knife helps pull the skin away from the muscle and bone. The skin becomes rough after the animal is dead. Since becoming pregnant, though, the smell has become unbearable. The oils and salts do not carry distinct scents anymore; they have merged together, with the further smell of sour meat. I dare not close my eyes when I\u2019m working, I\u2019m afraid to wake up in something worse than an apocalyptic warehouse. But the leather brings us money \u2014 for now, at least. Manoj says the government will soon stop us from skinning for leather. They want to make sure the reputable tanneries in Chennai take care of it. Manoj is furious. I\u2019m glad. The few times I\u2019ve asked him if he can do the skinning he reminds me that I came with no dowry.

Not that I\u2019m complaining, this is my life. Slightly altered but the same. It\u2019s not the same as my parents\u2019 evenings, of course.

The arguments were hardly bitter even though the talk was not all sweet. They are the reason I like to talk, but no-one likes to talk to me. Not unless they want to tell me what to do. Manoj doesn\u2019t have any stories. If he does, he chooses to tell Sheetal them instead. He\u2019ll probably tell her how I got offended because she sent food. She\u2019ll laugh but understand why another woman chooses to dislike her. Then she\u2019ll comfort him in ways I cannot. It\u2019s not funny but I giggle because he\u2019s clumsy in the bedroom. A boy trying to imitate a man. I don\u2019t have anyone to compare him to but she will. Manoj looks at me, his thick eyebrows turned up out of irritation rather than curiosity. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d I tell him. He continues with his dinner.

He was shouting at me: It\u2019s a girl. It\u2019s a girl. You stupid woman. We cannot have her. He snatched her by her legs as if she were made of rubber; unable to be broken. He threw the baby to Sheetal who let her fall on the floor. She wasn\u2019t Sheetal anymore. She was a wild predator who sank her teeth into the plastic doll that lay under her. I let no more tears fall; I\u2019d given birth to a doll, not a baby, what use was it? The animal shot me a look with its piercing black eyeballs, smug, as if they saw something I didn\u2019t. As if the doll would bring the creature sudden prosperity."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I wipe sweat the dream left off my forehead and chin with the corner of my saree but the fabric is slippery and leaves a sticky film of wetness over my face. Manoj is sleeping on the floor beside me, breathing heavily through his mouth. He doesn\u2019t have the best of profiles, his prominent nose makes his small chin appear nonexistent. I wonder what Sheetal sees in him. Is she the reason he hasn\u2019t taken an interest in this baby? It\u2019s been so long I can\u2019t remember his reaction to hearing I was pregnant. I try to recall it but it doesn\u2019t come. But you remember people being happy, don\u2019t you? Manoj has never been happy. I place both hands over my bump. What if you\u2019re a girl, I whisper to it. If your father is anything like the Manoj I dreamt about, he\u2019ll probably bury you where the cattle bones are kept or he\u2019ll ask Sheetal to sell you. God knows we need the money more than we need the attachment to unwanted babies, he\u2019d say. And what will your mother do when your father is getting rid of you? I whisper again. The women my mother knew held their stomachs up and carried on with their days, tending to the cooking and cleaning, frantically erasing the nine months gone. Not long after, they\u2019d be pregnant again. They\u2019d ask my mother to pray for them: Pray for a boy. What use was that when her own prayers hadn\u2019t worked. Most had girls again that would soon disappear. The mothers would too if they had a girl three times in a row. I don\u2019t want anyone to pray for me. Whoever is inside, it\u2019s mine. There\u2019s nothing else in this world I can call mine. I\u2019m disposed to it. But does it trump the duty I have towards my husband? Without an elder present, I have no-one to ask. No-one to confide in. Perhaps I should be glad. There are elders who offer ill-intentioned advice. Mothers who side with their son\u2019s choices, no matter how gruesome.

Question upon question fills my head: where will I go? How will I live? What if it\u2019s a boy; do I need to go? What if it\u2019s a girl? Will Manoj care? Despite them, I scan the room for a clue to where Manoj keeps all the cash, but he shuffles and begins to peel open his eyes, as though he knows what\u2019s going through my head. I let the idea evaporate as I lay back down. I cover my belly with my saree. I arrive at the conclusion that Manoj wouldn\u2019t care that I\u2019ve gone, just that I\u2019ve taken the money."}]}
