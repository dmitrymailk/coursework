That\u2019s what I said, anyway. Because there were questions, you know. Not very common to see a 20-year-old single gal move into a mobile home park. It was a tight-knit crew at Eden Springs Mobile Home Community and they were rather nosey. I would tell one thing to Cheryl from Unit #27 and Louisa from Unit #44 would casually ask me about that very same thing. So I was light with the detail, heavy on the \u201cyes ma\u2019am\u201d and \u201cno ma\u2019am\u201d and I had my signature line \u201crecovering from heartbreak\u201d that I could use when they were really prying."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It wasn\u2019t the normal kind of heartbreak, at least the ones Cheryl, Louisa, and Mari were familiar with, anyway. But calling things different names didn\u2019t make it hurt any less."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It had to be hard, loving someone like me. I was an amalgamation of sitcoms my Nana used to watch, songs I heard on the radio and lines other people told me that sounded nice enough to repeat. I was a kaleidoscope of references I couldn\u2019t place and opinions that didn\u2019t belong to me. I had no fixed personality or preferences of my own, so I reflected those around me."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That\u2019s why I felt for Travis, because it had to be hard, loving someone who wasn\u2019t a real person at all. He had to be content with forever being my #2. Because no matter how many summer afternoons he and I spent kissing on the couch, no matter how many times he would grin down at me that I was his very favorite girl, no matter how many days he worked on cars to provide for me, it was never really about him."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It used to be so fun."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It was Fourth of Julys and bottles of Jim Bean being passed in the back of pickup trucks. It was running from car to car at the drive-in with brown bags and drinking until dawn with all of my friends in the Motel 6. It was the first sip of white wine in the summertime down by the lake and drunk kissing behind a tree. It was pouring vodka into water bottles with my gal pal Charlie to bring to school and giggling all through geometry."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Charlie and I thought we were hot shit because we could spit back the rhetoric the older guys we drank with had told us about how school was devised to combat our original thoughts and turn us into cogs in the machine. But Charlie and I really didn\u2019t have any original thoughts of our own. We had submerged them in so much Burnett\u2019s they didn\u2019t have a fighting chance to emerge. So we repeated their thoughts and we thought we were cool for it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And we were. Cool, that is. No one else in our grade was drinking with the older boys, riding around in Mustangs, raising hell all around Savannah. They picked us and we were special for it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I don\u2019t remember ever deciding to be with Travis. I was wasted, he was interested in me and he was old enough to get me any kind of alcohol I liked, so I let him press his lips to mine. He was a mechanic and he had a car, which was mighty impressive when I was 15. Best of all, he was in love with me, so he would do anything for me."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Charlie went away to school once we graduated, which I thought was just the silliest damn thing I ever heard. All that talk we were always spitting out about how school is an establishment designed to entrap us and here she was, all chipper in her Georgia State gear, all jazzed up for rush week."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cCharlie, promise me,\u201d I asked her while we were drinking by the riverbank with the boys for her going away party, \u201cPromise it\u2019ll be just like it is now when you come back to visit?\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cIt will be, I swear it\u201d she giggled, that signature toothy Charlie laugh I loved so much. It was the soundtrack to the best memories of my life, \u201cWe\u2019re always going to be best friends. I promise.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We pinky-promised while the boys shot fireworks into the sky. I embraced her while they popped above us into the inky night and the boys howled at the moon."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I really thought it would all be the same when she came back, with the Motel 6 parties, the brown bags, and the mischief."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It was different the next summer, though. She was different. She had all of these stories and all of these new friends. She was taking online classes. Her hair was straightened from the brown mop of curly brown hair she used to let run wild. She would stop drinking every night by 11pm to make sure she was in the right frame of mind for studying the next morning."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And she asked me questions about me, which was the worst part."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked when she picked me up in her Buick to go meet up with the guys at the drive-in, \u201cWhat have you been up to?\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I shrugged, \u201cY\u2019 know. Drinking. With Travis. Figuring it out.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There was something in her eyes I couldn\u2019t figure out. She had her sorority, her passion for nursing, her preppy friends, her frat boyfriend. I was a nothing girl, no stories beyond the ones I saw on television, nothing to show for the past year besides a hell of a lot of empty bottles. I wanted to plead with her, to ask her why she would leave me, why didn\u2019t she tell me we were supposed to move on with our lives? We had made a pinky promise, didn\u2019t that mean anything?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But rather than say anything of the sort, I just drank myself into darkness and I was told by Travis later, I screamed at her about how she forgot me. These screaming fits were becoming more and more common when I drank, spitting venom at whoever was in front of me just like my mama used to do."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That was the last night I saw her."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When Charlie moved to Atlanta, I moved in with Travis to his condo in Pooler, which was about 10 minutes from where I lived with Nana in Savannah. He was a mechanic, a mighty good one too. He could just put his hands on a vehicle and know what the hell was wrong with it. With women, he didn\u2019t exactly have the same ability. When it came to putting his hands on my body, that is."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I loved living with him anyway, because he didn\u2019t ever ask me to figure it out. He let me drink all day to watch television programs and listen to records. He let me talk nonsense to him when I was wasted about how the clouds looked like the color lilac, when he knew very well they were just grey. He would nod when I told him about my dreams of becoming an actress. When you\u2019re drinking, you can turn grey clouds into lavender, a day watching television into an adventure and a girl into an actress. He was fine with letting me live in my dream world, so long as I was there when he got home from work and I still grinned up at him, his girl, his sanctuary after dealing with the long, hard days of his work."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I wasn\u2019t a complete piece of shit, okay. I cleaned, I grocery shopped for the two of us, I cooked him dinner every day. I called my Nana every afternoon. I had a glass of Jim Beam waiting for him once he returned every night, exhausted and covered in grease. I sat on his lap while we watched television and I tousled his hair with my fingers. We were dirt broke but we had each other, we had a television that worked most of the time, the oven was out but the stovetop worked just fine. We cuddled on the couch we bought at a yard sale at the side of the road. He didn\u2019t tell me what the money was really like, but he always managed to pass me two twenties to get the groceries and the alcohol for the week on Fridays with my fake ID. He didn\u2019t ask me to get a job or to limit my drinking. So it suited me just fine."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And that was it \u2014 we had drinking. Doesn\u2019t matter where you are if you\u2019re drinking. Our little universe, with game shows, records, dreams that would never come true and Jim Beam, made us feel like we were royalty. Weekends we would drink by the river or set fireworks in the fields with his friends, bottles in hand and electricity through our veins."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I used to think we could be anywhere, we could get through anything if we just had each other. I now think it\u2019s just cause we had booze."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I dunno when exactly I realized I was in love with alcohol. I loved Travis, our little home and our little life."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But I loved drinking so much more. It was my real first love. Pressing my lips to the bottle was the truest form of home I\u2019ve found. I got butterflies every Friday when Travis left out $40 bucks and I could go buy more alcohol with my fake ID. Drinking, I felt more confident, more sure of myself, more like a real person than just a combination of sitcoms I half-heard and lyrics I remembered incorrectly. You\u2019re telling me something that makes you feel more like yourself isn\u2019t true love?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "All I knew is I began to love drinking more than I loved anything in my life and it was the only thing I ever felt like doing. I got increasingly anxious waiting for Travis to get home so I could pour us glasses and get back to the living, until I just started drinking before he got home."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Nana could hear the inebriation in my voice for our 2pm balcony calls, I\u2019m sure of it. Both of her daughters had gone down this path and I\u2019m sure it broke her heart to see me fall in love myself."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I knew I had a problem on my 20th birthday. I drank because I was nervous that Charlie would call to wish me a happy birthday, or maybe it was because I was even more scared she would forget. By 11am I was shitfaced, stumbling down the hallway singing happy birthday to myself. I laughed when I realized it. Houston, we\u2019ve got a problem. It struck me incredibly funny to have an alcohol problem when I was still below the legal age of drinking in this country. So I giggled and drank, giggled and drank, and I was passed out by the time Travis got back from work."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When I got the call Nana passed away, I was wasted. I tried to remember the last time she and I had talked and the last conversation we had. I tried to remember the last time I had Travis drive me out to see her. I couldn\u2019t grasp anything firm, it was so waterlogged in all of the boozey memories."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It made me feel so helpless, like that last night I saw Charlie. I wanted to scream at Nana \u2014 why didn\u2019t you tell me you were going to die? Why didn\u2019t you tell me you were getting older?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But hell, maybe she did. I couldn\u2019t remember the last damn conversation we had. Her last thought here on planet Earth must have been the disappointment that I was going the same path as her daughter, my mama. That she failed as a mother twice, losing both of her daughters to alcoholism then taking in her granddaughter who was seduced by the very same demon. Watching me fall in love with Jim Beam and partying just like her daughters did. Wondering if her years in rearing me and loving me when my mom wasn\u2019t able to was a waste."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It took some time, some legal matters and family disputes, but it was decided I was getting some money from Nana\u2019s estate, which I didn\u2019t know she even had one. I grew up thinking we were dirt poor, but Nana was actually fairly smart with money, squirreling it away. She taught me you could live on bread and oranges while you\u2019re waiting on social security. Her mama had lived through the depression so I guess she was good like that."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When my check came in the mail at Travis\u2019, I was terrified. I had never had that kind of money in my life. I didn\u2019t even have a bank account to cash that big ass six-digit number into. But once I learned how to turn that paper to cash, all I could think about is how many damn bottles I could buy with it. I dreamed of getting so obliterated that I could jut suspend myself in that perfect abyss of nothingness."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And y\u2019know, that\u2019s honestly how I planned on spending it. I didn\u2019t have to wait for Fridays when Travis handed me money for the groceries and the drinking anymore. I could buy my own bottles, each day of the week if I wanted to. I could drink as much as I wanted to."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But since Auntie Margaret got Nana\u2019s house, I knew she was going to drink in that damn house until she died. I could just picture Nana\u2019s frown looking down from heaven. And this check, plus the butterfly mobile I swiped from the house I grew up in, were the last parts of my Nana I had."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And I missed her. The only useful memories I could pull out of my television static of a brain were the memories we had when I was much younger. When I was five and she took me to the ice cream parlor the first night I moved in to let me know that my Mama was going away for a while to straighten herself out. When I was 8, when she took me to the fair, bought me cotton candy and took care of me when I threw it all up from the Tilt-a-whirl. When I was 12, when I got my period at school, and she picked me up to wipe my tears and take me to the drug store to tell me what was what. She threw in chocolate and a face mask in with the pads as an extra treat."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Since I met alcohol, sure, she and I had talked every afternoon, but there was nothing to grab onto. It was last the last three years of my life, nothing significant. Just hazy blurs things that feel like they\u2019re funny but you never remember in the morning. Ideas that evaporate into nothingness. Mornings that are tinged with dread. And now I had no idea what exactly her stories were, what her legacy was, what her life was. And it was too late."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That\u2019s the trouble with drinking. You don\u2019t know how much life you\u2019re missing out on."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I hadn\u2019t the damnedest idea of what to do with the money besides drink. Go to college as Charlie did? What would I study? What was I good at besides drinking and watching television?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Paying rent on a new apartment scared me too. It wasn\u2019t a lot in Pooler and that left too much money in my hands for reckless behavior. I wasn\u2019t to be trusted. The responsible thing to do would be to give it to Travis, probably, but then he would just hand me that $40 every Friday. I would stay with Travis because he bought the alcohol and he would keep buying me alcohol so I would stay."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My only remaining decision, in my head at least, was to buy something big, all at once so I wouldn\u2019t have direct access to it and I wouldn\u2019t spend it on alcohol. So I bought a trailer home in Eden, bout 20 minutes from Savannah. Garden of Eden, I thought to myself. Paradise. I think I heard that in one of Nana\u2019s television shows."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After buying the canary yellow mobile home and the lot, I still had some leftover, to cover me a couple of months for the $150 lot fee and the groceries. I had to be strict, though, because it wasn\u2019t much, but Nana had taught me how to get by close to nothing. I left Travis in the middle of the night and took the bus with a duffel bag of my clothes. I kissed him on the cheek but the saddest part was my last sip of Jim Beam."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Life was different here in Eden Springs. I couldn\u2019t afford a television so all I could do for entertainment was read the bible the previous owner Larry left in the closet of my canary yellow trailer. I liked to sit on the patio to watch Nana\u2019s butterfly mobile dance in the wind, casting sunbeams like disco lights all over. I liked to walk to 7/11 to buy a hot dog and a slurpee every Friday afternoon."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I woke up most mornings at dawn at Eden Springs mobile home park. I had bad anxiety from quitting the alcohol cold-turkey \u2014 anxiety that shot me out of bed, heart racing. I began to love the mornings I felt sleepy because I got so sick of springing out of bed as though I was on fire. It was such a hectic way to start a day of doing nothing at all and I could never get back to sleep."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I thought about taking up smoking just to have something to do with all of the nervous energy I had cooped up in the body, but I was too broke for that. So in the mornings I woke up in a panic, I would sit on my patio and wait for the sun to come up, singing to the radio softly so I wouldn\u2019t feel so alone."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That\u2019s how I got to see my neighbor Howie, \u2019cause he was always heading off to work at that time. Whistling, this guy, at like 5am, like there was anything to be cheerful about at that hour. Then he would always tip his hat to me and say good mornin\u2019 as though a bleary-eyed 20-year-old gal was just the most normal thing in the world to see on s scoop of a motor home in Eden, Georgia. After a couple of times of these silent exchanges, I asked him how he was and he always said \u201cbetter than I deserve.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I don\u2019t know what he had done to not deserve to feel good. He seemed like a nice fellow. If I thought about it, I knew I didn\u2019t deserve to feel good \u2014 neglectful granddaughter, shit girlfriend, alcoholic by 20 years of age. I deserved eternal damnation for all of that. So maybe I was doing better than I deserved too, with my empty days in the hot mobile home, watching my butterfly mobile spin in the breeze, singing along to the radio and reading passages from the bible to feel closer to my Nana."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I had been doing nothing when I lived with Travis too, so I was awfully good at it, but this sort of nothing felt different. It felt so much more still without the alcohol. There was so much more time in the day. There was so much more space in my brain. It had taken up the largest part of my days since I was 14 years old, and without it, I just felt so empty. My heart ached for it, the confidence, the happiness, the joy it brought me."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The anxiety and the heartache made me want to drink until I couldn\u2019t see. I wanted to every damn day. I dreamt about it, visualized myself drinking in the trailer park until I just croaked and I could just be suspended in nothingness."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But I didn\u2019t want Howie or Cheryl or my next-trailer neighbor Mari to find me. They didn\u2019t deserve that. And my Nana, looking down at me and my canary yellow trailer, certainly didn\u2019t deserve that."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The first thing I noticed about my next-door neighbor Mari were her nails. The trailers were awfully close to one another, so when she watched television, she would drape her cigarette out of the window, bout a foot away from my patio. She had the most glamorous nails with her cigarette placed in between, pink tiger stripes with palm trees on them, diamonds on her thumbs that caught the sunlight on her thumbs. Then two weeks later, I saw her nails had alternating lavender and celery green nails with little easter eggs on \u2019em for Easter. I didn\u2019t even realize it was Easter."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It gave me something to look forward to, week after week that blisteringly hot spring and summer when all I could afford to eat was bread and oranges \u2014 well, what\u2019s Mari\u2019s nails going to look like this week?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI like your nails,\u201d I told her when she caught me looking at her latest creation, the white butterflies on a hot pink background, \u201cThey\u2019re always so pretty.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cThank you,\u201d she exhaled her smoke, \u201cI\u2019m a hairdresser, so I figure, if I\u2019m gonna have my hands on your head, they might as well be pretty.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cMakes sense.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cY\u2019know, hat mobile always catches my attention,\u201d Mari said, pointing up at Nana\u2019s butterfly mobile with her long pink nails, \u201cThe light goes all over.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I blushed.

I liked remembering going with my Nana to her salon in Savannah every other Thursday when I was young.
