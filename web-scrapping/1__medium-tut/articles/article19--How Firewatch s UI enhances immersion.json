{"title": "How Firewatch\u2019s UI enhances immersion", "data": [{"type": "sentence", "content": "Firewatch slowly crept up on everyone and blew them away, like the video game version of a forest fire (erm, the good kind). A narrative-driven mystery light on game time and heavy on dialogue didn\u2019t seem like everyone\u2019s idea of a sure-fire hit, but players constantly found themselves engaging with the almost-real world of Shoshone National Forest."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Multiple GDC awards and 1 million unit sales later, there is general consensus that Firewatch aims for a niche and hits it pretty well. That niche is immersion. Firewatch wants to put players in the head of Henry, the fire lookout protagonist, and also wants to put players in the environment, with all its underpinnings of foreboding and isolation. And while the brilliant writing, believable voice acting, and gorgeous environments go a long way towards making this immersion happen, I think an oft overlooked aspect is the smart UI choices that Campo Santo made while designing this game."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s run through a primer on video game UI and analyze why Firewatch\u2019s UI choice helped them double down on their niche so successfully."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "A primer on Game UI"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A must-read article on game UI (without delving into research pieces) is this piece by EA Dice designer Marcus Andrews.

The in-game character that the organism controls is separate from the organism, no matter how realistic the gameplay or cosplay."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The UI is the plane the organism passes through to become the avatar. Since the avatar is traditionally dictated by game developers (if you play a space marine game, the hero is a space marine), the goal of UI is to make the organism feel adequately that he or she is the avatar."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "With me so far? Let\u2019s go a level deeper:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Diegetic UI: Interface elements that are visible both to the organism in the real world and the characters/avatars in the game world. For example, in the GIF below, both the GPS marker attached to the car and the map in the avatar\u2019s hand are diegetic UI elements (because they are visible to you, the player, and also to every character in the game world). These elements usually offer the most immersion and form a seamless plane between the organism and the avatar."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*L7WhhA4OnBriwgM16qy4qg.gif"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Non-diegetic UI: UI elements only visible to the organism in the real world and not visible to in-game characters/avatars. For example, in the GIF from Uncharted 4 below, the ammo count, gun icons, and grenade counters on the bottom left of the screen are non-diegetic (because you, the player, can see them but in-game characters cannot). This is hardly the most immersive UI choice, but usually performs well with respect to functionality and getting the necessary information across to the player."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*PHovL3S-C8mdbEW_ZVcIgg.gif"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Spatial UI: UI elements that are presented in the game\u2019s 3D space (whether they are visible to the characters/avatars or not).
