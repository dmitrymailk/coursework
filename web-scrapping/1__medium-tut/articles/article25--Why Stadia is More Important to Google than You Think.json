AWS leveraged the startups and the SMBs to gain immense popularity and traction, Microsoft leveraged their relationship with Enterprise and the power of their \u201clock-in\u201d towards CIOs to enter the public cloud business. Google's cloud market share is about 5%."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2048/1*mwPzrPtT09u7sMhjK8G2-w.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A very simplified way to frame the current public cloud market is that AWS started from startups & SMBs, then raised the target bar towards enterprises, while MS is doing the opposite, starting from enterprises and trying to scale down. Google? Google has been squeezed in the middle with less adoption than the other 2 vendors and less traction on both small and big companies. Google has to find a way to drive hordes of developers to their service and their best chance is to bet on a different, disruptive approach because the \u201cstandard businesses\u201d have been already taken by either AWS or MS."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Videogames business model has evolved over time"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/0*euxv2YmCDOrOahY6"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let me switch context for a while. Videogames used to be something you bought once and you could play them forever.

Quake forced users to activate the game online, by registering a product code and users needed to get online to be able to validate that code. It was not good enough at the time, because ID Software couldn\u2019t rely on the fact that users would have Internet connection whenever they wanted to play: the Internet was a very scarcely available resource, almost luxury in some countries."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As the Internet became widely distributed more companies relied on \u201conline\u201d authorization to let the players access their game. Don\u2019t be fooled, this was not to increase game appeal or accessibility, it was to reduce piracy and to increase revenues."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As the requirement of Internet connection became more common, new business models became viable. World Of Warcraft is a very well known example of a subscription-based game: players would pay every single month to access their game, and it was MASSIVE.

Do the math."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Today, mobile games and modern desktop games implement a similar strategy, it\u2019s not a mandatory monthly payment anymore but a series of \u201coptional\u201d microtransactions that you are, more often than not, forced to buy to stay competitive. So it\u2019s a subscription-based model masked as a free-to-play model. 30% of gamers pay for subscriptions (source Gamasutra)."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/890/1*zOaoMn54homWupYnrd5JCg.gif"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Supercell\u2019s Clash of Clans, a very popular mobile game has been generating over 1M$ revenues PER DAY for years (source gamerevolution)."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Modern games are expensive"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The catch with modern popular games is that in order to serve that amount of users and the low latency expected, companies must invest an immense amount of resources in infrastructure, often cloud infrastructure. The good news is that the \u201cserver\u201d part of the game is the same (or almost the same), regardless of the different client platforms accessing it. The \u201cclient\u201d part of the game, however, is usually totally different from platform to platform and it requires to be heavily re-engineered to be available on multiple smartphones, consoles or desktop operating systems.
