Sit yourself at the desk of your character (any character) and let them write from the heart, through you. Have them chronicle the events of your plot and how it has affected their lives in both significant and small ways. This is your character\u2019s opportunity to work through their own feelings and their feelings towards their castmates. While you\u2019re writing these entries, work on the individual voice and tone of your character. You might uncover some details and feelings which fit naturally into your main narrative, which you can use to add bonus detail and depth to your main narrative."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now, I\u2019m not suggesting you randomly start inserting diary entries into your book (unless they are supposed to be there!); this exercise is intended to be a little something extra, just between you and your character.

Most writers either love or hate dialogue \u2014 and by that I mean, most writers are either really good at dialogue or struggle with it quite a bit. Fortunately, this trick works just as well for writers in both camps."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Strip a scene back to only dialogue and nothing more, like a transcript. To help you keep track of who is speaking, you can add a name before each line of dialogue. To begin, write nothing else and focus only on what lies between the quotation marks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This might be all you need to inspire your creative juices to start flowing more freely. If not, start to build up more layers. Go back and add some physical actions to the dialogue, insert notes about changes in the environment, plot points or the comings and goings of other characters. Gradually flesh out the scene until you have all the essential pieces in place."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now move on and write the next scene. Come back and redraft during the edit or when you\u2019re feeling inspired to tackle it again \u2014 don\u2019t let it hold you back any further."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The answer to writer\u2019s block is very rarely not to write but, in fact, to write more. Unless you\u2019re working to a professional deadline, forcing yourself to work on something is not a universal solution \u2014 although it does work for some people. Have you ever heard the saying \u2018A change is as good as a rest?\u2019 If you\u2019ve come to a writing roadblock and simply persevering doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s working for you, try changing tactics."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Switching to a different project or taking a break to work on a short writing exercise is a great way to sidestep a block without letting your good writing habits slip. Sometimes a good warm up exercise is all you need! Often, while you\u2019re focusing on something else, your brain has a chance to bubble away in the background and work through whatever is holding your back. Today\u2019s tips allow you to stay focused on your project whilst giving you a break from any problems in your main narrative."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There is no one-solution-fits-all answer to feeling blocked or uninspired, so my advice to you is to try different approaches until you find one that works for you."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Originally published at https://plotfactory.com on March 16, 2020."}]}
