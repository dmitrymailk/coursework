Everyone in there \u2014 minus that one student \u2014 were wondering the same thing. How the hell do you make compelling non-fiction?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now, it\u2019s not to say we were all so far removed from the writing world that we didn\u2019t understand there are plenty of great non-fiction pieces. We were just under the impression that to write one of those there were certain criteria that had to be met. You\u2019re either an expert or professional in the field related to the book or you are the primary source of the material and you were helped by an expert. Regardless, our skepticism soon washed away. As I learned one of the most important lessons for writing ever."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be known as a non-fiction writer. If it does happen, we can reference this in the irony and ribbing that follows. But the activities we did and theory we discussed will be in all of my writing."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The teacher \u2014 whose name I again can\u2019t remember \u2014 would have us do a couple activities. These activities are still with me today."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1820/1*OgcmRCZeYfbzS0OOtBvDRw.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s funny, because when we first did this exercise, we all looked at him like he was nuts. I mean, you have to have some idea of a story before you begin writing. That\u2019s at least what we all thought. As we did this exercise each week, I began to see a pattern where my writing flowed more naturally. It started in an action and came off like a story. I was very surprised and happy. It was the first time I felt like a writer."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And now I know that, that is the feeling I want forever. I write these article pieces and feel alive. I\u2019m having fun and I don\u2019t care how they are received or even if they are received. That is the most freeing thing to me."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Writing for the sake of writing."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I hope I can give just an ounce of this feeling to another writer one day. It\u2019s invigorating.

Everyone understood it easier and went to town. I wrote something using this and it was terrible, but to be fair all my writing is terrible."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What I found is that I didn\u2019t feel as natural doing this one and I wasn\u2019t alone. While the teacher said this is a perfectly good way to also find a starting point, I still felt something missing from this."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Later, I would discover that I gravitated to the first exercise because of the freedom it gave me in my writing. I have a wandering mind and imagination. The worlds I create typically never stop getting created. It\u2019s just all about preference."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now, to bring this all together. These two exercises are not the only ones. They are just the two that opened my eyes. If you have others then share them. it\u2019s the feeling that I want to get across. That\u2019s the beauty of all of this. There is no one way. I write now more than I ever have in the past. I just started one night after work and finally couldn\u2019t stop. And I love it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Stories are in everyone."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There in every moment and event you move through. There in every smell and sight. They come from the rain hitting a little harder and the beer going down a bit smoother."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When you feel as if all the ideas have been taken or you will never produce anything on the scale of the greats or even a peer, try something for me. Do one of these exercises and see what you create."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Because, the best part of writing is that there will always be more waiting to get out."}]}
