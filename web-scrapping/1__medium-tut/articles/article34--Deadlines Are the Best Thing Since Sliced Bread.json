But at the same time, unless something immediately pressing was happening in the world, deadlines felt sort of arbitrary."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cThey\u2019re just trying to be in control\u201d, is what my non-conformist, all-knowing, early 20-something self would think about anyone who put my work on a deadline. This was true for any sort of job or assignment I crossed paths with. Even when I was waiting tables, being told I had 10 minutes to deliver someone their lunch made me tingle with frustration. How dare they interrupt my day with their urgency?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Fast-forward to me launching my own copywriting business, and my opinion of deadlines changed quickly and dramatically. Here\u2019s what shifted my mindset."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Deadlines let you know if a client is worth your time."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the beginning, when clients would book a call with me, I would always get excited. \u201cThey want to work with me!\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Then I learned the real question is \u201cdo I want to work with them?\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One sure-fire indicator that I don\u2019t want to touch a project with a 10-foot pole is \u201coh, you know, we have the idea but there\u2019s no pressure to hurry.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Their deadline apathy tells me a few things."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Zero thought about a project timeline is my queue to tell them they may not be ready to work with me yet.

Do this for each of your services. It doesn\u2019t have to be fancy. It could be a simple Google doc or pdf that explains how and when you get started, how and when you provide edits, and how and exactly when the final work will be delivered. What matters is that the client knows when they\u2019re going to get what they paid for."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Even better than delivering work on time is delivering work early. When you\u2019re your own boss, there\u2019s no real reason that you shouldn\u2019t give yourself a nice, long project timeline to make this possible. Double or triple how long you think the project will take you so you have plenty of time to make yourself look great with an early delivery."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Here\u2019s how to change a deadline without being a jerk."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ll save the Honor Your Deadlines speech, because I have, in fact, pushed back deadlines. I hope someday I never have to, but for now, if I change a deadline, I follow these 2 rules:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In my experience, moving a deadline has been due to new information or current events. If a new study came out that will strengthen an article significantly, or a global pandemic makes their email campaign feel insensitive, I wouldn\u2019t feel right delivering the work as-is. Never has a client been unsatisfied with hearing \u201cI\u2019m looking out for you.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I haven\u2019t had any personal emergencies get in the way of making deadlines, but if I did, I would make sure they were aware of the situation without burdening them with too many details. Clients don\u2019t need to know the nuances of sick dogs or car accidents. They just need to know what it means when it comes to them receiving the work they paid for without. Leaving out the sob story shows you respect their time."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The magic of this approach is that when you respect their time, they\u2019re more likely to respect yours."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "A writer on a deadline is a beautiful thing."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As a writer or creative, deadlines come with the territory. Will there be days where you\u2019re guzzling coffee and taking your meals hunched over your keyboard? Absolutely. But that\u2019s a whole lot better than getting caught in a cycle of attracting low-paying clients who expect you to put your life on hold at their every whim. That\u2019s a surefire way to prevent yourself from reaching your goals for many years to come."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The moral of the story? Your time is money. Use deadlines to help you budget accordingly."}]}
