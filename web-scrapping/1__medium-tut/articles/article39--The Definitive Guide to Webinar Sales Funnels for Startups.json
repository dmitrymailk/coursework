Relentless in their pursuit to provide value for their customers."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, qualifying leads, responding to emails and meeting ad-hoc requests is incredibly time-consuming. This is even more true if you consider the duration of traditional B2B sales cycles, especially if you are an unknown startup."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A small ticket item can take around three months to close, with higher contract values taking about six to nine months. If you\u2019re one of many startups who have a limited run rate and need to close customers to raise your next round successfully, you should be seriously considering how you can accelerate your sales funnel.

In exchange for the value you\u2019re offering to your prospects, you can plug your startup as the solution."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "First, create your event on either EventBrite or Universe.

Why is your webinar important? Why are you an authority in this space? Communicate social proof through testimonials, speaker biographies, links to press releases \u2014 whatever floats your boat."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You\u2019re also going to need to create event posters.

It was ours as well. We organized for a private mock webinar."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Send out calendar invites and run the event as if it was the real deal.
