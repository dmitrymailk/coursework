Competitive research is essentially research into how much of your opportunity has already been seized by others, not a topic most entrepreneurs are passionate about immersing themselves in. Your diligence about competitive research tells me that you\u2019re a professional about the less gratifying tasks in an entrepreneur\u2019s portfolio. I can also expect other facets of your strategy will be similarly backed up by substance and attention to detail."

If you\u2019ve properly identified and acknowledged the competitive pressures facing your startup AND you\u2019re still excited about your prospects, that tells me you\u2019re more likely to be in it for the long haul.

I\u2019m probably not an expert in your particular niche and its ecosystem at this moment. I bet most investors aren\u2019t either.
