Or should you simply apply to all of them and see which ones extend an interview? Maybe you somehow know you want to go into, let\u2019s say, product. But is this the right role for you?"

Most of my classmates flocked to finance and consulting jobs, which never really appealed to me. The e-commerce venture I had started in college renewed my entrepreneurial spirit, and I was determined to get a job in tech. Since many of my peers didn\u2019t share the same sentiment, there were few people I could go to for advice."

I joined two companies pre-IPO (Dropbox and Lyft) and witnessed both companies change after the public offering. I\u2019ve taken on a new role almost every year, which is not very common within tech, and it taught me a lot about the functions of each role, as well as its merits and limitations."
