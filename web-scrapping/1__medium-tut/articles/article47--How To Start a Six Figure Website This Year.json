When I wasn\u2019t taking care of my daughter, who was a baby at the time, I spent my mornings and evenings studying SEO and content marketing, and I accidentally started an online business. It took a while for that site to translate into earnings, but it eventually paid off."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I didn\u2019t predict a recession in 2020, but I was more prepared for it than previous ones. I built up a reserve of cash in my business that will hopefully see me through the next few months."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ve learnt the hard way not to depend too much on one source of income."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you haven\u2019t started an online business yet, now is an ideal time to start. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve studied or interviewed successful niche website owners like Canadian lawyer Jon Dykstra."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "During the early 2000s, he faced a unique challenge."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "His employer wanted him to attract more clients through blogging and content marketing. So Dykstra began writing about legal topics that interested clients, based on their search queries."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*siC6rDnxoE9IRWTVaSuVHw.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He says,"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Inspired by how content marketing helped grow the practice, Dykstra began building niche websites on the side."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When these niche sites began attracting website traffic and earning revenue, he found balancing a law career with an online one more challenging."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cEventually you\u2019re forced to choose. It\u2019s hard to do both. I seemed to like the blogging side and the writing online more and opted to go that route,\u201d Dykstra says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He quit the practice, where he was a partner, in 2012 to focus on growing niche websites full time. A niche site typically focuses on a single subject like sports cars and attracts traffic through high-quality articles optimised for search. A hyper-niche site dives down into a topic even further."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He told me,"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "1. Invest In Quality Content"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Dykstra grows his niche websites by publishing in-depth articles about specific topics, at scale. Dykstra relies on agencies to supply much of his content, something that forms a significant chunk of his monthly overhead. He also recently hired a content strategist."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI liken content to a widget. If you\u2019re in manufacturing, you produce widgets. If you\u2019re an online publisher, you produce content. And so yes, there are multiple workflows. I have a couple of in-house writers that I work with,\u201d he says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Today, Dykstra runs nine profitable niche sites, but he doesn\u2019t disclose their URLs. He also started several more niche and hyper-niche sites over the years. Some of these sites haven\u2019t taken off, while others represent long-term bets."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cSeveral of them are very small and don\u2019t do anything. I call them my rainy day sites. I publish maybe one, two, three articles a month on them,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t expect them to do well, but I like to have some aged sites with some good content sitting there in case down the road I get some time and some more resources.\u201d"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "2. Pick One Niche (For Now)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Considering the potential return of a niche site, it\u2019s tempting for an aspiring entrepreneur to start several sites at once and hope for the best. However, Dykstra offers this warning,"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Running more than one site also presents additional technical challenges and issues. For example, if a WordPress plugin breaks on a site, the owner will probably have to fix the same issue across all of their sites. Similarly, investing in high-quality content for multiple sites at once could become a huge expense with no immediate returns."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "3. Exercise Patience"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It takes many months if not years of hard work before an online publisher will see a proper return on a niche site project. Ranking highly in Google search results requires a significant amount of quality articles or backlinks. Domain age and authority are important factors too. Changes to the Google search algorithm also present business risks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cThese things don\u2019t happen in six months. The growth takes a long time unless you get very, very lucky, or you really know what you\u2019re doing. I can\u2019t make them happen in six months,\u201d says Dykstra. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to pull the plug early, but at the same time you don\u2019t want to just keep throwing money at something that has absolutely no future.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Dykstra is running a profitable business built around publishing. His success isn\u2019t unique though. The Wirecutter is the most high-profile example of a successful niche site. It focused almost entirely on Amazon product reviews and Amazon bought the site in 2016 for over $30 million."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For anyone interested in creating content, a niche site represents a profitable career opportunity.
