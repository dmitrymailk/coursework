Everyone was learning and nobody had truly mastered the art form. \u2018UX designer\u2019 wasn\u2019t even a job title back then. Design sophistication just wasn\u2019t as important.

Of course not. Designers still have deadlines to meet and clients to appease. What it does mean is using design time effectively to get the best design outcomes.
