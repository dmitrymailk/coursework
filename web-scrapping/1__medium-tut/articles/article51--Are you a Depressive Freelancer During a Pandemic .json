      "content": "Please allow me to tell you a little story. I lost five years to chronic depression then spent almost two rebuilding a life word by word, trusting I could write my way out of anything. Because desperation always needs a hint of hubris to function. Mainly, you hope curiosity will override shame and embarrassment."

So when I arrive in the Netherlands at the end of 2019, I\u2019m looking forward to the next chapter of a narrative never not tentative but still ongoing, against all odds."

I\u2019m carrying one big omelette in a basket and it\u2019s leaking all over my shoes. Still, coaxing my depressive brain into producing or editing copy doesn\u2019t give it time for existential angst. And editing other people means spending hours in their universe, an experience that always enriches my own."

Although I still think about dying several times a day, it no longer happens daily. This counts as massive progress. \u2018Not dead yet\u2019 has been my good enough for a long time. Anything on top of that is extra."

Many of us even freelance despite illness when it isn\u2019t exactly the most obvious choice. We\u2019re always worse off than employees, on either side of the Atlantic. No sick days, no paid leave, and precariousness as a frequent bonus."

There\u2019s so much freedom to be found in doing things we\u2019ve never done before, if only because it shakes up our malfunctioning brains. And it lets our inner child run free, going from no to wow. If your livelihood is disappearing fast, go commit random acts of creative faith and see what sticks. The internet is an ideal sandbox, especially at a time when there\u2019s an enormous captive audience."
