I run fleeing from job descriptions that require fifteen years of me running on a hamster wheel day in and day out. And I know recruiters have majored in missing the point when they look at my background and don\u2019t get why I deliberately chose each role, and how the sum of those roles contributed to the work I do today."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I would not be as confident and successful if I only knew how to put widget A into box B.

Categorize and define you in a way they can understand. But they\u2019re simple-minded, unable to think strategically and make the connections to tell the story of you."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Here\u2019s a fact: I haven\u2019t been doing brand marketing since the womb. I started out my career in investment banking and soon hated it because I craved a life where I didn\u2019t have to wear pantyhose and run financial models all day. In 1999, I mailed out my paper resume (yes, this was a thing \u2014 so was the abacus) to find another job and recruiters told me the only job I could get was one in finance."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So, I went on weekend interviews at Merrill Lynch, worked my alumni connections to break into Berkshire Hathaway, and I would cry in the lobby because the selling point of each bank was the convenience of having showers in the building."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SURELY, YOU JEST."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Frustrated, I decided to manufacture experience where I had none. I built an e-commerce site where I sold designer clothing and accessories that I\u2019d purchased from outlets and sample sales in New York. Back then, you didn\u2019t have The RealReal or Nordstrom Rack online, and there was a demand for designer clothing on the cheap for people who didn\u2019t have access."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I completed the LLC paperwork, did my own books, put in an application to be a payment processor so I can accept credit cards, designed and built a website, bought the clothes based on trends I\u2019d analyze in magazines, TV shows and what I\u2019d see on the streets, wrote sales copy, used my status as an eBay power seller to market my website, and managed all the shipping and customer service in an apartment over a barn out in Long Island. I even got my pop into the act and a man who broke and exercised thoroughbred horses soon became fluent in Prada and Dolce & Gabanna."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You should know except for the writing part, I\u2019m horrible at everything I\u2019ve just described. I\u2019ve no head for visuals. Up until last year, I couldn\u2019t balance my checking account. But I did it because I\u2019ve learned that if you want something and people keep denying you that something, there\u2019s nothing you won\u2019t do to get that something. If you\u2019re hungry enough. Tenacious enough. And realize that done is better than perfect."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My work caught the attention of the burgeoning Oxygen network and a woman came out to the horse farm in which my pop worked and we lived and interviewed the scrappy duo selling Badgley Mischka gowns online.

A new career was born. And I\u2019ve been making lateral and upward moves ever since. Because I viewed my career as a set of tools in a toolkit. If there was something I wanted to learn, I would take a job or build a side hustle in that something. I took a job in marketing and business development at Time Warner because I wanted traditional consumer marketing experience. I shifted to book publishing because I was intrigued by the intersection of commerce and art and how to understand customers to market books to them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I had side hustles where I published an online & print literary journal from 2002 to 2007 because I was intrigued by bringing content online and understanding the entire editorial, publishing, and marketing process surrounding words. I was an equity partner in a small social/digital agency in New York because I wanted to get my hands dirty and work with a slew of brands across industries and categories so I could be nimble enough to work in any company, fast. I worked at a global agency as a VP Strategy to understand bigger brands, bigger budgets, and more sophisticated ways of learning about customers and using data and insights to build brands and tell stories."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "All of these roles (either taken or designed by me) were in pursuit of following what made me curious.

Anyone familiar with CPG knows that this particular category has a lexicon and a type of marketing specific to the category. I won\u2019t torture you with the details, but my client wanted to make a leap to help businesses be better citizens. But she didn\u2019t know what a consulting practice could look like because it wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d ever done before."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Create & Define The Future State"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So, I asked her to do three things:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Then, I asked her to review all the exercises and write the story about a day or week or future project she\u2019d be working on in two year\u2019s time. Whether it was designing a business model that centered on impact, or designing marketing strategies and campaigns that connected cause and product, or created a mission-driven culture internally in an organization \u2014 the thread line was she didn\u2019t want to work with companies that were garbage humans, putting profit over people."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Do this for yourself.

Back in 2013, one of my closest friends was a traditional brand strategist and marketer \u2014 MBA from Stern, a dozen years of experience doing what I wanted to do. But she lacked digital and social acumen and expertise, and she knew she needed that to stay competitive."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So, we decided on an informal cross-mentorship. We would shadow each other\u2019s projects (for free because we were learning but also providing assistance \u2014 think of it as bartering that\u2019s mutually beneficial) to learn terminology, process, format, and methodology. We\u2019d work together to build a brand platform and a digital marketing strategy. We did this for about a year on our respective projects. It wasn\u2019t a huge leap for me to learn my gaps because I already had a career in marketing."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Consider it a fast-tracked MBA, but in real life without the fuckton of student loans."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Maybe there\u2019s someone in your network where you can partner up for a time to shadow one another on real projects."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Or you can take online courses, do pro-bono work (and being transparent with your client that you\u2019re learning as you go), offer to intern or shadow someone you admire (or a peer) to help them on a project while gaining real expertise and mentorship."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There are so many ways you can fill the gaps and gain experience for your dream job as long as you show up and do the work."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Don\u2019t think you have to be deadbolted to your current job because it\u2019s familiar, safe.
