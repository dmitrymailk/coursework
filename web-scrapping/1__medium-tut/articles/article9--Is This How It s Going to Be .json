He was trying to follow all the instructions barked out to him by Mandy, the firefighter who had to leave in a hurry. And I was doing my best to help him. Help he desperately needed again, on his second day with us."

      "content": "It was midafternoon. Riva and I followed Steve over to the home of Wombles, Rhonda, and Dottie. Those three know not to mess with the chickens so he let them and Sissie out. If he was a smarter human he would have kept them close. Maybe he thought they were like me."

That\u2019s not true for the others. Steve was about to learn that. He should pay more attention to me. I tried to warn him."

      "type": "sentence",
      "content": "The silly human got distracted again. To his credit though, Steve heard me tell him the others had run off to the neighbors. He called them back and they responded. For a moment. But Steve was busy with something and took his eyes off them. Big mistake."

    },
    {
      "type": "sentence",
      "content": "Diane was right, and I could tell Steve knew it. If he had a tail, it would be tucked. I think what made it worse for him was that she was quite civil. I was impressed. She was cool, intelligent and straightforward. A real lady. Like me."

      "type": "sentence",
      "content": "To his credit, Steve accepted responsibility, apologized and promised to never allow the dogs out like that again. Diane left and I went in to get some water. Steve came in with me. That\u2019s when we saw it; the mud tracked into the kitchen, on the walls, down the hallway into a bedroom, and then into the living room. I was so mad!"

After grabbing the supplies, he plopped down to his knees and kept mumbling something about someone named \u201cCinderella\u201d. I hope he starts paying closer attention because Sissy needs his help."

But she didn\u2019t get low enough and that fence ripped a two-inch gash into her side. I think she knew she would be in trouble because she didn\u2019t tell Steve about it."

      "content": "The morning after Diane came to visit, I heard Steve hacking. It sounded like he had a furball stuck in his throat. Riva and I had to laugh at him for this. Serves him right, letting that cat into his room and not us. We would have kept her from climbing all over his face."

    {
      "type": "sentence",
      "content": "We helped Steve with the morning chores. He found the gash on Sissie\u2019s side when he went in to feed them. He liked to stop and pet everyone and say nice things to them. Sissie enjoyed the attention and turned her side to show him what had happened to her. Poor Steve. I could feel his concern. He circled around a couple of times like Riva does when she\u2019s looking for a softer spot on her bed. With his head hung low, he went back to the house to get some medicine."

He said he wasn\u2019t about to contact our mom, Maya, to tell her he\u2019s responsible for her friend being ripped open. At least not until he had some answers. Steve told me that his friend\u2018s uncle is a veterinarian. He would know what to do. He tapped on the phone again."

    },
    {
      "type": "sentence",
      "content": "I moved over on the couch so Steve could sit. It helps me to sit so I can think. He kept whimpering about how he had never even spoken to Maya. He let his imagination of the pending disastrous conversation make him edgy. I think he was looking for a way to escape the country."
