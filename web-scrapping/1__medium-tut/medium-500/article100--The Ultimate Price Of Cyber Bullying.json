She got into a fight with a male housemate who washed his clothes together with her wrestling attire, to which she overreacted and tipped his hat off his head, seemingly angry."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As a response, she received a huge shitstorm on social media. People started telling her \u201cnobody needs you\u201d and \u201cyou should kill yourself\u201d.
