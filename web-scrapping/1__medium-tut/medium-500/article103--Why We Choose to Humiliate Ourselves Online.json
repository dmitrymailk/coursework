Every day, you dare yourself to reveal more than is comfortable, mining your past and your current reality for shame, humiliation, and pain. The more you do, the more trapped you get yet you have to cater to the audience you built, the kind that consumes the misery of others to feel better about their own station in life."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Most people have no idea who they are unless they can compare themselves to someone else so you\u2019re that someone every imaginable kind of misfortune happens to.

This is the business model you chose because there was no barrier to entry: Everyone has feelings, everyone can type."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You too."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Success feels icky to you, unreal, a fluke, something you never dared imagine you\u2019d find although you\u2019ve never not dreamed of it either."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Parlaying sordid into splendid, shame into fame, and humiliation into traction may have improved your financial and material health but your mental health hasn\u2019t enjoyed the ride at all. You\u2019re now stuck in a cage of your own making, one you handcrafted bar by bar, word by word."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You built it from the inside, it has no door, and the bars are so close together they almost look like a wall. The minute you grokked people love to spectate the lives of others, you went all in on feelings and aimed for the human heart. If it\u2019s good enough for lobbyists and marketers, it\u2019s good enough for you: Algorithms will promote anything as long as it keeps users on a site."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In a staunchly anti-intellectual culture, the lowest common denominator is always a safe bet: It has mass appeal. You can\u2019t beat victimhood culture for clicks and bucks either: People love to feel sorry for themselves and blame someone else because it\u2019s a lot easier than taking responsibility for your own life."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of profit are your honest birthright."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Unfortunately, we don\u2019t live in the world we used a few months ago and misery of the magnitude of yours is commonplace now, even vanilla in comparison to pandemic-related horror.

You had no sense of purpose beyond getting paid so you became the mechanical turk of gut-wrenching content and that was that."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But trauma is nobody\u2019s best friend, diagnoses don\u2019t define anyone, we aren\u2019t any less human because we have issues; the human condition isn\u2019t a pathology nor should it be pathologized. Every single time we embrace victimhood, we self-sabotage. Positing you\u2019re a victim \u2014 even of your own malfunctioning mind \u2014 robs you of agency."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Wobbly mental health isn\u2019t an excuse any more than it needs to be a limitation: It is a parameter, part of your context, but it\u2019s not who you are.

The attention laying yourself bare on the page generated failed to translate into any of the validation, admiration, or credibility you sought. Much as you will yourself to detach from the persona you created, you\u2019ve come to espouse its forms so perfectly you\u2019re one now."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is how everything you\u2019ve worked so hard to build collapses and crushes you while others continue to grow and thrive despite all the odds stacked against them, including lack of means. And if it makes no sense, it\u2019s because some of us, especially the most cash-strapped, have been socialized to equate self-worth with dollars and assets at the detriment of our own humanity. When every interaction is a transaction, connection is never genuine but designed to achieve monetization."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We do what we have to survive but our culture encourages, elevates, and empowers the worst of human traits, we as a society, we as an internet have gone too far and shot ourselves in both feet."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When life is a performance, no one knows how to be real anymore, and constant connectedness makes it much, much worse. No one knows who or what or how to trust either. Now that the social life of many has gone mostly if not fully digital, welcome to alienation: Without the ability to forge deep bonds with others, how do we even survive, much less live or thrive?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Our inner monologue informs the language we use to convey a snapshot of our reality in print: Self-respect shows others we value vulnerability while not recoiling from any aspect of it, and much less attempting to sensationalize it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When words honor and celebrate our shared humanness, nothing is taboo, nothing is stigmatizing, nothing is even awkward anymore.
