We have lost the nuance in social behavior that should tell us that a friend of twenty years DMing you asking why you\u2019re not talking to them anymore is different from an abusive ex telling you it\u2019s all your fault; is different from a stranger asking for feet pics. Boundaries have become the most important thing: more important than bonds, responsibility for others, duty to one\u2019s community. Maybe it\u2019s because the discourse on acceptable behavior is driven by people in their teens and early twenties, for whom the most empowering thing they can do in a relationship is, often, to escape it.

Notifications are unavoidable. Any sort of contact can feel like a violation of our space, an excessive demand on our time.

I\u2019m not a stockbroker, I work at a Jamba Juice!\u201d We may even avoid responding because, though we want to say something to someone, we don\u2019t want them to reply right now and draw us into a whole conversation. We\u2019re left with few options for contacting another person that aren\u2019t tainted somehow with the feeling that communication inflicts harm. All of this is worsened by the association private messages have with harassment. The closeness of the phone to the body lends physicality to verbal harassment that bystanders dismiss as mere words, but such harassment often also leads to doxxing, stalking, threats, and even physical violence.

The truth is perhaps more sinister: a complex ranking algorithm decides whether or not your posts are good enough to share, and with who. Posts that contain positive, happy content seem to be ranked higher. Friends interacting with your status raises its rank. Basically, you have to compete with your friends for popularity while ads sneak into the gaps. That\u2019s are why your feed is full of dog videos instead of your friends\u2019 posts. It\u2019s why an old friend you haven\u2019t heard from in years will suddenly get through to say he\u2019s recovered from cancer when you never even knew he had cancer.

It was kind of an odd choice: the forum was mostly for making fun of weird people on the internet, and it was pretty gross and bigoted \u2014 and the members all pretty much grew up and got over that stuff, realizing we were weird people on the internet all along.

For the most part, we don\u2019t know each other in real life. We have long, threaded discussions in which there are few ways to participate passively: you\u2019re not really there unless you post. Over the years, many of us have learned each other\u2019s real names, contributed to fundraisers for one another, and traveled to other cities to meet up. We\u2019ve created a few chat servers over the years, and lately, I\u2019ve spent more time on the Discord than on the main forum. Some of us have stalked and threatened and harassed each other, as well, and some of the people we mistreated in the past have come back for revenge. We\u2019ve dealt with it without having to dismantle the community, though some irreparable harm has been done and some well-liked members will never return.

But the level of candor they had before this was what drew other people close. People shouldn\u2019t have to keep everything in their lives a secret. But the problem with talking about our personal lives online, besides saying potentially incriminating or embarrassing things about ourselves, is that our lives intersect intimately with the lives of others. It is impossible to talk about your own inner life without mentioning other people, and to them, that\u2019s gossip, subtweeting, callout posts.

Tumblr\u2019s approach to anonymity was interesting: while most web sites discouraged users from using multiple accounts, Tumblr allowed several blogs under different names to be registered under one master account. Something that social media that relies on real names and photos fails to account for is that in addition to having different aspects of their lives that they need to be able to compartmentalize to different peer groups, people sometimes also use different names and appearances that they present to those groups. A universal social network where everyone sees the same thing \u2014 your boss, your grandmother, your fellow luchadores, your orgy buddies, and so on \u2014 puts people in a position where they have to present themselves in a way that is acceptable to all those people.

The philosophy I had in mind was not to allow passive interaction: you couldn\u2019t \u201clike\u201d anything, you had to actually leave a text-based comment any time you wanted to do anything on the site. Ultimately, only a handful of my friends tested it out, and they eventually lost interest. There were never enough users to get a feel for how the site would have worked at full-scale. This is one of the big problems with creating a successful social media site: whether it\u2019s any good or not, the site won\u2019t work unless massive numbers of people are using it constantly. Many alternative platforms have been created. There are an overwhelming number of options if you know where to look.

When the \u201cheart\u201d react was introduced, the \u201clike\u201d became a sort of indifferent nod: yeah, I saw it, whatever man.

When people were still comfortable having their photos shared online, I photographed nearly every party I went to, and was able to expand my friend network when people tagged one another on Facebook. Those people talked to me; invited me to events. Events became more difficult to invite people to as Facebook transitioned from being a service that helped people connect to friends to a service that sold ad space to businesses: mass invites could be used for free advertising, so we couldn\u2019t have them anymore. With the rise of social media influencers and corporations cranking out faux-homemade videos, the line between personal posts and advertising is increasingly blurred. I know that any sort of creative work I post falls somewhere between sharing my life with friends and promoting myself as a business. I worry at times that my friends may feel exploited when I show them my art or writing, the way they would if I were hawking Herbalife in every post.

Some have compared the idea of a limited number of friends you can visit during quarantine to Myspace\u2019s \u201cTop 8.\u201d Such decisions, though necessary, will surely create lasting hierarchies; feelings of abandonment, jealousy, and resentment among friend groups."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Constraints in the form of interaction affect what we say."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We tend to think of technology as expanding our abilities: social media apps give us the ability to do things that we were not able to do before.

Like SMS, tweets are a valuable communication tool with drawbacks created by their format: short and lacking in tone and gesture, they seem terse and passive-aggressive, and especially on a global scale, jokes are hard to distinguish from sincere beliefs. Long stories are broken up into threads. While it\u2019s possible to read an entire thread as intended, it\u2019s also very easy to take any individual tweet out of context, relying on the fact that most people simply won\u2019t bother to read the original thread to spread misinformation. Good ideas can spread very quickly, but can also quickly be stripped of nuance and misused. Arguments can continue long after the original poster apologized simply because the apology is a separate, unseen tweet. Bot accounts can be used to manipulate public opinion,\u00a0and\u00a0real\u00a0people\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0mistaken for\u00a0bots.

Users can only post pictures or videos, and only from a mobile device. You can\u2019t link to web sites outside of Instagram in your posts unless you\u2019re a business with a high follower count.

Instead of friending individual people, you would join communities based on regions, subcultures, and friend groups of various sizes. Structured subforums and advanced search functions would replace the confusing infinite-scrolling feeds.

It\u2019s hard to say: fixing social problems with apps seems ill-advised. The difference between a utopia and a dystopia, after all, is not the technology, but the division of power in society and the social and economic policies that govern the way people live with that technology. But if our behavior has changed in the past twenty years in response to the changes in technology, surely we can create new technology intentionally designed to assist us in maintaining friendships and completing social tasks. We can intentionally design software that encourages people to interact with one another more actively, more compassionately. The app we need (because let\u2019s face it, we\u2019re not all going to pitch our cell phones into the sea) may already exist, we just don\u2019t know it yet.
