The VICE headline read, \u201cSenate Votes to Allow FBI to Look At Your Web Browsing History Without A Warrant.\u201d The article is referring to the Senate passing the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act, which reauthorizes several Patriot Act and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) surveillance authorities \u2014 while failing to pass an amendment offered by Senators Wyden (D-OR) and Daines (R-MT). The amendment would have required the FBI to get a warrant before snooping on Internet activity like web browsing and search history. The headline is provocative, but it is 100% true. And the article itself elaborates and explains the nuance. The fact checker is essentially claiming that the post is misinformation because the Senate didn\u2019t \u201cvote to allow\u201d \u2014 they just \u201cdidn\u2019t vote to not allow.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Even if that were true, it would be a pretty tenuous justification for effectively censoring information on a platform used by billions of people. But it\u2019s not true \u2014 the amendment was tacked on to the underlying bill, which reauthorizes FISA surveillance powers that are set to expire. So the Senators who voted to reauthorize Section 215, and voted against the amendment, absolutely did \u201cvote to allow\u201d warrantless government surveillance of Internet activity. The USA TODAY piece is significantly more \u201cfalse\u201d than the VICE piece."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It appears that the USA TODAY fact checker first discovered the VICE article via a viral post from the Facebook page \u201cBeing Libertarian.\u201d The fact checker took issue with some of the specific language that that page used when sharing the article.

They did not attempt to contact my organization Fight for the Future, or experts from the ACLU, Free Press, Demand Progress, or any of the dozens of other reputable civil society organizations who have issued public statements that closely mirror the article\u2019s framing. It also does not appear that they attempted to contact Senators Wyden or Daines, VICE, or the journalist who wrote the piece. In the end, they claim that the article is \u201cpartly false\u201d based on a fairly generous read of how the FISA court works and their best guess at how a reader might interpret the headline and article. Without due process or a meaningful way to appeal the decision, this \u201cfact checker\u201d became judge, jury, and executioner, killing the spread of an organically viral post about government surveillance at a time when activists are working around the clock to inform the public about an upcoming vote that impacts their most basic rights."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The outcry over the Senate vote had an impact, and the House is now expected to vote on a similar amendment in a matter of days.

I\u2019m sure the fact checker at USA TODAY did their best to research this complex topic and come to a determination they felt was fair. I doubt they\u2019re secretly working for the surveillance state. Reporters will always bring their implicit biases to the ways they frame stories, which details they include and which ones they omit. In this case, clearly the VICE story was more sympathetic to civil liberties advocates working to limit government surveillance. The USA TODAY piece is more sympathetic to the government and intelligence agencies. Neither of them are \u201cfalse,\u201d and neither of them should be effectively censored by Facebook or buried by its non-transparent algorithm in the name of stopping disinformation.

But it\u2019s not a problem that can be fixed with more censorship or by demanding that Big Tech companies become the arbiters of what is and isn\u2019t true. Around the world, we\u2019ve seen governments scrambling to stem the flow of \u201cmisinformation,\u201d often by enacting policies that do more harm than good. Ethiopia\u2019s \u201cHate Speech and Disinformation Prevention and Suppression Proclamation\u201d has been decried by activists there as being abused to stifle free expression and freedom of the press.

Empowering for-profit companies to become the referees of speech and determine what we are and are not allowed to debate solidifies the status quo, and largely benefits the powerful while silencing the oppressed. And in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, this situation could easily get worse very quickly. Facebook has already admitted that it\u2019s relying more on the use of artificial intelligence, and prioritizing the \u201cremoval of harmful content\u201d over all else. Implied is that they are prioritizing removing \u201charmful\u201d content over ensuring that their moderation systems don\u2019t also remove legitimate content in the process.

Instead of calling for more aggressive moderation, we should address the problem at its root: Big Tech companies\u2019 underlying business model of data harvesting, micro-targeting, and artificial algorithmic amplification maximized for engagement above all else.
