When you get started, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s the best way to get your first followers and how to get this initial fan base that will give you leverage in the long run. You\u2019ve read about engagement groups, mass-following bots, engaging with influencers, the $1.98 method by Gary Vaynerchuk, but you\u2019ve also learned that there are no shortcuts and that most of these methods don\u2019t work in the long run."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The truth is the growth methods all change depending on the number of followers you have."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You don\u2019t grow an account from 0 to 1,000 followers the same way that you do for an account to go from 100k to 500k followers."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Most of the resources you\u2019ll find online will work on accounts that already have a significant amount of followers. So if you\u2019re just getting started on Instagram, doings these methods are going either going to be very inefficient or have no effect at all."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Because you\u2019re also trying strategies that don\u2019t work, you\u2019re tempted to switch plans all the time, which is also not ideal if you want to grow consistently."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "There\u2019s No Shortcut to Getting Followers, and it Will Take Time."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This might go against a lot of content you may have been reading about Instagram growth, but building an audience takes time, and it takes more time than ever."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Instagram keeps making it harder and harder to get a lot of organic reach, making it hard to grow quickly on the platform.

The follow-unfollow method was trendy a few years ago to grow quickly on the platform. The technique consists of following lots of accounts every day hoping for these people to follow you back; then unfollow these people a few days later to keep a clean follower to follow ratio. Instagram is aware of this method and now gives penalties to accounts using it. Some even got their accounts deleted by the platform because of going against Instagram\u2019s rules. If you\u2019re seriously considering Instagram as a marketing channel, that\u2019s the last thing you want to happen."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Without a solid marketing strategy behind your growth, you won\u2019t be able to maintain constant and sustainable growth."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That\u2019s why going for a clear strategy is essential.

You make a pretty looking profile that promotes the value you can bring to your audience, and you engage with people within your niche to make sure they see this profile."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To make sure that this strategy works, and works well, you need to make sure you know the people in your niche well, which means that you need to know what content they like, who they follow, and how to talk to them. One of the few traps that people fall into is that they engage with other people that are in the same business as them. For example, a fitness coach engaging with other fitness coaches, or a photographer engaging with other photographers. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but if you\u2019re trying to sell your coaching programs through Instagram, it\u2019s unlikely another fitness coach is going to buy it (unless that\u2019s explicitly what you are going for.)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Knowing who your audience is is the key to all marketing strategy, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to bring you the most results with this strategy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now, it may seem like a non-scalable method, and that\u2019s partly true.

And that\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to keep doing it, every day, for a while, to see results.
