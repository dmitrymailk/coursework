Boy, was I wrong."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The person explained that I will help more from time to time (you read it correctly \u2014 explained, not asked) to which I responded that I don\u2019t work for free and if a translation is needed \u2014 it will cost. As you probably already understood \u2014 it didn\u2019t stop there, I\u2019ve got a wave of messages with sentences to translate and just blocked the person."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I had a good laugh at the conversation and decided to share it in a Facebook group dedicated to freelancers. I took a few screenshots, removed anything that could give away the identity of the sender, and posted it in the group. I went on to live my life and didn\u2019t think about it twice. Until the next morning."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I woke up, made myself a cup of coffee, and went to check what\u2019s up on my socials. I had tons of notifications on Facebook, which is significantly more than my usual 3. What happened? Well, my post was approved by moderators a few hours ago and it already had hundreds of reactions and comments. Okay \u2014 that\u2019s interesting, I thought to myself and went on to read what did people say. Rookie mistake."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "D*ck, selfish, low-level, and so on. I\u2019ve got called names. Online. In front of the entire world and by people I didn\u2019t even know. I\u2019m quite sensitive and I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting that. My heart started beating like crazy and I felt anxiety coming around the corner. I made a mistake and it\u2019s awful\u2026 I\u2019m terrible\u2026 Stop. I put my phone away, took a few deep breaths, reassured myself that I\u2019m not a genital and went on to evaluate the situation and learn what I can."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "People will hate"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ve always been afraid of negative comments \u2014 both to give and receive. Just by going to therapy and working with myself, I learned to not take it personally and be able to constructively express my emotion without being afraid of hurting somebody's feelings or looking weak. I\u2019m learning to love myself and it\u2019s a skill I\u2019m nurturing daily, which, honestly, is way harder than I ever thought it could be. This post was the most serious test of my improvement yet."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "People called me names and splashed me with negativity. I hadn\u2019t experienced that since high-school and never thought I\u2019d have to deal with it again. It made me question my integrity and whether I was actually a self-absorbed idiot. I felt bad and wanted to delete the post, but didn\u2019t do it \u2014 I still stood behind what I wrote.

I knew the saying \u201cHaters gonna hate\u201d, but I never experienced it with my own skin. Kudos to celebrities, who deal with that daily, I couldn\u2019t do it.

Others experienced such clients and had bad experiences too!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Actually, the majority of reactions were positives and showing support, yet I had a hard time seeing them because my mind was focused on the bad ones.

I knew that people who work as freelancers experience this problem and that I\u2019m not alone. I had a gut feeling that my chat will be relatable and the fact that it was made it grow and have a supporter-base. Even those who disagreed with me could relate to it \u2014 they could hate it.

I didn\u2019t \u2014 I focused on delivering good content, making videos, writing articles, and doing what I can to help others and bring myself a better tomorrow. It can be extremely hard to stay focused on the main road and not distracted by all the fuzz that\u2019s going around, but at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t deliver value \u2014 nor to us, nor to the ones we care about. I took my lessons, understood my clientele better, and move forward better than I was. These are lessons that are insanely valuable and although my first viral post was driven by conflict \u2014 I got my first viral post and I could share my lessons with you!"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Outcome"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The outcome as of now is that I\u2019ve got new clients and followers.

Doing something will lead to having people who will dislike and judge your actions, but as long as I know, who I am and what my values are \u2014 life goes on and I feel blessed for those lessons."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s grab a coffee and up to the next challenges, cheers!"}], "topic": "social-media"}
