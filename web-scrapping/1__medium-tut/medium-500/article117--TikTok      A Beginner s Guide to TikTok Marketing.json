As mentioned above, content creation can be quite straightforward and quick on TikTok, thus, one video per day is a doable amount for anyone."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, the most efficient way to handle TikTok is by creating videos in batches. For example, you could set one or two content creation days per week and create all videos for the week during these days. Once your videos are ready, posting them doesn\u2019t take more than a few minutes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Producing your videos in batches will help you to build your presence on TikTok without too much stress and pressure and you\u2019ll instead enjoy the process."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "By posting regularly, you\u2019ll either build a gradual following or what might also happen is that one (or more) of your videos goes viral and reach the masses, which again will lead to a quick growth in followers."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "4.
