I produced a lot of great free content. So a lot of people messaged my page looking for more free stuff.

And the emphasis there is on right now. These might be paying customers later. So I directed those people to my free online course. It was a win-win. They got more free help and, as they signed up off Facebook with their email addresses, I built a substantial mailing list of prospects."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "With the developing leads sitting on my mailing list, the chatbot could show me in more detail who was a priority lead. I knew there were two key factors that made people more likely to buy: motivation for doing the exam and target grade (\u201ctarget bandscore\u201d in the lingo of this exam). So my chatbot asked:"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1322/1*X8Qb0yNaGhR0SxwjJIATew.png"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1448/1*Xq4wcMpzjgiNyd6sPL7zrw.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When I came to check my inbox, I looked for low target bandscores or \u201cSomething else\u201d responses. Low targets were easier to achieve without my help. The purpose of \u201cSomething else\u201d often turned out to be casual interest or a general idea to do the exam because \u201cit might be useful later.\u201d These leads were unlikely to result in sales. So they went to the bottom of the pile."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "On the other hand, high targets meant the lead was going to have a hard time getting their grade alone. Work and study were economically important objectives that made people more likely to spend.

A chatbot can never truly understand best interests. Nor can it make nuanced decisions about what kind of offer to make a lead.

It also got me more sales opportunities, which I could have capitalised on if my offer had a price that was more in line with the market. It didn\u2019t directly bring me more leads. But the chatbot revealed my most promising leads and helped me build content to attract more leads. If \u201ctwo out of three ain\u2019t bad,\u201d then this simple chatbot was really not bad at all."}], "topic": "social-media"}
