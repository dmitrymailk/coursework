Celebrities like Lebron James and The Weeknd participated in it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In this case, the controversial campaign they used was negative for the brand. They even had to withdraw the advertising for their brand and issue apologies."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Adidas and Arvida"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Adidas used the model Arvida to launch new sneakers of its brand in September 2017. Something eye-catching about this advertising is that the model didn\u2019t shave her legs for the photo. The publicity soon generated a lot of nonconformity comments. The company did not withdraw advertising because its intention was to show a new concept of femininity, which does not follow stereotypes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The number of likes in that photoshoot increased by 35,000 compared to her other photographs.

They have made all kinds of ads, from Pepsi using the figure of Santa Claus, a character who has become an icon of Coca-cola, to the White Bear. There was also the Halloween ad where both used the same photo, but with different slogans."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In this case, the advertising has been quite good for both brands.

We have to be careful with the messages that we are going to send when we create those types of campaigns because otherwise, it could be worse for the company."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Personally I do not recommend creating controversy to reach a high audience, although it is proven that it works.
