I ran a profile quality audit like I always do when kicking off an audit on Instagram.

Overall, our engagement levels are good when it comes to us engaging with our following."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now, to make a point clear, our engagement rate was 0.1%."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That is below poor. Why? Well, let me introduce you to ghost followers. From Wikipedia:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Yet, the number of ghost followers was staggering. 80% of our followers have not interacted with us.

We changed the content we post on our platform massively in the past two years. As I mentioned above, a lot of people who were on Instagram in 2014 are not there anymore. Plus, some fake followers are just hard to spot, sneaky things.

I would look for potential bots as well as people who have not posted since 2017 or beyond (yup, far too many of our ghost followers have been dormant since 2015)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A great perk of doing this is that I got to re-engage with active followers who may forget about us by liking some of their pictures, which also sparked up our engagement."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is the most time-consuming part of the process, but so worth it."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Maintain"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I asked my colleague, who runs the social side of the business daily, to be on top of checking all new followers every working day.
