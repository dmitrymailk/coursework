Out of the pipes came the first poison gas, Chlorine. The German military emptied 5730 cylinders (each weighed 200 lbs) of Chlorine in just 15 minutes. The enemy troops, unaware of what had happened, screamed and ran in agony. The entire front line got covered with a thick yellow blanket of Chlorine. Thousands died that day, and many more will die in years to come due to poison gas attacks. The brain behind Chlorine gas, which killed millions, is responsible also for the growth of the human population by two-fold. He was Fritz Haber"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Early Life:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Fritz Haber was born to a Jewish family. His father, Siegfried Haber, ran a chemical dyestuff company in the city of Breslau. Haber was a bright student at school and continued his education at the University of Berlin. After one year of military service, Haber took up his family business but ended in a loss. Haber looked for a job and moved to Zurich, where he worked in two universities. After a few years, he moved to the University of Karlsruhe, where he would spend 17 years of his career. In 1892 Haber converted from Judaism to Lutherism and in 1901 married Clara Immerwahr, a fellow chemist at the University of Karlsruhe. The couple\u2019s marriage was a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Clara was opposed to Haber\u2019s idea of using science against humanity in warfare."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Drive towards Science:"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/4000/0*8FukhERx49NsUeqe.JPG"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Science was at the top of the priority for countries around the world at this period. Pasteur Institute in Paris and Rockefeller\u2019s medical institute in the USA were few noted institutes that drove the field of research. Prussia (Germany\u2019s ancestor) pushed the idea to establish a similar institute for research. The idea took shape in 1910 with the formation of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in an area of 50 Hectare. The mission of Prussia\u2019s new venture was as \u201cWehrkraft und Wissenschaft\u201d, which means knowledge and military power.

Ammonia was used for manufacturing explosives and also as a fertilizer for plants. Ammonia was hard to synthesize as it needed 200 Celsius or 390 Fahrenheit in a 200 atm pressure. Even after such an arduous process, only a trickle of Ammonia came out. Haber, along with Carl Bosch, concluded that a catalyst is needed to make the process quick. Catalyst is a chemical component that can speed up a chemical reaction but will remain in its state even after the reaction was over. Haber, along with his team, tried out 4000 different catalysts. At last, he found that Iron, oxide of aluminum, calcium, and potassium are useful catalysts for making Ammonia. This process had remained the same until today."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Poison gas legacy:"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1240/1*otGTwpeEY4nSJR3AqKq_Kw.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "World War I was a clash between superpowers in the European continent. The war ended up as a stalemate in the trenches along the border. Haber and Carl Bosch set up a partnership between IG Farben and the University of Karlsruhe to manufacture Ammonia for usage as explosives. Haber extended his research and proposed the use of poison gas on enemy soldiers, which was against the Hague convention of 1899.

To celebrate the promotion, he held a party at his home. His wife, Clara, committed suicide at this party after hearing the gas incident. A more potent Phosgene gas saw action against Russian troops in Galicia. The Phosgene gas choked the victim, caused a sensation of burn in the lungs, and led to death. Otto Hahn, a future Nobel laureate, worked with Haber in this project.

Against protests from the scientist community, Haber won the Nobel prize for his Ammonia extraction process in 1918.

Haber\u2019s greatest legacy would be his discovery of Hydrocyanic acid used primarily as a pesticide but later was converted into the infamous Zyklon-B poison.
