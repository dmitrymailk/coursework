It appears all over the internet, used in TED talks and it's on the front of bestselling books. But in the nitty-gritty of the mundane life of a leader, what does it really mean? How do you inspire someone? What\u2019s the secret?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One secret I would like to explain is to be intentionally awkward with your words."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Don\u2019t pass up an opportunity to overload someone with praise. Adult or child \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. Just praise them. Make them feel embarrassed with the words you speak. Make them feel special. Honoured. Validated. Use words that empower people. Build them up. Don\u2019t limit yourself to words related to your company, business or environment, assume a vocabulary that cuts through someone\u2019s outer facade and speaks to their inner sense of self-worth and self-belief. It might make you feel uncomfortable, nervous or slightly sweaty, but outstanding leaders see beyond their own."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You might never know the effect your words will have."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "A Lesson from the Classroom"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the classroom, praise works 9 times out of 10. If there is a student who finds it difficult to engage or cooperate with the lesson, there\u2019s a strong chance it\u2019s because they have nothing to lose. Their education history of failures, \u2018naughty\u2019 behaviour and overwhelming negativity give them nothing to fight for. Their sense of self and self-worth tells them they can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not worth it. They live in a deteriorating self-fulfilling prophecy cycle. Whatever they try, defeat is the most likely outcome. They have nothing to lose."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you, as a teacher, find something of value in their existence, something worth praising, then hopefully they will too. It\u2019s a risk. It involves discipline in biting your tongue during the challenging moments, in order to create an uplifting, invigorating atmosphere."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Don\u2019t mistake this for a quick fix or easy win. It\u2019s not. This takes time. This takes a stable relationship. It takes an intentionally uncomfortable use of words. As the teacher, I know that the particular students\u2019 answer is not \u2018excellent\u2019 or \u2018superb\u2019 when compared with other students, but I use those words anyway. I don\u2019t use them because that\u2019s the standard for answering the question but because I want that student to feel superb on the inside. I want to raise their self-esteem to a level where they will engage with the work enough to truly excel."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Find their Why"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In one of Simon Sinek infamous youtube videos, he uses the phrase \u2018begin with your why\u2019 to describe the way businesses need to operate. The same is true of students and school engagement. When they have nothing to go on, nothing to lose, they won\u2019t engage. When their \u2018why\u2019 for a particular subject or education, in general, is empty, they don\u2019t bite. It\u2019s obvious. But give them a \u2018why\u2019 and eventually, they will. Teachers have the opportunity to transform a students\u2019 \u2018why\u2019 so that they do engage. The opportunity to help a student see themselves differently, to give them a new narrative to live by. A positive, self-affirming narrative. A story that begins with a simple act of intentional, directed praise."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It may only be the simplest of things, a verbal answer to a question, a well-explained opinion or simply turning up on time with the correct equipment, but it\u2019s a moment to praise. It\u2019s a moment to use words that cut through the students\u2019 facade to nestle in the depth of their being. The buried memory vault seldom opened because it\u2019s reserved only for moments of affirmation and validation. Seldom used because those moments in the life of a preconceived \u2018challenging\u2019 student are rare, if ever. As such, it\u2019s vital that say something. The art of being a successful teacher is to make use of any opportunity to validate the students."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Even if just for a moment."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "For Leaders Everywhere"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I don\u2019t believe this approach to other people is limited to the classroom, it should be a way of life for any business, any manager, any parent or anyone."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you're a leader in any situation and you want to see your team flourish, take the same approach. Take every opportunity you can to affirm your employees or team members. Praise them. It may be uncomfortable to use cheesy words with fellow adults (it\u2019s somehow easier with students) but it works."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When we think about it, we all want to hear those words. We all want someone to say they\u2019re proud of us; value our contribution, ideas or company.
