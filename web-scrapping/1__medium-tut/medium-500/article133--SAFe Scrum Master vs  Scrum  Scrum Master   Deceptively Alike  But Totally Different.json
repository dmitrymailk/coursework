They can also choose to adopt parts of Scrum and combine it with other practices. It is important to note, however, that according to the Scrum Guide, these teams do not use Scrum at all:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Still, the servant leader of a SAFe Agile team has the title \u201cScrum Master\u201d. If a SAFe Agile team uses Extreme Programming only, the servant leader and coach is still a Scrum Master."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "TLDR; Entirely Different Roles"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There is a difference between a SAFe Scrum Master and a Scrum Master according to the Scrum Guide (I will call it \u2018Scrum\u2019 Scrum Master from now on). Starting with the fact that Agile teams in a SAFe environment don\u2019t have to use Scrum at all, there are many more things that make it an entirely different role:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "With that, it is clear that the roles are entirely different. So much so that it is strange that they have the same name. You could even argue SAFe is not a scaling framework for Scrum. It re-interprets the Scrum Master role, therefore it isn\u2019t Scrum. It would be entirely logical to rename the Scrum Master role in a SAFe environment to something like SAFe Team master."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you are interested in a detailed comparison of the two roles, you can find them in the remainder of the article.

Still, there\u2019s fine-print to consider."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Servant leader and coach"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Both types of Scrum Masters are servant leaders and coaches for their team. The Scrum Master is continuously challenging the status quo to help improve the team."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Complementary practices"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Both types help the team understand Scrum and complementary practices like Kanban. The SAFe Scrum Master also focuses on teaching SAFe."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Impediments"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Both help remove impediments. SAFe Scrum Masters identify and eliminate them. Scrum doesn\u2019t specify that a Scrum Master identifies impediments. The reason is that everyone is responsible for identifying impediments to the team\u2019s progress. By emphasising that one person is responsible for identifying impediments, you run the risk of creating teams depending on others to find and fix their problems."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Self-organisation"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The Scrum Master\u2019s primary role is to help a team to self-organise to achieve its goals. These include team goals and Sprint/Iteration Goals. SAFe adds to that that teams are/can be self-managing. Typically, self-management means the team has more authority than self-organisation. Interestingly, SAFe brings this forward where Scrum doesn\u2019t."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The SAFe Scrum Master assumes that the responsibility for inter-team coordination cannot be delegated entirely to the Scrum Master; every team member shares this responsibility.

He/She helps them become better problem-solvers. The Scrum Guide however only discusses that Scrum Masters help teams to create high-value products. It is interesting to note that SAFe doesn\u2019t mention Value in the context of improvement.

Lastly, a SAFe Scrum Master helps individuals and teams through personnel changes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This all is way more descriptive than you will ever find in the Scrum Guide. A \u2018Scrum\u2019 Scrum Master can do these things to help create high-value products. But the Scrum Guide is deliberately vague about it."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Sourcing of the role"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SAFe has some very clear-cut ideas about how to source the SAFe Scrum Master. The role can be part-time or full-time. For Enterprise-scale, SAFe recommends a part-time Scrum Master. It supposedly will be a challenge to bring across the need for full-time Scrum Masters in an environment of 100 teams or more. The SAFe Scrum Master section even discusses that a company has to choose between developer capacity and Scrum Master capacity, hinting that developer capacity brings more merit. Therefore SAFe assumes that a Scrum Master role is part-time except at the start of the transformation. SAFe also recommends having external consultants as Scrum Masters, especially during initial SAFe adoption."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The Scrum Guide doesn\u2019t discuss all of this, leaving room for all kinds of choices.
