The Client Is Not Always Right"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And they can blame you if you blindly follow their lead."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is my number one rule, and it comes from a decade with marketing managers at some of the world\u2019s largest brands."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Especially in professional services businesses, it is not uncommon that clients don\u2019t actually know what they want. It doesn\u2019t matter where they got their fancy MBA or how many years they\u2019ve had on the job."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sometimes they genuinely don\u2019t know that there is a better, faster, cheaper way to achieve their objective. They will appreciate it if you show them. And, on other occasions, well, they\u2019re just flipping you a request from someone else without carefully thinking about what they really want or how to get it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There is, however, a difference between the client not being right, and you proving them wrong.

Honesty and Credibility Are Underrated"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The corollary to point number two is that truth in marketing is something that is respected and prized by customers. If you make grandiose claims and don\u2019t deliver, you\u2019ll lose a customer for life."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you are honest and genuine, you can ensure that customers will keep coming back, sometimes, even if they don\u2019t like the product they just bought."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Customers have grown skeptical from years of marketing gimmicks and BS exaggeration. Honesty is like a nice tall, cool glass of water on a hot day: Refreshing until the last drop."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "4. You Don\u2019t Always Get the Information You Need"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When you pull together a wish list of information before starting a project, don\u2019t expect that you\u2019re going to get everything you want.

Too many times. Even organizations that self-proclaim themselves to be \u201cchallenger brands\u201d or \u201cdisruptors\u201d often refuse to upset their marketing status quo. I\u2019ve got news for them: customers don\u2019t care about their naming conventions."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You might also like these stories. But no pressure, time is money.
