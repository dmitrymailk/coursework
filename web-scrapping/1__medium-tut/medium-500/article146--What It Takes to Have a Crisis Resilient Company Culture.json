While so many factors influence the success, failure, and survival of a company, culture is significant. It should be the reason for an organization\u2019s strength, not its vulnerability. It takes more than a list of individual characteristics. It requires a culture carefully cultivated and reflected in shared experiences, throughout the company, in its entire system. As written before, there\u2019s no such thing as cherry picking adjectives for something as all-encompassing as culture, like a \u201csafety\u201d culture, or a \u201cteam-oriented\u201d culture, or even a \u201ccrisis-resilient\u201d culture. A whole culture is so much more. It includes \u201call things that have the power to influence behaviors, interactions, and perception\u2026[that] determine the boundaries of what is acceptable and not acceptable,\u201d as defined in Culture Your Culture: Innovating Experiences @ Work. Look at the patterns of what is rewarded, punished, condoned, or accepted \u2014 these are what define a company\u2019s culture. The aim is to embody a set of interconnected key capabilities that makes a company crisis-resilient as a whole \u2014 one that rises to the occasion and recovers quickly. These are the conditions that must be in place:"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*RvR3HiZxrOJnfwuPWCnwUQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Connected. This is a less obvious, but necessary first choice. A company that is connected internally and to the outside world has access to knowledge, resources, and people, such as: information, talent, external stakeholders (especially customers), leaders as well as current, past and potential employees. It\u2019s not about having as many connections as possible so much as the right connections. To illustrate, neuroscientists have proven the common misconception that intelligence is determined by the size of a brain and the number of connected neurons. Smarter brains actually have \u201csparsely\u201d connected neurons that are ultra-efficient. The same is true for organizations. Mutually strong, continually reinforced, and positive relationships sustain connectedness. It is not only an essential characteristic of engagement, but also crisis-resilience."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1256/1*dC6fOoN0QEpIjZ_WfDhBPQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Strategic. Businesses that are well connected have the intelligence for broader perspective. They can see how change in one area might impact other areas or uncover game changers before others. Awareness triggers action. A recent headline reads, \u201cWhen It Comes to the Future of Work, We Only Know What We Don\u2019t Know.\u201d Agree or not with that conjecture, most people would rather know than be ignorant and caught unaware. Being strategic means having the knowledge and being able to bring together the different parts to work toward the whole. This is especially important in the middle of crises."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Trustworthy. Strong positive relationships that come with being connected are sustained by trust. This happens when people believe they will not be exploited, as defined in the Academy of Management. Trust builds reputations, followership, comradery, assumes best intentions, and willingness to overcome the benefit of the doubt. One can\u2019t be successful without it, for it affords the much-needed social capital to get anything and everything done."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1244/1*6mBBKySgZzyocbeOJoB_TQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Flexible. Being both strategic and trustworthy allows for flexibility. It\u2019s the opposite of rigidity. Those that are strategic have flexibility in perspective \u2014 they can switch their aperture between the details and the big picture. And because of trust, people, en masse, are willing to listen and consider what they may not do on their own. A flexible organization is always ready for change, especially one brought on by a crisis. It is what allows a successful startup to take off, an established company to remain relevant and competitive, and individuals to learn."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1236/1*y_-NAHdO2KuBwXjRnT53qg.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Creative. A culture that is described as creative has the ability to \u201cuse imagination to create something new in the world\u201d on a large scale. There are numerous conditions necessary in order to unleash creativity, but one of the biggest barriers at the organizational level is the lack of psychological safety, or a fear of reprisal. Though they are distinctly two different concepts, trust is necessary for psychological safety to exist. As described in Creative Confidence, it\u2019s about keeping \u201cthe creative momentum going instead of cutting off the flow of ideas. Throwing cold water on one person\u2019s contribution can bring the conversation to a halt\u2026\u201d Would a company need creativity overcome a crisis and/or recession? Yes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Learning Agile. Agility alone is not enough. Being learning agile means new knowledge can be quickly synthesized, incorporated, and demonstrated. Dr. W. Warner Burke of Columbia University delineates two equally important components of learning agility. The first is skill. In his words, it\u2019s \u201cwhat you do when you don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d That is the application of knowledge and learning. The other is motivation, the \u201cwillingness to take risk in novel situations.\u201d Of the nine dimensions in the Burke Learning Agility Inventory (BLAI), speed and flexibility are the most powerful. When there are so many moving and unknown parts during a crisis, a culture that practices learning agility makes a tangible difference. It builds the capability to be innovative and resilient."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1244/1*LILeXj34Xnh8Ly-YYwBvCg.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Innovative. The relationship between creativity and innovation are well known. \u201cWhere creativity is the ability to come up with ideas, innovation connects ideas to other people, where it is shaped, adopted, and realized,\u201d as written in Culture Your Culture: Innovating Experiences @ Work. In Creative Confidence, Tom and David Kelley put it more simply: \u201ccreativity manifests itself as innovation.\u201d Linda Naiman of Creativity at Work wrote, \u201cFor innovation to flourish, organizations must create an environment that fosters creativity; bringing together multi-talented groups of people who work in close collaboration together \u2014 exchanging knowledge, ideas and shaping the direction of the future. Organizations led by creative leaders have a higher success rate in innovation, employee engagement, change, and renewal.\u201d Most companies want to be innovative (hence the overuse of the word), but the few who truly are have a competitive advantage. They can actually innovate their way out of the biggest challenges."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Resilient. Just like resilient people, a resilient company is better positioned to bounce back in the face of adversity. Prof. Larry Mallak of Western Michigan University wrote: \u201cFor your organization to be resilient, it needs people who can respond quickly and effectively to change while enduring minimal stress.\u201d The standard has long been established as this was written over 20 years ago. There\u2019s no adversity like a crisis at the scale of a pandemic. Unsurprisingly, the topic of resilience has seen more writing and discussion lately. It\u2019s the answer to stress, which is known to be counterproductive in so many ways. Mallak continues, \u201cThe resilient organization designs and implements effective actions to advance the organization, thereby increasing the probability of its own survival.\u201d And that\u2019s what organizations need to do during a crisis: survive."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1276/1*1rlorAXUSO9aEv1CpjxcGA.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Action-oriented. All this depends on operationalizing the above as knowledge, mindsets, capabilities, and cultural norms across the organization. Execution is key. The term \u201cstrategic speed\u201d from the eponymous book is \u201cwhere urgency meets execution; it\u2019s about implementing plans and strategies not only quickly but well.\u201d That\u2019s what this kind of action is all about. As a behavioral competency, it\u2019s Korn Ferry/Lominger\u2019s Drive for Results, \u201ccommunicating a vision, setting priorities, developing and executing plans that achieve the desired outcome \u2014 for the organization and the world.\u201d Action becomes a part of the culture when it is implemented in alignment and coordination throughout the company."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1416/1*mdhw-Oklb-wlFgek6DbU6g.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Prepared. This is not to be assumed as a result. It is a constant state that must be maintained and sustained, where an organization is always ahead, anticipating and set up with systems and plans already in place. A prepared culture builds confidence and calm in a chaotic world. Better prepared organizations will have the least negative impact and a shorter road to recovery. Likewise, before, during, and after a crisis, a company\u2019s culture when it comes to preparedness will influence outcomes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Connected, strategic, trustworthy, flexible, creative, learning agile, innovative, resilient, action-oriented, and prepared \u2014 all these work together as an antidote for the kind of fear that kills company culture and businesses even under normal circumstances. These cultural capabilities not only make a company crisis-resilient, but also ready for the unavoidable Future of Work.
