They\u2019re often full of corporate-speak and half-truths. The CEO and Co-Founder of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, changed that with his letter to employees."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The global economy is having a sudden cardiac arrest and despite Brian\u2019s social media following and celebrity status amongst the startup community, he too has been forced to act. His beloved company will axe 1900 out of their 7500 employees."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There is no easy way for a CEO to do that. Many CEO\u2019s before Brian have had to do exactly the same and mostly done it in a heartless way with an in-genuine apology. I remember being let go from my job last year and crying for no reason at all. It hurts. I wouldn\u2019t wish that feeling on my worst enemy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But Brian gave us hope with his letter."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He took a different approach that we can all learn from, even if you\u2019re not the CEO.

Last year, when I got fired, I blamed myself. It. Hurt. So. Much."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I told myself: \u201cYou idiot! You did it again! How could you be so stupid?\u201d This internal punishment in my head went on for some time. Because I wasn\u2019t given a valid reason for being fired and there was no context or warning, the only answer I could come up with in my head was, \u201cI must be shit.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Brian prevented this situation from playing out for his employees by ensuring they knew it wasn\u2019t their fault, or performance, or skills that were being questioned. This might look like a small thing, but years later these redundant Airbnb employees will realize how much of a gift they have been given by Brian."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Always Reflect on the Company Mission"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Airbnb\u2019s mission is centered around belonging. To make people redundant hacks away at that mission with a chainsaw. Brian decided to state the obvious and tackle their mission statement head-on."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Every decision a company makes is supposed to be reflective of their mission statement. During a recession, the mission statement is often forgotten about and replaced with graphs of revenue going down and the number of employees needing to be fired going up."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s easy to forget those people who get fired are humans."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Reveal the Decision-Making Process"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Often job losses are communicated by CEOs without mentioning how the decision was made. This makes the staff who are staying and the people who are leaving confused."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When confusion arises over job losses, assumptions are made."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "These assumptions become a toxic culture that destroys a lot of what a company has built. That toxic culture looks like this: every man and woman for themselves. This is how you act when you don\u2019t understand properly why redundancies occur and how people were chosen to be let go."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Brian revealed his decision-making process because he understands transparency breeds confidence and loyalty in uncertain times.

He assumes the people that are being let go are talented, and he hopes that other companies (even his competitors) will hire them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Non-compete agreements can really delude leaders in a recession. The best talent, who get made redundant, can go to a competitor and the people left over can hate them for it and even use it against them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Brian decides to drop this scarcity mindset and welcome his competitors to grab the talent he must let go."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He hopes other companies will benefit from his company\u2019s loss.

I could have only dreamed of this support last year. This good deed will be remembered for decades to come and will make Airbnb an employer of choice in the long run."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Companies that truly care for their employees and show it through their actions have a huge, invisible, competitive advantage.
