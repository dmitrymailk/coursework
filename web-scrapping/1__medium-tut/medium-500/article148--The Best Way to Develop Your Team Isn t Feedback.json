I spent copious amounts of time learning how to give \u2018good feedback\u2019. I described specific situations, pointed to concrete behaviours, and explained their impacts from my perspective, all in a caring and professional way."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sometimes, my feedback led to behavioural improvements. But other times, it didn\u2019t. The results were patchy at best."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "What\u2019s Up with Feedback?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The term feedback has become so widely used that it\u2019s now virtually a synonym for communication. However, it\u2019s worth being specific about what feedback means:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Feedback refers to someone\u2019s reaction. Under this more precise definition, advice isn\u2019t feedback. Asking questions isn\u2019t feedback. And a conversation isn\u2019t strictly feedback either."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is an important distinction. The conventional wisdom suggests that managers should share their reactions about a teammate\u2019s behaviours and performance to help them improve."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But is this the best thing managers can do?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sadly, neuroscience suggests it isn\u2019t, particularly if the feedback is not positive."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When people receive feedback, they can instinctively interpret it as a threat, triggering a defensive response (also known as fight or flight). Scientists have discovered that once this response is active, learning is inhibited. In other words, constructive feedback may prevent people from learning."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Luckily, I stumbled on a way to improve learning that doesn\u2019t rely completely on feedback."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The Development Pipeline"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "David Peterson is the Director of Executive Coaching & Leadership at Google.

So, if you want to change behaviours, you have to \u2018unblock\u2019 the narrowest part of the pipeline."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Peterson realised that optimal learning is a constraint problem: unblock the constraint and increase the learning."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s look at an example. Imagine a teammate who\u2019s taking on too much work. They already understand that they need to delegate more to their team, but they\u2019re concerned that they don\u2019t have the time to delegate effectively."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In this scenario, the teammate has the insight, capability, and opportunity to delegate but they lack motivation and accountability.

However, it\u2019s not the only factor. It\u2019s important to also clarify someone\u2019s overarching goals and values, their beliefs about what they can and can\u2019t do, and the factors determining success in their role."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Here, Peterson has a deep insight:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is a powerful reframe: leaders who want to maximise their team\u2019s learning should replace \u2018giving feedback\u2019 with \u2018having conversations about development\u2019.

Do they have the necessary capabilities and a chance to put them into practice?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There may be multiple constraints. At this stage, you won\u2019t know for sure.

Insights are, sadly, fleeting so you need to clarify the next step as soon as they find clarity. The smaller and more concrete the step, the more likely it will be to happen.
