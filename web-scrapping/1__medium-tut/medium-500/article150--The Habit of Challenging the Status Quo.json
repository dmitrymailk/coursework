From working in the office to working remotely to hybrids.

Sundry processes and habits are going through adaptations, and the vast majority of people are doing fine, not reeling around."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Contrast this with the preciousness that seems to abound in the tech industry in the last few years. Jeremiads would accompany every change and adjustment. Advising executives, I\u2019ve learned that the status quo is something we fear prodding, even though that is where our biggest next leaps await."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We have now demonstrated that we are capable of ongoing such changes rapidly, and the best teams I\u2019m helping are using these changes to come out of the pandemic better than they came into it. Instead of sanctifying the status quo, you should hold your organization\u2019s neuroplasticity sacred and the growth that it enables."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As we are emerging out of our cocoons, we should not forget these lessons. You can change swiftly. You can alter the status quo. Now, rather than adjusting your status quo reactively, you should do so proactively.

Egos should be put aside and valuable inputs should be broadcast so that the safety to speak up is instilled in everyone."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Implementing wholeheartedly and rapidly: One of the reasons we shy away from change initiatives is that we have change fatigue. You have to treat these changes with the importance they deserve and require everyone to commit to them and execute.

Decision clarity is required so people know that something is going to change and the reasoning behind it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Visible improvement: To maintain your team\u2019s trust and cooperation they have to see that these changes are positive. Even if not every change is a slam dunk, make it a habit to review these after the fact and communicate the results. Share your successes and how they were measured so everyone can celebrate the improvements together."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Autonomy and a labs approach: Not all changes require a consensus to get the ball rolling.
