I thought it would be something new and unique (even for the team members who had played before). I have been running homebrew campaigns for roughly the last two years \u2014 so I knew that I could do it \u2014 I just had to figure out how to simplify the in-game systems enough that ~10 people who did not know how to play D&D could pick up and play through an adventure in about an hour. No easy task, but not impossible."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The rest of this article is geared towards people who have previous experience playing or running D&D games, since explaining the workings of the 5e system are way beyond the scope of this piece."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Systems"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Characters"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One of my favorite things about D&D is creating characters \u2014 but it\u2019s time-consuming and complex.

These corpses are partially transformed into werewolves, but not fully, and begin to resurrect and attack the characters as they go into the saloon (2 creatures, ~40 hp, each attack for 2d6 damage per turn, 8 AC). After combat, the adventurers hear movement in the back of the saloon as the large beast jumps out of the window, shattering it. As this happens, one more body pops up off the ground \u2014 a friendly NPC who owns the saloon and has been playing possum amongst the corpses for days.

I followed it up by linking them to the D&D 5e starter set and telling them how they can use various online resources to manage and run amazing virtual games. Within 10 minutes, a number of them were talking about setting up a follow-up session as a future team event \u2014 so it seems to have been a hit!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I hope that you can use this as a template for creating exciting and memorable experiences for your team.
