The way they moved. The way they spoke. This admiration continued with me well into my thirties. I wanted to be like them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Today, however, at the age of 41, I don\u2019t really care if someone exudes great confidence or not. Nor do I look up to people because society deems them successful."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The people I admire most are kind. They are generous. Those who do what they can to instill confidence in others. The people who make others feel truly seen."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I wish I had come to this conclusion earlier in life. Emulating the actions of the kind and generous people around you is one of the best decisions you can make."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "1. They are masters of the follow-up"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ve lived in Spain for ten years. During this time, it\u2019s been hard to keep in contact with old friends. Every few weeks, however, like clockwork, a friend of mine reaches out."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This same person has four kids and owns a decent-sized business. I\u2019d be naive to think I\u2019m the only person who he treats this way. The reason for his success is obvious: he cares."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Check-in on people. Kill people with kindness in the follow-up. It doesn\u2019t have to be something big. It could be a book recommendation based on a recent conversation. Or just to simply say hello."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI miss you.\u201d \u201cI saw something and thought of you.\u201d These phrases light people up. This is especially true in trying times like we are all going through now. They let people know you are there for them. Little, yet consistent acts of kindness, lead to strong, long-lasting relationships."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Being a person who follows-up is a choice."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "2. They give their best ideas away for free"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I was hesitant to ask my friend if I could write about a great idea he once shared with me.

If generous people come across something that could help you grow their business, they share it with you."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The best relationships are always forged when two people give without expecting anything in return.

They are quick to forgive people"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I made a mistake. A man I greatly admire reserved an hour of his day to help me with a project.

I was in Italy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After sending an apology I called my mom to vent. \u201cSee how he responds,\u201d she replied. \u201cEveryone makes mistakes. He knows you.

He thanked me for freeing up that time and he sent an option for the following week."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There are worse things in the world than missing a meeting. People will do things you don\u2019t like. Regardless, look at people as a whole instead of a single sum of their many parts.

They ask themselves who needs them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "By all means, keep your own to-do list of the things you need to do each day, but don\u2019t forget to also keep a tally of the ways you can support other people. Helping other people enriches our lives. It is the fastest way for each of us to feel truly successful."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Prioritizing others is a choice."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "5. They treat their word as gold"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Kind, generous people pride themselves on keeping their word. They know that trust is everything."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This doesn\u2019t mean, however, they are pushovers and their kindness leads to their own detriment."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Quite the contrary. Kind, generous people are quicker to say no than most. They take the time to identify when, where, and with whom they are best served. Saying yes to everything spreads them too thin.

It serves as a reminder to do the same for others."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Kind, generous people approach their interactions with an open mind to learn as much as they can about the people they meet. They pocket their agenda for later. Experience has taught them empathy is the key to truly being able to see."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Listen and observe before you speak.
