This is done by burning fuel, and using the thrust of the exhaust gases to provide an acceleration. The problem with this method is that to achieve greater acceleration (and thus a greater final speed) a larger thrust is needed. And to gain a larger thrust, we need more efficient engines that in turn require more fuel."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Unfortunately for interstellar travellers, this process of adding more fuel cannot go on indefinitely. By increasing the fuel reserves at launch, more mass is added, which in turn reduces the acceleration attainable for a given thrust.
