It\u2019s a story we\u2019ve heard many times that usually looks something like this: It starts with a core team, led by a scrappy DIY-type CEO determined to become an exceptional leader and build something great."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But as the company becomes more successful, the pressures and responsibilities on the CEO mount, often causing them to feel increasingly less productive despite working longer hours."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It starts to feel like too much of their time is spent on tactical, low-impact aspects of being an executive\u2014such as combating a constantly-overcapacity inbox, booking seemingly-endless meetings, or arranging nebulous travel details."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Unfortunately, this often comes at the expense of their direct reports\u2019 needs, resulting in a CEO who feels like a bottleneck. As their backlog grows and increasingly-important responsibilities fall through the cracks, they begin to feel like they\u2019re failing their team and undermining everything they\u2019ve worked so hard to achieve."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This overwhelming reality often forces the leader to come face-to-face with the fact that the velocity of their team is limited by their velocity as CEO. They realize something has to change and look for ways to increase their throughput."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One of the most immediate solutions? Hiring an executive assistant."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In a perfect world, that hire would fix everything. That\u2019s rarely the case because many people begin the EA/exec relationship with one of two restricting approaches:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Both approaches often lead to disappointment, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Whether you\u2019ve been working with your EA for three months or three years\u2014or even if you\u2019re just thinking about taking the plunge\u2014it\u2019s my hope these five changes will help you take things to the next level."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "1. Climb Out of the Tradition Trap"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Most EAs have the potential to free up massive amounts of time, maximize productivity, and, most importantly, to enable you to reach your fullest potential as a leader, but too many execs never reach that level because they fall into what I call the \u201cTradition Trap.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As described above, many leaders subscribe to an outdated, uninspired, \u201ctraditional\u201d vision for the role of an executive assistant. Ultimately, they settle for a glorified office admin: someone who manages travel, books meetings, and takes care of general administrative tasks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As a result, they might describe their assistant as \u201chelpful,\u201d but not \u201cgame-changing.\u201d They\u2019re missing out. If you\u2019ve invested in an EA, you\u2019re probably sitting on a treasure trove of untapped potential. Why settle for anything less than game-changing?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At my company, Mindmaven, we believe \u201cgame-changing\u201d should be the standard. But for that to happen, a new approach and mindset are required from both EAs and execs. To that end, we created a new role we call an \u201cengagement manager\u201d (or EM). An engagement manager is a hybrid between a skilled EA and chief of staff, whose primary responsibility is empowering you to reach your fullest potential as a leader."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At the end of the day, if someone hires an assistant simply to \u201csave time\u201d or \u201cbe more productive,\u201d they\u2019re thinking too small. Working with an EM is about much more than saving 2-3 hours a day; it\u2019s about becoming the leader that your team\u2014and your company\u2014deserves."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Although increased productivity is a natural part of that process, it shouldn\u2019t be the end goal. Nearly every aspect of your role\u2014from how you manage your inbox to the way you lead your team\u2014has the opportunity to be transformed by an engagement manager. Here are a few examples."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Clearing the bottleneck"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "An EM can improve your velocity and throughput by tracking your commitments, structuring your day around your most important priorities, and ensuring you follow through on near-100% of your responsibilities faster than ever.

Three months later \u2014 without prompting from you \u2014 an email (written by your EM) shows up in your Drafts folder asking about the move and even recommending a few places they could take their family to celebrate settling in."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The best part? All you need to do to deliver this experience is to click \u201cSend.\u201d"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Supercharging your team"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "An EM can help you build stronger relationships with your team \u2014 often boosting morale and lowering attrition as a result \u2014 by enabling you to deliver higher-quality interactions across the company at deeper, more personal levels."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For example, imagine having a meaningful conversation with a team member and, two weeks later, a ready-to-send email shows up in your drafts folder (produced by your EM) sharing what you appreciated about the interaction and expressing (specifically and genuinely) how much you value their unique contributions to the company culture."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Hopefully, you can see the value in those examples. The point I want to drive home is that if you\u2019re serious about becoming the type of leader your team needs, those tactics (and many others like them) aren\u2019t just luxuries; they\u2019re necessities. From that perspective, I believe working with an EM is one of the most important decisions you\u2019ll make as an executive."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "2.

Ultimately, letting guilt guide decisions often leads to two things:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The more divided an EM\u2019s attention is, the less meaningful their impact on the things that matter most (such as helping you reach your fullest potential). We\u2019ve yet to see someone achieve full leverage with a shared assistant. In our experience, the best results come from a single EM supporting a single executive."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Great assistants want to make an impact. Don\u2019t set them up to fail. If guilt\u2019s compromising your partnership with your EM, view it from a different perspective:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Working 1:1 with a dedicated assistant isn\u2019t about taking more than you deserve, it\u2019s about empowering you to give your team the time, energy, and focus they deserve.

Extinguish Trial-by-Fire (and Fast-Track Leverage)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The costs associated with hiring an EM aren\u2019t just limited to the salary or initial onboarding period. It\u2019s important to also factor in the time and energy necessary to reach game-changing levels \u2014 and too often, execs underestimate how intensive that process can be."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Even an experienced EA has to climb a steep learning curve before they can become a fully-leveraged EM. The game-changing capabilities of engagement managers are the result of highly-personalized coaching and, too often, we see executives operate out of the sub-optimal mindset that because their EM\u2019s primary responsibility is supporting their needs, they\u2019re the only person who can properly onboard their assistant."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If that sounds like you, I\u2019d challenge you to answer two questions honestly:"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Are you really the best person to coach your EM?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Great EMs aren\u2019t hired, they\u2019re coached into becoming great.

Too often, I see execs try to take it on only to wind up overwhelmed as they attempt to balance this alongside their other responsibilities."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This usually ends with a frustrated exec settling for \u201cgood enough\u201d because they don\u2019t have the time needed to reach breakthrough levels with their EM. The problem with \u201cgood enough\u201d is that it runs counter to the reason many execs hire an EA in the first place: contributing to the success of their team at the highest level."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One of the best ways to overcome those limitations is by bringing in a proven advisor to coach your EM on the skills they need to support you. Remember, working with an EM isn\u2019t just about freeing up time; it\u2019s about reaching your fullest potential as a leader, and that\u2019s a path most effectively traveled with a coach who\u2019s seen and done it before."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "4. Recognize the Biggest Limiting Factor (is You)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you resonated with the Limited Dreamer approach above, this one\u2019s especially important: one of the easiest mistakes an exec can make is assuming they already \u201cknow it all\u201d because they\u2019ve worked with an EA before, or will \u201cfigure it out as they go.\u201d The truth is the executive often needs even more coaching than the assistant."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Working with an EM requires fundamental shifts in the way an executive operates, and those changes often don\u2019t come naturally.
