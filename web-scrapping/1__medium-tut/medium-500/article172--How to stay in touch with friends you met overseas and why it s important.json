It\u2019s staying in touch with them that I find a bit challenging. I feel like I\u2019m the type of person who wants to build secure connections and continuously remind myself that that will usually not be the case. Building strong connections takes a lot of energy and time, and being so far from these people doesn\u2019t make it any easier. But it\u2019s worth keeping them in any way you can! And if they\u2019re down, you\u2019re down. Here are a few ideas based on how I maintain connections with people I met overseas."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Understanding travel friends from a distance"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Every connection and friendship will be different. People have their own lives at home, as you have your life here. You have to understand each other. You\u2019re getting to know these people at a much slower pace than your new friends at home. So if someone doesn\u2019t answer for days or weeks, there\u2019s no reason to fret. There\u2019s a trust that they will get back to you. And you want the same courtesy and understanding extended to you as well."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/10944/1*ikilL3JE1XxExbCkkoV7vQ.jpeg"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Use your creativity"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When I spent a month in Russia, I met and stayed in touch with a fair amount of people. I was there in August 2018, which was quite some time ago. In a year and a half, I maintained good-standing friendships with a few people. Shortly after I came back from Russia, I started my last semester at Parsons and was working on my thesis. I graduated from a Communication Design program, so thesis was in the form of a big design project. I designed social awareness posters based on USSR-style design. The subjects I used in the posters were based on portraits I took in Russia of Russian youth, therefore focusing the topic onto Russian youth culture. The thesis is the way I was able to use my connections, conversations, and the portrait shots I took in a meaningful way. It created something I was happy to report back to the people that collaborated with me for the project."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Another way I include travel friends in my creative processes is by sharing the stories they tell about a particular topic I am writing about for Medium. So, I seek out conversations to have. A good example of this is the article I wrote recently about staying at hostels. I contacted a few people that I met in hostels on my travels and asked them questions about their worst and best experiences. Not everyone I contacted answered me, but the ones who did told amazing stories and gave us space to deeply talk about awesome experiences we had. This was a practice in active listening. Since I will already tell my own story in my writing, this was the time to listen to their story."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Involving people in creative projects strengthens communities, increases communication, and keeps that globalization ball rolling."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Using the internet"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s always fun to say something like \u201cI met Tay in a Saint Petersburg hostel, she\u2019s from Brazil, and now she\u2019s hanging out with me here in Brooklyn!\u201d It\u2019s no doubt that having travel friends meet you in your hometown or visiting a friend in their home city is a great feeling.

But there are some people whose interaction with you only goes so far. It\u2019s okay. If someone is really disengaged, someone who continuously doesn't reply, then there\u2019s no reason to keep trying. There are also times I don\u2019t care if someone doesn\u2019t reply, and I\u2019ll probably try again in a few weeks if I think of them.

I haven\u2019t talked to her in about 4 years. This was someone I\u2019ve had emotional conversations with. She was on my mind, I was wondering how she was doing, and it felt right. Why not go for it? The discussion was minimal. However, she did reply and greeted me with warmth and enthusiasm.
