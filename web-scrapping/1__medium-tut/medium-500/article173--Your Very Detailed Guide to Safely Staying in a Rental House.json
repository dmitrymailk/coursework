Unlike hotels where you will naturally come into contact with more people (cleaning staff, other guests, and so on), she says staying in a place where it\u2019s just you and your chosen unit could be safer. \u201cWhen you get there you can make sure everything is sanitized to a level that you\u2019re comfortable with, and then it would be just like your house,\u201d she says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Still, there are a few issues you\u2019ll need to navigate to ensure a safe stay.

The new protocol offers hosts Covid-19\u2013specific cleaning guidelines informed by the CDC and other health experts like Vivek Murthy, MD, the former surgeon general of the United States. Hosts will receive training on important cleaning and sanitation practices, like how to properly use personal protective equipment while cleaning a home (like wearing a mask and gloves) and what disinfectants are EPA-compliant. The initiative will also require hosts to leave a 24-hour window between bookings to minimize the risk of airborne particles in the space."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If a host does not commit to completing the training for the heightened cleaning protocol, they can still opt in to something called \u201cBooking Buffer,\u201d which includes a 72-hour vacancy period between guest stays. Hosts can also opt out of participating in either of these new precautions, so be aware that neither of these are mandatory. Check the listing page to be sure."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Vrbo has released updated cleaning guidelines for hosts. While there does not appear to be any formal sort of certificate program hosts can complete like Airbnb\u2019s new initiative, Vrbo hosts can add information like what disinfectants are being used at the property, booking buffer policies, and contactless-check-in options to their property descriptions."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you\u2019re booking a home on Airbnb, Vrbo, or another home-sharing website and you do not see a clear indication on the listing about what cleaning and sanitation measures are being taken, it is safest to contact the host ahead of time to ask for specifics."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Determining your guest list"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Deciding exactly who and how many people should join you at a summer rental house will be trickier this year given that more people means more risk. The public health experts I spoke to didn\u2019t have a definitive group size that they would consider to be safe. Instead, they say it\u2019s more about how big the rental house is, gauging how well you know the other guests, and deciding how much you trust them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cIf you\u2019re a few days into your vacation and someone gets a fever, there should be enough space in the house to put that person in their own room with their own bathroom so that they don\u2019t infect anyone else,\u201d says Murray. \u201cIf you have too many people in the house for that to be possible, then you have too many people. Ideally, you want a bedroom per person and at least two bathrooms.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Marissa Levine, MD, the director of the Center for Leadership in Public Health Practice at the University of Southern Florida, says this isn\u2019t the summer to be cohabitating with friends of friends or people who you don\u2019t know all that well. \u201cAre these family members who have been tracking their potential exposure to the virus or are these strangers? These things matter. This is going to be a time where erring on the side of caution is a smart thing to do.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Another important factor to consider is what sort of transportation guests will require in order to get there.

If you\u2019re going to socialize with friends, just be aware that there is a possibility that one of you might infect the other, and understand what that would mean. As friends, think through not only how to avoid it, but also what will you do in the event that someone does get sick?

If you\u2019re staying in an Airbnb that has committed to the \u201cEnhanced Cleaning Initiative\u201d there\u2019s still no official inspection being done. You will have to trust that the hosts are really doing everything they say they are."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s a good idea to bring along some EPA-approved disinfectants to wipe down high-touch surfaces throughout your stay, but you don\u2019t necessarily need to black-light the place. \u201cBe a detective,\u201d says Jack Caravanos, DrPh, a clinical professor of environmental public health sciences at NYU. \u201cDoes it smell like it\u2019s been cleaned?

It also asks hosts to avoid shaking laundry to help decrease the spread of germs.
