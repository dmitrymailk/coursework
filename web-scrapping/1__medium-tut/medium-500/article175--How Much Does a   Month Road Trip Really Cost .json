Typically I\u2019ll save money before I leave for the SW.

Even when my balance was nearly zero, I felt confident that I had the supplies I needed and that I would get another deposit before I ran out or went negative."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If I can travel for $873/month, I can certainly stay in one place for under $500.
