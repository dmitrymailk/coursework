I was generally more content to sit in my bedroom than to play in the sunshine because my favorite \u201ctoys\u201d were picture atlases, phrasebooks, and the world-band radio my parents had given me for my 8th birthday. I resolved very young that someday I\u2019d see the sights from these atlases in person. Someday I\u2019d need the words from these phrasebooks. And someday \u2014 I liked to imagine (because what little girl doesn\u2019t hope she grows up pretty?) \u2014 I\u2019d be an impossibly beautiful, exotic creature, captivating strangers without effort while I moved about my daily life far away."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As it turns out, that last dream did come true, in a way \u2014 as a nightmare."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I chose Ecuador to study abroad in my second year of college, lured by a combination of my love for mountains and my lifelong interest in indigenous American cultures. I was thrilled to see my dreams taking shape so young: I was only 19, and here I was, already beginning to see the world. The future felt so wide, so early."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Ecuador\u2019s just the beginning, I thought. Maybe I\u2019ll spend a semester in Spain next. And then I\u2019ll finish my Spanish major, and I\u2019ll find a job abroad \u2014 and keep exploring new places whenever I can."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But my Mediterranean curves and hip-length, dark-honey curls were rare and compelling in the Andes. It didn\u2019t matter that I dressed like a tomboy and felt more awkward than attractive; I couldn\u2019t escape male attention there. (Probably not a coincidence that subsequent years saw me gaining 35 mystery pounds and losing aggressive amounts of hair.)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I came home with PTSD."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "No single incident was responsible for breaking me. The PTSD was largely just the result of a holistic miasma of fear."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Being sexually assaulted in broad daylight sucked \u2014 both times. But so did being followed by a police motorcycle for weeks for no reason. As did being summoned to the post office for a suspicious \u201cpackage\u201d that never existed at all (amidst a backdrop of warnings from locals about the possibility of false drug arrests and cautions about how foreign women, especially, seemed vulnerable to them)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The fact that I got catcalled \u2014 if not also followed \u2014 once per minute each time I walked anywhere outside my house didn\u2019t help either. Nor did the stories from friends about their own assaults, which reinforced the notion: Danger is everywhere."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To add insult to injury, I went home each day to a homestay where the housekeeper was a man whose attentions toed the line of impropriety. There was no place in Ecuador where I felt fully at ease because everywhere I turned, someone thought I was beautiful \u2014 and because many of the people who thought I was beautiful decided they were entitled to that beauty in some way: to comment on it or follow me in the hopes they might possess it, or even just reach out and grope me on a Sunday afternoon or dry-hump me on their morning commute."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Many, many things made me feel unsafe, constantly, and I started to feel like I was safe nowhere in the world.

I\u2019d learned that some things simply aren\u2019t safe for women to do, and it had nothing to do with being a damsel in distress type who \u201cneeded\u201d a man, nor was it about \u201cdrawing attention to yourself.\u201d It was just life."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I resigned to finishing out my Spanish major (I couldn\u2019t afford to switch to a new one) and tried not to let myself wonder:"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "At age 22, I started therapy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I was tired of the vivid flashbacks that kept bringing me back to Quito, and of the fact that a single dream about being in the Andes could depress me for an entire week. Counseling was slow (PTSD can be tricky), but even as the flashbacks became less frequent, I spent my early 20s making unfulfilling choice after unfulfilling choice: I\u2019d long ago given up on my old dreams of future semesters or summers abroad, and I took a teaching job at my alma mater after graduation, partly to avoid taking a risk on a new place\u2026 even though my town bored me to tears."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Next, I joined a Ph.D. program as a compromise: I would study the world and its people from the distance of the ivory tower, as an untouchable observer \u2014 even though I knew in my gut that I wouldn\u2019t be happy\u2026 and I declined the opportunity to work on a research project abroad."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Of all the reasons for neglecting my dreams throughout my early-20s, my trauma was probably the biggest. Because even when money wasn\u2019t an obstacle, even when I was free of a controlling ex-boyfriend, and even when I realized I felt deeply unfulfilled\u2026 I stayed put."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I knew I wanted something else out of life \u2014 I knew I\u2019d always wanted something else out of life \u2014 but it just didn\u2019t make sense to reach for it anymore. Why would I ever try again, if just a single reach had been enough to shatter me?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This was how I lived for half a decade until a very unexpected encounter."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At age 25, I met someone who reminded me of the old\u2014as in, the real\u2014me. A kindred nomad soul who hadn\u2019t been broken by his own adventures. And as I listened to his reveries about the many places he\u2019d explore, the magic he would alchemize someday for this world from all his far-flung inspirations\u2026 I recognized my own forgotten dreams in his words. I didn\u2019t know how I\u2019d find the courage to fly again, where I\u2019d go, or even how I would extract myself from the lifestyle I was stuck in\u2026 but I promised myself that I would."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Because suddenly the loss of my true self had become unbearable.

My stomach abruptly sank, and I think I was reminded of a quote I\u2019d loved since high school: \u201c\u2026you will be more disappointed by the things you didn\u2019t do than by the ones you did do.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The lead weight in my gut told me all I needed to know about how much I truly wanted to travel again \u2014 and how ready I was to try. Luckily enough, I refreshed the search and the bargain prices reappeared. I booked without hesitation. And the trip helped me heal. The following year, I moved to Shanghai. Then, later, to Berlin. The international life I lead right now is totally unrecognizable compared to anything I was daring to dream just a decade ago."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It took a lot of therapy, a lot of reflection, and a lot of testing the waters to get comfortable with reclaiming my inner nomad, and I definitely \u201ctweaked\u201d my old dreams in the process; they aren\u2019t the same shape as they were before Ecuador."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ve learned to research destinations with respect to the prevalence of gender violence, and there are some places I simply won\u2019t go. (At least not without a man.) I also recognize that there are certain things I can\u2019t (personally) feel comfortable doing when I travel alone as a woman, no matter how \u201csafe\u201d the destination supposedly is: I won\u2019t allow myself to get drunk or hit up nightclubs alone, go to beaches without a buddy, book arrivals or departures at certain times of night, or stay in neighborhoods where female reviewers say they\u2019ve felt uneasy (even if men, in the same places, feel fine)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sometimes I lament my limitations: I wish I could get drunk alone, sunbathe or swim alone, come and go at any hour, and not have to spend extra for a gender-specific sense of security in my accommodations\u2026 but as long as I travel without a companion, that\u2019s how I roll."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I also wish I had less fear than other women \u2014 women who haven\u2019t been stalked or assaulted in their travels \u2014 but the reality is that I was stalked and assaulted in my travels.

I can also tell you that having a counselor helps.
