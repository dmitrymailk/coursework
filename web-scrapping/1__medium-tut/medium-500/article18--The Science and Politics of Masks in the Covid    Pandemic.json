While it seems logical that a single viral particle hitting a person\u2019s mouth, nose, or eye could cause an infection, strong laboratory and empirical evidence says that this is not the case \u2014 it takes a big dose of virus to launch a case of Covid. This happy fact means that masks for everyday use don\u2019t need to block 100% of pathogens in order to prevent the disease from spreading. (Even the medical-grade N95 masks don\u2019t block every viral particle, but they block enough to protect the user, even when caring for patients with known Covid-19.)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Face masks are effective because they block droplets from spraying out of the wearer\u2019s mouth. They also remind us not to touch our mouths/noses. We all know that sneezing and coughing can generate a spray of virus (the six-feet rule is because, in most cases, that\u2019s the outer limit of how far moist droplets will travel). We now appreciate that singing transmits a lot of viral particles, and at least one large outbreak occurred during a choral practice. A recent simulation study found that loud speaking can also send viral particles out a moderate distance, though the clinical significance of this is uncertain. Nevertheless, now that we know the various ways that virus can leave someone\u2019s mouth and enter the air, it\u2019s all the more reason to mask up \u2014 particularly since there\u2019s no good way to tell whether someone has Covid without testing, and up to 50% of Covid patients are asymptomatic, at least at first."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There have been no controlled trials that have tested the benefits of masks; all of the available evidence regarding their efficacy is from observational studies.

The figure below, from Howard et al., shows that if masks are 50% effective at blocking pathogens (a conservative estimate, shown in the Y-axis on the left) and 50% of people wear them (which shouldn\u2019t be too tough; X-axis), the rate of viral transmission plummets from one person spreading it to 2.4 people on average, to one person spreading it to 1.35 people. (R0 from 2.4 \u21921.35; the curved lines within the square show the resulting R0.) That saves many lives, but, with an R0 of 1.35, there\u2019s still a lot of spread. (Recall that the virus begins to die out if each infected person gives the virus to fewer than one person; an R0 of <1). The higher the rate of adherence to mask-wearing, the more we move to the upper right (blue) part of the square, the lower the spread of the virus, and the more quickly the epidemic recedes in a given community."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2024/0*I0fIM6icAQOKBb3Q.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A simulation by De Kai and colleagues makes the case that masks are most effective if at least 80% of people are using them.

In a world in which it is impossible to know who is carrying SARS-CoV-2 and highly unlikely that we can completely avoid entering each other\u2019s space, masks represent a simple and effective strategy whose use will save tens of thousands of lives.
