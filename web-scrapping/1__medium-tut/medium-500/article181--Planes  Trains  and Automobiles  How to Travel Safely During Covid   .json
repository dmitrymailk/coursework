Right now, many places have stay-at-home orders in place that largely restrict travel. However, as states begin lifting these restrictions, or as people need to move, there are questions about the safest way to do so. Is it better to take a road trip but risk stops along the way? Or is it better to take an airplane and spend hours in tight quarters with strangers?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cAny form of travel at this current time in the Covid-19 pandemic involves risk,\u201d says Jill Weatherhead, MD, an assistant professor of tropical medicine and infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cKnowing the most up-to-date information regarding the virus and travel restrictions is critical.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Weatherhead points out that taking public forms of transportation like buses, trains, or planes can undoubtedly mean close exposure to more people in different areas of the country. \u201cWhile waiting within airports, bus spots, and train stations, as well as while riding in planes, buses, and trains, practice social distancing as much as possible. Disinfecting highly touched surfaces, such as seats, trays, arm rests, and wearing a facial covering may help reduce viral transmission during travel,\u201d she says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What about the lack of airflow on a plane? \u201cModern planes are equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which filter particles from recycled air, reducing risk of viral spread through the air,\u201d Weatherhead says. \u201cHowever, it won\u2019t necessarily prevent droplet or contaminated surface transmission of the virus if in close contact with sick individuals.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Robin Patel, MD, president of the American Society for Microbiology, takes a stronger stance on flying. \u201cTraveling in your own car, either by yourself or with members of your household, is certainly safer than traveling by airplane right now in terms of acquiring Covid-19,\u201d she says. \u201cEven with physical distancing measures on an airplane, there is a risk of exposure to Covid-19 due to the sheer number of people not from the same household sharing the same space.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Patel says that because Covid-19 can be spread from people without symptoms or people who haven\u2019t yet developed symptoms, there\u2019s no easy way to know who might by carrying it. \u201cHaving air travelers wear a mask, properly cleaning surfaces in airports and on planes, and washing your hands regularly can help, of course, but if you\u2019re alone or with others from your household in your own car, there\u2019s really little risk of acquiring Covid-19 there. It\u2019s pretty much like being at home.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Weatherhead says that while driving may reduce close contact with large groups of people, \u201cDriving requires frequent stops with exposures at restaurants, rest stops, and gas stations.\u201d Her advice: \u201cEnsure everyone in the car is from the same household. Reducing stops and washing hands regularly may also prevent spread of infection while on road trips.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The bottom line is any transportation comes with a set of risks, especially if you\u2019re attempting to travel across states or for a long period of time. In some cases, the distance may make the decision easier.

But sometimes you have no choice but to take one or the other."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Ellie Murray, PhD, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University\u2019s School of Public Health, says the relative safety of public transportation or ride-sharing likely depends on the local Covid-19 conditions in your area. In the U.K., she notes, \u201cPeople who drive buses, taxies, or ride-shares had a high risk of Covid-19, so all shared transportation methods do probably convey some risk.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A good rule of thumb is to \u201cchoose the least crowded option available to you,\u201d Murray says. \u201cIf your local buses or subway cars are relatively empty, then that might be a safer option than a ride-share, since there could be more space between you and other passengers than you and the driver in a ride-share. If the public transportation is quite crowded, then ride-share might be a preferred option.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The usual rules of pandemic hygiene apply in both cases: Wear a mask, avoid touching surfaces unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary, don\u2019t touch your face or personal items, and wash your hands with soap and water once you get to where you\u2019re headed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cIf you are heading home,\u201d Murray adds, \u201cyou may also want to change into new clothes once you get in.\u201d"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Is it safe to use bike-share?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Since the spread of Covid-19 has made it risky to take public transit like subways and buses and to ride in cars with strangers, many are opting to ride a different kind of public vehicle: shared bicycles via bike-share programs. Programs like these, which sometimes also include scooters, let riders avoid breathing around strangers while also getting a bit of exercise en route to their destination. But unanswered questions about the safety of shared seats and handlebars might leave some people leery."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There don\u2019t seem to be any Covid-19 studies specifically on bicycles or scooters, but Steffanie Strathdee, PhD, associate dean of global health sciences at the University of California, San Diego, and author of The Perfect Predator, suggests treating handles and seats like any other potentially contaminated surface and cleaning them before use."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201c[Since] we know that SARS-CoV-2 can live for over a day on some surfaces,\u201d Strathdee wrote in an email, \u201cI would recommend that people wipe down the handlebars and anywhere else they might place their hands, along with the seat, with bleach wipes before using them, just like they would with a grocery cart. I\u2019d also not recommend wearing short shorts!\u201d"}], "topic": "travel"}
