No matter where you live, there are beautiful, scenic spots you can reach in less than a day. Georgia has some of the most diverse geographies in the nation. From the mountains in the north to the beaches and swampland in the south, it is rich in scenery and photo opportunities."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/4684/1*m6tNBZb2MpeZzkSV99E4eA.jpeg"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The Mountains"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Lush mountains cover much of the north part of the state. The Chattahoochee National Forest covers many counties in this mountainous region, and it is also on the edge of the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Smoky Mountains. A photographer could spend days just wandering around the peaks and valleys in this region and never run out of things to shoot. Yonah Mountain, in particular, is a magnificent place to hike with breathtaking views."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Besides this area of the state, there are a few other mountains of note in Georgia. Stone Mountain and its little brother Arabia Mountain are huge outcroppings of the great underground veins of granite that run just under the surface. Both make great photo ops by themselves and offer spectacular views of the surrounding areas."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*8CwJx-Ndpt3WcZrZ"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The Coast"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Along the coast of Georgia are about a dozen barrier islands, each of which offers a unique place for photography. Tybee Island, to the north, just off Savannah, is a funky little place reminiscent of Key West, with miles of beaches. At the other end is Cumberland Island, a natural oasis still populated by sea turtles and wild horses. To the north of Cumberland lies Jekyll and St Simons Island, very close geographically, but very diverse photographically. Sunrise at Driftwood Beach on Jekyll is a must shoot location."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/6176/0*z6eEU38oW21TvnP9"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The Swamps and Canyons"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Not far to the west of the coast is the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. The Okefenokee Swamp is over 350,000 acres of natural swampland with hundreds of unique plants and animals. Guides are a must, but this great natural wonder is a sight to behold and a photographer\u2019s paradise."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Northwest of Savannah lies the George L. Smith State Park. This is another wetland teeming with wildlife and cypress and tupelo trees just perfect for photography. In Southwest Georgia, you can find Providence Canyon, which is a mini-Grand Canyon hidden in the state\u2019s corner few people even know about. Hidden in the northwest corner, you will shoot Cloudland Canyon. Not quite as large, but beautiful, nonetheless."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/10944/0*n2i5QTOtBp7lM4JY"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The Waterfalls"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Most states would consider themselves lucky to have a beautiful waterfall to photograph. Georgia has five. The most famous and majestic is Amicalola Falls, about 75 miles north of Atlanta. It is beautiful at any time of year, but fall is spectacular. There is a trail you hike to the top, or take the easy way and drive up there."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To the northeast of Amicalola is Toccoa Falls. It is not nearly as tall as Amicalola, but it is on the grounds of Toccoa Falls College, which is a nice photography destination in its own right. Just to the northwest of Toccoa, you can hit Anny Ruby, and Dukes Creek Falls about 10 miles from each other. Also nearby is High Shoals Falls."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It would be impossible to hit all the magnificent photography spots in Georgia in a single day. But if you divide the state up into quadrants, you could see everything and capture some amazing images in a week.
