Ltd. and linking the city to the port of Gandia on the Mediterranean coast. Known as the \u201cEnglish railway\u201d (el tren dels anglesos in Valencian), the line was used for transporting coal and other materials to the growing Alcoy industrial sector, and for exporting industrial products such as textile, paper and olive oil via Gandia."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*h8jj5IU09qiXGst2.JPG"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The construction of the railway was subject both to physical and to political constraints: for a considerable stretch the River Serpis passes through mountainous terrain and a narrow gorge known as el barranc de l\u2019infern (\u201cHell\u2019s gorge\u201d), whilst the local authorities insisted on the creation of stations in Alcoy, Muro de Alcoy, Villalonga and Gandia in a bid to ensure that the new infrastructure improved communications between the coastal and the inland areas.
