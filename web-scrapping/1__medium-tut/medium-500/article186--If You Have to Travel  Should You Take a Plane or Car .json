Right now many places have stay-at-home orders that largely restrict travel. However, as states begin lifting these restrictions or people need to move, there are questions about the safest way to do so. Is it better to take a road trip but risk stops along the way? Or is it better to take an airplane and spend hours in tight quarters with strangers?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cAny form of travel at this current time in the Covid-19 pandemic involves risk,\u201d says Dr. Jill Weatherhead, an assistant professor of tropical medicine and infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cKnowing the most up-to-date information regarding the virus and travel restrictions is critical.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Weatherhead points out that taking public forms of transportation like buses, trains, or planes can undoubtedly mean close exposure to more people in different areas of the country. \u201cWhile waiting within airports, bus spots, and train stations as well as while riding in planes, buses, and trains, practicing social distancing as much as possible; disinfecting highly touched surfaces such as seats, trays, armrests; and wearing a facial covering may help reduce viral transmission during travel,\u201d she says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What about the lack of airflow on a plane? \u201cModern planes are equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters which filter particles from recycled air, reducing risk of viral spread through the air,\u201d says Weatherhead. \u201cHowever it won\u2019t necessarily prevent droplet or contaminated surface transmission of the virus if in close contact with sick individuals.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Dr. Robin Patel, president of the American Society for Microbiology, takes a stronger stance on flying. \u201cTraveling in your own car, either by yourself or with members of your household, is certainly safer than traveling by airplane right now in terms of acquiring Covid-19,\u201d she says. \u201cEven with physical distancing measures on an airplane, there is a risk of exposure to Covid-19 due to the sheer number of people not from the same household sharing the same space.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Patel says that because Covid-19 can be spread from people without symptoms or people who haven\u2019t yet developed symptoms, there\u2019s no easy way to know who might be carrying it. \u201cHaving air travelers wear a mask, properly cleaning surfaces in airports and on planes, and washing your hands regularly can help, of course, but if you\u2019re alone or with others from your household in your own car, there\u2019s really little risk of acquiring Covid-19 there; it\u2019s pretty much like being at home.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Weatherhead says that while driving may reduce close contact with large groups of people, \u201cdriving requires frequent stops with exposures at restaurants, rest stops, and gas stations.\u201d Her advice: \u201cEnsure everyone in the car is from the same household. Reducing stops and washing hands regularly may also prevent spread of infection while on road trips.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The bottom line is that any transportation is going to come with a set of risks, especially if you\u2019re attempting to travel across states or for a long period of time.

In any situation, try to stay spread apart from others, keep washing your hands, and wear your mask (and seat belt)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Read more on travel:"}], "topic": "travel"}
