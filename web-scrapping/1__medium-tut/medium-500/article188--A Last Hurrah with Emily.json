I have just had a very decent lunch for the apparently reasonable price of forty nine hundred pesos. Most non-fast food restaurants here want seven thousand for a decent lunch, where one can sit and feel like a dignified person for a little while, after days spent on dusty roadsides and nights sleeping in sandy places. How quickly standards change \u2014 I would only have considered paying this in Arequipa for a special occasion, and this is just a lunch, but something felt special enough about it to make seven dollars seem reasonable. I had a fried cut of albacore tuna, an empanada and a salad, washed down with a limonada."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I chose this restaurant because it was comparatively affordable, but also because the patio looked like a good place to linger awhile. Not many other diners in these late lunch hours, no blasting reggaeton. The meseras didn\u2019t keep asking me if I wanted anything more. So I did indeed linger and did some writing, protected from the sun by an umbrella, or as they call it, un parasol. A for-the-sun. Rain umbrellas have a different name: paraguas. Sometimes spanish makes so much sense."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "People here love sitting out on these patios that jut out into the street, eating and drinking and talking. Day and night, all of the cafe bar restaurants seem to have some people at them. You just don\u2019t find this in Per\u00fa. People do sit in plazas, and there is definitely a culture of going out to the bar/club, but not so much sitting around at caf\u00e9s. This practice, this cafe life, is much more like Europe."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In general Chile is much more orderly, relaxed and dignified than its neighbor to the north. I didn\u2019t expect to like it as much as I do. There is the lingering difficulty of the accents, which I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m making any progress with; the expense \u2014 a lot of things are priced like the US; and the sheer barrenness of this coast. The hills above the city are absolutely devoid of life, a bleak sun-scorched dull brown. But below is this city with a smattering of trees, relatively modern and just a bit quaint, tranquil and friendly enough."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1*5KHVlnifvstbxtFj-iB-bg.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is the first thing I\u2019ve done today, at least outside of the hostel, a day I\u2019ve taken necessarily slowly. Necessary, after three days of advanced/rough travel, waking up in a different town each day than we woke up in. In some ways it makes sense, as we both have a long ways to go and not much money. But I also wonder if I might be getting too old for this sort of thing. It feels exhausting just thinking back on my recent life. The festivities around leaving Arequipa, playing a show, saying goodbye to everyone I got to know, staying up late with Karem night after night, and getting violently stomach-sick my last full day there took a lot out of me. This was followed by buses, a border, and extreme travel, trying to keep up with a twenty-three year old, hitchhiking and wild camping all the while. Phew."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My traveling companion is eighteen years younger than me, drinks more and then wakes up with the energy to do yoga in the morning. Had I more money, and the correlating time, I could stay here a week and just relax, get my energy back, get the hang of the various kinds of Spanish going around. But I know I have to keep moving. If not tomorrow, then the day after, it will be the road again."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Slept in as best I could \u2014 read: slept off the rum \u2014 through all sorts of hostel comings and goings in the hallway outside our door. When I finally stumbled out of bed I made a pot of black tea and drank a cup on the rooftop terrace looking out at the sea and another on the ground floor inner courtyard patio. This hostel is perfect for us \u2014 shabby but comfortable, a place where the travelers have created their own community."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After my two cups of tea, I traded one courtyard for another, sat down with my new friend Julian on the streetside patio, and moved on to my next tea experience. As a good Argentine, he was drinking Yerba Mate, and in good cultural form he of course wanted to share, which I was delighted about. This was a sign that I was getting closer to the Land of Mate, closer to Uruguay, my destination. We passed back and forth, not a gourd but a stainless steel cup which he called a mate, with a leather embossed outer holder. He poured water from a thermos, filling it up each time he\u2019d pass it to me. The water was scalding hot and the bombilla \u2014 filtered metal straw \u2014 was burning my lips a little, so I\u2019d take my time letting it cool a bit. I\u2019m not sure if this is frowned upon when sharing mate, but everything seemed to be relaxed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At my request, Julian explained how to conjugate for vos, a different form of second person singular than the standard tu or usted. There was only one irregular \u2014 for ser, to be \u2014 which happens to be one of the first things any traveler asks you. Instead of the usual De donde eres? \u2014 where are you from \u2014 vos conjugates as De donde sos? I\u2019d heard this over and over the night before, and wanted to get to the bottom of it. The other verb conjugations were disorienting because for verbs with an irregular conjugation \u2014 for example tener is (tu) tienes \u2014 with vos the conjugation is regular, but with the accent at the end: (vos) ten\u00e9s. This was going to be a little bit of a headache. Perhaps this seems like a slight difference, but the sound of words changes significantly. Tienes sounds like \u201ctee-yen-es\u201d, where ten\u00e9s sounds more like \u201cteh-ness\u201d."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In late morning I cooked a good breakfast of Huevos Pericos, which somewhere in Central America became my traveling breakfast of choice. You can always find halfway decent eggs, tomatoes, onions. I am getting back into my traveling mind, but not without some difficulty. This day of rest is helping a lot with the transition, after eight months where I mostly was in one place. The ability to find places to relax and stop out here on the road is crucial."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Checked my email for the first time in three days, and found a message from my long-lost friend Becky in New Orleans. It was an in-depth, thoughtful email, one of those that you can\u2019t expect, that only come around every once in a while. She is a good writer and sketched out her recent life, which has taken a decidedly more domestic turn. She is living with her partner, and is more and more involved in the life of his ten year old daughter."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Among other things, she described her experience of Mardi Gras. For so long that day was one of the centerpieces of my year. When I lived in New Orleans and a few years after, I saw eight straight Fat Tuesdays. Two years ago Becky and I were almost attached at the hip on the same surreal journey from early morning pancakes until fall of night when Mardi Gras gets not-good-weird and I was quasi-kidnapped by another woman. But that\u2019s another story."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Last year, I was in Colombia, and Carnaval is a big deal, at least in parts of that country. Colombian carnival music, which I was hearing a lot in the weeks leading up to it, reminded me of Mardi Gras Indian music and I\u2019d been seeing footage of parades on TV, so the Tuesday in question I was very much aware of the day. I was traveling with a couple friends \u2014 Miles from San Francisco and Daniela from Buenos Aires \u2014 and I regaled them with Mardi Gras stories while on our bus ride down from Lago de Tota in the Andes of Boyac\u00e1 department."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This year, Mardi Gras fell two days ago. I must be pretty far away from New Orleans, because I didn\u2019t even notice. Waking up on a public beach in a border town, hitchhiking on a semi truck, making camp in strong winds in a ghost town fishing village were enough to entirely distract me. My world was so unknown and immediately palpable that it never crossed my mind what might be happening on Royal Street in New Orleans or at the steps down by the Mississippi above Jackson Square."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I was presented with one clue, after the fact: last night walking around, I repeatedly saw people streaming out of churches, which I thought was strange on a weekday night. And then I saw the black marks on their foreheads. Ash Wednesday. This was the first time it occurred to me that the day before might have been Mardi Gras, what had once been the peak of my year. Realizing that I\u2019d utterly missed the day was a little jarring."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Emily and I have spent most of our time here in Iquique separately, with the exception of the hours last night hanging out with lots of other people. This morning she spent a long time sitting at a table in the hostel office registering for classes in the fall at CU-Boulder, and it felt like part of her was already gone. Her heart is in southern Chile, at this dream of a farm retreat where she will be volunteering, and where maybe there is a boy involved. Her mind is going back to school. She has about a year left for her undergraduate degree, and has a determination to finish. We\u2019ve talked a lot about the state of our home country over the months we\u2019ve known each other, and though at this point she\u2019s not quite as sour on things as me, it seems to be more of a sense of duty than a desire to go back."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s a good thing for us to have some time alone, after three days when we were almost always together. And it\u2019s quite an adjustment from being casual friends in a city to traveling together, navigating all the little challenges and trying moments of day after day. She seems different, moody and distracted. I wonder how I must seem. I\u2019m doing my best to let go of the idea that it\u2019s about me, and just let things go."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Either way our partnership has an expiration date; in the next city down, Antofagasta, I\u2019m turning east, up towards the Andes. Emily may accompany me up to the high Atacama desert, but she probably will just carry on southward. She seems to be leaning towards not coming with me to San Pedro, the town in the desert, and even if she does, then we\u2019ll certainly split up there, as I\u2019m crossing over into Argentina, and she won\u2019t do that. It\u2019s likely we have only two more nights together. She has a long, long way to go still. I have two more borders to cross and two more countries to see, but she\u2019s got a lot longer way to go than me."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "2"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Our plan for the night is to go out and play some music on the streets of Iquique. I say \u201cour plan\u201d but it hasn\u2019t been fully agreed upon. Emily and I have been talking about it for a couple days, but when I\u2019d brought it up earlier she\u2019d been noncommittal and said she\u2019d see how she was feeling. Julian insisted that the thing to do was to go to a bar, ask the bartender or barker if we could play, do three songs and then pass around a hat; that playing on the street would be much worse. But Emily absolutely did not want to do that."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We\u2019d gone busking several times in Arequipa, though that was a little different. The hat, or guitar case as it may be, is on the ground, a passive receptacle with an implied request for donation. When you go up to someone and put the hat in front of them, it\u2019s much more confrontational. I understand. But years of living in New Orleans cured me of that particular inhibition, and it\u2019s standard conduct there to have a pretty woman or a friend of the band circulate through the crowd, passing the hat. I suppose New Orleans is good at curing inhibitions in general."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Either way, Emily was a positive-leaning maybe for playing on the street, and a solid no for bars. In the late afternoon I went for a walk to check out the two places Julian had hesitantly recommended. There was a long calle peotonal closed off to traffic about five blocks away called Paseo Baquedano, and it was really quite nice. Caf\u00e9s and bars and benches with trees planted in the street. The largest collection of older architecture I\u2019d seen in the city, pastel colors, an almost Caribbean influenced feeling. Palm trees and antique streetlights, very ocean-centric. A bit of the vibe of Key West, Florida.The paseo led up to Plaza Arturo Prat, a broad well-kept plaza with not many people. I found a few potential spots for busking, but at least in the daytime the street was about as sleepy as the buildings."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1*J87WSElEiHWhUX5DRvqL2w.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I walked down to Playa Cavancha, the beach a few blocks the other direction from our hostel, a wide gently curving beach of light gray sand with black sea rocks on the north end and a whole mess of fancy hotels to the south. There is a malec\u00f3n between the boulevard-like street and the beach, with benches and shaded spots, a lot of people running and walk-and-talking by. This was the other place Julian had mentioned as a busking spot, and it had potential. Found my way down to the beach, where hundreds of people were laying out on towels, frolicking in the water and drinking beers. I stripped down to my swim trunks and waded in to brave the waters of the Pacific. It seemed somehow a little less cold than Pisagua, though we were a few hours further south, but maybe it was just the hot sun."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Warmer or no, it was bracing and I didn\u2019t last long. Sitting on my towel afterward, consciousness reset, letting the warmth come back into my body, that thing called \u201cbeach\u201d got through to me. It had been such a long time, all of Per\u00fa I suppose, where the combination of barren desert beaches, foggy weather and ice cold water made it hard to feel the festive aspect of sand and sea. But it was here in Iquique, and I found myself warming to the idea of staying in this city longer. Emily had said she wanted to leave the next day, after two nights, and I was thinking maybe I\u2019d just let her go. We were about to split up anyway. Take the time to rest some and swim each day; hang out with Julian and learn some Argentinian guitar playing. I was about to leave the coast and head across the continent, and wouldn\u2019t see an ocean again until Uruguay."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/6430/1*ZymbgkpTqp2w6_wQ5SPXsg.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When I got back to the hostel, Emily was in fact up for playing some music, and I was delighted that we\u2019d at least have one last hurrah. We took our time and went out after seven and a bit before sunset, just when the sea wind was coming in and finally cooling the day. We went to the beach promenade first. I got out my guitar and tuned up and we started playing some songs. The spot was beautiful, but there didn\u2019t seem to be much foot traffic, and those who would walk or run by paid us no attention. What I hadn\u2019t considered was that the noise of evening traffic on the avenue and the crashing of the waves would swallow up the sound of my acoustic guitar and our voices, so those passersby could barely hear us. After a few songs of playing into the wind the sun set behind us, we agreed to try the pedestrian street and packed up our show."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Since I\u2019d been at the Plaza in late afternoon, there was a whole concert set up with a stage and loud amplified music. Or maybe it had been there and I didn\u2019t notice it. But either way we weren\u2019t going to be playing acoustic music anywhere near that. So we walked back towards the ocean, realizing that most of the cafes and bars were playing their own recorded music on speakers, and there just wasn\u2019t a lot of aural space to work with. We eventually found a spot that was partly lit, and just far enough away from the bars on either side that we could barely get away with playing."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We did our thing, played the fifteen or so songs we know how to play together: some of mine but mostly covers, some in Spanish but mostly in English, and we weren\u2019t getting a lot of attention. A slow trickle of pesos coming in; every so often a person walking by would nod their head. It was okay \u2014 I was having fun playing with Emily and we have our own world together once we start making music. By far our biggest fans were the barkers at the adjacent bars. After a while they turned down their music a little bit, and started clapping after each song. Now we were feeling it a little more, and letting loose. The trickle of passersby and pesos had turned into a steady stream, and a few of them would stop and listen to half a song. We played songs we didn\u2019t really know, played the same songs a second time. The night was getting on but I didn\u2019t really want it to end."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The street was turning sleepy again, and at some point a guy came up to us saying he had a bar around the corner and would we come play a few songs there? This was better than what Julian had been talking about \u2014 we were actually being invited to play. I asked him where the bar was, unilaterally declared that we would come and he left. Emily was still unconvinced. We talked about the nature of asking for money as gringos down here and I would have let it go but we had just been asked to play at a bar in Chile and we weren\u2019t going to show up?! I stuck with it and she reluctantly agreed. We got our things together and walked in the direction he had pointed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It was a little confusing, but about a block and a half away, behind a parking garage, was a little restaurant painted in bright primary colors, a handful of people sitting out at scattered tables on a covered patio with bistro lights, music playing through speakers. I popped my head in the door and our guy was behind the bar, and he was serving some people, but saw me and enthusiastically gave a thumbs up. Afuera? I asked and pointed to the patio, and he nodded. M\u00fasica? and made the symbol of turning a volume knob, to which he also nodded, but gave me the two finger sign of \u201cin a minute\u201d."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I went back out to confer with Emily. She was not into it, but she was going to do it anyway. She said she\u2019d do two songs, and we agreed upon \u201cHome\u201d and \u201cFriend of the Devil\u201d which are probably our best, and I said I\u2019d do one solo to start. She went to the bathroom or the bar, and I said to the scattered tables, Buenas Noches, and sang \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice it\u2019s Alright\u201d a Bob Dylan song, to almost no reaction. By late in the song Emily had come back out, and we did our two songs and the crowd was slightly more responsive. A middle-aged couple stopped talking altogether and listened."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Walked around to each table with my hat in hand, and at all but one table someone gave at least something. I thanked the bartender and we went on our way and Emily was just happy that it was over. We hadn\u2019t counted our money but we had enough to buy something. It was time to celebrate so we walked towards the centro looking for something like a dive bar with food. On a corner after about six blocks we walked past a patio where who did we find but Julian, my patron saint of street music, singing a heartfelt folkloric ballad, red in the face, voice hoarse from too many nights at too many bars. I hadn\u2019t heard him play in public yet, so we had to go in and listen. We sat down at a table and he saw us and gave a sad smile and carried on to a disinterested audience."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While we listened we counted the money we\u2019d made in little piles and found we had more than seven thousand pesos, which sounds like a lot but is really only ten bucks. It was enough to get two big bottles of beer \u2014 Arequipe\u00f1as, in fact, a not particularly good beer from our Peruvian home \u2014 fries with cheese and a couple empanadas, and we ordered this from a waitress and felt like a success. After Julian had played a couple songs and walked around with the hat he came over to talk to us."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I told him proudly that we\u2019d played on the peotonal and had gotten invited into a bar, thinking he\u2019d be proud of us, but he seemed preoccupied and just talked about how frustrated he was. Mala noche. People here didn\u2019t appreciate music, and he wasn\u2019t feeling well, maybe he was getting sick. Mala comida, he said, holding his stomach, and said he was going home. We said we were sorry and hoped he felt better. He bid us buen provecho as our refreshments arrived and left into the night, saying maybe he would go to one more bar. We ate our fries and empanadas and drank our beer in little glasses and it was certainly worth chalking up in the small victories department."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "3"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Over our beers, Emily said she\u2019d decided she was ready to keep moving. We agreed that we could easily do another day and night in Iquique, but we both have a long way to go. Maybe it didn\u2019t help when I told her earlier that the map on the wall at the hostel made it look like we were closer to Lima than Santiago. She\u2019s going a lot further than Santiago. I had been considering just staying in Iquique and resting another day, but sometime when we were playing, I realized we\u2019d be leaving this city together. For the moment at least, we are a team, and as long as we\u2019re going the same direction, I should accompany her on the road."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Next she announced that we needed to leave the hostel at 7 am. Given that it was midnight, we were at a bar and had just bought liter beers to drink, we hadn\u2019t packed our bags or researched where we needed to go to even get in position to hitchhike, this seemed rather unrealistic, and I said so. She said, \u201cOkay, fine. Eight,\u201d with a stern look in her eye. We ended up smoking a joint out on the patio back at the hostel and talking for a long time about the state of the world with Matias, the thoughtful juggler from Buenos Aires. Sometime well after two I was sitting by myself on the ramshackle roof looking out at the dark ocean, listening to music in headphones."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My old friend Reid, who had helped me start this journey nineteen months ago, had sent me a new song that day, his first new music in ages, and asked for my feedback. It was this slow-building, moody synth track, and it seemed like a perfect activity for that moment. Feeling very peaceful, a mostly sleeping night city, listening over and over to this seven minute long brooding heartfelt contemplative song in the dark. By then I\u2019d pretty much decided that I didn\u2019t want to leave in the morning at all, certainly not in less than six hours time. I was just hoping Emily didn\u2019t still want to leave, and didn\u2019t make any final decisions."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At eight I woke up to the sounds of street traffic out front, and felt surprisingly decent enough that I figured we might as well try to go. Emily was still in deep sleep. After making a pot of tea, I woke her up, just to ask if she wanted to leave town that day. She mumbled something about a bad sunburn and rolled over, and I started putting my bags together. A few minutes later she woke up for real, and said \u201cokay, let\u2019s do this.\u201d By nine-thirty we had everything together, she\u2019d made a couple of sandwiches, and her mood seemed to be better than it had been in a couple days."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We slung on our bags, said goodbye to whoever was around \u2014 Julian had not appeared yet that day \u2014 and took our leave of the Hostal Sunset Beach. We crossed over to the opposite side of Avenida Arturo Prat, the main boulevard along the ocean, and after a little while caught a blue city bus. The driver said he wasn\u2019t going to Huayquique, the place I\u2019d identified as the southern edge of town, but he said he would point us to another bus that would. That one, a yellow bus, took us to the beginning of Ruta 1, the coastal highway heading south."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It felt like an achievement just to have gotten this far: out of the hostel and to the outskirts of the city. For some reason I had confidence we would get picked up, even though that hadn\u2019t happened once in our two previous days hitching.

We hopped in and it turned out he was from Per\u00fa, originally from Puno, then Tacna. He was unimpressed that I had been to both places, and didn\u2019t ask anything more."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Fifteen miles down the coast, he turned off at the sign for Verde, leaving the main highway. I don\u2019t think he understood that we weren\u2019t trying to go there, and even when I asked him to please leave us on the main highway he didn\u2019t really get it and kept on for half a mile. Finally he responded to our continued requests, seeming a little confused, and pulled over. We thanked him and then had to hoof it uphill with our bags a long way back to our road.
