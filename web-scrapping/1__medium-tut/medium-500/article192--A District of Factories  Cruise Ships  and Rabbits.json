These quarters are more of a recreation area with a picturesque partly-wild park and a lake. I left my apartment at 5 a.m. on Sunday, and it took me 20 minutes by train to reach the station Siemensdamm. The first nice building I saw was one of the old Siemens facilities \u2014 its dark-brick texture reminded \u201cOreo.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, I decided to visit the sleepy park Jungfernheide first \u2014 just before dog owners and joggers would invade it. And it was a damn good decision."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The name of the park Jungfernheide means something like \u201cthe heath of a young noblewoman.\u201d In the 19th century, this territory used to be a royal hunting ground, later for a short period, it was a ground for military maneuvers. Still, it sometimes looks more like an untouched forest rather than a \u201ccivilized\u201d park."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When I just entered, a fox stepped on the path in about ten meters. It looked at me for a while and started crossing the path very slowly, but once I tried to sneak the camera in my pocket \u2014 the fox disappeared. A few minutes later, I noticed a gang of fat-bottomed rabbits jumping across the lawn. And again, too fast for a shot. They suddenly dove behind a mossy stump, and I came closer to see how many holes they\u2019d dug here and there \u2014 almost the first world war trenches. Eventually, only a majestic heron joined me to greet the first rays of the rising sun."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Staring at the sun, I noticed an old water tower on the horizon. Although it seemed pretty close, I had to cross a kilometer-long lawn in front of it. Meanwhile, the sun rose, and the birds\u2019 singing got shouted down by the dogs\u2019 barking \u2014 local dwellers went for a walk."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Before leaving the park, I looked back through the locked gates of the bathing pavilion and spotted another authentic German thing \u2014 a clock even in the place where you are supposed to lose track of time."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/4338/1*b7bs00zo9hLrGjDgBfcFtw.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The UNESCO World Heritage settlement is right beside the park. It\u2019s neither an ornate gothic cathedral nor a prehistoric stone temple \u2014 not even a century old! Nonetheless, it belongs to so seriously protected sites. It appeared as a collaboration of the six greatest German architects, representatives of the Weimar-era modernism. The overall plan belongs to Hans Scharoun, whose more widely-known design, the Berlin Philharmonic, you might have seen before. Passing by the Philharmonic, I always imagine a golden-scaled dragon sitting on a rock, but in Siemenesstadt, his style is different."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My friend on Instagram wrote, \u201cThis is how you recognize Scharoun. I think he was raised by ships or something\u2026\u201d One of the most notable buildings in Siemenesstadt earned the nickname \u201cPanzerkreuzer\u201d (Armored Cruiser).

At some point, I even imagined dipping one of these cute buildings into a gigantic glass of milk."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In a couple of minutes, I approached Walter Gropius\u2019s work, and the impression of it turned out to be quite different. Strict monochrome forms by the founder of the Bauhaus School starkly contrasted with the \u201cgalettes.\u201d This geometry and minimalism might have influenced the inhabitants so that they don\u2019t expose so much household stuff on their balconies. Or maybe it\u2019s just because this building is facing the street."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/11000/1*NPLgEylzvZLfd95f9_W8CA.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Walking around the settlement, I ran into H\u00e4ring\u2019s brick warmness and Gropius\u2019s cold minimalism combined. The building by Fred Forbat inherited the best parts of both approaches \u2014 the \u201ccookies\u201d and the \u201cmilk.\u201d It might have been renovated recently, so squeaky clean the walls were. I suppose they seriously reconstructed everything around 2008 when the settlement got recognized by UNESCO."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Interestingly, overall modernist housing in Siemensstadt occupies much larger territory than the \u201cUNESCO\u201d section, and it\u2019s all worth gazing at, too. For example, some houses are bent like snakes and hover over the streets. Above each arc, there are creative tiles or scenes, which don\u2019t repeat twice. Some are large; others are tiny, practically invisible. My favorite one is a symbolic depiction of the four seasons."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Through the arches and across the Wilhelm von Siemens park, I moved to the gorgeous estate along Rapsstra\u00dfe and Rieppelstra\u00dfe. There is a memorial stone dedicated to Wilhelm von Siemens in the park \u2014 he is called the founder of Siemensstadt. Wilhelm von Siemens was a son of a world-renowned inventor, engineer, and businessman Werner von Siemens. The neighborhood Siemensstadt arose in 1899 when an electrical engineering company \u201cSiemens & Halske\u201d bought this territory and started building new factories out of brown and red brick. By the way, Siemens is the largest manufacturing company in Europe nowadays."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*dn0Y_QHxZCLOTz0gz19AMA.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But let\u2019s get back to architecture. The atmosphere of the next settlement happened to be different from both Scharoun\u2019s \u201cfleet\u201d or H\u00e4ring\u2019s \u201ccookies.\u201d This part consists of tile-roofed terraced townhouses and three-story blocks, which seem pretty rural."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To me, these cute houses are the most amazing in the dawn when the sun starts warming the pastel-colored walls. A distinctive feature of the settlement is the doors framed with white ladders, not to mention adorable green and blue shutters on the windows.

She holds a bowl with water and is accompanied by a deer, squirrel, and birds. As for the house behind, it\u2019s elegantly decorated with red rustic compositions."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Suddenly, I smelled the fresh pastries from a bakery on the corner. If you walk here early in the morning, don\u2019t forget to enjoy a crusty bun, French-style croissant, or cinnamon snail."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I could wander around this settlement forever. It felt like being inside of a hyperrealistic diorama of an ancient fortified town with stone walls and gates.

Well, yes, another tower and, of course, with a clock. But unlike other Siemens buildings equipped with a large tick-tock, this one is probably the most recognizable. And this eagle on a column is the Monument to the Fallen Siemens Workers, commemorating those who died in both world wars. The stone cubes hold the war years, and around three thousand Siemens employees\u2019 names are engraved on the panels surrounding the square."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I should have finished the story because we\u2019ve discovered a lot: a beautiful sunrise, graceful geometry, and even a fairy tale mood.

Here you go, my friends, \u201cIf you see houses like ships, it\u2019s Scharoun; if you want to find Hans Scharoun, search for the ships.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It turned out that in deck-balconies and porthole-windows were not enough, and Scharoun started playing with the layout.
