Both of these, along with hundreds of other Paleolithic-era figurines, were found in areas spanning from southwestern France all the way to Siberia."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Virtually every figurine that\u2019s been found from this time period is female, and many archeologists believe them to be some of the earliest indications of our ancestors\u2019 spiritual practices. In other words, we were quite likely a culture that honored the feminine as sacred long before our male gods came roaring onto the scene."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In my imaginings, I contemplated what the air smelled like in these places. I wondered, too, about the intentions of our ancestors who created these artifacts, and if those dreams and ideas were somehow captured and held within these pieces of stone or the land itself."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/12032/1*KWH73vjuyW7ZvUjJdoPymg.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Three years ago, my dream became a reality. My husband and I, along with our two small children, spent a summer traveling throughout Europe, visiting historical sites connected to ancient Goddess worship. The trip was amazing. I saw the ancient limestone cliffs and cave dwellings of the Dordogne. I saw beautiful Goddess artifacts from the Minoan culture in the Heraklion Museum of Archeology on the island of Crete. I spent a quiet afternoon in the Chalice Well and Gardens in Glastonbury, England, a popular pilgrimage spot for modern Goddess seekers. In Switzerland, I visited the Black Madonna of Einsiedeln, one of many statues of a dark-skinned Virgin Mary thought to have connections to an ancient Earth Mother."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It was the trip of a lifetime. But after two months on the road, I learned an important lesson: The Sacred Feminine is not confined to a particular statue or artifact. Yes, visiting official sites connected to her was life-changing, but so was the entire trip."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Watching my kids splash in the Libyan Sea off the southern coast of Crete, hearing the gentle clanking of cowbells ringing through the Swiss Alps, taking in the rolling green hills of the English countryside as they slid past my car window: I was reminded again and again that she is always with us. I began to understand that, as amazing as it was, I didn\u2019t really need to take an international trip to find her."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/4896/1*HTV7QX3IKACgG7RcEWRegQ.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My exploration of ancient Goddess cultures through books has taught me the same lesson. In prepatriarchal spiritual traditions, our ancestors didn\u2019t necessarily view our creator as something that exists apart from ourselves. Instead, divinity was very much alive and well in everything that exists within our world. And that includes each of us\u2014just as we are."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We are not so much made in the image of the divine as we are a living expression of the divine in human form."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Before I took my trip, I thought of the Sacred Feminine as a beautiful spiritual idea lost to, or at least obscured by, history\u2014in part because of the rise of dominant patriarchal religions. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me that I should be looking within myself to find her."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After all, how many of us really think of ourselves as sacred? There\u2019s a good reason we don\u2019t. We are thoroughly immersed in a culture that doesn\u2019t place value on ordinary lives and experiences, and this is especially true of women."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If the Sacred Feminine lives within all things, including us, then perhaps the best way to connect with divinity is by undertaking an inner pilgrimage to recover our own sacred nature. For me, that\u2019s meant being willing to seek out and reclaim the lost parts of myself that I\u2019ve tried to reject or deny. And, honestly, coordinating two months of travel logistics in foreign countries with small children is an easier task."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As women, we\u2019re exceptionally good at slicing ourselves up and discarding the pieces that don\u2019t meet the standards imposed by a culture that does not value us as our complete and messy selves. I could be speaking literally here \u2014 plastic surgery is an $8 billion industry, with women electing to receive the majority of procedures \u2014 but I\u2019m also speaking figuratively. What are the pieces of yourself that you\u2019ve discarded from your own life?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There are so many pieces of me I\u2019ve tried to throw away that I\u2019ve almost lost count. There\u2019s the part whose rage was legendary in my family, even at a young age. Or the part that once wore tiny skirts, sported an always-exposed navel ring, and loved attracting the attention of men, especially older ones. There\u2019s the part of me that is often exhausted by the needs of my children, and the part that is dying to let my freak flag fly as high and freely as it can\u2014 and the fear, still, over what others will think."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At one point or another I\u2019ve discarded all these pieces of me, trying to forget about their existence, convinced that I cannot be good or smart or a responsible mother if I hold on to them. But who gets to decide which parts of us are sacred and which are not?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In The Myth of the Goddess, Anne Baring and Jules Cashford note that our Paleolithic ancestors were deeply connected to the cycles of the moon. They suggest that the fourth phase, the new moon and darkness, is in fact where all life is gestated and where the new moon is \u201creborn\u201d each month. This darkness \u2014 that of the Sacred Mother who gives birth to all \u2014 transcends duality. It contains everything: the light and the dark, the beautiful and the ugly, the living and the dead."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For our Paleolithic ancestors, \u201cEverything that existed, including themselves, was an expression of the Mother Goddess,\u201d write Baring and Cashford. And all of it was sacred. Every single part."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Maybe the most important sacred journey we can take, then, begins right here, and requires that we look no further than ourselves. To imagine the Sacred Feminine as an integral part of our world, we must experience a full awakening of ourselves as sacred. We must learn to treat the individual parts of ourselves as holy, especially those we\u2019ve denied most often. We must make pilgrimages to each, dusting them off, understanding the memories that accompany them and why we discarded them in the first place."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is not easy work. It will not be simple, and it will not be swift. But if we\u2019re willing to taken on the task, our lives become pilgrimages of their own."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Maybe, over time, we can approach these parts of ourselves with reverence and wonder and gratitude. And each time we reclaim a piece of ourselves, each time we love it not despite its flaws but precisely because of its imperfections, its aching humanity, we breathe more life into a great awakening of our entire selves as sacred, exactly where and as we are."}], "topic": "travel"}
