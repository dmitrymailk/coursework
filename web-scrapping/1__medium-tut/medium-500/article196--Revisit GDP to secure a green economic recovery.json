They will probably be able to tell you that economic growth is important, recessions are bad, and they are likely to have heard of Gross Domestic Product, or GDP."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The economy consistently ranks among the top issues for voters, even if it is a somewhat nebulous concept. For example, according to YouGov polling, it was the second most important issue in the 2017 UK election and the third most important in 2019 (excluding Brexit). In practice, voters are likely to view \u2018the economy\u2019 as shorthand for career opportunities and financial security. In a similar vein, GDP is viewed as shorthand for the economy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "GDP represents the total market value of a nation\u2019s final goods and services produced over a defined period. Simon Kuznets developed the concept of GDP for a US Congress report in 1934 and it has been widely used as the go-to tool for measuring the economy for decades. Kuznets, however, warned that the measure is an oversimplification with significant limitations and should not be used as a measure of economic well-being. His caveats have not stopped leaders using it for that very purpose."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Politicians are fixated on GDP, because they know it is important to voters. In turn, the media and public focus on GDP, because it is so widely adopted and seems important \u2014 in part, GDP is famous for being famous."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When GDP is growing, politicians brandish their sound economic management credentials; when it isn\u2019t, they chalk it up to external factors outside their control. Currently, we\u2019re in the latter state."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While the measures taken to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic have saved millions of lives, they have come at considerable economic cost. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF\u2019s) April outlook report projects a 3% contraction in GDP over 2020, with advanced economies to be hit harder. If the projection bears out \u2014 or turns out to be understated \u2014 it would be the sharpest contraction since the Great Depression of the 1930s."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For now, the public\u2019s focus is on suppressing the virus and minimising deaths \u2014 rightly so. Leaders of countries with effective responses have seen a boost in their approval ratings. However, there will inevitably come a time when the public shifts their attention to the state of the economy. When that happens, citizens of poorly performing economies are likely to punish their leaders."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Leaders are understandably nervous and will do everything they can to achieve a quick \u2018V\u2019 shaped recovery. In all likelihood though, the recovery will be drawn out and is highly dependent on how quickly \u2014 or indeed whether \u2014 an effective vaccine can be developed and rolled out. In April 2020, The Economist magazine, presented the concept of the \u201890% economy\u2019 \u2014 an \u2018almost, but not quite\u2019 world where continued social distancing measures and residual anxiety prevent a speedy full recovery. Such a situation would inevitably result in a range of additional significant stimulus measures being deployed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Preempting the reaction of governments, several think tanks have called for a \u2018green recovery\u2019, where stimulus measures are focused on transitioning to a low-carbon economy and addressing biodiversity loss. There has been a groundswell of support for this concept. In May, over 150 global corporations worth over US$2.5 trillion signed a statement urging governments to align their recovery packages with the latest climate science."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A green recovery makes a lot of sense \u2014 it would ensure stimulus funds are used to tackle the current crisis as well as the longer-term climate and biodiversity crises. However, just because the concept is logical, advocates should not assume it will happen naturally \u2014 they will need to fight hard. Governments are more likely to default to the quickest and easiest way to restore GDP, which could involve relaxing environmental standards and further entrenching fossils fuels in the economy, as has happened after previous economic shocks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The myopic focus on GDP by governments, central banks and the media alike, will not help. The environment is poorly represented by GDP. Looking at green stimulus options through the lens of traditional GDP, will therefore not cast these measures in a flattering light \u2014 other measures may appear quicker and more effective by comparison."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In order to improve the chances of a successful green recovery, nature and sustainability should be embedded in economic metrics. Doing so will give policymakers greater confidence to adopt green stimulus measures, as they will be better positioned to reap the benefits."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The problem with GDP"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "GDP serves a purpose. It is widely adopted and easily communicated, partly because it manages to summarise something as complex as the economy into a single number. It has significant limitations, however, and so politicians should not rely on it too heavily to measure economic well-being and set policy \u2014 not that this stops them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This article focuses on the limitation that GDP does not value the environment nor penalise its destruction. GDP is a flow metric (e.g. a revenue item), rather than a stock metric (e.g. value), so it reflects goods and services extracted from the nature, but does not allow for any associated adverse impact on the environment."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For example, unsustainable extraction of resources, such as over-fishing, will have a positive impact on GDP in the short term, yet no adjustment is made for the associated environmental degradation. Often, by the time GDP suffers as a result of severe degradation, it is too late to change course."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Similarly, GDP does not allow for the adverse impacts of pollution and climate change. Perversely, environmental disasters, like a major oil spill, typically improve GDP, due to the activity generated by the clean-up effort."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Rutger Bergman, author of Utopia for Realists, sums up the issue well: \u201cEnvironmental pollution even does double duty: One company makes a mint by cutting corners while another is paid to clean up the mess.

But most deny its worth\u2026 Economists assume that nature is a fixed, indestructible capital asset\u2026 The problem with the notion that nature is indestructible is this: it is wrong. Once economists accept that they are mistaken on this count, it could revolutionize the way in which we calculate economic progress.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Dasgupta goes on to provide historical examples of how the depreciation of nature has led to adverse economic consequences in the long run.

He creates an adjusted GDP metric, which takes into account the depletion of fish stocks via a negative depreciation adjustment. Any income generated by excess fishing is offset by depreciation of the value of the fish stock. Further, persistent over-fishing reduces adjusted GDP over time, as the starting value of the fish stock diminishes each year (i.e. a compounding effect). The chart below illustrates the adjusted GDP metric. Under this metric, the Sven\u2019s error would have become apparent far sooner."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1516/1*Qug_SKkQkl8p-FsEPpflow.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u2018Sorry Dad, but it was a red herring.

However, sadly, it is not completely detached from reality. According to the UN FAO, like Sven, we are over-fishing 30% of fish stocks and a further 60% are fished at the maximum sustainable level. And the problem doesn\u2019t stop there."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Whilst global GDP has more than quadrupled[1] since 1970, nature has suffered immensely. The population of wild vertebrate species has declined by 60% since 1970, primarily as a result of habitat destruction. The rate of extinction in recent decades is as high as 1,000 times the natural background rate.

The value of these services can be estimated by determining the cost of replacing them. For example, what would it cost to pollinate crops if the bee and insect population collapses? What would it cost to desalinate water if freshwater systems breakdown or are squandered?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A seminal paper by Costanza et al. in 1997, attempted to put a value on benefits provided by the world\u2019s ecosystems.

Significant progress has been made, particularly since the late 1990s. A number of prominent economists have devised robust methodologies and have proposed ways of adjusting GDP or alternative metrics. An international framework for environmental accounting is in place \u2014 called the UN System of Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) \u2014 although reporting is piecemeal, obscure and the degree of implementation varies widely across countries."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Despite the wealth of research and sound basis for the concept of an adjusted GDP, such a metric is yet to achieve widespread adoption. Perhaps it is because leaders do not like the results."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "China, under the leadership of Hu Jintao, embarked on a project to measure performance against a Green GDP metric, which was adjusted to reflect the cost of pollution. The first results based on 2004 data were published in 2006 and showed a cost of pollution of 3.05% of GDP. Although this estimate is lower than most independent estimates, people still baulked at the figure and by 2007, Green GDP was quietly dragged into the shadows and put to rest."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At the 2012 Earth Summit (also known as Rio+20), a new metric was launched called the Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI). Inclusive Wealth is defined as the total value of a nation\u2019s stock of: natural capital; produced capital (e.g. infrastructure, buildings, equipment); and human capital (e.g. knowledge, education, skills). Changes in IWI provide a more complete and sustainable view of a nation\u2019s progress over time."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The 2018 Inclusive Wealth Report found that 44 out of 140 countries have experienced a decline in inclusive wealth per capita since 1992 despite almost all recording positive GDP growth per capita.

While the IWI has the potential to be a powerful tool for policymakers, it has not received the attention it deserves."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There have been some positive signs that countries are warming to the idea of placing greater emphasis on economic metrics that incorporate nature. In 2019, HM Treasury in the UK commissioned Dasgupta \u2014 the critical economics professor mentioned earlier \u2014 to perform a review of the economics of biodiversity. The review will explore the interaction of humans with nature, the economic costs of biodiversity loss, and ways to simultaneously enhance biodiversity and economic prosperity."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In April 2020, the Dasgupta Review interim report was released, which sets out a framework for assessing the economics of biodiversity. It is well worth a read. The report emphasises the importance of nature to the economy and advocates the use of Inclusive Wealth as a measure of sustainable growth."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The interim report highlights that a central weakness of GDP is that it does not allow for the depreciation of capital. Dasgupta proposes an adjusted metric called Net Domestic Product (NDP), which equates to GDP less depreciation of natural capital, produced capital and human capital.

Importantly, an adjusted metric would better reflect the benefits of green stimulus measures, thus improving the chance of the green recovery succeeding."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To stick with traditional GDP is to continue to measure economic progress on a basis that is unsustainable. Further, it will put politicians in a bind. When faced with immense and growing pressure to restore economic growth, leaders are likely to forget the warm and fuzzy sentiment around a green recovery.
