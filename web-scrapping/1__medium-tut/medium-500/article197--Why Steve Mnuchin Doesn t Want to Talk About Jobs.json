I absorb tons of political and economic information, although my trading days are behind me, much like a retired drill sergeant that still rises at the crack of dawn even though he has no troops under his command."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Mnuchin said something in his testimony that jumped out and hit me right between the eyes.

This question from Senator Brown made headlines:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sure, the question was sort of hyperbolic, but I get the senator\u2019s point. To me, what came next was more important, although this part of their Q&A got less attention:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Mnuchin was evasive when asked if corporations could receive government funds, then lay off workers down the road.

Some people call it a Pickle situation. Nearly every time I\u2019ve seen this, the runner gets tagged out. I have no idea of the statistics, but my guess is maybe 3 out of every 10 runners are lucky enough to make it to a base."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As far as the GOP is concerned, business \u2014 big business, in particular \u2014 is the economy. They think business drives the economy, not people. To them corporations are the automobile, CEOs drive the car, and employees are the replacement parts."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That is why they are fine with opening a meatpacking facility filled with folks working elbow to elbow, in a toxic soup of sickness.
