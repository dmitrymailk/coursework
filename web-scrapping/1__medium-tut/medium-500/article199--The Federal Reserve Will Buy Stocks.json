{"title": "The Federal Reserve Will Buy Stocks", "data": [{"type": "subtitle", "content": "If the Fed will do anything to keep the \u201cEverything Bubble\u201d from bursting, the next step is to buy stocks"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The Federal Reserve is in deep trouble. They have thrown everything, even the kitchen sink, at financial markets, propping up all the risky, speculative asset classes: stocks, corporate bonds, auto loans, mortgages, anything close to defaulting while the economy remains shuttered."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So when the stimulus inevitably wears off and asset prices continue to fall, the Fed will have exhausted their \u201cconventional\u201d toolbox: Fed officials have already dropped interest rates to zero, created an array of alphabet soup \u201casset relief\u201d programs with exotic names like CPFF (Commercial Paper Funding Facility) and TALF (Term Asset\u2010Backed Securities Loan Facility), and executed yet another round of QE (quantitative easing)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Though these actions support asset prices, printing trillions of dollars annihilates the purchasing power of savers while rewarding yield-thirsty investors that take high risks for high returns. But that\u2019s the aim: the latest administration wants you to buy stocks, not to save money. It\u2019s their way of saying you\u2019re doing your part to support the economic expansion."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The \u201clast hope\u201d for the Fed to entice investors is a promise to buy stocks. If the stock market bubble starts to implode \u2014 and it will because it always does \u2014 the Fed\u2019s final pump, their \u201cfull Kuroda,\u201d will be to acquire various stock ETFs such as $SPY, $QQQ, and $DIA, exchange-traded funds tracking the major stock market averages."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The Fed has a history of implementing policies they condemn initially. They will denounce buying stocks as a realistic policy, performing an immediate 180 when stocks begin to plunge. If the central bank\u2019s mission is to sustain confidence in a flawed system \u2014 inflation over deflation, subsidizing laziness, and punishing productivity \u2014 officials will say anything to get the job done. In 2006 it was \u201csubprime contained\u201d from Ben Bernanke. In 2015 it was \u201cI don\u2019t see a financial crisis occurring in our lifetime\u201d from Janet Yellen. In 2019 it was the \u201crepo crisis is contained\u201d from Jerome Powell. As a rule of thumb, if Fed officials say it won\u2019t happen, it will eventually."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The Fed, however, is not the first major central bank to buy stocks: The Bank of Japan (BOJ) started buying ETFs back in 2010. But they haven\u2019t just dabbled: Recently, Governor Kuroda added ETF purchases within a huge stimulus package to \u201csupport the Japanese economy.\u201d At the end of February 2020, NLI Research\u2019s Ide estimated the BOJ owned 75% of the ETF market. That\u2019s 29.6 trillion yen, roughly 4% of the Japanese stock market according to WisdomTree\u2019s Koll."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As you might expect, buying ETFs has failed to support stock prices. The BOJ cannot fend off the economic stagflation that\u2019s been plaguing the Japanese economy for decades. At this stage, Japan\u2019s government might as well give the money they print directly to citizens as it\u2019s more likely to hold its value there than in the Nikkei: Japan\u2019s main stock exchange."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The Fed knows ETF purchases fail to support asset prices, but they will buy them anyway. They believe investors and trading algorithms hooked on cheap money and stimulus will beg for more, pumping the markets higher, adding a few points to major indices. But that\u2019s all. The markets will plunge, submitting to economic gravity once again. Unless, of course, the economy recovers miraculously from the biggest economic crisis in a century."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If buying ETFs is the \u201clast hope\u201d for the Fed to keep stock prices high, it\u2019s crazy to think the stock market will perform well in the distant future. After all, hope is an absurd reason to invest in anything. Expecting any asset class to skyrocket in value by the time you retire \u2014 whether that's gold rising to $5,000, house prices climbing 300%, or the S&P500 rallying to 10,000 \u2014 is crazy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When the Fed faces the reality that buying stocks fails to hold up prices, their next move that \u201cno one saw coming\u201d will be to impose negative interest rates: the final frontier of flawed economic policy. Of course, the evidence shows going below the zero bound has adverse effects. Countries like Germany, Switzerland, and Japan have reached subzero levels with no benefit. Still, we\u2019ll go through the same farcical parody: The market will rally on \u201chope\u201d until everyone figures out negative rates destroy future growth."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has denied that the U.S will experience negative rates which means they are a certainty, \u201cI continue to think, and my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee continue to think, that negative interest rates are probably not an appropriate or useful policy for us here in the United States,\u201d he says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But like Powell announcing that the central bank will buy ETFs, no one in the government, in the media, or within the Federal Reserve itself will tell you they saw it coming."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Want more analysis and ideas?
