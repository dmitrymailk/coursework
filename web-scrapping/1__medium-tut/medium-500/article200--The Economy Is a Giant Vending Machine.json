We spend money into the machine, and it produces goods and services for us to consume. But the economy won\u2019t sell us what we lack the money to buy. Instead, those delicious goods and services will remain inaccessible, staring at us from behind their glass pane. To prevent this outcome, the economy needs a way to ensure that we all have money to spend."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Basic Income"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Also known as universal basic income, or UBI for short, basic income is an unconditional income for every person. It solves the problem of how to get money into the hands of consumers so they can buy things from the vending machine."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While this is not the only definition of \u201cbasic income,\u201d it is the usual one. According to this definition, there is no such thing as a non-universal or non-unconditional basic income. Basic income goes equally to everyone \u2014 to all adults in the economy. The terms \u201cbasic income,\u201d \u201cuniversal basic income,\u201d and \u201cunconditional basic income\u201d all describe the same concept."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s worth emphasizing that basic income does not have to be an amount of money that meets people\u2019s basic needs. Such an amount may be both desirable and achievable, but it is not part of the definition. Basic income is \u201cbasic\u201d only in the sense that everyone gets it. The income itself is basic \u2014 not what it buys."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "People tend to make assumptions about what the amount of the basic income should be, or about what kinds of taxes or other policies would best go along with a basic income. Not everyone is careful about separating their desired parameters for basic income from the concept of basic income itself. This lack of precision can make basic income seem more complicated than it is."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So let\u2019s get back to the basics of basic income. Basic income is just the same amount of free money for everyone. The amount could be small, or it could be substantial."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You don\u2019t have to need the money. You don\u2019t have to prove that something is preventing you from working. You just get it \u2014 even if you have a job or another source of income.

The answer is simple. There\u2019s only one way to pay for it: by printing new money."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This assertion is less controversial than you might expect. Any time the government spends, they\u2019re printing money. They are printing money in the sense that they\u2019re adding money to a part of the economy that wouldn\u2019t otherwise have that money."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Government spending adds new money to the economy regardless of whether taxation happens to be removing money from another part of the economy at the same time. Taking away money from one part of the economy doesn\u2019t automatically make room for new money to another part of the economy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For the government\u2019s money to be able to buy something, the economy has to have something it wants to sell. For basic income to buy goods and services, those goods and services have to be available for purchase \u2014 there has to be something in the vending machine."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Natural Level of Basic Income"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The right question to ask isn\u2019t: Can we afford a basic income? The right question is: What\u2019s the optimal level of basic income for our economy? How much basic income can our economy handle without causing inflation or other problems? To what extent will various taxes and other economic policies increase or decrease that amount?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "On its own, the concept of basic income is simple. It\u2019s free money for everyone. But it can be hard for us to wrap our heads around how a simple basic income fits into our complicated economy. The good news is that basic income simplifies our economy for us. Much of our economy\u2019s complexity stems from a lack of basic income. So, let\u2019s explore how the economy works with a basic income. We can then work backward to understand the real world."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In this simple economy, people put money into the economic vending machine. The candy bars it spits out for them to consume are the economy\u2019s products. To ensure consumers can buy all the candy bars, we provide them with a limited daily allowance of money to spend. That\u2019s our basic income."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s say the vending machine restocks itself every morning, but it\u2019s only able to fit so many candy bars. In other words, our economy has limited resources; it only has the capacity to produce so many goods and services. If the amount of the basic income is too low, candy bars will remain unclaimed in the machine at the end of every day. If the amount is too high, then there will be a shortage of candy bars. Consumers will have extra money left over that they wanted to spend."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There\u2019s exactly one level of basic income that allows consumers to claim the machine\u2019s full contents every day without also causing a shortage \u2014 exactly one amount that allows consumers to buy all the goods and services the economy can produce for them. This sweet spot is the natural level of basic income for our vending-machine economy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "No amount of putting money into the machine is going to get consumers more candy bars than there physically are in the machine."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Real Purchasing Power"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If the average price of the vending machine\u2019s candy bars changes, then the natural level of basic income changes along with it. For example, if prices double, then people need twice the money. The natural level of basic income doubles."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Any given amount of basic income corresponds to a specific price level at which it is the natural level of basic income. If the basic income doesn\u2019t match the general price level, we can adjust some combination of both to correct the difference. Let\u2019s say that consumers receive enough basic income to buy all the candy bars twice over. We can bring the basic income to its natural level either by doubling the price of candy bars or by cutting the basic income in half."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When basic income is at its natural level, the number of candy bars in the vending machine is the only thing that determines how many candy bars consumers can purchase \u2014 the economy\u2019s productive capacity determines what people can buy. Irrespective of the general price level, the natural level of basic income claims the same amount of goods and services \u2014 it represents the same amount of real purchasing power."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In our vending-machine economy, when we think about what a dollar is worth, we\u2019re thinking in terms of how many candy bars it can buy. A stable dollar implies that the average price of candy bars doesn\u2019t change. The price of a Snickers bar might go up, but it will never be the case that all the prices in the vending machine rise at the same time. There\u2019s neither inflation nor deflation."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A stable dollar is ideal; it gives us an intuitive standard against which to measure the prices of everything else. Only by understanding that ideal, can we grasp the implications of deviating from it. In our vending-machine economy, a stable dollar means the average price of a candy bar can\u2019t change. Inflation is always zero."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Of course, we can only legitimately assume away inflation if we also require the conditions that are necessary to maintain zero inflation. By disallowing inflation, we force ourselves to disallow the causes of inflation. To do anything else would be cheating."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For example, let\u2019s say that the vending machine will automatically adjust its prices to sell all of its candy bars every day at the highest prices possible. A basic income higher than the natural level would cause inflation. A basic income lower than the natural level would cause deflation. There\u2019s only one level of basic income that\u2019s even possible: the natural level of basic income. If the basic income were at any other level, the machine would automatically change its price level \u2014 and that\u2019s not allowed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At the natural level of basic income, the average price of goods and services remains constant.

The economy\u2019s capacity to produce goods and services has expanded. Not only can we increase the basic income, but we must increase the basic income to bring it to its new natural level."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Because inflation and deflation are forbidden, the flow of consumer spending must continue to match the flow of economic output. If the economy can produce more goods and services for consumers, then consumers must spend more money to purchase those additional goods and services."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A change in the flow of candy bars implies a corresponding change in the flow of dollars. The flow of dollars and the flow of candy bars must remain equal and opposite. This balance must maintain itself whether the economy is growing, shrinking, or staying the same size."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Jobs and Labor"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So far, our vending machine takes no inputs. It only produces output. It magically restocks itself every morning, and nobody has to do anything. Our economy\u2019s money only flows only in one direction: from consumers\u2019 pockets into the vending machine. Goods and services flow in the opposite direction: from the machine to consumers."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s instead imagine that the machine requires some labor input to produce its candy bars. Before, people were just consumers. They were beneficiaries of the economic machine. But now we need at least some people to contribute their labor as workers \u2014 to act as inputs to the production process."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We can ensure that people contribute labor by withholding some of their basic income. We thereby create an incentive for people to earn their money back through jobs. Some people might choose to do the work while others happily accept the lower level of basic income. What matters is that the right total amount of labor is being contributed to fully restock the vending machine every morning."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The consumers who work can now buy more candy bars than the others. But that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s the reward that motivates them to operate the vending machine for the benefit of everyone."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Given that our real-world economy requires labor, the natural level of basic income is the level that\u2019s low enough to activate enough labor to stock the vending machine but high enough to ensure that consumers can still buy all the candy bars."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Consumers vs. Workers"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As the economy\u2019s need for labor decreases, we can withhold less and less money from consumers. To put it another way, automation of production causes our economy\u2019s natural level of basic income to rise. The less we have to work, the richer we can be. The less we have to be workers, the more leisure we can enjoy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Workers are just inputs to the economic machine. When we create an identity around labor, we\u2019re treating people as mere inputs. But people are more than just inputs. The economy is here to serve us, not the other way around. What matters is what we can get out of the machine. The people\u2019s needs come first. Everything else is secondary."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The economy exists for the benefit of the people. The most crucial role that people play in the economy the role of \u201cconsumer,\u201d not \u201cworker.\u201d Being consumers just means we\u2019re receiving benefit from the economy. We\u2019re here to eat the candy bars, not to toil away."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "People need to participate in the making of the candy bars only to the extent that the candy bars wouldn\u2019t otherwise get made. We need to reward workers only to the extent that it gives them an incentive to contribute useful labor."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Money Accumulates"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The government prints the money, and consumers spend it into the vending machine. But where does that money go? If we want, we can try to tell a story in which the vending machine pays its workers using money that came from the sale of candy bars. But, unless the natural level of basic income is zero, there\u2019s still a gap. Consumers spend more money on candy bars than workers receive in wages. Where does the rest of the money go?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The answer is simple: Money accumulates \u2014 it doesn\u2019t just keep circulating forever. Just because some people happen to be both producers and consumers, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that money flows from consumers to producers while goods and services flow in the opposite direction. Producers are happy to accumulate money because they like getting rich. Meanwhile, the basic income must continually replenish consumers\u2019 spending money."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If we pull back the curtain and look inside the vending machine, we see that it\u2019s made up of a lot of different parts working together. It\u2019s the workers and their labor. It\u2019s the capitalists and their equipment. It\u2019s the resources and materials. It\u2019s the various automated production processes. All of these factors churn away to produce goods and services for our economy\u2019s consumers."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The real-world economy is more like our giant vending machine than it is like a meritocratic system in which everyone gets out what they put in. An efficient economy does not pay workers based on some calculation of the \u201cvalue\u201d they contribute. It just pays them enough to get them to do the work."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As long as producers want to accumulate money, consumers can keep buying their products.

Does this mean that our economy\u2019s natural level of basic income is zero? No. Instead, we try to compensate for our lack of basic income in other, less efficient, less effective ways. Rather than fund consumers directly, we use a combination of the financial sector and the labor market to funnel money to consumers."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "No small number of economists are hard at work studying how to bring the economy to full employment. But what these economists are forgetting is that full employment is not the same thing as full output.

Full employment just means we\u2019re keeping everyone busy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This problem has become all the more obvious in the Covid-19 crisis during which we explicitly want people to stay home from work. But because we never questioned the idea that people should depend on jobs for income, we have taken measures to protect those jobs and \u201cstimulate\u201d the economy, including something called the \u201cPaycheck Protection Program.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In an efficient labor market, jobs only exist because we want the product of the labor and the only purpose of wages is to provide an incentive for people to perform that labor.
