A president who calls the death toll a \u201cbadge of honor.\u201d A paralysed Congress. 40 million unemployed. Today, I often get the question, \u201cWhy are you negative, Umair?\u201d or, \u201cWhat can be done to fix all this?\u201d These are really the same question, and my answer, which you probably won\u2019t like, goes like this: we\u2019re still underestimating American collapse."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The economics of American collapse say that it\u2019s probably too late to fix America. It\u2019s probable that this is the new normal. Chaos, decline, incompetence, malice, poverty, hopelessness, despair."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let me explain, as clearly as I can."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You can see, right about now, that America is what political scientists call a failed state. A President who tells people to drink bleach during a pandemic. 90,000 dead, of which 90% are needless. A society that\u2019s not able to provide basics for it\u2019s citizens anymore. A nation in which income, savings, life expectancy, happiness, trust are all in free-fall. This is the stuff of epic social collapse."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now, the reason that America collapsed is straightforward. Americans never invested in building expansive social systems, unlike Europe. Systems to provide healthcare, retirement, childcare, finance, and so forth."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The result has been twofold. One, the average American now goes without these things. That\u2019s because they\u2019re largely unavailable. For example, the fresh food that I can get on any block in Europe is simply absent in huge chunks of the States. You buy processed food, or you don\u2019t get food. The same is true of many, many things, like, say, education, or income. You don\u2019t have a job with guarantees and protections like in Canada or Europe. You have a lower quality \u2014 not just quantity \u2014 of income."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Two, the the average American pays prices that the rest of the world considers absolutely absurd \u2014 because they are \u2014 for the very same things. Having a child? That\u2019ll be $50K, thank you. An operation? That\u2019ll be more than a house. Want to educate a kid? There go your life savings. Want a few fresh apples? That\u2019ll be ten times the price Canadians or Europeans pay. These things \u2014 the basics of life \u2014 are eminently affordable in the rest of the rich world. In America, though, they cost more than the average person can afford."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "How do I know that? Because the average American now dies in debt. Their whole life is one long sequence of unpayable debts now. First, there\u2019s \u201clunch debt\u201d which becomes \u201cstudent debt\u201d which becomes a mortgage and credit card debt which becomes \u201cmedical debt.\u201d The forms of debt in quotes don\u2019t even exist in most other rich countries. In America, though, they define life \u2014 precisely because the average American is now a poor person, in the sense that they can\u2019t make ends meet when it comes to paying for the basics of life."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sure, they might have a big car and big house and a big gun. But the economic truth is this: all those things are had on debt, and the average American now lives like an impoverished person. No savings, no assets, no liquidity. 80% \u2014 eighty percent \u2014 of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, struggle to pay basic bills, and can\u2019t raise say $500 for an emergency. Those are the statistics of a nation having descended into poverty."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now. I don\u2019t write all that to make some theoretical point, so let\u2019s come back to the question. Can America save itself from collapse? If you really understand the numbers, then the answer above \u2014 sadly \u2014 is: probably not. The economics say that America has more or less almost certainly reached a point of no return now, and collapse is nearly inevitable."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To stop collapse, America would have to start investing \u2014 massively, suddenly, historically \u2014 in functioning systems. To stop longevity and health cratering, it needs a healthcare system. To stop happiness and trust cratering, it needs affordable education and retirement. To stop incomes and savings plummeting, it needs retirement systems and protections for workers. And so forth. Every single facet of American collapse requires massive, large-scale, sustained public investment to be turned around, that goes on for a decade or more."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Many Americans even support that much. They get, by now, that without a new social contract, America is finished. Sure, the American Idiot \u2014 Trump and his army of bleach-drinking morons \u2014 don\u2019t. But maybe the average American does \u2014 sure, let\u2019s allow that much. The tragic wrinkle is that it makes no difference. Even if the majority of Americans want a better America \u2014 is it too late to actually build one? Probably."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Why? Well, who\u2019s going to pay for it? Remember those dismal statistics above? The average American lives like a poor person now? So who exactly is going to pay for all these expansive new systems? The average person simply can\u2019t afford the very improvements to society that they need anymore. Bang! What happens then? The answer is: nothing does. More of this does: a slow, shocking collapse and descent. Because there\u2019s no other option, choice, alternative. Nobody much has the money for one. You see, if I say to the average American \u2014 \u201clet\u2019s fix America. All you have to do is pay ten percent more in taxes, and you\u2019ll have world-class healthcare, retirement, childcare, and so on\u201d \u2014 they might even support it, whole-heartedly. They might genuinely want it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But the economic truth is that they cannot afford it. That ten percent is now crucial income. That\u2019s what \u201cthe average American dies in debt\u201d tells us. The average person can\u2019t give up that ten percent. He or she needs it \u2014 usually desperately \u2014 to pay off simple everyday bills. They have no real savings to speak of. So where is the money to fund this wonderful new social contract going to come from? The bitter truth is this: Americans are now too poor to afford a better social contract. Even if Americans support a Canadian or European style social contract, the hard economic truth is that are probably now too poor to ever have one. Americans are now so poor they can barely afford to support themselves and their own \u201480% live at the edge \u2014 so how can they afford to support anyone else, let alone everyone else?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That\u2019s not just some idle opinion. You can see stark evidence of these fatal economics already doing their work. Americans just rejected their best chance at reform in generations, Bernie and Liz Warren. That was on the left \u2014 the 70% or who say they want decent healthcare, retirement, education, and so on. Only they never, ever vote for it, when it comes down to it. Why? Raising the spectre of higher taxes to fund a functioning society is something that simply can\u2019t be borne by even those who want. Nobody can afford it now. Even Americans who say they want a better society don\u2019t seem able \u2014 predictably, consistently \u2014 to follow through now. There\u2019s a reason for that, and it\u2019s that America is too poor as a country to afford to be a functioning society anymore."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Even if, as Bernie promised, taxes wouldn\u2019t rise \u2014 Americans don\u2019t seem to believe it. Why not? It\u2019s not just they don\u2019t \u2014 with good reason \u2014 distrust their government. It\u2019s also that they can\u2019t bear any more uncertainty. When your whole life and future seems to be going up in smoke, when you bear all the risk in society \u2014 the last thing you can take is even more. So while Bernie and Liz might have championed a functioning society at the same tax rate, the risk of taking having to pay for a functioning society is simply now too much for Americans who already live at the edge. What if taxes do end up rising by five percent? When you\u2019re already perpetually struggling? Bang! Then it\u2019s game over. Americans can\u2019t afford to bear the risks or costs of fundamental reforms to a broken society, and that seals in collapse as the only trajectory left to follow."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "On the right, by the way, people are so confused and bewildered that, like the protesters above, they\u2019re willing to give up their lives to keep their livelihoods. That\u2019s how desperate things have gotten. See the point: on the left, people might want a functioning society, but never, ever vote for it, because nobody can afford it, while the right has given up on it altogether, hoping only for the chance to be exploited, just so long as food can still be put on the table. That leaves\u2026nobody much\u2026in society\u2026who both wants a functioning nation, and can afford to pay for it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sure, it\u2019s true that corporations and the super rich can be taxed. And they should be, heavily. But that\u2019s not enough. There\u2019s a reason that Europe and Canada ask people to pay higher taxes to support a better social contract, and that reason is that is the only way such a contract is sustainable. You can\u2019t get there from a one-off tax on corporations and the rich alone."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s also true that if America were to build a better social contract \u2014 with say good healthcare and retirement and so forth \u2014 everyone\u2019s bills would decline over time. But that doesn\u2019t solve the problem, which is that Americans can\u2019t afford the costs in the first place. Sure, if American had public healthcare, people wouldn\u2019t have to pay $10K per person per year for it. But they do \u2014 and it\u2019s not as if someone\u2019s magically going to raise their incomes by that much if they don\u2019t. Do you think corporate America\u2019s going to give anyone a raise just because it\u2019s paying less in healthcare costs? That\u2019s why all the plans for overhauling America\u2019s broken public healthcare system involve, still, employers paying into some kind of fund \u2014 nobody wants to give people more money. But without giving people more money, Americans stay too poor to live in anything but\u2026the collapsing society America\u2019s become."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If that doesn\u2019t make sense, just think about it in your own life. Could you really afford to lose 10% of your income right about now? Ever? More likely, like most Americans, your life is balanced right on the razor\u2019s edge. A few percent either way, and \u2014 kaput!! \u2014 you lose most or everything you have. There goes the mortgage, school, the credit ratin, and so forth. The plainer economic translation of that is: you\u2019re too poor to afford a functioning society. You can barely support your own \u2014 how can you support anyone, everyone, else?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So how was America left too poor to afford anything but collapse? In Europe and Canada, there\u2019s a certain kind of fairness that came to prevail. People pay about half their incomes in taxes. Half for me, half for everyone else. But that also means that society\u2019s surplus is distributed far more equitably in the first place. That half you pay in taxes goes on to employ doctors, nurses, professors, public servants of all kinds that simply don\u2019t exist in America. It\u2019s used to invest in hospitals, schools, universities, parks, libraries \u2014 every single year. That\u2019s been happening for something like 50 years by now: a cycle of equitable redistribution that became sustained investment and reinvestment. What happens if you invest in a thing like a park, hospital, library for fifty years? It gets better and better. It\u2019s returns grow and grow. There\u2019s more of everything to go around for everyone. The battle for self-preservation doesn\u2019t lock people into poverty, as it has in America. That is what it means to be a truly rich society."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "America\u2019s been doing exactly the opposite, for the same fifty years, and longer. See any reinvestment in\u2026anything? Everything\u2019s decrepit, from airports to schools to libraries, precisely because there hasn\u2019t been any. There hasn\u2019t been any \u2014 or enough, anyways \u2014 because Americans didn\u2019t want to pay those higher taxes Europeans and Canadians did. They believed the strange, foolish, and evidence-free ideologies of trickle-down economics and neoliberalism and all the rest of it \u2014 we\u2019ll all be richest if we invest in\u2026precisely nothing together. Nobody should care about anyone else. Nobody should ever support anyone else in the pursuit of anything. Life was to be purely individualistic, adversarial, and acquisitive."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That led Americans straight into a poverty trap. They were paying lower taxes, sure. But their public goods were decaying. Their common wealth was eroding. Their systems and institutions were corroding. What happens to metal that isn\u2019t polished, a street that\u2019s never cleaned, a house that\u2019s never repaired? Well, in the end, you have to pay a bigger bill. But you might not be able to afford it by then. Bang! Then you\u2019re done. You live in that crumbling house until it finally turns to dust, if you can\u2019t pay the roofer, plumber, electrician. That\u2019s where America is now."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Do you know what a poverty trap is? When a poor person spend more than rich people just to have the basics \u2014 think of a poor person spending most of their income on low-quality food, transportation, medicine, and so on, because it\u2019s all they can get. That\u2019s where America is now, from a global perspective. In a classic poverty trap. Too poor to ever afford to be rich again, because it doesn\u2019t have the money to invest in it\u2019s own self-improvement or betterment now. Decades of underinvestment mean that there was less and less to go around \u2014 until American life became a brutal daily battle for self-preservation. But when all you can do is barely even struggle to preserve yourself, put food on the table, keep your family afloat \u2014 what do you have left to give back to a better society? Nothing, is the grim answer, and it\u2019s borne out by America\u2019s spectacularly low \u2014 negative \u2014 savings rate, aka, everyone but the mega-rich dies in debt."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To achieve European or Canadian living standards, how much would America have to invest now? Think of it: gleaming hospitals for everyone, thriving public squares, expansive childcare, good retirement, jobs that pay the bills, oversight of it all. It would take trillions. Probably dozens of trillions. Much, much more than average Americans all put together can afford to spend now. Those are the brutal economics of collapse. Societies who let themselves become poor can hardly then wave a magic want and become rich."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What it means to be a poor society, which is what America\u2019s become, is also the experience of life in it by now: political chaos, economic ruin, emotional paralysis, cultural degeneration. Europe and Canada, again, have been investing in life for decades, while America\u2019s been ignoring it. The result is that they are ahead now \u2014 and America probably can\u2019t ever catch up. America let itself become a poor society, and this \u2014 the chaos and dislocation of now \u2014 is what it means to be one."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I know this is grim reading. It\u2019s terrible and horrific. Is it \u201cnegative,\u201d though? Well, I know that it comes across that way. I want to do a job that the typical pundit won\u2019t, though, which is try to tell you simple truths. The one that economics tells me is this. It\u2019s too late for America to recover. It left it too long. It was arrogant and conceited, paying for things it didn\u2019t need, like wars and mega-mansions, but not those it did. So it didn\u2019t invest when it should have, but now the bill is due, but nobody can pay it. What do you call a society like that? Bankrupt. Just like most Americans are, only they don\u2019t know it. What do you call a whole society of people, after all, who die in debt?America\u2019s broke, my friends. And when you\u2019re broke, what do you have left to invest in yourself?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There\u2019s one way out, by the way, if you\u2019ve followed me closely. Give people money. No strings attached, no questions asked, now, on a large-scale, more or less permanently, forget how much needs to be borrowed to make it happen. So people can fund a working society again. Or else. That\u2019s the big question for America. The rest is noise. Until something along those lines begins to take shape \u2014 my answer is simple: Americans made themselves too poor to now afford to have the luxury of a functioning, civilized, modern society. Or is all that a necessity?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Umair May 2020"}], "topic": "economy"}
