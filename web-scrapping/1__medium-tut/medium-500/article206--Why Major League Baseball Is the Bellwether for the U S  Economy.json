Well, natural if I am 37 days into a quarantine. Despite my professional training, the distinctiveness of the current situation does not lend itself to the type of pure statistical analysis and inference in which I am trained. Instead, I am looking more and more to high level data, back-of-the-envelope calculations, intuition, and historical precedent to help understand the current environment. This approach is consistent with what I have learned professionally through this crisis: during unprecedented events one must accept that all models come with greater uncertainty and context can help us understand their conclusions."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Statistical models are of course still valuable when used appropriately. For example, there are plenty of data and historical precedents available for me to comfortably conclude that the US and global economies have entered a recession.

Others may advocate that plummeting global energy markets may teach us the most. However, as I sit here today, I believe that how MLB solves the quandary of when and how to play its 2020 season may well be the single most important observation to understanding the state of our economy and the stage of its recovery. I believe MLB will solve this problem; but, it won\u2019t be seamless, it won\u2019t be the same, and it\u2019s very possible it all goes sideways for baseball and the economy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To make the baseball of relevance to our discussion, we first have to understand the economics, so let\u2019s start there.

We have many ways to measure uncertainty, but perhaps the cleanest metric I am aware of is the volatility index, or \u2018the VIX\u2019 as it is commonly referred to in finance. Technically, the VIX measures our expectations of the magnitude of future price movements of the S&P 500 over the next month. For purposes of this article, I am thinking about the question it helps me answer: how much uncertainty is involved in forecasting the stock market\u2019s future price? Higher index values reflect higher expectations of uncertainty about the future price of the S&P 500, which is a decent proxy for the economy as a whole.\u00b2"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Understanding the uncertainty that the VIX conveys is critical to understanding when the economy will recover.

This portion of MLB\u2019s business model is under siege. To date, the public health response has made it globally impracticable to supply sports to live patrons (and via television for that matter).\u2075 Making things worse, because MLB plays games in multiple countries,\u2076 states, and cities \u2014 all of which have different, rapidly evolving guidelines \u2014 it is not clear if MLB will be able to return to the markets in which it has traditionally supplied live fan experiences."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The demand side of the equation is equally uncertain.

In a moment of weakness over Easter weekend, I found myself watching a replay of last year\u2019s The Masters final round \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t find that surprising.

Until they start playing, we have to seriously consider the possibility that the league may play zero games and at least conduct the theoretical exercise of MLB earning zero revenue during 2020.\u2077 On paper, such a scenario would mean large haircuts of MLB\u2019s team valuations."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "According to Forbes annual team valuation study, the sum of MLB\u2019s 30 teams\u2019 total values was approximately $55.5 billion as of February.

If we assume that MLB earns no revenue in a season that it plays no games, its owners would then expect that, assuming no changes to the price-to-sales multiple, their teams would be worth a maximum of 20%, or $11B in aggregate, less than they were in the pre-COVID-19 world. But even that haircut underestimates the best case if MLB were to play zero games. Such a calculation also implies that MLB will earn all of the post-2020 revenue that it was projected to earn pre-COVID-19, and that those post-2020 revenues can be discounted back to present value at a rate of 0%. The implication of that assumption is that MLBs post-2020 revenues carry no risk; they\u2019re 100% certain.

According to Forbes, MLB generated roughly 40% of its $10.7 billion in 2019 revenues from the patron experience through channels including tickets, concessions, and team owned stores. Though the Braves don\u2019t break out these revenue streams separately, it is safe to assume that they earn a similar portion of their revenues from in-person patronage.

On the other hand, each NFL team plays 16 regular season games; NBA and NHL teams each play 82.

Good weather is a requirement for MLB games, and the marathon schedule requires that its athletes have an extended recuperation period prior to the subsequent season.

This is particularly relevant to baseball because, as I keep coming back to, baseball teams play a lot of games. As a result, the fans support jobs in the communities surrounding ballparks. A 2017 study commissioned to estimate the economic impact of building a new stadium for the Oakland Athletics estimated that for every one dollar a fan spends on a ticket, he or she spends another dollar in the community that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise spend. Fans are likely to park in local lots, many of which aren\u2019t owned by the teams. They might stop for dinner at a nearby restaurant, have a couple of drinks at a local bar, or come home with something from a store in the area.

After all, if this works, it looks great for politicians who help MLB pull this off and it brings significant commerce and tax revenues along with it.

If MLB were trying to play in its home stadiums in 2020, such a plan would likely require sign-off from two federal governments,\u2079 18 state or provincial governments, and 28 local governments including the District of Columbia.
