In fact, one could argue that Brazil hasn\u2019t been generous with itself for many years or decades. Putting things into perspective, the country may very well be achieving its all-time low in the year 2020. This is by no means an overstatement. In historical terms, never before has Brazil faced a sanitary, an economic and a political crises all at the same time. But you never know \u2014 there is nothing so bad that it couldn\u2019t be worse. Brazilians are losing confidence and hope as well. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are yet unpredictable, and chances are that it could be generating some long-lasting damage in the country\u2019s economy, society and democracy throughout the first years of the upcoming decade starting in 2021."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the year 2013, way before this current mess, projections made by past political leaders and renowned economists now seem to largely diverge from the situation we\u2019re witnessing today.

The documentary \u2018O Brasil deu certo. E agora?\u2019, which translates to \u2018Brazil has succeeded. What now?\u2019, was an initiative by former minister of finance Maison da N\u00f3brega and was produced and directed by journalist Louise Sottomaior.

It sounds equally mistaken if compared to another famous quote of his related to the country\u2019s miraculous economic development of the 1970\u2019s and disastrous ability to distribute the newly generated wealth among all the population. He allegedly intended to \u201cmake the cake rise before dividing it into slices\u201d. Brazil\u2019s cake in fact got bigger, but inequality remains one of the biggest challenges in the 21st century. After achieving monetary stability and pursuing increased fiscal austerity in the 1990\u2019s, consistent efforts to tackle poverty and extreme poverty took place in the 2000\u2019s in Brazil. However, this trend encountered significant obstacles in the decade thereafter and progress has stalled. According to the World Bank, the country has reached its lowest disparity rate (measured by the Gini coefficient) in 2015, but indicators have consistently worsened in recent years."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2276/1*bfhz5cUUdBJIWvwP-PrIRA.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira, former minister of finance (1987), expected Brazil to be \u201cbetter than today; more democratic, more developed, and more social\u201d.

Considering the contemporary scenario of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s administration, it\u2019s really hard to believe that Brazil followed these pathways. Facing 1) intense political and ideological polarization; 2) notable deterioration of decades-long mechanisms enshrined in the 1988 Constitution that enable and encourage civil society\u2019s active participation in decision making processes; 3) daily attacks on journalists and on media in general; 4) deliberate clash against the legislative and judicial branches of government; 5) science denialism in times of pandemic; and 6) distancing from the traditional globalist approach in favor of blind and obscure nationalistic values, the country is certainly less democratic, less social, less humane, less participative and less in tune with the international community when comparing 2013 with 2020.

It\u2019s worth noting that in late 2019, Brazil was on the verge of finally overcoming the long-lasting impacts of the worst economic recession of its history so far. Figuratively speaking, it was more like a depression as it took place between 2014 and 2016, with significant drops in the GDP (-3.5% in 2015 and -3,3% in 2016), but its negative effects in unemployment rates, consumption and investment ended up prevailing all the way until just recently.

Since 2019, however, Brazilian diplomacy has been putting a highly ideological foreign policy into practice and has been threatening other countries that Brazil will be stepping back in several multilateral agreements and international forums. Suddenly, cooperation and collaboration are words that automatically apply to just a small set of preferred partners (USA and Israel to the detriment of China and Argentina). Furthermore, President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s aggressive and authoritarian speeches as well as the country\u2019s disastrous response to the new Coronavirus pandemic are notably helping deteriorate the country\u2019s image even more.

Not only Brazil\u2019s GDP per capita has decreased from US$13.2 thousand in 2011 to just US$9 thousand in 2018 (it will certainly get worse in 2020), but the country might also end up being a unique case of nation which will become old prior to getting rich. Despite its continental dimensions, population size and abundant resources, Brazil is still a middle-income developing nation. It is not part of the OECD (yet). As we know, the logic of demographic transitions is totally independent from economic performance throughout the time.
