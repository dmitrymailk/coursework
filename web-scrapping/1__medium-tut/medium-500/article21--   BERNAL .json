A renowned Chemist. An exceptional X-ray crystallographer.

Many believe that would have been the case."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The controversy surrounding Rosalind Franklin not being credited for her work on the 3D structure of DNA finds its origin in 1968, a decade after she had passed away. But the story began much earlier than that."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The year was 1951. Rosalind Franklin had been awarded the 3-year long Turner-Newall Scholarship. She moved to King\u2019s College London to start working in John Randall\u2019s laboratory. Her field of research concerned studying the 3D structure of DNA. Maurice Wilkins also worked in the same laboratory, as a senior scientist studying the structure of DNA. Due to some initial conflicts and misunderstandings, the relationship between Franklin and Wilkins had a bitter start. Raymond Gosling, who was the PhD student in the lab had initially been supervised by Wilkins but had then been put under the supervision of Franklin as she joined the lab. This had apparently taken place in the absence of Wilkins, who was caught off guard as he rejoined the lab a few days later."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*xi0aPJguasJtlZj6yus5vg.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In September of 1951, Franklin discovered that there existed a second type of DNA, that was more hydrated than the one known at the time (i.e. A DNA). She called this the \u2018B DNA\u2019. In the months that followed, she had gone on to make vital observations regarding the helical structure of the DNA. It was around this time, her PhD student Ray Gosling took the now infamous \u2018photo 51\u2019."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Another group from the Cavendish Lab, University of Cambridge was working on the structure of DNA. This duo consisted of James Watson, a physicist who had become quite enthusiastic about the DNA, and Francis Crick, a Biologist and fellow DNA enthusiast. Both wanted to create a model for the structure of DNA. In 1952, they created their first model of the DNA structure- a triple-helix with its nitrogenous bases projecting outwards. They called Wilkins and Franklin from King\u2019s to review their model. Franklin, based on the observations she has made up till that point, dismissed the model almost immediately. It was their lack of knowledge on basic chemistry that had led them to commit blunders in modelling the DNA. Needless to say, the model was a complete disaster and ended up in Lawrence Bragg, the head of the Cavendish Lab ordering Watson and Crick to cease their work on DNA."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As time passed, things got tougher for Franklin at the King\u2019s College, University of London. She found herself dreading her working environment so much that she decided to move to Birkbeck College in 1953. Raymond Gosling went back to work under Maurice Wilkins as a result. Being his supervisor, Gosling had shown Wilkins photo 51 and Wilkins was shocked. Things started to shift. Back at the Cavendish lab, in the spirit of unraveling the mystery of DNA before his American competitor Linus Pauling, Bragg decided to allow the DNA duo to resume their DNA modelling. Around this time, Watson visited Wilkins at King\u2019s where Wilkins showed Watson his newfound golden data point- photo 51.

This does make one stop and question: Would things have been different had it been a male in place of Dr. Franklin? On the periphery of things, it seems that the situation would have been the same, regardless of the gender but as one delves in deeper, it becomes more difficult to think of it in this singular, straightforward perspective."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Of Course, we view all this in hindsight so things may appear different than they might have been at the time but the underlying misogyny of this matter was brought out in the spotlight, quite explicitly, in 1968 when James Watson published his book \u2018The Double Helix\u2019. In the book, he was seen making various dismissive and sexist comments about Franklin, who he refers to as \u201cRosy\u201d. It was but the start of a series of sexist and racist comments made by Watson that might have led to him ultimately be \u201cshunned\u201d by the scientific community, so much so that it came down to him auctioning his Nobel prize in 2014 to combat his poverty."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/364/1*IczGjNcR6emXAD6_z1Nj7w.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Rosalind Franklin\u2019s story is more than the 1953 controversy and tension that surrounded her time in King\u2019s College.
