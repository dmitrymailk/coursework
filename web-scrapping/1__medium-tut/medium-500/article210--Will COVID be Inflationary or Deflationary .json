The forces unleashed upon the world by a decade of zero (and even negative) interest rates, outlandish levels of government and corporate debt, extraordinary amounts of central bank money creation, and shortages of goods due to supply chain disruptions and work stoppages around the globe all seem to point to massive price inflation. On the other hand, the unwinding of this debt, restructuring, demand destruction, high unemployment, and the continual march of technological innovation seem to portend price deflation."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "TL;DR"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Just jump to the bottom to see the compilation of views from financial experts on this topic.

This debases the currency and redistributes your wages to the early receivers of new money who get to spend it on goods and assets before prices rise to account for the new money. This creates a host of pernicious effects, but most notably tends to lead to price inflation, or the rise in prices of consumer goods as each dollar becomes worth less and less."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1774/0*Cm10OCdNCgumUf-Y"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Price inflation, as defined above, can be caused not only by money printing, but also by increases in demand or reduction in supply. These latter causes are the culprits behind the sudden rise in prices of food items such as eggs and meat. Supply chains have been disrupted and consumers have been stocking up on these scarce goods forcing prices to rise to compensate."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Typically these supply and demand shocks don\u2019t occur on an economy wide scale, so you won\u2019t see large swings in traditional inflation measures like the PCE or the CPI. But, these aren\u2019t normal times. Governments have deemed some workers essential and others not which has led to disruptions of supplies at every level of the value chain."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Consider the food supply which, in the US, relies heavily on trucking to reach far-flung markets across the continent. These trucks need regular maintenance to keep them on the roads and ensure that food reaches your local supermarket. Spare parts to conduct repairs are primarily imported from Canada, Mexico, and China. If manufacturing of spare parts in these countries and the US slows down significantly, we may see an additional shortage of spare parts thereby putting trucking fleets at risk.\u00b9"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "On the other side, there are deflationary forces which continue to push prices downward."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Shelter in place orders remain in effect for many around the world which has decimated demand for many goods and services. Most notably, we see the effects in the oil industry which has suffered through a fall in oil prices due to a decimation of demand. As far as prices are concerned, this is great for consumers because as fuel gets cheaper, so does shipping and personal transportation. All else equal, this will be reflected in lower prices you will pay for goods and services."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As the rolls of unemployed continue to rise, people are liable to curtail their spending.

However, the groundwork has been laid for a change given the effective merging of the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve through direct monetization of the federal government\u2019s spending. After the US presidential election, we\u2019re going to have a ~$2 trillion stimulus bill that won\u2019t be targeted towards financial assets, but instead infrastructure meaning it will command real resources in the economy and at least half of it will be monetized directly by the Fed."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Chris Cole, Artemis Capital, Macro Voices April 16, 2020"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "State pension systems are wildly underfunded at every level, even before the crisis began.

However, all the forces that were holding inflation down, such as global supply chains and technology, are no longer there: export controls are in place, tech startups and VC\u2019s are going bust. The central bank action is going to lead to a shift to secular inflation and rising inflation expectations. We\u2019re already seeing that in grocery prices where people are paying more for things like eggs, which has led to more people being willing to pay higher prices for these goods. When these supply shocks settle in, inflation is going to take off thanks to these changing expectations coupled with more money in the system. If government intervenes and begins to nationalize industries, this will only exacerbate the shortages further destroying confidence in the system."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Simon White, Variant Perception, Macro Voices March 26, 2020"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Governments have intervened with massive amounts of money creation through the Fed\u2019s programs as well as actual helicopter money being directly deposited into the bank accounts of individuals.

The CARES Act and subsequent stimulus programs are going to greatly increase the debt in level in the US and further drag growth downward. The political incentives are set up to continue increasing debt and spending, which will only pull growth down more leading to lower interest rates and lower inflation. The only case where inflation would turn around \u2014 and we could get hyperinflation \u2014 would be if the Federal Reserve was able to spend money, which would take an amendment to the 1913 Federal Reserve Act."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Jeff Booth, The Price of Tomorrow, The Investor\u2019s Podcast April 25, 2020"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Technology is advancing at an exponential pace backed by Moore\u2019s Law and the coming advent of quantum computing and other developments.

More long term, the post-virus world will turn back some of the effects of globalization, which has worked to push prices down for consumers, as well as additional precautions for workers which will hamper productivity.
