Most Americans are crudely familiar with a history which goes something like this: \u2018Once upon a time there was a crazy dictator named Hitler, who took over Germany and led the country to a war that the United States won, with some help from the Soviet Union and Britain. During the war, Hitler tried to kill all the Jews, succeeded in killing six million of them in gas chambers before the war ended, and afterward, Hitler committed suicide.\u2019"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Note that this cartoon-history of World War II in Europe is matched by an equally cartoonish history of what we now call the Pacific War: \u2018On a Sunday morning in December of 1941, the evil Japanese launched a sneak attack against the U.S. 7th Fleet at Pearl Harbor, killing thousands of sailors and sinking several U.S. battleships. The next day the U.S. declared war on Japan and after a stunning victory at the Battle of Midway in June of 1942, the U.S. Marines and U.S. bombers pushed the \u201cJaps\u201d back to the main islands of Japan and unleashed two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, thus ending the war in August of 1945.\u2019"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "More educated readers will recognize both the truths in each account, and the glaring mischaracterizations and omissions as well, but the point is that if this is the extent of most voting Americans\u2019 understanding of how and why WWII was started, fought, and ended, current events and public reaction to these become less puzzling."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For example, by 1930, Weimar Germany \u2014 then in the grips of the Great Depression which had its proximate start in the United States \u2014 was a multi-party state that rapidly polarized into Communist and Fascist parties. The Communists aimed at a revolution which would eliminate income inequality, redistribute income, and give German workers unprecedented welfare benefits; the Fascists promised to redress Germany\u2019s \u2018humiliation\u2019 from World War I (to make Germany great again), re-establish law and order, and purge Germany of undesirables, including Jews and foreigners of color."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sadly, a comparison of today\u2019s politics and the political economy of the 1930s becomes a fascinating d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience.

For example, one version of recent history goes like this: \u2018In 2008, after decades of attempting to reform U.S. politics by reducing regulation of industry and taxes on the wealthy, Republicans in the U.S. caused a massive global economic crisis due to unregulated speculation in the U.S. housing market. Dated and creaking safety valves that had been instituted to prevent another Great Depression were engaged; and these succeeded in preventing the recession from becoming a global depression, but the most striking feature of the recession was that neither those responsible for it, nor the debunked economic theories which underpinned the policies that led to it, were held accountable. On the contrary, the new \u2018liberal\u2019 administration of Barack Obama was left to attempt a costly and difficult recovery as its first task in office. The recalcitrance and mendacity of the Republic Party of the time led to a strategy of \u2018just say no\u2019 to any \u2018liberal\u2019 legislation. This led to gridlock, which in turn created an environment in which centrist or conservative voters began to yearn for a strong executive who could break the impasse in party politics. This yearning for an authority figure to help us out of our problems then created circumstances favorable to the election of a U.S. strongman, who would by definition have to be a candidate on the political Right.\u2019"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But we needn\u2019t accept this version of history as correct in order to predict what may happen next in 2020."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "First, the economic crisis which we\u2019re experiencing now will intensify public demand for a strongman, and may result in the re-election of Donald J. Trump, an arguably unstable narcissistic megalomaniac, at the helm of the most prosperous and militarily powerful state on the planet. Second, the blame for our economic crisis will not land on those most responsible: Xi Xinping of China, whose authoritarian regime allowed the novel Coronavirus to escape Wuhan and lied about it; and Donald J. Trump, whose administration both gutted U.S. capacity to respond to a pandemic threat two years ago, and whose colossally incompetent response to the arrival of the virus on U.S. shores made it impossible to contain. Instead, blame will be lain, with the help of Fox News, on \u2018libdems\u2019 or \u2018demrats\u2019 (read: Obama, liberals, socialists, and communists), foreigners (see: Trump\u2019s initial insistence on referring to COVID-19 as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d), and immigrants writ-large."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Unlike the 1930s, the U.S. is already politically polarized well before the great depression we\u2019re now sliding into. The ability of responsible journalists, or leaders in local, state, and federal government to elucidate the causes and consequences of the pandemic are severely hamstrung by social media, which directly and systematically misleads; either by design (think of Russia\u2019s fantastically successful interventions in British and U.S. politics in 2016), or by flooding us with so much information that we cannot decide what to pay attention to or whether what we are seeing or reading is real. Fox News is a fascinating case in point: in a normal crisis, its relentless editorial messaging (the Right is always right) masked as journalism is harmful, yes, but in a pandemic, it\u2019s lethal \u2014 most particularly to its own core constituency, which by-and-large trends demographically older, less educated and more rural."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Coming full circle, we see the strong possibility that overlain with a pandemic, an economic crisis, originating in the United States, causes a global economic depression, further polarizing the polities of democratic states into far Left and far Right parties.

Because war distracts from domestic corruption and incompetence, and because, like Nazi Germany, we\u2019ve so over-invested in military power, war becomes \u2018necessary;\u2019 and because so many other countries \u2014 some already authoritarian (e.g. Russia and Turkey) and some only recently so in Hungary \u2014 have the same idea at the same time, we end up on the brink of another world war that we might survive (though probably not), but which no one can win."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So, if history has anything to teach us, hang onto your hats because it looks like we\u2019re about to party like it\u2019s 1939!"}], "topic": "economy"}
