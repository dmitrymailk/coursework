This idea even had a catchy name \u2014 Peak Oil, which stated that at some not too distant point in the future, the world would run out of cheap-to-produce oil. Coupled with growing demand from both developed and emerging markets, the increased cost to extract crude oil (from exotic places like deep beneath the Arctic Ocean) would result in higher and higher prices. The ultimate result would be significant diversification away from oil into other alternative sources of energy like solar and wind as well as lower and lower oil production (as various countries worked to break their addiction to super expensive oil)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And things unfolded according to the Peak Oil story for a while. Countries like China and India massively increased their oil consumption as their economies caught up to the developing world. Exxon Mobil and Chevron invested billions and billions of dollars in exotic offshore oil projects and oil sands projects that were only economical with oil at $120. All this created an epic boom in oil prices from the early 2000s through 2008. I distinctly remember how the price of a gallon of regular gasoline went from $1.50 in 2002 to more than $4 in 2008."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1728/1*H4d2mW7z2UJKqyVS6F90TQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Then last month, on 4/20/2020, the unthinkable occurred \u2014 the price of a barrel of crude oil went negative. At its worst, the price dropped all the way down to negative $37. What does that even mean? So if I had a barrel of oil that I urgently needed to sell, I would not only receive no money for it, I would actually need to pay someone else $37 to take it off my hands? Pretty much."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Part of the reason is obviously coronavirus and how it\u2019s absolutely obliterated crude oil demand. Another reason is that the quoted price of crude oil is a futures (a futures is a type of derivative) price not a spot price \u2014 much more on this later. But the seeds of oil\u2019s price swoon were actually sown many years ago."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The Shale Revolution"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Just as the conventional side of the energy industry was fully buying into the theory of Peak Oil, a group of upstarts was perfecting the techniques that would prove to be the theory\u2019s demise \u2014 horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "An ideal oil field like the giant ones in Saudi Arabia is deep with high flow. That means you can drill a bunch of vertical wells and the oil (and the dollars) start freely flowing. Imagine a water filled balloon as big as your house. Now imagine poking several metal straws into that giant water balloon. Because there is so much water in the balloon, water will flow easily from those straws for a long, long time. That\u2019s how the best oil fields are."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But as of the 2000s, the vast majority of U.S. oil came in the form of something called oil shale. Oil shale is, for lack of a better description, rock that contains oil. The U.S. has massive deposits of oil shale (in the trillions of barrels). But for the longest time, these deposits were uneconomical to produce. That\u2019s because oil shale deposits are extremely wide (sometimes covering thousands of square miles) and shallow relative to traditional fields. The previous generation of drilling technology faced two primary challenges when attempting to extract oil from shale:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So basically oil shale deposits are exactly the opposite of an ideal oil field."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1566/1*XEEGhuGu2FSilnkWazcrjg.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The aforementioned upstarts like Mitchell Energy and Chesapeake Energy solved these challenges using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. By drilling horizontally through the oil rich rock, the shape of the well could much better align with the shape of the oil shale deposit (the blue line in the above figure). The flow issue was fixed with the perfection of a technique called hydraulic fracturing. By pumping, at a very high pressure, a mix of water, sand, and thickening agents into the oil shale, well operators could increase the amount of fractures and cracks in the oil shale. The oil trapped in the rock could then flow more freely through these newly opened cracks, significantly increasing the flow and yield of the well."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The U.S.\u2019 massive shale deposits that were once thought to be impossible to extract suddenly became a significant and globally competitive supply of crude oil.

It also put a cap on how high oil prices could go (barring a major disruption like war) as oil shale wells could be brought online and connected to the existing pipeline infrastructure (for moving the oil to refineries or to be exported) relative quickly. So any time prices went up, more dollars poured into shale, more wells were drilled, and large amounts of supply hit the market (bringing the price back down)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Shale was great for U.S. economic growth as well as consumers and corporations that consumed a lot of oil and natural gas, but not everyone was pleased with this suddenly booming industry."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Saudi Arabia Attempts To Suffocate The Shale Industry"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In my above plot of oil prices, you can see three major declines. The first was 2008 \u2014 the global financial crisis brought with it a massive recession, which among other things, caused demand for crude oil to fall off a cliff.

This meant that typically in times of oversupply, it would reduce its own production (and therefore market share) so that oil prices did not fall too drastically. But this time it had other ideas. It argued that it didn\u2019t make sense why the world\u2019s most efficient oil producer (Saudi Arabia) had to sacrifice market share and profits when less efficient producers continued to flood the world with oil. So instead of being the swing producer and reducing production, this time Saudi Arabia decided that it would engage everyone in a breath holding competition."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s gamble was that as the lowest cost producer, it could tolerate low prices longer than everyone else, especially those pesky American shale oil producers. It was confident because it knew that many shale oil producers were heavily indebted, having borrowed in order to lease the land and drill the well (energy projects typically require large upfront spending before gradually producing cashflow). As Saudi Arabia locked into its position and the oil glut went from big to massive, crude prices dropped from more than $100 to $45 in the span of just a few months."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The gamble backfired. Yes, some shale producers did go bankrupt. But the price war forced the survivors (helped by an abundance of cheap capital and rock bottom borrowing rates) to consolidate, increase efficiency, and learn to turn a profit at oil prices where previously it was thought to be impossible to make money. Ultimately, shale producers emerged leaner and stronger and in 2016, Saudi Arabia waved the white flag."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Ironically, oil\u2019s high price for much of the last 15 years was in itself a major catalyst for its eventual decline \u2014 as it drew massive amounts of investment and research into both better extraction technology and substitutes (electric vehicles and renewable energy)."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The Current Pandemic And Its Impact On Oil"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1440/1*CfkK3G8sGmxA9SC9DNfZRw.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Throughout all of the oil market\u2019s twists and turns, there has never been a crisis that\u2019s impacted it as much as the current one, hence the negative price.

Thus at any given time, there is a finite amount of storage capacity; and available capacity was running perilously close to zero (thanks to another Saudi Arabia price war, this time with Russia, that occurred in March of 2020).
