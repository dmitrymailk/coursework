Since then, browsing levels have recovered partially, more so than registered demand."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, the severity of the drop is more of a \u201cdelay interest\u201d rather than \u201cstopped looking altogether\u201d as evident in the improving demand as we move closer to potential lockdown ease. In the recent Savills Global Market Sentiment Survey, only 10% of estate agents said 30%+ of their buyers have stopped looking."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the Prime Market, defined as the top 5 to 10%, Savills see their website traffic from w/c Apr 13 now back up pre-COVID levels, however this is mostly driven by a +38% increase from overseas viewers.

This is assuming the full lockdown lasts until the end of Q2 and begins to ease during Q3. While this is the most likely scenario as a base case, there also exists more downside than upside. For example, if the current lockdown is extended into Q3, or if there is a second wave when autumn flu season hits. Some notable figures like Ray Dalio are talking of a deeper drop and much slower recovery (in view of the US economy)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in the post-COVID scenario below sees real GDP drop 35% in Q2, recovering back to its pre-virus level by Q4, with half the second-quarter fall unwinding in Q3. This would add up to a 13% annual GDP drop for 2020 on a whole, worth noting that this would exceed any of the annual falls in the wars and the recent great financial crisis.

This also expected to increase very fast in Q2 as the sharp rise in Universal Credit already shows, even with the government pledged help in place.

To compare with the recent crisis, at its highest, unemployment was 8% in 2009."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Doing a simple back-of-the-envelope supports this view. Currently, 23% of the 28million employed workforce are on furlough, post lockdown businesses would be on the road to recovery, it\u2019s hard to see them getting 100% of the furloughed employees back. Many companies will be cash-flow constrained and cautious, for business survival, it\u2019d be easier to fire fast and hire slow. So if we assume 25% of the furloughed employees lose their jobs and 10% of the self-employed closeup.
