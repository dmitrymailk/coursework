She asks about my job. I ask about the ducks. She complains about my father. We withdraw from the conversation as soon as good manners allow. This is, believe it or not, the healthiest our relationship has ever been. This is a victory, and it was hard-won."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My mother refused to give up her maiden name when she married. I have only ever known her as a conservative Irish Catholic woman, but by all accounts, she was a real wild card in her youth. I\u2019ve seen the pictures of her bleached hair with red tips molded into liberty spikes all over her head. I\u2019ve seen pictures of her in a leather jacket outside a theater, preparing for a live showing of Rocky Horror Picture Show. I\u2019ve seen her tattoos, faded and aging alongside the rest of her. But this cool punk-rock mother has always been a stranger to me."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It was my father who filled my arms with books by Robert Frost and Walt Whitman the moment I could read. But my mother did like Sylvia Plath. The first thing she ever told me about Plath was that she stuck her head in an oven. She said this as only a Catholic could, with a particular disdain rationed toward speaking about suicide. But there was something else just behind that judgmental tone: a spiteful admiration."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Later, when I discovered the racism and anti-Semitism rampant throughout Plath\u2019s work, I wasn\u2019t too surprised. Growing up with my mother, I\u2019d learned early that the boots snapping the necks of vulnerable women often belonged to other women."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My sister\u2019s favorite poet has always been Emily Dickinson. We find our mouthpieces for pain in women whose pain resembles our own. Emily Dickinson suffered alone and quietly, like my sister. Sylvia Plath suffered emotionally and loudly, which is what makes her work enticing to loud and emotional women \u2014 something I inherited from my mother. But Plath was also unforgivably narcissistic and so blinded by her own hurts that she could not recognize the ways she hurt others."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Blind narcissism is easily contracted. If it wasn\u2019t, prejudice borne from ignorance would not be nearly so widespread. It\u2019s hard to see the pain of others when you\u2019re so busy wallowing in your own. It is easy to poke and prod at your hurts and then feel betrayed when they do not heal. Consider a dog, scratching relentlessly at his own stitches until he reopens the wound. This is why we make them wear cones."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For ourselves, we pretend at self-discipline. An alcoholic says, \u201cI can still go to the bar with my friends. I just won\u2019t drink anything.\u201d A cutter says, \u201cI can still keep the knife by my bed. I just won\u2019t reach for it.\u201d An addict says, \u201cI can still go to the party. I just won\u2019t take what is offered.\u201d Sometimes this works. Mostly it doesn\u2019t."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the novel Sharp Objects, Gillian Flynn writes, \u201cSometimes I think illness sits inside every woman, waiting for the right moment to bloom.\u201d This can be physical illness, like the kind the protagonist\u2019s mother forces on her daughters. And it can refer to mental illness, like the protagonist\u2019s own, which manifests mostly in an overwhelming need to cut words into her skin."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Often, the illness waiting patiently inside each woman is a cyanide capsule put there by another woman. Pain passed down like an heirloom. In Sharp Objects, the protagonist, Camille, received hers from her mother, Adora, who received hers from her mother in turn. When I realized this, I set the book down to cry."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I thought of my abuse at the hands of my mother, who had been abused by hers. I used to cut words into my skin too. I carried a little CD case filled with pocket knives, razor blades, protractor needles, and thick shards of glass; I preferred glass shards because they cut on each end and their cuts burned longer. I kept this case for some time, even after I\u2019d stopped cutting. Just looking at it was a comfort of its own."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There is a lot to be said about the inherent pain that comes with being a woman, especially generational trauma based in fear of sexual violence and lack of bodily autonomy, which our mothers, aunts, grandmothers, gave to us rather than questioned. The lost control and ownership over our own bodies is shared between generations of women, originally placed in our hands by men. We see this in women at salons, crying as their daughters cut or dye their hair."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "From Tess Morgan, the pseudonym under which a mother wrote a whopping melodrama to The Guardian when her child had the indecency to get a tattoo: \u201cI will never look at you in the same way again. It\u2019s a visceral feeling. Maybe because I\u2019m your mother. All those years of looking after your body.\u201d She said \u201cyour body,\u201d but really she meant \u201cour body.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In Sharp Objects, when Adora sees the extent to which Camille has mauled her own skin, she treats this as an attack against her, because Adora cannot see Camille as anything but an extension of herself. My mother\u2019s own reaction to my cutting was similar. When I had my lip pierced, she refused to speak to me for two weeks. When she discovered I was sexually active, she put me on house arrest and then disowned me. Mothers, as women, exist in a world that is increasingly wrenching more and more autonomy from them. And so in their search for control, they turn to their children\u2019s bodies."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Of course, mothers who feel some sadness at watching their children change \u2014 or hurt \u2014 themselves are not automatically bad mothers. But sometimes this sadness becomes a seed that can grow into a manipulative grief and a malignant need to exert power."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We often neglect that women can exist beyond the parameters of our pain. Pain does not have to come with a purpose. It does not have to be dissected and examined and redistributed for the consumption of others. Your pain can belong to you only. You have that right."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I would love to see women discuss pain and feel pain and not simply accept the inevitability of it. This idea that when a woman is born she is gifted pain and she will always have this pain until she dies because she is a woman makes me weary. I would like to see women feel their pain but also recognize the causes and try to move forward and find happiness and self-fulfillment. Maybe the pain never dissolves, maybe it always exists inside us, but it can exist alongside a future that is painless. A scar is nothing but pain healed over."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I have never related so viscerally to a protagonist as I relate to Camille Preaker from Sharp Objects. Here is a woman in pain, a pain so inherent that she cannot remember ever not feeling it. She is not unkind, but she is not particularly kind either. She is not generous. She is not brave. She is not a good victim, but she is an easy one. She is a cutter. She is a fuckup. But she is trying, desperately, in a way that no one else can see. She is me in another life, with a different sister. Camille, who lost her sister at 13, imagines a world where Marian had not died. Would they have survived their mother? Would Camille have survived in a better way? As someone whose Marian did not die, I believe the answer is yes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Camille represents a particular victim that I don\u2019t often see: the female victim of a female abuser and \u2014 even more specifically\u2014the child victim of a maternal abuser. Evil mothers written by men are usually propaganda. Evil mothers written by women are testimonials. Camille hates women because of what a woman has done to her, though of course she does not recognize that. And, what\u2019s more, Camille does not recognize the multitude of ways other people, primarily men, have hurt her because the hurts they dealt have never been as devastating as the pain from her mother. \u201cA child weaned on poison considers harm a comfort,\u201d she says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In one scene, Camille describes how as a blackout-drunk 13-year-old girl she was \u201cpassed around\u201d four football players. She argues it wasn\u2019t rape. She says, \u201cSometimes drunk women aren\u2019t raped; they just make stupid choices \u2014 and to say we deserve special treatment when we\u2019re drunk because we\u2019re women, to say we need to be looked after, I find offensive.\u201d She chose to go to those woods, she chose to drink, and she chose to put herself in that position. Whatever happened afterward, well, those are just the consequences of her actions. At least that\u2019s what she\u2019s been taught to tell herself."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Last summer, I went to a bar in Milwaukee with two other flight crew members I did not know well. I had four drinks, all mixed, none especially strong. I had eaten regularly throughout the day and ate again at the bar. I was not dehydrated. I am a regular drinker. I repeated these things to myself throughout the following day, as if I were my own interrogator. We arrived at the bar around 3 or 4 in the afternoon. We left around 9 or 10. I had four drinks over five or six hours. All of us went to the bathroom multiple times. My drink was left unaccompanied for many of them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I came to consciousness around 1 in the morning, completely naked in the shower of a hotel room I did not recognize. I felt dizzy and confused. There was someone asleep in the bed, who I later realized was the other flight attendant, though without my glasses, I could not make her out. Wrapped in a towel and dripping wet, without my clothes, phone, glasses, or key card, I stumbled out into the hallway, only to realize I could not get into my own room. Another flight attendant woke up to me knocking on her door. She gave me my clothes, my phone, my key card. She explained that we had gone to our captain\u2019s hotel room to watch something, and she wanted to leave but she didn\u2019t want to leave me alone with him. I vaguely remembered she and I kissing in his room, though I was too drunk to really move at the time."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This was a situation I can feel righteous indignation about: I did not ask for drugs. No one offered me a choice. I did not drink enough to put myself in that position. And yet, I still feel a shallow amount of shame, like standing ankle-deep in dark water. I did go to the bar with people I didn\u2019t know. I did leave my drink alone, even though I know better. \u201cI know better,\u201d the mantra that\u2019s followed me from my childhood. \u201cYou know better\u201d turned into \u201cI know better,\u201d but it\u2019s still said in my mother\u2019s voice."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A month later, while visiting Boston with my mother, I gave her a general summary of what happened. I\u2019m not sure why I mentioned it, and I regretted it immediately. I don\u2019t mean to keep testing my mother, offering these scraps of myself as feathered lures, hoping she might surprise me while knowing she never will."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "She said, \u201cCan you now understand why as your mother I have trouble trusting your choices that led to this?\u201d Lure swallowed, she sank, and I still don\u2019t know what I expected."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When I told my sister about the incident in Milwaukee, she held me close. She said she was glad I was alright and that she loved me. It should not seem remarkable to be treated with care by the people meant to love you."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I hated women for a long time because of what my mother did to me, though of course I didn\u2019t recognize it for what it was. It was hard for me to empathize with women. The portraiture that became common during my late adolescence, of women as martyrs, women as plated heroes rising up against their own hydra, the patriarchy. Women as strong and independent warriors. These images hurt me. My own dragon was a woman, a self-proclaimed feminist even, and no matter how many times I cut off her head, there were always more. To me, all these towering, powerful women wore the face of my mother, who was a towering, powerful force of her own."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This was probably unfair given that the most positive figure in my life, my older sister, was also a woman. But the ways our minds interpret pain aren\u2019t always fair. My abuser was a woman, and so I could not trust women. Underneath this was the fact that I also loved women \u2014 but in a way that was \u201cwrong.\u201d Thinking of women hurt me, but I could not stop. I thought about women as I had sex with men. I thought only about women when I watched romantic scenes between women and men. I thought about women in locker rooms, in shopping malls, in train stations. Because I could not think about them rightly, I made these thoughts mean. I imagined the girls I liked as I let men fuck me: Would she look like this? Would she let him do this to her? Would she be better than me? I was uncomfortable with my own lust, so I turned it into a competition. This was what I told girls when I kissed them. \u201cLet\u2019s see who can do it better.\u201d By the end, I always announced that I\u2019d won, though during the actual act of it, I would forget we were supposed to be competing."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I struggle to relate to womanhood as defined by heterosexual women. Mass-media-processed imagery of \u201cgirl power!\u201d encourages us to acknowledge the loving deepness of friendship between women, which will always be stronger than marriages women find themselves falling into. \u201cNot if you marry a woman,\u201d I think to myself. \u201cNot if you fall in love with your best friend.\u201d Never mind the fact that the women penning these think pieces and articles were often the teenagers screeching, \u201cWhy are you looking at me? Are you a dyke?\u201d at girls like me in middle school locker rooms."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When Camille Preaker goes back to her hometown, she is forced to reconcile not only what was done to her, but what she did to other people. Often, people who are hurting like to hurt. As a teenager, I had a specific response to whenever my mother would hurt me. After she was finished, I would go looking for something she loved. My mother always loved \u201cthings\u201d: shelves filled with knickknacks and figurines and ceramic plaques and fragile pottery. I would take one of these things and I would break it. I would throw it at the wall. Smash it with a hammer. Stomp on it with my boots. I would shatter it however I could, and then I would bury it somewhere in the house for her to find. She always knew it was me. She would hurt me again, in punishment. And I would break another thing she loved. Rinse, repeat."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In this way, I was not a good victim, although I was easy. All children make easy targets, even the loud and spiteful ones like me. Children who are abused by a parent are more often abused by their mother. It makes sense in terms of access. In traditional mother/father households, mothers are commonly the primary caregiver. They are left alone with the child more often and for longer. In a single-parent household, the parent is usually the mother."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When I\u2019ve written about my own experience with maternal abuse, I\u2019ve had commenters encourage me to \u201ctry empathy\u201d and \u201chave a relationship with your mom.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Telling a victim of abuse to \u201ctry empathy\u201d with their abuser is outrageous, but common. People cannot accept that a mother might abuse her own child without first having been a victim herself. And my mother was a victim, long before she decided to pass that pain along. And her mother had been a victim too, molested by her father while her mother allowed it to go on. I wonder if that brings my mother any comfort, if it helps her \u201ctry empathy\u201d when she looks at the scars her mother gave her."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Gillian Flynn writes women who do horrible things, and she does not expect or even want us to forgive them. She writes women who hurt other women in poignant ways that cannot begin to compare to any crimes the men in her stories commit. The men in Flynn\u2019s stories are inconsequential, easily supplanted by any other man. They hurt in the usual ways. Women expect men to hurt us. When women hurt other women, it is deep and lasting and influential. In Sharp Objects, Camille\u2019s younger sister Amma says, \u201cSometimes, if you let people do things to you, you\u2019re really doing it to them.\u201d And sometimes you\u2019re doing it to yourself."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When Camille drank her mother\u2019s milk, even knowing it was poisoned, she was thinking, \u201cCome on. Is that the best you\u2019ve got?\u201d As a teenager, I constantly pushed back at my mother, dared her to yell louder, to hit harder, to bruise more. One evening, my mother choked me in the kitchen, and as my vision began to blacken around the edges, I thought, \u201cAt least if she kills me, she won\u2019t get away with it.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Last year, I spent 10 days visiting my sister in Okinawa. Most of my time was spent touring the island. We went to the beach, a pastoral painting of white sand and cotton sky and crystal-blue water, a color scheme I had not believed was based in reality. We went through the cities, architectural spiderwebs of coral roads and geometric buildings freckled with spots of sprawling forest gnawing at the red-tiled roofs."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My brother-in-law had several bottles of different kinds of sake for me to try. One of the bottles held the coiled body of a habu snake, mouth open and ready to strike. The habu snake is a type of pit viper, related to the rattlesnake and very venomous. Its sake, habushu, is made of crushed rice, koji mold, herbs, and honey. The snake is inserted into the liquid, and the aging process dissolves the venom, making it nonpoisonous. There are two methods for inserting the snake: Either the maker simply submerges the snake and lets it drown, in which case its body will not be coiled and posed, or they can freeze the snake. While frozen, the snake is gutted and bled and then sewn up again. As it thaws and gains consciousness just for a moment before succumbing to its injuries, the habu snake will coil and prepare to strike."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1048/1*z-ffPhER_4GGARAjflmGZg.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I held the bottled snake in my hands as my brother-in-law explained this.

Cut into, emptied, and sewn back together like nothing happened."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In Sharp Objects, Camille dreams that her mother has cut her open and taken everything out, sewing her initials into everything before putting it back in again, orderly and clean. A mother\u2019s handiwork turned nightmarish. My own mother would often comb through my room while I was gone, or even sleeping, taking anything she thought I shouldn\u2019t have, innocuous things like skirts and candy. And money, always money. When I asked her if she had seen the missing items, she blamed me. \u201cYou never take care of your things,\u201d she scolded. Later, I would find them in the dumpster outside or hidden in the back of her hamper. These are the things you have to do, when you cannot trust the person who is supposed to care for you: Dig through dumpsters and dirty clothes, searching among the trash and filth for proof you aren\u2019t crazy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "On my last day in Okinawa, my sister packed me a bento box to take on the plane. She filled it with golden kiwi, naan, and beni imo, an Okinawan sweet potato with flesh as purple as a cracked geode. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be hungry.\u201d Food as an act of love, a statement of care, the sort of act a mother might perform. My sister, a mother, is the bar by which I compare all others. When my niece announced she wanted to shave her head of beloved auburn curls, my sister gamely fetched a pile of hairstyle magazines for her to thumb through and choose between. While my mother was teaching me that love is conditional, my sister was packing my lunch."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Anne Sexton wrote about the pain of womanhood and motherhood. Sexton sexually abused her daughter Linda for many years.

In it, my mother and I lived together in an old house, and we knew each other in a way I now realize we never will. The dream itself was innocuous: We watched a movie. We made a pie. I fetched her pain medication for her knees and held her hand as she fell asleep. But the love and the trust that swelled between us was overwhelming. It was all I had ever wanted. On realizing it was not real, I began to wonder about that gentle dream mother who looked like mine. Had she had a mother who loved her too?
