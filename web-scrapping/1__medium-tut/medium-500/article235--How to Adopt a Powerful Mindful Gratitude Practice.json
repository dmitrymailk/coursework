It leads to a perspective shift, which feels like we stepped into a new dimension of existence. Isn\u2019t it wonderful how we can change how we see things and everything changes?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Being grateful for little things can be a big deal. We open our eyes to the bigger picture. We see everything as a gift. I appreciate the convenience of a refrigerator light or nail clippers, for example."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My first AA sponsor introduced me to gratitude lists in 2003, when I was newly sober. She suggested I write down five things I\u2019m grateful for, then share them. I was grateful for my favorite grey fuzzy sweater and my dad. I\u2019m sure sobriety was probably on my list."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Years later, I made colorful, extensive lists with my gel pens. I used to write these columns daily in a spiral notebook. I write them the same way these days. I include big concepts and simple pleasures, like patience and dark chocolate."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Here are a few ways to adopt and nourish your mindful gratitude practice:"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Pay attention to the seemingly insignificant"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When you place your focus on the little things, you shine a light on the rest of your life. Think of how easily we fall into a negativity trap. You can fall into the appreciation zone just as easily."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The other day, I noticed the feeling of my bamboo toothbrush against my teeth and the flavor of my homemade tooth powder. I made it with baking soda and essential oils, and a little bit of coconut oil. I reveled in my delight as I dropped into the present moment of brushing my teeth. I usually forget how it feels to brush my teeth. I don\u2019t notice the taste or sensations because my mind is elsewhere."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My next thoughts were crucial. I emphasized the gift of having a comfortable, affordable, eco-friendly toothbrush, and having knowledge and supplies for the tooth powder. I was astounded by the power of this practice. It came to me organically. I\u2019ve practiced gratitude for years, but this time was a new layer of feel-good life enhancement."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Think of the implications. If we can focus our energy on everything working for us, we create an entirely new reality for ourselves. And we can access this tool anywhere, anytime."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Most of us go through the motions of rising from our bed, cooking, eating, and more. When we become conscious of our daily activities, we have the ability to transmute the mundane into a miracle."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Look around. You likely have a comfortable, clean bed, enough clothes, and all the supplies for health and hygiene. You probably have things to entertain and educate you, like books and movies.

Take a moment to appreciate them, and your world brightens."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Breathe in, breathe out"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Mindfulness meditation involves a focus on the breath. Anytime your attention wanders, you redirect your focus to the breath. Observe your thoughts without attaching to them, then go back to noticing your breath. It\u2019s helpful to place your hand on your belly to feel your natural breathing rhythm."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You can use mindfulness techniques when you\u2019re active. It doesn\u2019t have to be a silent sit-down affair. You can bring mindfulness with you anywhere. Use mindful breaths throughout the day, to remind you of your \u201cnow\u201d moment. It\u2019s hard to stay present if your attention is on the past or the future."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Mindful breathing simply means you\u2019re paying attention to your inhale and exhale, without trying to control it. You\u2019ll notice when you\u2019re feeling tense and when you\u2019re relaxed. I\u2019ve felt low-grade anxiety throughout the day, and I can feel it as I share this with you. It came out of nowhere, so it\u2019s likely an unconscious energy exchange. Focusing on my breath alleviates the associated discomfort."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The intention behind mindful breathing is noticing your breath with no attachment. It\u2019s also the best way to bring your attention back to the moment. Life\u2019s happenings can distract us from staying present. Mindful breathing will help you ground and center into the now."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When you\u2019re living in every now moment, you\u2019ll see things you hadn\u2019t noticed before.

Appreciate your body\u2019s ability to handle breathing without your effort. Isn\u2019t it amazing?"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Sit in silence"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Meditation is so simple, people tend to wonder if they\u2019re missing something. If you focus on the present for three seconds, you\u2019re meditating. If you sit for three minutes, you\u2019re meditating."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sitting in silence ensures you\u2019ll slow down and heighten your awareness of your surroundings and circumstances. When you do nothing, your mind has a chance to recalibrate. You\u2019ll notice ideas and solutions come more easily. You relax and calm your nervous system."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Stare out the window. Sit on your bed with closed eyes. Your mind might be running a mile a minute. Observe your initial inner chatter without attachment. Eventually, your thoughts will settle."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Silence allows for a new perspective to emerge. Instead of lack and frustration, you\u2019ll feel abundance and peace."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Write a list and share it with others"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Make a list of at least three things to appreciate right now. For example, I\u2019m grateful for birds chirping, a clean house, and fresh air. Then share it with one person. Share it on social media, in a text to a friend, or in person."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When I feel negative, or my kids are grumbling, I\u2019ve developed a habit of saying three good things. I say out loud, \u201cQuick, name three good things,\u201d This can snap us out of our complaint fest and into the beauty of now."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Writing is especially powerful for me. I look back on my gratitude lists when I need an attitude shift. I share with others when I\u2019m overflowing with an appreciation or experienced a profound alteration of my being. I also share when I\u2019m not feeling so great. I talk about the blessings in disguise, silver linings, and hidden gifts."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sharing our appreciation with others spreads goodness everywhere. It can lift spirits and give people hope."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Reading how my friend is approaching her cancer treatment brings me hope. She\u2019s grateful for radiation. She envisions her tumors burning and shrinking. It\u2019s hard to go through treatment, but she\u2019s illustrating resiliency and faith in her process. She\u2019s showing me if she can face this challenge, I can certainly tolerate a finicky cooling system. It\u2019s all about perspective, isn\u2019t it?"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Final thoughts"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Consciously choosing to appreciate the tiny but mighty things in our life will bring about positive change.

Stand in awe of the inner workings of your miraculous autonomic nervous system. This process keeps you alive. What appears to be a simple act is the very nature of our existence."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Find a quiet moment in stillness. Cultivate awareness of the present moment and appreciate being here. Share the beautiful discoveries you\u2019ve made along the way. Do it every day, throughout the day.
