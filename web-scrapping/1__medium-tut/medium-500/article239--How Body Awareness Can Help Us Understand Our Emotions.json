Still, understanding one\u2019s own emotions can be a daily biggest struggle."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "During my PhD studies, I examined research on emotions and aspects, but knowing the theories did not always help me in understanding my own feelings. Why do I feel so bad? Why do I have no desire to do anything? What is this chest pain when somebody hurts me?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I learned that there are ways to increase awareness about what\u2019s happening with our emotions, and how this affects our bodies and our lives. The theory of emotional intelligence (EQ) might offer some solutions. At the heart of the EQ is the idea that control over one\u2019s own emotions starts with the ability to perceive them. Knowing and understanding your emotions, you can healthily manage your mood and open the door to a more mindful and happier life."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The question is, how can we perceive and understand our emotions better? For me, understanding my own emotions started from carefully listening to what my body was trying to tell me."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Body and Emotions"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The idea that our bodies and emotions work hand in hand is not new. The relationship between the two has gained much attention from psychologists. Did you know, for example, that negative emotions can lead to real physical pain? Or that positive emotions can undo some serious heart complications caused by negative emotions?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In other words, whatever happens in your body may influence your emotions and vice versa. Emotions also seem to invoke different sensations around some areas of our bodies."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In one study, participants had to color the parts of a human silhouette in which they felt emotions while watching emotional scenes from the movies. The drawings were then analyzed and combined to plot bodily maps of fourteen primary emotions, from anger to envy."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/5148/1*XfsrLtS_w_sxAQmYzRfbGA.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This was a revelation to me. I had known that emotions had physiological signals, but mostly in the context of facial expressions and different reactions such as sweating or a fast heartbeat. But it\u2019d never occurred to me that we tend to link our bodily sensations to different emotions and vice versa."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Although psychologists are wary about saying that emotions genuinely live in these areas of our bodies (read How Emotions Are Made if you want to get an introduction into the topic), the fact is clear \u2014 this chest pain you may feel when you\u2019re sad is as real as it gets."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If so, what does it mean?"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Enter Body Awareness"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The fact that we can feel real pain from strong emotions suggests that monitoring one\u2019s bodily reactions and accompanying emotions might enhance emotion perception."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Very often, we go through life without paying much attention to how we feel and what we feel."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Stress at work, the tension in the relationship with your partner, and one deadline after another make us insusceptible to any kind of drama, but only until it\u2019s too late to fix what\u2019s been long broken."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As a result, our emotional pain overwhelms us, and we chase it with pills, drinks, and other habits, ruining not only our health but also social relationships.

I also do it to practice to recognize my emotions promptly and to manage them more mindfully."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For example, when I feel that because of the tension in the relationships with my partner I feel down (usually I feel weakness in my extremities and chest pressure in these moments), I realize that instead of lying on a couch with the phone in my hands it\u2019s better to go for a walk in the park or for a bicycle ride. It won\u2019t help to improve the relationships, of course. But it will let me switch the context and improve my mood, which can help me later in fixing what\u2019s broken. At least, partially."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "My Emotion-Bodily Sensations Cheat Sheet"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Every emotion is unique.

From my experience, I know that some emotions tend to share physical sensations, which can make it challenging to identify the exact emotion."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The key, however, lies in practice. I noticed that with time I became more sensitive to what I felt and was able to use more words to describe how I feel both to myself and to my partner."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Below is my list of bodily reactions associated with different emotions. It\u2019s based on my personal experience, but I hope that you may find it useful too."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Anger"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Anger is a powerful emotion that we usually experience when something is against our goals or expectations. To be honest, I hate feeling angry.

Joy broadens our attention and helps us to be open to new experiences."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Joy is a strong emotion that involves all of the body parts (see the image above).

Some studies show that love may encompass many positive emotions, from the interest in a person to the joy of sharing breakfast with them to gratitude for being together."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Nevertheless, very often, the feeling of love results in bodily reactions that are similar to fear.
