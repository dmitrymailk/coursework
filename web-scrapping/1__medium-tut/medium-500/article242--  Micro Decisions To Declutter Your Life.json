Sure, it is uncomfortable to let go of anything, but it is a crucial step to unfold our best selves."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Unleashing our true creative potential is much more challenging in cluttered workspaces, messy homes and overflowing wardrobes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Wonder how we go to clutter in the first place?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "These are not the big decisions of choosing a partner or buying a property. Micro-decisions that we make throughout the day have an under-recognised impact on our physical and mental clutter."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "1. Design a system for your used dishes"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Imagine you came across the perfect way to turn chocolate into divine, heavenly cupcakes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Or a shockingly easy recipe to the most delicious, flavoursome eggs for your next breakfast."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now imagine you rush enthusiastically to create those masterpieces in your kitchen and find a sink full of used dishes. You decide no recipe is worth the hassle and settle for your nearest bearable takeout."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "On some level, no matter where you are in life, all of us find indescribable pleasure in home-made, wholesome meals. Cooking can be an excellent outlet for creativity, satisfaction and fulfilment."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sure, not all of us have Michelin-starred skills, but the joy of food prepared with care is universal.

Yet, we continue to clutter our screen with multiple avenues of information, growing distracted each time we lookup."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Many of us have a habit of keeping specific tabs open in our browsers permanently. For some, its the local news source, for others it\u2019s social media. We covet the positive reinforcement of a new notification or the curiosity of news. If we\u2019re not in the loop, we are missing out."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Staying informed is not wrong."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Trading constant stimulation and chatter for deep, uncluttered work is."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Action: Secluding your work to one or two tabs in your browser is the easiest way to keep your virtual desk organised.

Instead of the usual forgettable subject lines of a sale/new product, the personal touch made for a successful clickbait."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Looking back, I overlooked marketing emails as all the same, but they were a constant source of my-inbox-mental-noise."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I didn\u2019t care about the newest Sephora product. Yes \u2014 I once purchased something from them, but we don\u2019t have an ongoing relationship, and I don\u2019t need a new \u201cmust-have\u201d every week."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It might seem small, but protecting your inbox from useless chaos gives you a sense of control. You take charge of an essential aspect of your daily digital consumption."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Action: Instead of putting off the unsubscribing to a time slot in your planner, use the same amount of time doing it right away.

Through clothes, I was comforted by my familiar past self and hopeful for a better tomorrow."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The truth is, when we hold on to clothes that no longer fit us or probably never will, we buy into a low-key, insidious contempt of our currently healthy, breathing, living bodies."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We are no longer the person in our high school sweatshirt."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We cannot stay gripped in the ultimate fantasy of fitting into the expensive jeans bought five years ago to make the investment worthwhile."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Action: Create a curated wardrobe of pieces that flatter your body and aligned with your personality.
