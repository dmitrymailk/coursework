It is so cute! It\u2019s got an old bench seat across the width of the truck. It has a stick shift on the wheel shaft. Extremely basic knobs. Roll down windows. No air conditioning or heat. But it stays surprisingly cool in the summer with the windows rolled down and warm in the winter from the engine heat."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We smile when we go for a drive. It\u2019s got a nice sound and a nice feel. We smile because it makes us slow down physically and mentally."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It. Just. Makes. Us. Smile. So. Much."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And, apparently, makes most everyone else who sees it smile, too."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We get waves, thumbs-ups, and lots of \u201cGreat truck!\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I love that we can spread a little sunshine from just an old truck."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When my husband and I play tennis together, we drive it to the tennis courts."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Last year, we drove it to the tennis courts, played tennis together, and decided to drive through town on the way home.

In order to replace the fuel gauge, he needed to pull out the steering wheel, and just didn\u2019t want to bother with it yet. It was a big project he was putting off.

Another great thing about this problem."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "University police drove by twice, rolled down the window, and just asked if we were okay. No tickets, citations, scoldings, or warnings. We were taking up the whole sidewalk in a remarkably busy part of town.
