{"title": "Trying to Conquer Your Chattering Mind Is Futile \u2014 Do this Instead", "data": [{"type": "subtitle", "content": "It\u2019s about observing, not conquering."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Most people on this planet are \u201cstuck in their heads\u201d most of the time. Thoughts about the past, worries about the future and just plain trivial BS dominate most peoples\u2019 moments. That\u2019s the bad news."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The good news is that past years have seen an upsurge in public awareness that this state of affairs is not a good thing. For millennia before this, people just accepted that their minds were who they were and didn\u2019t see this as particularly concerning. The boom in meditation and mindfulness (MM) has the world trending in the right direction."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A common beginner mistake"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But many wading into the incipient stages of MM have a faulty understanding of what the true game plan is. They identify, correctly, that the mind and all of its injurious, involuntary thinking, is the main culprit. And they think, logically, that the way to approach this problem is to try and overcome, or conquer, this mind that has caused them so much grief throughout their lives."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "How does this strategy manifest? In meditation, people say to themselves, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s focus on stopping my crazy mind from thinking\u2026\u201d This may work for a short while, but then the thoughts inevitably come charging back with a vengeance."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In practicing mindfulness it comes out when, for example, someone is out in nature and says, \u201cWow. What a beautiful sunset. Let\u2019s just stop thinking and be present with it\u2026\u201d This also ends in frustration and increased thought traffic."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Observe, don\u2019t conquer"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The point is that the human mind cannot be wrestled into submission by direct action. So what is the best strategy for slaying our noggin dragons? Simply learning how to observe your thinking mind. That\u2019s it. Don\u2019t conquer it, observe it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What that requires is self-evident: You need to separate the real, conscious you from the egoic, thought machine you (i.e., the mind). You to need separate the subject (real you) from the object (not real you thinking mind)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Unfortunately, doing this is difficult. Why? Because we\u2019ve been stuck in our heads believing we are our thoughts for as long as we can remember. I can\u2019t think of a harder habit to break than stopping myself from getting sucked into my thoughts. It happens so automatically for most of us that it\u2019s hard to notice and therefore hard to prevent."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There\u2019s a reason for the chattering mind"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s important to acknowledge that the mind produces all these thoughts for a reason. It is desperately trying to make things \u201cokay\u201d for us. It uses all of our past experiences as data points in determining what thoughts will result in an okay you. The problem is that the mind is almost always wrong."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Fine. So we\u2019ve concluded that the chattering mind is injurious to our well-being, that trying to conquer it is futile and that the best solution is to observe it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That leads to the inevitable question: How do you teach yourself to detach from and observe your mind? Answer: You do it by practicing meditation and mindfulness correctly."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The key: nonjudgmental observance"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Both of these practices at their essence are about nonjudgmentally observing what is happening in the present moment. In meditation that means following your breath, listening to that truck that just drove by and, most important for our purposes, noticing the thought I just had about my tennis match yesterday. The tennis thought is no different than the truck sound or the breathing. It\u2019s just something that isn\u2019t me appearing in my field of awareness soI treat it as such."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Fortunately, the more we meditate and just observe our thoughts as something that is as separate from who we are as a speeding truck, the quieter the mind becomes. It takes a while, but slowly and surely, it happens."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And as it does, you become calmer, less anxious, more focused and, best of all, more content."}], "topic": "mindfulness"}
