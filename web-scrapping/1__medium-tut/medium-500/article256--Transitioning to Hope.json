It is a deep longing, when there is nothing to yearn for, a dull ache in the soul."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It is a heaviness that numbs your limbs and makes you lie on the floor in the middle of the day, with nothing in your mind but the weight of your body and the cool tile floor."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When you lie there and listen to the world continuing on around you, the question of value, your value, rises to the surface. If you weren\u2019t here would anyone be at all concerned.

I mourned the loss of a partner that I could share their lives with and mine, having no one to share the day to day details \u2014 the happy and the sad, the ridiculous and the ironic. Instead, I kept them to myself, savoring them in isolation."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There is sadness in knowing that you have very few friends and in knowing that you are considering cutting ties to new friends \u2014 or people you thought were friends, but maybe not."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Mono No Aware is Japanese for sadness that comes from the passing of time and how transient our life is. Literally, it is the \u2018pathos of things\u2019.
