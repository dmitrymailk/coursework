And I know this doesn\u2019t sound particularly triumphant, but give me a couple paragraphs. I\u2019m a Rite Aid frequent flyer due to my insatiable appetite for candy corn year-round (if anyone says it is seasonal, they are dead ass lying to you and they are not a good friend) and because I have a collection of mental illnesses that require refill after refill after refill. Rite Aid is legit one of my happy places. Everyone who works there is super friendly. From the sales associate who trained his pet birds to say \u201cbye bitch!\u201d when he leaves for work, to Mike the Pharmacist who is an all-around good guy. There have been a few times when my psychiatrist didn\u2019t send in a new script for my medication and since bipolar waits for no one, I\u2019ve teetered on the brink of a brain collapse. But luckily in these situations Mike will spot me a few antipsychotics until everything is sorted out. Again, solid dude. Once I proposed we market a Snickers bar stuffed with klonopin, and while he did say no, there was definitely a pause. I also really like Rite Aid\u2019s collection of lawn ornaments. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I wanted to walk out of there carting a sparkly gnome that also glows in the dark. But, where was I? Oh! Yeah, I\u2019m brave."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Since COVID \u2014 19 has been plaguing the world I\u2019ve been playing my part. I stay at home lying on a canopy bed made of toilet paper. I know all hugging has been suspended until further notice so I just walk around with my arms wiiiide open without touching anyone. I wash my hands down to the bone so I have delightful skeleton fingers, perfect for holding candy corn. When I walk my dogs and someone is coming my way I haul ass to the other side of the street, and yeah, I think that\u2019s everything. Upstanding citizen over here! If you\u2019re curious why I didn\u2019t list my mask protocol, it\u2019s because I don\u2019t wear one."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*Pv0JJMklsM46RoJZK24jiw.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Don\u2019t turn on me! I had you captivated with my wit and charm and that whole Snickers thing and now I feel like I\u2019m losing you. I have a good reason why I don\u2019t mask up. I don\u2019t leave the house. I started out pledging my love and loyalty to Rite Aid because I love errands. Walking down aisles, checking things out, smiling and head nodding at my fellow shoppers because we\u2019re having the thrill of a lifetime ambling around the produce section. Errands make me feel productive and purposeful and when it comes to an outing, I quickly volunteer, which is fine with my husband who would rather play online poker than fight a soccer mom for the last bunch of cotton candy grapes (that\u2019s a real thing and they are delicious and definitely worth fighting for). But much to my dismay and heartbreak I\u2019ve been staying home. Quarantining my errand dreams. And unfortunately, I have a really good reason why I\u2019m staying at home and why my mask is lying listless by the front door."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When I was a kid I was molested by a neighbor. I\u2019m not getting into the details because this is my trauma, this is my story, and I don\u2019t owe anyone anything. I survived and here I am. But I\u2019m here with my PTSD. I\u2019m here with nightmares. I\u2019m here with flashbacks. I\u2019m here with panic attacks. Recovery is not linear, so some days, weeks, months are symptom free, but there are triggers everywhere \u2014 some that I can\u2019t avoid \u2014 like a pandemic that requires wearing a mask."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I had forgotten what it felt like to be gagged. To be suffocated under the strain of his cigarette stained fingers. To be trapped, stuck, caught, whatever you want to call it. I remember the fear, I remember crying, but I forgot what it physically felt like when he would stretch his hand over my mouth so I wouldn\u2019t cry too loudly. I couldn\u2019t see, I couldn\u2019t breathe. I forgot what it was like to be imprisoned in your own body. Masks trigger my pain and transport me to another time. Of being a kid again. His fingers were a mask to keep me limp and obedient. A feeling and an aspect of fear that lay dormant for a while, now viscerally haunting me again. You see a surgical mask, a bandana, a custom mask from Etsy, a mask made by a crafty friend or loved one, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling of his heavy hand wrapped around my face."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The first time I put a mask on I had a panic attack. I thought it would be uncomfortable and definitely didn\u2019t think it would be so fucking terrifying. My panic attack blurred into a flashback and all of a sudden I had to run back inside my house. My breathing was choppy and I ripped the mask off my face. My husband was sitting on the couch and ran to me as I sunk to the floor, hugging my knees, crying my eyes out, and trying to be as small and invisible as possible. I clunked my head against our door and wondered how I could take control of the memories, the feelings, and live in this masked world."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1500/1*ZDL6yGLtBRHfyEjW7nDQhA.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let there be therapy! As a good friend once told me, therapy is exercise for the soul, so I\u2019ve basically been an American Ninja Warrior since high school. My calves are pretty impressive. Haha, not really, but I am very self-aware after all of this hard work. As I chatted with my therapist via FaceTime, I told her I didn\u2019t know what to do. How the anxiety of these feelings coupled with these memories were stalking me, threatening to take over my life. Cue my wise therapist/American Ninja Warrior coach. My therapist recommended trying on the mask for small intervals. Just so I could get used to it. Build tolerance to my mask induced PTSD. So I started wearing it in the safety of my own home. When my chest tightened, when my breathing sped up, when the panic started, I would take off the mask and sit on the couch. Pet my dogs. Hug my husband. Look at sloth videos. It sucked, but I wanted to own this. I missed going to Rite Aid. I missed my routine. I didn\u2019t want the memory of him to limit my life, to constrict my freedom. Because I am free and I\u2019ve always been a fighter even when I have to wear a mask."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Today I went to Rite Aid. This doesn\u2019t sound particularly triumphant, but it is. I drove down the street with my purple mask in my bag. I parked my car. I hooked the elastic bands over my ears. I looked in the mirror at my eyes peeking above the cloth. There were no fingers. There was no force. No pain. Just a mask to keep me and everyone else safe. I was still free. I\u2019m not going to lie; it was really hard. But I did it. I walked in, grabbed a gallon of milk and a Cadbury egg, paid the cashier and left. No one stopped me. My fear didn\u2019t stop me. My PTSD didn\u2019t stop me."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Told you I was brave."}], "topic": "mental-health"}
