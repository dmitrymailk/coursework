Spoiler alert; it\u2019s essentially because we don\u2019t love ourselves enough to love others in turn. What I didn\u2019t say, though, is how I\u2019m learning to love myself. Note I didn\u2019t say \u2018how I learnt to love myself\u2019 in the finite? That\u2019s because loving yourself is a practice. To use a well-worn cliche, it\u2019s about the journey, not the destination. So, without further ado, here are some of the steps I took on my ongoing journey to love myself. If you\u2019re ready, you might try some of them too."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "I sought therapy"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ve talked publicly about therapy a fair bit because it\u2019s been the single most valuable thing I\u2019ve ever done; and that\u2019s not hyperbole. It changed my life. Why? Because many of us go through life either trying to change our external circumstances to make us happier/more fulfilled/richer/more popular/or [insert another goal]. What people constantly tell us, but we don\u2019t really believe, is that \u2018happiness\u2019 is an inside job. It sucks because working from the inside out is hard. Like really fucking hard. In the past three years, I\u2019ve found myself, at times, completely unraveled. Unpacking your baggage is painful. Yet, I\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat to get where I am today."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I recognise that therapy is a privilege, and one that not everybody can afford. The most pertinent point here, however, is that I was ready to go looking for help.

I do it every single day without fail and it\u2019s probably the single most important \u2018action\u2019 I take to work on my mental health. When I started this work I didn\u2019t know who I was or what I needed. I relied on other people to tell me. I was codependent. While therapy gives you a space to reflect on your own wants and needs, it\u2019s just one 50 minute slot per week. You can take as much space as you need in a journal. I write to reflect. I write to rage. I write to tap into subconscious thoughts. Here are a few exercises to help with the latter;"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Stream of consciousness writing"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Set a timer for 5 minutes and just write. The only rule is that you\u2019re not allowed to stop. \u2018Even if you\u2019re writing \u2018I don\u2019t know what to write\u2019 over and over, keep going and something else will come. You\u2019ll reveal thoughts and feelings you didn\u2019t even know you had \u2014 and admitting your own feelings to yourself is half the self-love battle."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Write with your non-dominant hand"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Because it takes so much effort, writing with your non-dominant hand is another fascinating way to reveal thoughts and feelings you\u2019re not aware of while your mind is busy concentrating on something else. When I do this I like to write a question with my dominant hand (try \u2018how do you feel right now?\u2019 as a starter for ten) and respond with the other. You may be surprised with what you write. These are valuable insights."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Write in the third person"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Writing about yourself in this way can feel mega cringe. But it can also help give you some perspective. We tend to get caught up in our thoughts and feelings and lose sight of the wood for the trees. I often find that writing about myself in this way means that I am much kinder to myself. We\u2019re our own worst critics and each have a little inner asshole, yet we wouldn\u2019t talk to others\u2019 that way. Writing in the third person helps us drop the judgements of our inner critic. Learning to ignore this critic is key to learning to love yourself. Note I said ignore\u2019, not \u2018silence\u2019. When I\u2019ve tried to silence my critic in the past she\u2019s just got louder. The key, for me, has been to let her have her say but to then choose not to take heed. Over time, this has helped kinder, more compassionate voices to get louder."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "I meditate"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When I was first introduced to meditation I hated it. I thought \u2018how the hell am I supposed to silence my mind?\u2019 It became much more valuable when I finally understood that meditation isn\u2019t a thing you can learn to \u2018do\u2019 and it\u2019s not about silencing anything. It\u2019s about developing awareness of what\u2019s going on inside you. It\u2019s a practice."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The point of meditation is to identify how you feel (physically and emotionally) and what you\u2019re thinking about, and then to disidentify from these thoughts and feelings by \u2018noting\u2019 them (becoming aware). This is how I developed a part of my mind I call \u2018the Watcher\u2019. The Watcher is a part of my mind that now watches as thoughts and feelings arise. Often (not always \u2014 it\u2019s a practice remember!) I watch as thoughts or feelings arise. This means that I don\u2019t immediately get caught up in them. I don\u2019t react to them.

I may have seethed or stewed for days. I may have cried or vented for hours. I would\u2019ve \u2018blamed\u2019 the guy in the made-up exchange for my feelings. These days I respond (as oppressed to reacting) and usually get things cleared up in a matter of seconds."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I started meditating using the Headspace app and developed my own practice over time. You could try it on your own first though. Take 5 minutes and focus on your breath. Ask yourself \u2018how am I feeling\u2019 and try to notice when you\u2019ve got caught up in your thoughts. Come back to your breath and repeat. That noticing IS meditation. The more you notice, the more aware you will become. And if you can\u2019t do it at all on some days, that\u2019s ok too. Just keep trying for a few minutes each day."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "I take responsibility"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This was a biggie. And no mean feat. I still struggle with this sometimes and am ever practicing. My therapist once explained boundaries to me in a really simple way.

Nobody can make you feel anything, it\u2019s what happens in your mind that determines how you feel.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I understood this intellectually but grappled with it a lot in the three years that followed. First I had to identify what my thoughts, feelings, ideas, and behaviours were. This led me on a journey to figuring out what I needed and how my needs aren\u2019t being met. From there, I had to learn how to get my needs met. Which leads me to my next point."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "I try to be vulnerable"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is another thing I constantly fuck up but am getting better at with practice. Over the course of our lives we unlearn vulnerability. We get hurt and we gather defence mechanisms to keep us safe. But these defence mechanisms also stop us from connecting to people.

I might say \u201cI just need a friendly ear if that\u2019s ok? I\u2019m not after answers or solutions, I just need to talk it out.\u201d Being able to learn about, and slowly drop, my defense mechanisms has allowed me to practice being vulnerable.

But there\u2019s a bit of a paradox at play here \u2014 we can\u2019t get our needs met by others until we can meet our own needs too. Now when I feel sad I try to sit with it for a bit first. I might cry, mediate, or journal \u2014 sometimes I talk to my imaginary inner child and she asks for a hug. After all that I may still reach out to a friend but the actions I take first are helping me learn to self-soothe \u2014 a crucial life skill that many of us don\u2019t learn as children."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "I surround myself with like minded people"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Not everybody is ready for this sort of work, and some people never will be. If you\u2019re surrounded by cynics and people that blame others for their shortcomings you will find your own self development journey much more difficult. I\u2019m very lucky to be training with a group of like minded people, with whom I feel very safe to talk about \u2018all this stuff\u2019. But I\u2019ve found that my friendship group has changed and morphed around me too. Some people have drifted away, and that\u2019s ok.

Some days I simply cannot stand being alone with my thoughts. And that\u2019s often why we need other people. We treat them as objects to project our shit onto. We might judge them for being angry, instead of admitting our own anger. Being alone, in conjunction with some of the other tips I\u2019ve mentioned, allows us to get to grips with what\u2019s going on inside. It also helps us learn to self-soothe and to meet our needs.

It\u2019s just not possible."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Putting it all together"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s not uncommon for people to talk about the virtues of loving yourself, but having an intellectual understanding of something and actually embodying it are world\u2019s apart. Unfortunately, if you\u2019ve got emotional baggage that\u2019s holding you back (and let\u2019s face it, who hasn\u2019t) there\u2019s no easy fix. Plenty of people opt to turn away from self development and are content to keep their metaphorical fingers in their metaphorical ears. But if you\u2019re ready to take a long hard look in the mirror and take responsibility for your own needs then hopefully some of my experiences can help you get started.
