In such an environment, non-evidence-based ascientific treatments used by a large portion of mental health professionals \u2014 including counsellors, psychotherapists, and even some registered clinical psychologists \u2014 have flourished."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The resulting harm to clients is significant, surprisingly common, and estimated to be vastly under-reported. In order to work with a client with the goal of treating a psychological, mental, or emotional issue, all counsellors, psychotherapists, and psychologists should be registered with an accredited regulatory organization."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To be registered with said organization, the mental health professional must have completed significant, high quality training in science and scientific methodology, and this science training must be core to their graduate education. Without these measures in place, significant harm to clients and loss of faith in non-pharmacological psychological treatments will continue unabated."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Lack of Evidence-Based Psychological Treatments and Graduate Programs"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Recent reports have shown that there is a widespread lack of evidence-based mental health and psychological services and low numbers of evidence-based psychology graduate programs in North America (Lilienfeld, Ritschel, Lynn, Cautin, & Latzman, 2013; McHugh & Barlow, 2010)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There is substantial evidence showing that several clinical psychology graduate programs (especially those run by private, for-profit organizations) do not have high admissions standards, do not provide enough training in science or scientific methodology, and therefore produce graduates who do not know how to conduct their own research or read scientific journal articles (Baker, McFall, & Shoham, 2008)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As a result, these graduates are unable to enter the wider ongoing scientific debate or help to resolve the growing divide between psychology research and practice."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Additionally, a large faction of clinical psychologists, usually thought of as some of the more science-literate members of the mental health field, have been described as displaying a \u201cdeep ambivalence about the role of science and their lack of adequate science training,\u201d leading many of them to base their understanding of their own treatment practices on personal experiences with clients or anecdotal reports from mentors and peers (Baker et al., 2008, pp. 67)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Some are using outdated treatment modalities, like forms of psychoanalytic therapy, to which they have strong emotional attachments.

For example, some symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) typically worsen at the beginning of exposure therapy, and marital altercations can increase at the beginning of couples therapy as couples confront each other on issues that they may not have discussed before. These temporary deteriorations are to be expected as a combined result of the particular presenting problem(s) plus the kind of treatment typically recommended for said problem(s)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Harmful effects resulting from non-evidence-based treatments are different and can lead to overall long-term deterioration in clients\u2019 functioning, an over-dependence on psychoactive medications, and large sums of money being spent to pursue either the same harmful treatment or a string of different unsuccessful ones."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Williams, Turner, and Peer (1985) described acrophobia clients who had experienced debilitating fear of heights that impacted many areas of their lives, with some clients having symptoms that stretched on over several decades.

The average mental health professional would not disagree with the amount of work and clinical trials that go into preparing and testing a new medical treatment before it goes to market, so why do so many of them balk at the necessity of careful and thorough scrutinization of non-pharmacological treatments in their own field (Lilienfeld, 2007; Vaughan et al., 2014)?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And current regulation is clearly not enough, otherwise the spread of harmful and non-evidence-based treatments would not be the ongoing and persistent problem that it has become. For example, the College of Psychologists of British Columbia, to which a mental health professional who has received a doctorate degree in psychology can become registered, will only grant membership (and branding as an official \u201cregistered psychologist\u201d) to BC-based applicants who have received extensive training in scientific methodology and research methods from an educational institution that has been accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association (College of Psychologists of British Columbia, 2015)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, the College\u2019s bylaws do not discuss ongoing surveillance or oversight of psychologists registered with them, and do not state that use of evidence-based practices are necessary for maintenance of one\u2019s status as a registered psychologist. While the College does have a process for clients to submit complaints about registered psychologists who are suspected of acting against the College\u2019s stated values, there is nothing explicitly in their bylaws stating that a member must maintain evidence-based treatments or else risk removal from the College."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A Google search of registered psychologists in British Columbia reveals several members of the College who openly practice non-evidence-based treatments (sometimes as their primary modalities), as shown by their websites\u2019 lists of treatments that they offer to their clients.

The theory behind energy psychology is based partly on egregious misunderstandings and misrepresentations of quantum theory and partly on traditional Chinese medicine, along with other elements cherrypicked from a variety of practices from around the world."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Practitioners of energy psychology believe that psychological disturbances are caused by energy blockages or surges in energy, which are said to be relieved or diverted by way of tapping areas of the body with the therapist\u2019s or client\u2019s hand (Bakker, 2013)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Quick Google searches show that many established and respected registered psychologists have based their careers \u2014 in full or in part \u2014 on treatments that run counter to leading psychological, scientific research."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To guard against this tendency towards pseudoscientific treatments and to repair existing damage, all mental health professionals should be registered with regulatory bodies that ensure adequate high quality training in science and scientific methodology on an ongoing basis. This is currently the only foreseeable way to maintain high quality standards of evidence-based practice and provide an assurance to clients that the therapy they receive will do the least harm possible (and ideally no harm at all)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Regarding education obtained in order to satisfy registration requirements by regulatory bodies, Aarons (2004) found that, generally speaking, mental health professionals who had received the most education are more likely to embrace and practice evidence-based treatments for the extent of their careers.
