Surfaced in yelling at my young child who was small and tired and not at his best. In those moments, I was not the happy radiant being I imagined myself to be. I handed myself over to the monster.

I should have known by then."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The book stated that all of us have a shadow side. Light can only exist where there is darkness. Day can only exist where there is night. We only know and recognize the light by knowing and acknowledging the shadow. We need the opposites. Both sides of the coin.

The beauty and the shadow."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But what exactly WAS the shadow?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I thought of my monster. I did not want it in my life.

It was a process. I compare it to a puzzle of many small pieces. You fit them into the picture, but you cannot see where it is going in the beginning. You get more pieces and put them in.

I cannot remember when it started, possibly during my meditations. There was so much grief and sadness washing over me. It was very strong. I let it go because I simply did not have the power to keep it inside any longer. I finally cried all the tears I had held back for years. Sometimes, I would sob for hours in a row. It did not feel nice. I shook. More and more tears streamed out. There was so much grief, I felt overwhelmed by it. I wailed, sobbed, all the time hoping no one would see me. I did not feel comfortable sharing this part of me, not even with my husband or my kids. I would wait until the house was empty before I sat down to do my daily crying. I would feel a bit better the day after. But there was still so much sadness and grief, I would most likely plunge into a new set of crying the next day. It was exhausting. I felt very tired and overwhelmed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My therapist said it would not be an easy journey. I saw what she meant. But there was no going back.
