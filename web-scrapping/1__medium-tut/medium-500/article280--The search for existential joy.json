As we sit at home, doing our daily risk assessments, doing our best to strike the balance between being responsible and staying sane, anxieties run rampant. Uncertainty abounds. The days blend together; the nights are dark and full of terrors; time loses all meaning. In short: we\u2019re all struggling right now."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But what exactly is the shape of that struggle? What is the structure of our anxiety, of our fear? And how does knowing that help us? This one is pretty heavy on the philosophy, so let\u2019s strap on in."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The philosopher Heidegger (who for all his brilliance was for a time a member of the Nazi party, so, you know, #problematicfaves and all that) distinguished cleverly between fear and what he called Angst. Fear, according to Heidegger, has a particular structure to it: it consists of the subjective experience of fear, a fear of (e.g., a dog) and a fear for (e.g., your face). That is, fear is an experience that is tied very directly to states of affairs in the world. By contrast, Angst consists solely of the subjective experience of fear, but without any particular points of reference in the world itself."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "(You can think of this as analogous to the difference between jumping across a chasm \u2014 the one side and the other, connected by that suspended, airborne instant \u2014 and drifting in an endless void, still suspended and afloat but not really in relation to anything in particular. Alternately, you can think of this as the difference between your muscles flexing to help you stand or walk, and you getting a goddamn charley horse for no goddamn reason.)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This basic formula landed in France, where it was misunderstood by Sartre and laid the foundation for much of what we think of as modern existentialism. By the time it arrived in the English-speaking world, Angst had become \u201cexistential dread,\u201d \u201cexistential crisis,\u201d or the pithier cognate \u201canxiety.\u201d We can think of anxiety, in this philosophical sense, as a fear unmoored from the world, a subjective experience of fear divorced from any particular fear of or fear for."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For Heidegger, a thinking and self-aware being is simply wired for Angst. Angst, anxiety, is not an inappropriate or misfiring experience of fear; rather, fear is a localized and contextualized instance of anxiety. Put another way: it\u2019s not that the experience of anxiety is fear creeping in where it doesn\u2019t belong, it\u2019s that the experience of fear is invoking and applying your anxiety wiring to some real-world situation."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Fear can be rational or not, depending on how logically connected your fear of is to your fear for; Angst, on the other hand, isn\u2019t even irrational so much as it is prerational, since rationality applies only to the relations of objects and concepts. That\u2019s why a fear can be resolved with a reassurance, while an anxiety can only be endured."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "(Bonus round: this is why we pretty consistently find that people with high baseline levels of anxiety cope better rather than worse in actual crisis situations. Being able to attach that subjective experience to actual crisis conditions both retrospectively justifies the feeling and prospectively renders the feeling resolvable.)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What Heidegger doesn\u2019t talk about, and what seems to be missing from much of his existentialist progeny, is an exploration of how this same structure might be replicated across other fundamental human emotions. Heidegger tells us, in effect, that \u201cOur experience of fear is a localized, contextualized instance of our underlying wiring for Angst, and sometimes that wiring is exposed and the machinery just fires on its own,\u201d which is an important insight\u2026 but we can go further."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We don\u2019t have a lot of good words for these underlying protoemotions \u2014 we\u2019re collectively bad at thinking about them, so we haven\u2019t had much occasion to find language for them, either \u2014 but take, for example, the experience of listlessness. When listlessness takes hold, I find myself pacing (always mentally, and usually physically) like a caged animal, reaching for something I can\u2019t name or identify, feeling vaguely unsatisfied no matter what I do. What is listlessness but an existential desire? My desiring wiring is exposed, but without any meaningful relation to anything in the world \u2014 I have the subjective experience of desire, but divorced from any particular object of desire. When depression takes hold, I\u2019m not sad for anyone or about anything; it\u2019s just the underlying wiring revealing itself, doing its background business but suddenly and inexplicably in the foreground."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the same way as anxiety can\u2019t be resolved with reassurance, listlessness can\u2019t be resolved with satisfaction and depression can\u2019t be resolved with cheer.

Japanese has two words \u2014 ureshii and shiawase \u2014 that both translate roughly to \u201chappy\u201d and that mean deeply, critically different things. Ureshii is a reactive happiness, the sort of happiness that you experience when you hear from an old friend or receive a gift or find a quarter in the couch cushions. It\u2019s a localized, contextualized instance of happiness. Shiawase, on the other hand, is the \u201chappily ever after\u201d kind of happiness at the end of a fairy tale, the fundamental and underlying happiness that is revealed when obstructions are cleared away. It\u2019s a happiness that\u2019s not attached to or reliant on any particular thing to be happy about; it\u2019s the happiness we\u2019re wired for and then, by and large, distracted from."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "(Bonus round: this model also neatly describes some of the Eastern notions of enlightenment as a sort of existential acceptance, independent of any particular thing to be accepted.)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This all fits very cleanly into our model and puts existential joy squarely in our sights. But how do we get at it? How do we summon it into the foreground of our lives? Its undesirable cousins \u2014 anxiety, anhedonia, depression \u2014 give us some clues. While they often barge uninvited into our days, they generally do so when we find ourselves in the thinnest places of our worlds, in the places where those wires run closest to the surface because we\u2019ve worn paths into the ground with our frequent visits: places of insecurity, or exhaustion, or trauma. Similarly, we can identify and make a point of spending time in the places where our wiring for existential joy runs closest to the surface."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all prescription here, since even if the wiring were the same, the wear and tear on each individual person is unique. I can tell you that for me, the most reliable path is what I call the banality of coexistence \u2014 this joy for me is most easily found in the companionable silence between intimates, in the casual anticipation of another\u2019s needs, in the sharing of some tea. Maybe yours is more easily accessed through the \u201cthis body is working as intended\u201d of vigorous exercise or the oonts-oonts of a loud club or the enveloping silence of \u201cI\u2019m the only one awake right now.\u201d There\u2019s no wrong place for it to live (unless it lives in places that require you to harm others)."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*Q4KKVJ_4zoWb-YbQi6j0uw.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What you\u2019re looking for is kind of the opposite of whatever \u201csparks joy\u201d \u2014 what you want isn\u2019t just the reactive, localized, contextualized instance of happiness, but the underlying happiness itself. My advice is to look for the most banal places, the places you go most often without thinking about it, that are still in the general neighborhood of happiness. Don\u2019t get discouraged; this isn\u2019t the sort of thing that can be done on demand.
