While the causes of situational depression and clinical depression are different, they both result in the same sort of symptoms."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In this article, I\u2019ll explain some techniques for coping with those symptoms that I\u2019ve learned from a lifetime of bipolar disorder. I\u2019m no less susceptible to existential dread than you are, but I\u2019ve spent a great deal of time learning how to manage it. Being isolated in my own apartment while feeling depressed actually feels pretty normal for me. It happens less than it used to, but it\u2019s still familiar."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There are, of course, many well-meaning articles being put out by qualified doctors or therapists about taking care of your mental health during self-isolation. Unfortunately, most of them tend to say things like \u201cbe kind to yourself!\u201d, \u201cmake a schedule!\u201d, \u201cexercise!\u201d, \u201ckeep busy!\u201d, \u201cremember what you\u2019re thankful for!\u201d, etc. Those things are great if you can do them. But when I\u2019m depressed, that advice is pretty far out of my reach."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I need things that are broken down to a level that helps me get through a bad day, hour-by-hour, with a lot of flexibility. So I\u2019ll go through topics including what \u201cbe kind to yourself\u201d actually involves, how to fill your days when you have a lot of time but not much ability to focus, and what to do when you find yourself overwhelmed and nearly immobile."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Before we get into that, it\u2019s important to note that this does not replace medical advice or therapy. In particular, if you are experiencing thoughts of suicide, please call a hotline such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. If you are trans, I recommend the Trans Lifeline in order to reach support that is understanding of trans issues. Get help now if you need it. Otherwise, on to the advice!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s start with the basics. You can\u2019t get as much done as you used to, even though you have more time. What you\u2019re experiencing is a change in your daily mental, emotional, and even physical capacity, caused by the stress of dealing with the pandemic. Everyday decisions suddenly have potential life-or-death consequences for you and for others. A recent article in Rolling Stone calls this \u201cmoral fatigue,\u201d and notes that in many cases the correct choices are not clear:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The uncertainty around everything, especially if you have lost your source of income, adds to this fatigue. As does the lack of human contact, particularly if you are an extrovert. Even if you are staying indoors with no possible risk of transmission to or from you, these other factors extract a cost from you each day."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One common way people think about this cost is the spoon analogy, a story originally told by Christine Miserandino. She was explaining what it is like to have a chronic illness (in her case, Lupus) to a healthy friend. They were in a cafe, so she gathered up eleven spoons from other tables, and gave them to her friend. They talked through a typical day, with Miserandino taking a spoon from her friend for each activity. They ran out of spoons before getting through the day. Healthy people usually have more than enough spoons for the day. People with chronic mental or physical illnesses often do not."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I regret to inform you that the pandemic is levying a tax on your daily allocation of spoons. Even if you don\u2019t realize it, everything you do is costing you more than it used to. Not just the \u201cmoral fatigue\u201d decisions, but mundane things like getting up in the morning or fixing lunch for yourself. The situational depression that results from all of the stress and uncertainty makes everything harder. But there is good news:"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "You did not suddenly become lazy and unproductive."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You are doing as much or more than you did before the pandemic. But a lot of that \u201cdoing\u201d isn\u2019t the sort of \u201cdoing\u201d that you\u2019re used to thinking about. So you don\u2019t give yourself credit for it, and instead get frustrated with yourself. So remember to give yourself credit. It\u2019s important."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now that the pandemic is consuming many of your spoons, you can help yourself by prioritizing what you want to get done in a day, and accepting that you won\u2019t get everything done that you used to be able to do. Especially on bad days. This is where you\u2019ll hear advice to \u201cbe kind to yourself.\u201d But what is the difference between being kind and being self-indulgent or giving up?"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Being kind to yourself means listening to your mind and body."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When little things seem way too hard, it\u2019s time to take a break. It may be time to take it easy for the rest of the day as much as you can. You can\u2019t convince yourself to have more energy using logic. Trying to \u201cpush through\u201d only consumes more spoons, so save that for real emergencies. Instead, learn what your new capacity is, and manage your daily expectations accordingly."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Keep in mind that you\u2019ll have good days and bad days. This is normal (even without depression or pandemics involved). You won\u2019t have many available spoons on a bad day. If you can, give yourself permission to do a lot less, or even to get nothing done. I find that if I can do that, I\u2019m a lot less frustrated with myself the next day, and start that day with more capacity. A really bad day is your mind and body asking for some serious rest. It\u2019s not being lazy to give yourself that rest. It\u2019s an investment in being able to do more tomorrow."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Everyone\u2019s mood changes during the course of a day. Often, you\u2019ll find that you have a predictable daily cycle. There may be a low point that lasts a couple of hours. On a good day, you\u2019ll just slow down a little during that time, but on a less good day you\u2019ll feel pretty awful. And on a really bad day you won\u2019t be able to do much at all."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Being kind to yourself means working with your daily rhythm."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Maybe it takes you a while to get going in the morning, and jumping right into things doesn\u2019t work well. Or maybe after lunch is your low time. In my case, it\u2019s a few hours sometime around dusk. It\u2019s a vague time range rather than being pinned to either the clock or the sun. But it\u2019s consistently within that range, and sometimes I\u2019ll just inexplicably feel awful during that time."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What gets me through those hours is the knowledge that this is my daily rhythm, and it will pass soon. I may be feeling hopeless despair, but I know it is temporary. So I take a nap, or stare at funny pictures on the internet, or do whatever other mindless distracting thing I can think of. I don\u2019t try to accomplish anything else. When you\u2019re at your low point, your accomplishment is getting through those two or three or whatever bad hours without acting from that place of despair. You don\u2019t want to give up on anyone, or violate physical distancing to seek comfort, or really make any big decisions at all."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Learn when your low times are. Plan around them if at all possible. When you feel particularly down, check the clock and see if it\u2019s near that time. If it is, think of yourself as being stuck on a boring bus ride. You\u2019re not going to get anything useful done, but you will get to the end if the journey in a reasonably predictable amount of time, and things will pick up."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Free time is both great and horrible. Most of us now have more of it than we\u2019d like, and it turns out to be harder to use it the way we\u2019d want than it first appears. We don\u2019t need to be productive every minute of every day, but most of us like to get things done now and then. With the pandemic making everything harder, you probably find you can\u2019t focus on any one thing for very long. Maybe things that you usually enjoy don\u2019t always lift your spirits anymore. As with overall energy levels and daily cycles, the way to handle this is to work with it rather than fighting it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You\u2019ll want to pick three or four-ish ongoing activities to help fill your free time. Then when you can\u2019t focus or get into one of them, you can switch to another.

When in doubt, try any one of these activities."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Pick things that don\u2019t have to be finished on someone else\u2019s schedule, or aren\u2019t things that you \u201cfinish\u201d at all. These are free time activities. You\u2019ll want your activities to require different types of focus. A good pattern is to pick at least one thing that you really want to do, and can make progress on sometimes. Then pick at least one thing that is more passive, like watching all episodes of a particular series. You can use recurring household chores, or you can stick with things you find fun. Having activities that require different kinds of attention increases the likelihood that there will be at least one that will work."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/6912/0*bwX4BRdptzN9CIX7"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Don\u2019t worry about losing interest in activities as long as you have enough to cycle though. In theory, one of mine is to read a specific book, but I just haven\u2019t been able to summon that kind of concentration for several weeks. So I replaced it with \u201cread Wikipedia articles about the evolution of life,\u201d which I don\u2019t bother to try to learn or remember. It\u2019s just fun easy reading in small chunks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What is important is giving yourself credit for whatever progress you make, including activities you might not think of as \u201cproductive.\u201d Constant productivity is over-valued in our society, and rest is under-valued.

That\u2019s an accomplishment."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "With this approach, you might not get as much done on any one project as you\u2019d like, but you will make some progress on each. Putting this intention around the activities, including the \u201cnon-productive\u201d ones helps you feel more in control of your life, without needing to adhere to a rigid schedule. I can\u2019t stick to a schedule even on a good day, but I can remember to keep choosing from a small set of things that I want to do, whenever the time is available."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "All of the above advice works pretty well for most days, even fairly bad ones.

You need to get your body moving at least a little bit. And you need to give yourself some positive feeling of accomplishment, however small.

Right now."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The hardest part is getting started, because you need to find something to write with and something to write on. A phone or laptop will do in a pinch, but they have way too many distractions on them to be ideal.

I just took a look in my bedroom, and I saw these things that I would write down:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Normally, these things are so trivial you wouldn\u2019t bother writing them down, much less breaking any of them into separate written steps.

It doesn\u2019t matter which one, order isn\u2019t important. Check the thing off of the list. Step, step, step. Finding things to do will distract your brain. Doing them will move your body.

If you\u2019re not comfortable posting to everyone, create a smaller filter of trusted friends."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Just keep in mind that not everyone sees every post all of the time, so it might take a while to get responses.

Because otherwise you will get unsolicited advice, and lots of it. It just seems to be how people work. They mean well, but they need guidance. Probably at both the top and bottom of the post. And maybe in the first comment. Possibly in all caps. You\u2019ll get the hang of it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If someone really can\u2019t follow directions, screen them off of these sorts of posts. Delete comments that annoy you. You\u2019re posting to help yourself, you don\u2019t need deal with anyone who is making things worse. At all. Even if your brain is telling you you\u2019re not worth it, set and hold boundaries. Social media can be a lifeline, but you do have to curate your audience to get the right responses."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "These are five of the most important techniques that I use to manage my own expectations and keep myself going through difficult times. To recap:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While I was writing this last bit, I started feeling unsure how to wrap it up and nervous that none of the things here are good advice for other people. I checked the clock and sure enough, it was my daily low point time. I tried looking at silly stuff on the internet but couldn\u2019t concentrate or enjoy it. So I just laid down on my bed and semi-dozed for about an hour."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I was still feeling pretty horrible for most of it, even though two hours prior I\u2019d been thinking that the day had been a really great mental health day. But I know my rhythm and reminded myself that it was temporary. And it was. Eventually I felt more rested, and got up, still feeling a little off. Over the next 30 minutes that \u201cslightly off\u201d feeling faded, and I felt good enough to write these paragraphs. Not as good as earlier, but definitely not bad."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So maybe that\u2019s the best way to end this, with a story of how these are really techniques that I use all the time. I hope they work well for you, but remember that we\u2019re all different and you may need to adapt them or just pick which ones help you and leave the others. Remember that none of this is a substitute for either psychiatric treatment or psychotherapy when those are needed, and you should call a hotline if you need immediate help. But for getting through a stressful time, day by day and hour by hour, I hope this article helps you understand yourself better and gives you some tools to manage this strange new world in which we find ourselves."}], "topic": "mental-health"}
