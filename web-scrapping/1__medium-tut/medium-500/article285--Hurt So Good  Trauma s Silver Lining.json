Not everyone needs to know death at all. And yet, me and death are like this. *cue crossed fingers*"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I didn\u2019t understand life for a long time. At first it was because of my careless caretakers. They didn\u2019t have a handle on life, mine included. They gave me life in the most unintentional way possible: a three-day Scrabble game on cocaine. And if you subtract nine months from my birthday, plus the two days I put my mom through labor, you get Valentine\u2019s Day. What\u2019s more romantic than strategic word puzzles with a fuck buddy? Better yet: What\u2019s more sexy?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Like most people, I feared what I didn\u2019t understand. Eh, more like judged with envy. Most kids at school radiated life, you know, that thing I didn\u2019t understand. They were all smiles, getting along with everyone, going home to parents who might still be together or who at least provided the basic essentials. I hated those kids."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Life to me was survival. Life was death touching me. Death to my serenity, death to my dreams, death to my friendships, death to my voice. Being raised by someone with severe mental illness is death. Being the only one with a neurotypical brain in a household is death. Who you are doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 hell, you don\u2019t exist \u2014 when you\u2019re never acknowledged. Your life, the spark of creativity and youthfulness inside, does not matter when it is shushed, ignored, and neglected. And so I went silent."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I feared what I didn\u2019t understand, so I didn\u2019t ask questions. I didn\u2019t know that other families weren\u2019t like mine. I thought life equated to money and beauty \u2014 the epitome of why the popular kids were popular. And behind closed doors, I figured their parents drank too much, slept all day, and made the kids share one can of Spaghettio\u2019s for dinner. I didn\u2019t know I was being abused and neglected because I didn\u2019t ask."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My poor parenting began to reveal itself as the drugs set in \u2014 the cocaine, the Adderall, the off-brand uppers, marijuana, \u2018shrooms, triples Cs, LSD, salvia . . . Since I already knew death so well, might as well bring drugs to the party. And, since misery loves company, I attracted other dead-headed folk. Together, we \u201clived\u201d it up for ten years. Granted, it was a revolving \u201cwe,\u201d because I consistently killed myself and my surroundings in my evolution to today."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The very magic that allowed me to access painful memories and realizations was what kept me from confronting and healing from them. I was one of those functioning alcoholics but my drug of choice was marijuana. All through high school and college I was stoned. In class, during exams, and probably walking to get my diploma and two degrees. If I hadn\u2019t been, perhaps I\u2019d be a 4.0 student, but I\u2019ll settle with a cumulative 3.89 college GPA. Yeah, I hid my demons well and school was my sanctuary. Life could\u2019ve been a lot worse for me if I wasn\u2019t lucky to not get caught white-nosed and joint-handed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My mind has always been an active one, a thoughtful one. Living so intimately with death has me obsessed with existentialism and the means to which it can be discovered: drugs, astrology, relationships \u2014 anything but church! In an attempt to ground myself during a high \u2014 I know, how naive \u2014 I\u2019d journal. This is how the revelations of abuse and trauma came to be."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I have worked out most things on paper. This is mostly because people don\u2019t want to talk about the hard stuff. I do have to give credit where it\u2019s due, however. I\u2019m looking at you Marilyn, my weekly therapist of two-and-a-half years."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In doing the hard work, I\u2019ve come to discover a pattern of killing myself and beginning anew. In some ways this has become a defense mechanism: no one can get too close to me, I can abandon mistakes, and I can rewrite."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This has served me well until now. Each Tara that I was until today was an unhealthy one. She\u2019d chase boys to fill the void left by her parents\u2019 abandon. First alcoholics who bought drugs from her family \u2014 you know, a familiar face that fit right in with the toxicity I\u2019d been raised with. Then guys who didn\u2019t know their worth. A breakup signified a new Tara emerging, with a one to 24-month gap of heavy drug relapse in-between the next."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The next Tara was always better than the last. Sure, I\u2019d literally grown up, but I\u2019d also become more responsible, more self-aware, and more in-tune with my values. It was in establishing my value system that really set the ball in motion for health. I set boundaries. I knew my worth. I honored my passions and didn\u2019t lose my chameleon self in my relationships anymore."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without my ten-year depression. And the five years I chain-smoked; first Parliaments (because cocaine) then Marlboro Lights \u2014 until they changed to Gold. The three years I spent single and slutty. The nine years I wasted on guys too gay (literally) or toxic or broken. The years I danced with death, 2007\u20132017."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019m grateful for the bad choices I made. I\u2019m also embarrassed, but mostly grateful. By being sweet to my inner child who was just looking for love and acceptance the wrong way, I hear her now and give her what she really needs. I don\u2019t blame her for the promiscuity and the substance abuse; I blame her parents. But we know carrying that hate is a burden, too, so we best stop that shit."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Then again, if it hurts so good, what\u2019s the harm?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I am in the scariest part of my journey, the one in which I am supposedly healed and have to continue a linear path toward life. I\u2019m still triggered by death, but it\u2019s more external than internal. It\u2019s others\u2019 toxicity that says, \u201cHey, remember me? Would you like to go out sometime?\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s tempting \u2014 death. I like it for the nostalgia and escape. But I\u2019m not running anymore \u2014 neither toward my former selves nor from them. Instead, I\u2019m setting down roots. I\u2019m building a foundation. I\u2019ve found my person, my husband, and am living my best life with him and our baby. Yes, we\u2019ve created life! I know it well! I don\u2019t want our daughter to intimately know death. But one day, when she\u2019s old enough, she\u2019ll read about how I\u2019d come to know it and never forget it."}], "topic": "mental-health"}
