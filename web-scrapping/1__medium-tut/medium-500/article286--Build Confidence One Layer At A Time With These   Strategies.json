When you do this, you open yourself up to new experiences and life lessons. These experiences and lessons keep you moving forward. The act of moving forward is in itself a huge reward that boosts your confidence, and the renewed confidence keeps you moving forward. Even failing can build confidence as you overcome obstacles and rise to life\u2019s challenges."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Grow."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Personal growth is a great way to inspire confidence. When something scares you, and you face it head-on, you learn to overcome the fear that is stopping you from being all you can be. Take some time for self-reflection. Is there something that you\u2019ve been avoiding because it\u2019s painful or uncomfortable? By tackling those demons head-on, you will grow in ways you never thought possible into pride and strength."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/6810/0*UmMmdlJgMa47Heko"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Be delusional."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Thinking highly of ourselves actually has an evolutionary function. Psychologists call it self-enhancement bias and it\u2019s our tendency to prop up our egos with irrationally high opinions of ourselves to avoid despair. This handy bit of mental gymnastics is also what leads us to believe we can do things that might be above our pay grade and we all know that half the battle with anything, especially confidence, is the mindset. As long as you get the balance right, a little bit of this can go a long way."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Learn things."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Actively learn something. Do research; ask questions, try to master a new skill. Practice something until you get good at it. When you know you\u2019re good at something, it shows. Remember, anything can be learned, and anything learned can be mastered. It just takes practice."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*k5lhWHqAdO-OCADs"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Get out there."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Put yourself out there more. Make contacts you wouldn\u2019t typically pursue. Purposefully raise the bar for yourself. Making contacts is helpful in every area of life; the more people you know, the more opportunities you will have to build relationships. The more connections you have on the go, the more feedback you\u2019ll get, and the more doors that will open. As the doors open, you\u2019ll start to realize just how much you have to offer."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Be optimistic."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Being optimistic makes you feel hopeful and eager. It gives you that \u201ccan do\u201d attitude. Sometimes half the battle is how you think about something. When you feel hopeful, there is a trickle-down effect that colors everything else. Being optimistic boosts confidence because when the future looks bright, good things are unavoidable."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/13440/0*25MftdOHHFp-T-nQ"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Rock your best points."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Do you have piercing eyes and a killer wit? Amazing curves and an IQ to boot? Are you the wise one who always has sage advice for the broken-hearted? Whatever it is that makes you uniquely you, rock that part and make it shine. There is nobody like you, and that will always be your greatest asset, so don\u2019t hold back. Give it some thought, figure out what you love most about yourself, and then embrace that and share it with the world."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Confidence isn\u2019t about putting up a facade. It\u2019s about knowing who you are and something that you can work on and strengthen. It can be cultivated and developed layer by layer like an oil painting that gets richer and more complex with each layer."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Start building those layers one by one so that you can be the person who commands the room with supreme confidence."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Thanks so much for reading!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you\u2019d like to read more articles that uplift and enlighten, join us here on ILLUMINATION.
