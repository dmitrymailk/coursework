As I rounded the corner, my jaw went slack when I laid eyes on her. In the driveway, with the sinuous grace of a cat, sat a pristine 1983 Porsche 928 in the exact color combination Tom Cruise drove in my favorite movie, Risky Business. I peddled faster and flung my bike and backpack onto the fresh-cut lawn. Wow, Mom and Dad, you\u2019ve outdone yourselves."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I removed my AirPods from my ears, last year\u2019s birthday gift, and deposited them in my pocket as I approached her. Everything from that point moved in slow motion. Her immaculate metallic bronze finish glistened in the afternoon sun. As I caressed her curvaceous hind end, my pulse slowed, our souls connected. The driver\u2019s door opened with the slightest of effort. I settled down into the smooth-as-melted-chocolate driver\u2019s seat and closed the door with a luxurious thunk. The outside world all but disappeared. We were one."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My gaze fell across the word \u201cPorsche\u201d splayed across the center of the steering wheel in large font as if one needed to be reminded of the German masters that built such a work of art. I reached up and turned the key hanging from the dash. She took a breath and exhaled with a glorious deep-throated growl, idled back, and waited like a lioness on the prowl bedded down in the Saharan grass. She transferred a subtle vibration into my body through the seat, reminding me of our deep connection. I can\u2019t wait to break you in, baby."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As I opened the center console, I chuckled and thought, They thought of everything. I examined its contents: a pair of black Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses, a box of Tic-Tacs, an assortment of cassette tapes including the soundtrack from Risky Business, and, wait for it, a brand new pack of condoms. My cheeks burned hot as I envisioned what must be coming later this evening from Dad, the dreaded \u201ctalk\u201d that I had been successful in avoiding until now."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I popped two Tic-Tacs into my mouth, removed the Risky Business tape from its case, and slid it into the Blaupunkt stereo. The player drew it in and moved it into place with a satisfying clunk. In no time, Bob Seger\u2019s \u201cOld Time Rock & Roll\u201d filled the cabin. I cranked up the volume, eased the seat back, and closed my eyes, as Tom Cruise (a.k.a., Joel Goodsen in the movie) danced across his living room in his tighty-whities."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Our special moment was rudely interrupted by a forceful knock on the window. I opened my eyes to see my older sister leering at me. The door flung open, and she yelled, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing in Joel\u2019s car? Get out. Now!\u201d I deduced the towering hunk behind her grinning at me was her boyfriend du jour. Of course his name is Joel, I thought as I switched off the engine, ejected the cassette, carefully returned the ancient artifact to its plastic abode with the same care a Louvre museum curator would take moving the Mona Lisa, and stepped out of his car."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m sorry.

Happy Birthday.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cThanks, man,\u201d was all I could muster as I watched him get into his car, put on his Ray-Bans, and fire her up.

Feeling like a jilted lover, I spun around, retrieved my backpack, and sulked into the house, at least grateful to avoid \u201cthe talk\u201d for a while longer. Suddenly, the bumper sticker message hit me, a reference to my favorite line of the movie."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "With the house all to myself, and the message the universe so kindly beamed into my head, I took off my shoes and jeans, walked over to the living room mirror, and popped up my shirt collar. In my Star Wars boxers, I blasted \u201cOld Time Rock and Roll\u201d from Dad\u2019s stereo and channeled Tom Cruise as I slid across the hardwoods, holding my mock microphone at the ready as the song\u2019s piano intro played through. I bobbed my head to the beat, gyrated my hips, and lip-synced around the room. Mid-concert, I jumped on and off the sofa, spun around, and found Mom grinning at me from the entry hall. I froze."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cDon\u2019t stop on my account,\u201d she teased in a monotone."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "With an outstretched hand, I dropped my fake mic, grabbed my stuff, and finished the performance in my bedroom."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sometime later, after Dad arrived home from work, my parents celebrated my birthday with takeout from my favorite Chinese place and a cake. I could care less that my brat of a sister was too well to attend. My latest crush, Joel, however, would have been most welcomed. I made a wish and blew out the candles, trying my best not to spit on the cake. And, you know what I wished. Don\u2019t even ask."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After cake, my dad handed me a set of car keys and said, \u201cHappy birthday, son.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My eyes went wide, and I ran out of the front door.

Joel\u2019s old POS lost that decades ago."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I yelled out, \u201cI\u2019m going to take her out for a spin. I\u2019ll be back in a few.\u201d A deep-throated rumble that didn\u2019t quite match her diminutive size exited the dual exhausts as I started the engine. I paired my phone to the stereo, began playing the Risky Business soundtrack, and slipped on my Dollar General sunglasses. As I backed out of the drive, I gave a wave to my parents standing at the top of the driveway. They waved back with tears in their eyes, looking like they were sending me off to war."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A couple of blocks from my house, Ben Aldus, the most popular guy from my high school, was jogging towards me on the sidewalk. Team quarterback, homecoming king that dated the homecoming queen/head cheerleader, and hot AF. You get the picture. I was on the basketball team. Football and basketball players didn\u2019t commingle at my school. The football players were higher on the food chain. I\u2019ve known Ben since kindergarten, but he hasn\u2019t uttered a word to me or even looked my direction since the infamous dodgeball incident in sixth grade. I swear, I lost focus from the game for only a second. Ben beaned me in the side of the face so hard I lost consciousness. When I came to, Ben was down on the ground hovering over me, apologizing, and asking if I was ok. The entire side of my face was bruised for a week; my ego never recovered. And, yes. Ben was already handsome in sixth grade. I knew right then and there, I liked guys too."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Ben looked my way as I approached him, our eyes locked.

He left me in the den to play \u201cDoom\u201d and went off to shower. He conveniently left his beer on the end table and returned for it, wearing only a towel. I lost focus from the game and got my player killed. I obviously didn\u2019t learn my lesson in sixth grade. While he showered, I texted my mom to tell her where I was so my parents wouldn\u2019t send out an all-points bulletin."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We ended up watching Risky Business as his bulldog, Miss Vanjie, snored between us on the sofa. I reached out to pet her as we watched the scene when Joel and Lana make love on the empty train. The mesmerizing melody of Tangerine Dream\u2019s \u201cLove on a Real Train\u201d played in the background as I felt my hand brush Ben\u2019s, noting he didn\u2019t flinch. I felt my heartbeat rise to my throat as I embodied my new mantra and placed my hand next to his and let it linger. He put his hand on top of mine and laced our fingers. I turned to face him."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Ben leaned over Miss Vanjie, placed his hand under my chin, and pulled me toward him into a kiss. As our lips touched, we both held our breaths from the shock of the initial impact. I explored Ben\u2019s mouth with my tongue and felt his moan vibrate into me before his lips curved into a pleased smile. That kiss was added to my list of best things in life. I moved over and knelt in front of him. Ben\u2019s legs fell open, and I settled myself between them. I combed my hands through his thick sandy blond hair as his gaze moved from my eyes to my lips. He grabbed my buttocks, pulled me against him, and followed through with another searing kiss, throwing his whole upper body into it. I buried my face into the nape of his neck and felt Ben\u2019s thudding pulse. He smelled of an expensive cologne, earthy with a hint of citrus."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Ben took my hand and murmured, \u201cYou want to stay the night?\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I replied using Joel\u2019s line in the final scene of the movie, \u201c\u2018I\u2019d really like that.

We left Miss Vanjie sleeping on the sofa, moved into his bedroom, and had sex while \u201cLove on a Real Train\u201d played softly on a loop in the background. I woke just before sunrise with Ben burrowed up against me, one of his legs and arms draped over mine, in a warm hug, nothing left untouched. Miss Vanjie was snoring on the far side of Ben. I added that feeling to my best-things-in-life list."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Much to the dismay of our girlfriends, Ben and I ended up spending the entire weekend together. Soon after, we hurtled into a top-secret romance and were inseparable through the remaining months of our Senior year. We even double-dated to the prom and ended up back at my place at two am after we dropped off our dates. Damn, we looked good together in our tuxes. To keep this G-rated, let\u2019s just say it was a prom night for the ages. We started using the L-word with each other that night and came up with a secret handshake we used in public that meant the same.
