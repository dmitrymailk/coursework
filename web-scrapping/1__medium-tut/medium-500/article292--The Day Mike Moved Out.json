Technically he decided three months prior when he signed an apartment lease. But on Friday, the morning of June 6th, as Mike squirted shaving cream onto his face and slid his razor down the white sheath, like a snowblower clearing the sidewalk, Mike knew. Today had to be the day."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "June 6th in Mike\u2019s kitchen looked no different than June 5th. His wife, Theresa, wore a faded Led Zeppelin t-shirt, a souvenir from the first concert she and Mike attended together, except now dried vomit stained the sleeve. She didn\u2019t look up when Mike entered, but the two hardly interacted since Mike relocated to the guest room. Theresa\u2019s sandy hair sat on her head like a bird\u2019s nest as she rocked Joey, their crying, eight month old son. The baby\u2019s beady eyes pierced Mike\u2019s, like he had a premonition to Mike\u2019s plans."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Mike rotated towards the counter. He stared at the hand-woven fruit basket, one of their wedding gifts. Theresa used to bake the overripe bananas into a succulent bread. These days the fruit rotted until flies buzzed so loudly that Mike tossed the whole bunch."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Across from Theresa sat Tommy, the couple\u2019s ten year old son. He swirled his spoon around his frosted Cheerios and milk, peering into the bowl like it contained life\u2019s secrets. Maybe it did. Tommy didn\u2019t speak much, and when he did, he referred to himself in third person. Tommy was simple \u2014 he cleaned his room and went to bed when he was told \u2014 but Mike couldn\u2019t understand him. One time he brought Tommy to a baseball game. The boy seemed to have fun; he feasted on cracker jacks and in the gift shop, said \u201cTommy would like a pack of baseball cards.\u201d That night he borrowed Mike\u2019s scissors to lobotomize the players and reglue their limbs onto new bodies."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cHave a great day at school, buddy,\u201d Mike said, ruffling Tommy\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019ll see you after work.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Theresa finally looked at Mike. \u201cPick up some diapers before you come home. We\u2019re running low.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cGot it,\u201d Mike mumbled, grabbing an oat bran muffin before he left the kitchen. He swung his briefcase over his shoulder and locked the front door behind him. Mike bit the muffin, recoiling as the dry flour sandpapered his esophagus. He should\u2019ve expected it was expired."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "June 6th was the fastest work day of Mike\u2019s life. His boss still reeked of tuna fish and slammed Mike with weekend assignments, but the weight of Mike\u2019s impending decision hit him like a bulldozer. Mike stayed overtime; he alphabetized his file cabinet, sharpened thirty pencils, and dusted every cubicle, but procrastination wouldn\u2019t exempt him from the evening\u2019s dreaded conversation. The sun lowered, like a cookie in milk, as Mike began his hour-long commute home. His new apartment was only ten minutes away."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "June 6th in Mike\u2019s den looked no different than June 5th. The TV illuminated Tommy in the dark, his wide eyes glued to the screen as he ate mac and cheese. Mike tiptoed into the room and sat beside Tommy on the couch. Theresa sat on the opposite end, next to the bassinet where Joey slept. Mike wondered if Theresa cooked herself dinner. He knew better than to ask; she rarely saved him a portion when she did. It wouldn\u2019t matter after today, anyway."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Tommy cackled as a cartoon rabbit drooled onto a carrot. Tommy had watched this movie over ten times, but each time he laughed as hard as he did during the first. Mike wondered why adults couldn\u2019t maintain that same spirit. Why did life\u2019s magic dull into monotony?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He glanced at Theresa. She stared at him, probably curious why he sat with them, but averted her gaze when Mike\u2019s eyes met hers. The three hadn\u2019t watched a film together since Tommy was six. Mike and Theresa used to bring their bedroom comforter to the couch and snuggle Tommy like seals protecting their young. Mike\u2019s stomach growled. The movie faded to black and the credits rolled onto the screen. Mike turned off the TV and cleared his throat."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you,\u201d he said, looking at no one in particular. He turned towards Tommy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI\u2019m moving out.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For a minute there was no sound other than the ceiling fan, until Theresa spoke."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWhat?\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI\u2019m moving out,\u201d Mike repeated. \u201cTonight.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re moving out?\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d Mike said slowly, enunciating each letter like a child learning how to read, \u201cI\u2019m moving into my new apartment. Tonight.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cNew apartment?\u201d Theresa shrieked, standing, \u201cWhat do you mean, new apartment?

If you walk, you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t have both.\u201d Her forehead vein throbbed. Joey started crying."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Mike looked at Tommy. The last time his son wore that expression was at the playground, when Tommy fell off the monkey bars and ran to Mike\u2019s bench. \u201cTommy wants to go home.\u201d The boy burst into tears as soon as he entered the car."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry.
