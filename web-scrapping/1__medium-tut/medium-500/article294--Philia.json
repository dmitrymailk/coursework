Anna again. Should we head out soon?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cYes, meet there in half an hour,\u201d I type back."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s one of our first weekends in Granada during our study abroad trip, and Anna and I are the only ones in town. The rest of our group bought Lederhosens and cheap last minute flights to Munich for a weekend of Oktoberfest, forcing us to hangout alone for the first time."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s not that I am nervous to hangout with her alone, just that conversations often flow so naturally in a group. When there\u2019s only two people, you\u2019re either the interviewer or the interviewed, and I personally don\u2019t like being either."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I spend ten minutes gelling my hair just right. I need to look as European as possible, right? When in Rome, I suppose."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I arrive at the bar to find her already accompanied by a pitcher of sangria and a few plates of tapas. I will admit, she does have an energy to her that\u2019s quite contagious. She just always seems so present in the moment. I admire that."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cNothing much,\u201d I reply. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this bar has some of the most authentic flamenco starting at midnight.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The bar was unlike anything I\u2019d seen back in the states. Long wooden picnic tables were the only option for seating. The only light came from the strings of lights hanging about the rafters and from the candles forming a line down the middle of each picnic table. At the end of the tables sat a small wooden stage, waiting for the flamenco dancers to arrive and stomp the crowd into action."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Anna poured two cups of sangria for us and raised her glass."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cTo our first weekend in Spain that we finally aren\u2019t jetlagged,\u201d she says with a laugh."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cThat\u2019s a good point,\u201d I say back, raising my glass to hers."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cThis kind of seems like a date night, huh?\u201d she says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWhoa, let\u2019s not jump to that quite yet,\u201d I replied with a smirk."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI\u2019m only kidding\u2026 do you have a sweetheart or something waiting for you back in the US?\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I take a long sip of my cocktail, trying to buy some time to come up with a response to her blunt question."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI don\u2019t really want to dive into that tonight,\u201d I reply."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cOh, c\u2019mon, we better get to know each other before spending the next four months together in this foreign country,\u201d she says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I could tell I wasn\u2019t going to escape this question. Remember what I said about either being the interviewer or the interviewed?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I cave. I tell her all about the girl I had been dating back at school last spring, and how she promised we\u2019d survive as a long distance couple. I told her about how we were doing well with long distance for the first few weeks, but the more time we spent apart, the less probable it seemed that we\u2019d make it. By the time June came around, we really started to have issues. We\u2019d go days without talking to each other, holding out, waiting for the other person to cave so that we\u2019d feel like we held some imaginary upper hand in the relationship. That, mixed with all night FaceTimes where neither of us we\u2019re quite in the mood to work things out, sealed our destiny as a couple. The night before I boarded my flight, we decided a four month break could be a good thing for us. We agreed the relationship could be paused until Christmas break, but I don\u2019t think either of us truly felt that we\u2019d ever revisit things."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I tell Anna every detail of it, and she listens intently. The whole story takes enough time for us to go through a whole new pitcher of sangria."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cSo, I take it your jetlag was accompanied by some seriously exhausting grief?\u201d she asks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI guess you could say that,\u201d I replied."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I explain to Anna that even though this does feel like a date night, the last thing I want to go through is another confusing fling, especially when we only have a few months to try and experience everything here that Europe has to offer. She nods in agreement. We agree to experience the semester solely as friends. To ignore the world\u2019s doubt in truly platonic friendships. She calls me her Spanish Partner in Crime. I kind of like that."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The flamenco dancers arrive and start dancing around 12:45. Gotta love European punctuality. Just after the first set finished their performance, a large group of American men shuffled their way into the picnic table beside us. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t presume where a group came from, but this group was obvious. They all were dressed in white button down shirts, as if they had left their high-rise offices in Manhattan and flown straight to this bar in Southern Spain. In very poor Spanish, they order four pitchers of rebujito, a classic Andalusian cocktail."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWhere are you guys from?\u201d Anna asks. She\u2019s so straightforward."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cTexas!\u201d they exclaim simultaneously."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We get to talking to them for a while. In a way, it was refreshing to hear English again. We find out that they all live in the same high-end neighborhood of Dallas together. One of the men was turning sixty this weekend, and rather than going to some boring-old-Texas rodeo, they wanted to see a full on bullfight in Spain. This was the last weekend of bullfighting season in Spain before winter, so they hopped on a last minute flight and would only be in town for the weekend. As a whole, they were a pretty friendly group. They kept buying us rounds of drinks, and seemed genuinely interested in our studies abroad."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Eventually the flamenco ended and the place started clearing out, prompting us to do the same. The group of Texans were itching to go to a Spanish nightclub until the sun came up, but we were ready to hit the hay. A strange twist in social norms."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Anna went to the bathroom before we were going to walk home and when she left, the man who had been seated closest to me came over and put his arm around my shoulders."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cYou two sure make a good couple. I\u2019d pay a lot of money to be in my twenties again,\u201d he says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I quickly replied, \u201cOh, no, no, no. We are just friends.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWait a second! You mean\u2026you aren\u2019t hittin\u2019 that?\u201d he says in disbelief."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I step away, taking his arm off of my shoulder. He clearly had too much to drink."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cNo, we just met, and we\u2019re just good friends, that\u2019s all there is to it,\u201d I reply firmly."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He grabs my shoulders and pulls me in close to him."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cListen, kid. She\u2019s into you. I can tell these sorts of things,\u201d he whispers to me, as if revealing some grand wisdom. \u201cTake this\u2026a gift from me,\u201d he slips a wad of Euros into my shirt pocket."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cTake her out for a nice dinner, with some good wine, and show her a good time, if you know what I mean,\u201d he says with authority."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Disgusted by his implications, I back away. I am relieved to see Anna coming back from the bathroom. We say goodbye to the group, and thank them for the drinks. I shake the gift-givers hand with reluctance, and he smugly nods at me."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he says with an immoral wink."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Walking Anna home, I\u2019m hesitant to tell her what the man had said to me. I feel the need to vent about his obnoxious advice, but also don\u2019t want to taint her perception of the group. I decide to hold off. She\u2019s had a lot to drink anyways, and I doubt the details will stick to her memory."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The next morning she texts me, asking if I want to go grab some breakfast. I agree, and we meet at a cafe around the corner. I feel guilty for not telling her what was said during her trip to the bathroom, and decide to share. She, too, is disgusted by his advice. She asks what I did with the money he handed me."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWell, it\u2019s still in my shirt pocket I guess,\u201d I say."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Her suggestion: go out for the dinner that he envisioned for us. I like the way she thinks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And that we did. We ate tapas that would normally be much too expensive for a college student\u2019s budget. We drank wine that we normally wouldn\u2019t even think to order. We spent the night exactly how he envisioned, just minus the end of course. We did so on the dime of our generous Texan friend, and by doing so, honored every platonic relationship that has once heard the question\u2026"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you guys more than friends?\u201d"}], "topic": "fiction"}
