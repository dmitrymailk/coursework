Madrigal and Robinson Meyer"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conflating the results of two different types of coronavirus tests, distorting several important metrics and providing the country with an inaccurate picture of the state of the pandemic. We\u2019ve learned that the CDC is making, at best, a debilitating mistake: combining test results that diagnose current coronavirus infections with test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus. The upshot is that the government\u2019s disease-fighting agency is overstating the country\u2019s ability to test people who are sick with COVID-19. The agency confirmed to The Atlantic on Wednesday that it is mixing the results of viral and antibody tests, even though the two tests reveal different information and are used for different reasons."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is not merely a technical error. States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Several states \u2014 including Pennsylvania, the site of one of the country\u2019s largest outbreaks, as well as Texas, Georgia, and Vermont \u2014 are blending the data in the same way. Virginia likewise mixed viral and antibody test results until last week, but it reversed course and the governor apologized for the practice after it was covered by the Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Atlantic. Maine similarly separated its data on Wednesday; Vermont authorities claimed they didn\u2019t even know they were doing this."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The widespread use of the practice means that it remains difficult to know exactly how much the country\u2019s ability to test people who are actively sick with COVID-19 has improved."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d Ashish Jha, the K.

This is a mess.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Viral tests, taken by nose swab or saliva sample, look for direct evidence of a coronavirus infection. They are considered the gold standard for diagnosing someone with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus: State governments consider a positive viral test to be the only way to confirm a case of COVID-19. Antibody tests, by contrast, use blood samples to look for biological signals that a person has been exposed to the virus in the past."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A negative test result means something different for each test. If somebody tests negative on a viral test, a doctor can be relatively confident that they are not sick right now; if somebody tests negative on an antibody test, they have probably never been infected with or exposed to the coronavirus. (Or they may have been given a false result \u2014 antibody tests are notoriously less accurate on an individual level than viral tests.) The problem is that the CDC is clumping negative results from both tests together in its public reporting."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Mixing the two tests makes it much harder to understand the meaning of positive tests, and it clouds important information about the U.S. response to the pandemic, Jha said. \u201cThe viral testing is to understand how many people are getting infected, while antibody testing is like looking in the rearview mirror. The two tests are totally different signals,\u201d he told us. By combining the two types of results, the CDC has made them both \u201cuninterpretable,\u201d he said."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The public-radio station WLRN, in Miami, first reported that the CDC was mixing viral and antibody test results.

When it resumed publishing test data last week, a page of its website explaining its new COVID Data Tracker said that only viral tests were included in its figures. \u201cThese data represent only viral tests. Antibody tests are not currently captured in these data,\u201d the page said as recently as May 18."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Yesterday, that language was changed. All reference to disaggregating the two different types of tests disappeared. \u201cThese data are compiled from a number of sources,\u201d the new version read. The text strongly implied that both types of tests were included in the count, but did not explicitly say so."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The CDC\u2019s data have also become more favorable over the past several days. On Monday, a page on the agency\u2019s website reported that 10.2 million viral tests had been conducted nationwide since the pandemic began, with 15 percent of them \u2014 or about 1.5 million \u2014 coming back positive. But yesterday, after the CDC changed its terms, it said on the same page that 10.8 million tests of any type had been conducted nationwide. Yet its positive rate had dropped by a percent. On the same day it expanded its terms, the CDC added 630,205 new tests, but it added only 52,429 positive results."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is what concerns Jha. Because antibody tests are meant to be used on the general population, not just symptomatic people, they will, in most cases, have a lower percent-positive rate than viral tests. So blending viral and antibody tests \u201cwill drive down your positive rate in a very dramatic way,\u201d he said."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The absence of clear national guidelines has led to widespread confusion about how testing data should be reported. Pennsylvania reports negative viral and antibody tests in the same metric, a state spokesperson confirmed to us on Wednesday. The state has one of the country\u2019s worst outbreaks, with more than 67,000 positive cases. But it has also slowly improved its testing performance, testing about 8,000 people in a day.

The state did not return a request for comment, nor has it produced data describing its antibody or viral results separately.

If even a third of the country\u2019s gain in testing has come by expanding antibody tests, not viral tests, then its ability to detect an outbreak is much smaller than it seems. There is no way to ascertain how much of the recent increase in testing is from antibody tests until the most populous states in the country \u2014 among them Texas, Georgia, and Pennsylvania \u2014 show their residents everything in the data."}], "topic": "science"}
