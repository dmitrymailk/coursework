And I feel very naked."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As kids, we have nightmares of being naked at school \u2014 a metaphor for exposing our true selves. Today, everyone is naked online. In the age of Only Fans, public nudity has been rendered an empty gesture. It\u2019s difficult to go online without seeing someone\u2019s breasts you never wanted to see. But bodies are edited into a lie, a form of being clothed, and true exposure remains rare."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I am 33 years old. I wrote my first novel draft at age 17.

When I was writing it, I was a government lawyer who wanted to be a writer. Writing Prue\u2019s artistic ambitions was not difficult; not writing them would have been harder. As the book progresses, Prue\u2019s music career takes off. She makes a song that goes viral and lands a show opening for her favorite band. It\u2019s everything she\u2019s ever dreamed of, but before the show \u2014 she feels only dread."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1498/1*-Zi5ybfXVQrRw5uGgK21pA.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I hadn\u2019t sold a book at the time I was writing Vagablonde, but I know how minds work. I wanted nothing more than to publish a book, but I knew that accomplishing this goal wouldn\u2019t fill the void in my soul. I\u2019m an achiever. I\u2019ve been accomplishing goals. The void remains. Prue\u2019s void remains."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Prue and I share other qualities. We both have serious neuroses surrounding food and our hair. We both enjoy the fleeting high of drinking on amphetamines. We can both be self-absorbed and shallow and care way too much about empty measures of external validation. We both confuse a \u201cgood time\u201d for \u201cgenuine connection.\u201d We both find \u201cbeing present\u201d excruciating, favoring distractions over feelings.

But as a human being, it also hurt. Because Prue is loosely based on me. Daphne Sidor wrote in her review of Vagablonde for Lambda Literary: \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of bravery in attaching so many autobiographical elements to such a deliberately alienating character.\u201d This neither shocked nor offended me. Prue is deliberately alienating, and I can be too. It\u2019s not something I like about myself, but I am who I am."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I wrote Vagablonde on, well, a \u201ccocktail.\u201d (The very same cocktail Prue is on for most of the narrative.) I was extremely depressed. I felt like a loser. My writing career was not a career at all. I was still writing legal briefs and getting yelled at for minute formatting errors, like my indentations being .1 centimeter off. I went out a lot but had few real friends. My happiest periods during this time involved taking an Adderall and hitting my vape pen and drinking beer and writing this book. During those months, that was the only time I felt energetic and alive and in control. I fell in love with the rhythm of my sentences and the way my characters continued to surprise me. I was turning my bleak reality into something more glamorous.

I wore tortoiseshell glasses the entire first year of my MFA program. I have 20/20 vision."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At the end Vagablonde, Prue decides to stop taking Adderall and quits drinking for a while. Since I sold this book, I stopped picking up the Adderall prescription I didn\u2019t need and quit drinking for a spell. Prue also dyes her blonde hair back to its natural color, which is like, \u201cbeige,\u201d to avoid looking like a child or a colonist.

I\u2019m much healthier now. I\u2019m less delusional. I\u2019m more at peace with my mediocrity."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Perhaps symbolically, at one point in the narrative, Prue learns there are naked photos of her circulating on the internet.

First and foremost, to help people feel less alone. Books do this in a way television and movies cannot, because we are hearing the voices inside other peoples\u2019 heads, and learning the personal is universal. Second is to entertain people, to get them through their days, to get their minds off the irritating chatter in their heads and distract them a bit from their pain. The third is to get people to see the world in new ways, to shift their perspective, even if it\u2019s just .1 centimeter, like the indents in my briefs."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If I could accomplish just one of these things, I think I\u2019m okay with being naked \u2014 metaphorically, for a bit, and on my own terms."}], "topic": "fiction"}
