She hated the persistent pacing of people as they waited for news from doctors who buzzed around with bloodshot eyes and coffee-scented breaths. She hated the fluorescent light that gave her deep dark skin a sickly glow. She hated being ignored when she tried to speak to someone in scrubs or a white coat. And she especially hated hospitals because her girlfriend, Sol-Luz Santiago was there."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When she received the call from Sol-Luz\u2019s mother, Se\u00f1ora Santiago, that she and her husband were at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens because Sol-Luz was involved in a car accident, Adebayo travelled from Brooklyn to the hospital and arrived breathing hard after running from the station. She sat with Sol-Luz\u2019s parents, her arm around Se\u00f1ora Santiago, cradling her tiny figure as she watched Se\u00f1or Santiago\u2019s tall figure pace back and forth, mumbling in Spanish. They spoke little English and Sol-Luz served as an unofficial translator in situations where their English didn\u2019t suffice."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sol-Luz taught Adebayo bits of Spanish, a word here, a phrase there until Adebayo understood a percentage of what Sol-Luz said to her. She hadn\u2019t told Sol-Luz that she\u2019d been studying on her own, using an app to teach herself, making notes of all the words and phrases she\u2019d learned. It would be a birthday surprise, Sol-Luz turned twenty-five in a few weeks and Adebayo planned a private dinner in her house with candles and enough Spanish in a sultry voice for Sol-Luz to claim her as an unofficial Dominican."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "She was grateful that she could communicate with Se\u00f1ora Santiago. When she questioned Se\u00f1or Santiago for the third time on what the doctor said, he told her that Sol-Luz was in critical condition and in surgery."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "They\u2019d been there since the night before, and Adebayo had gotten there a few hours ago. She\u2019d gone through an entire pack of gum, all 14 pieces, and had chewed her nails to painful stubs that left vicious marks on her arms when she scratched them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "They waited for hours, scrounging together a meal from the hospital\u2019s cafeteria before returning to the waiting room. When a doctor approached them, they shot up out of their seats, hungry for news. Bilingual, he explained that Sol-Luz was still in surgery and didn\u2019t know when she would be out, that they should go home, rest and return the following day. The Santiagos were adamant about staying but were convinced when the doctor said that Sol-Luz would need them rested when she came out of surgery."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The Santiagos drove Adebayo to Brooklyn and when they dropped her in front of her white two-family house, they thanked her for coming and said they\u2019d keep her updated."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When Adebayo saw Se\u00f1ora Santiago\u2019s name flash on the phone screen, she fumbled to answer the ringing phone, dropping her key ring. Sol-Luz\u2019s mother called at night to update her on Sol-Luz\u2019s condition, so for her to be calling early in the morning was worrying.

Her words shattered with deep, ragged cries."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Adebayo understood the words, but she didn\u2019t understand why Se\u00f1ora Santiago called her early in the morning to apologize or what she was sorry for or why her voice shook as she struggled to say her next words."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cAdebayo,\u201d she sobbed and made noises that resembled words but were unclear to her.

Sol-Luz is gone.\u201d She mustered."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Gone where? Adebayo wondered, drawing a blank. Something was wrong, but her mind didn\u2019t put it together, \u201cQu\u00e9?

Why was she saying that? A lot was happening in the back. She was screaming, crying and Adebayo heard people trying to console her as things crashed around. Her voice grew faint and Se\u00f1or Santiago\u2019s deep voice replaced hers."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cAdebayo,\u201d Se\u00f1or Santiago had the type of voice that sounded like he was seconds away from laughing, you could hear joy in his voice. When he said her name, there was no humor in his voice. \u201cAdebayo,\u201d he repeated. He took a deep breath, \u201cMi hija est\u00e1 muerte, Adebayo. Me entiendes? Sol-Luz no est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed m\u00e1s.\u201d He sniffled, his voice cracking."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The words Sol-Luz\u2019s father said froze her as the feeling crept up her spine, she couldn\u2019t even speak.

She clenched the phone, tempted, so tempted before relaxing her hand. She picked up the loaded keyring and dangled it between her fingertips."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This couldn\u2019t be possible, Adebayo thought of the last time she\u2019d seen Sol-Luz, like truly seen her. They hadn\u2019t been on the best of terms when she\u2019d stormed out of Sol-Luz\u2019s apartment, but she\u2019d planned on working it out, once she got over her anger. How was she supposed to know that Sol-Luz would end up in an accident the next day? Adebayo wished she hadn\u2019t gotten mad; it wasn\u2019t even that serious."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Her dark skin looked ashy and her body felt cold. She willed her mind to wiggle her fingers to make her feel something. Her feet didn\u2019t move, and the toes in her black-and-white checkered Vans stayed still. Her body listened though and she sunk, her back against the door. She tried to remember the details of the last time she\u2019d seen her, but all the moments they had together kept distracting her. The first time they kissed, every time they kissed, how happy she\u2019d been. God, she hadn\u2019t even kissed her bye. She\u2019d ran out like a child, and she felt the same way she did as a child, alone."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Memories flashed through her mind, her brown eyes stuck on the wilting sunflowers in the front yard. The same sunflowers that grew from the seeds that Sol-Luz\u2019s mother had given her one day, swearing they\u2019d bring good luck. Some fucking luck. She should have included that the luck would only run its course if she took care of the plants. If she\u2019d known that, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have let them die. And maybe Sol-Luz wouldn\u2019t be \u2014"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "She shook her head, unable to complete the thought. \u201cEst\u00e1 muerta,\u201d Se\u00f1ora Santiago yelled, Adebayo kept hearing the words in her head, she refused to translate it to English, it would make it real. Est\u00e1 muerta. Est\u00e1 muerta. Est\u00e1 muerta. She glanced around the yard, at the dying grass and the prickly, dried out shrubs surrounding the tree that grew. It was an apple tree, with long skinny branches that started low on the tree and spread out like a canopy as the tree rose, planted two decades ago by her mother and father, before she was born."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The tree didn\u2019t bear any fruit, no matter how much fertilizer or special tree food her mother gave it. It was as if the tree knew that her parents hadn\u2019t worked out and didn\u2019t see any point in producing proof of their efforts."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It was one of the last things they did together. Before she reached a year old, her father left her mother, in the most unspectacular way, running off with another woman as if he was in his 20s with no responsibilities. Her mother lost her father, who hadn\u2019t even given her the respect of a divorce and she lost Sol-Luz in the worst way, a dangerous way. She had to keep living, aware that she\u2019d been spared in the game of life and Sol-Luz had lost."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Why didn\u2019t she feel something when she left, why didn\u2019t she know? Weren\u2019t you supposed to feel a something change when someone you loved left? The earth didn\u2019t shake, the heavens didn\u2019t open up and her soul didn\u2019t shock her or whatever bullshit was supposed to happen. Nothing happened. Maybe it wasn\u2019t love, she thought."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "No, that wasn\u2019t true. She\u2019d felt something from the first time she saw Sol-Luz. She\u2019d felt something in every moment, every memory. She pulled her knees to her body, the memories weaving through her head."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The first time she saw Sol-Luz walk into the Poetry Workshop class they shared, in a baggy black flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up, jeans and Doc Martens and a large Afro, there was the feeling that she had to know who Sol-Luz was."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When during the second week of class, Sol-Luz approached her and introduced herself, she saw that her brown eyes were framed by thick eyebrows that were a few hairs away from being a unibrow and that her light skin had freckles."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Through the countless times they met up at Sol-Luz\u2019s house to bounce ideas off each other and critique the poems that came from those ideas, Sol-Luz opened up to her and she learned random information like how Sol-Luz had let kids use a permanent marker to play Connect the Dots with her freckles in third grade or how she\u2019d eaten paint to see if she could make a rainbow grow inside her."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "She learned that Sol-Luz knew she was gay since sixth grade and that her parents figured it out in ninth grade, that her trivial experiences with guys was just that, insignificant. Sol-Luz told her that she had a mental checklist when it came to girls; that she that she didn\u2019t deal with girls who weren\u2019t close to her 24 years, and especially couldn\u2019t deal with girls who\u2019d never been in a relationship with a girl or weren\u2019t officially out. That she\u2019d tried in the past and was left hurt when the girls decided that they\u2019d had enough of experimenting. Her last girlfriend cheated on her with her ex because sex with a girl didn\u2019t \u201ccompare to the real thing.\u201d Adebayo silently cursed that girl when she heard the story, she was the reason she didn\u2019t have a chance with Sol-Luz."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Which was why when Sol-Luz leaned her head in and kissed her, her lips reacted by themselves, but her eyes widened in shock. Sol-Luz removed her lips to ask if she was okay and Adebayo grasped the back of Sol-Luz\u2019s neck, pulled her in and kissed her before she could wake up from what she thought was a dream."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "They\u2019d been in Sol-Luz\u2019s room in the Queens apartment building she lived in with her parents. The dark purple fluffy blanket that had covered the bed was spread under them, the wooden floorboards creaking softly under their combined weight. Sharing poems with each other, it was Adebayo\u2019s turn. She\u2019d read a poem loosely based on Sol-Luz, but it was clear she was the muse. She hadn\u2019t looked up from the paper until Sol-Luz said she loved it, her voice husky."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Then she kissed her. And that was when things changed between them. They didn\u2019t stop kissing and Adebayo realized that she was the exception to Sol-Luz\u2019s don\u2019ts."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When they went out to karaoke or to a ramen place that Adebayo swore by or to smoke at one of Sol-Luz\u2019s favorite spots in Central Park, they kissed when they felt like it. Sol-Luz was braver, kissing Adebayo on the lips before she slurped her ramen or after she\u2019d sang a song off-key. Adebayo was weary of how it looked for two girls to kiss in public, even in New York and would give pecks or she\u2019d kiss Sol-Luz on the cheek until Sol-Luz would suddenly turn her head and Adebayo\u2019s lips would land on her lips. Sol-Luz didn\u2019t push for me and for that, Adebayo was grateful."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When Adebayo slept over, they would kiss until their lips grew sore, take a break by watching Netflix, cooking or whatever idle task they could think of, but they\u2019d soon be all over each other. Their kisses left the both of them taking deep breaths and swapping a cup of ice-filled water, so Adebayo could only imagine what would happen when they went all the way."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Weeks later, the kisses hadn\u2019t stopped, and Adebayo had yanked off her shirt, revealing a double-D chest in a black lace bralette. She made a sheepish face and held the shirt to her chest, nervous that she might be going too fast for Sol-Luz. Sol-Luz smiled and pulled her T-shirt over her head and tossed it on a computer chair. Taking Adebayo\u2019s shirt from her hands, she did the same. That night, they snuggled under the same blanket they\u2019d first kissed on and traced on each other\u2019s chest. Adebayo pressed her palm to Sol-Luz\u2019s chest, wondering if she was freaking out as much as she was but it was hard to tell, Sol-Luz\u2019s sports bra got in the way."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One night, Sol-Luz\u2019s mother walked in on them in a compromising position: with Adebayo\u2019s shirt off and her body pressed on top of Sol-Luz\u2019s. When Se\u00f1ora Santiago opened the bedroom door and shuffled in in a red floral-print dress, matching chancletas on her feet and a laundry basket in her arm, Adebayo yelped and in a flurry of sheets, Sol-Luz rolled out from under her and shielded her with her body."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cHola, Mami. \u00bfQue pasando?\u201d Sol-Luz said, smiling awkwardly."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Her mother tilted her head and looked from Sol-Luz to Adebayo with amused eyes. She glanced around the room and picked up clothes tossed on the floor. Before she shuffled out, she asked, \u201c\u00bfEs ella quedarse para la cena?\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sol-Luz looked down at Adebayo, who clenched her eyes closed, waiting for her mother to leave so she could panic in peace. \u201cDo you want to stay for dinner?\u201d She whispered."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWould it be weird?\u201d The words rushed out and her eyes opened to slants."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t be.

Sol-Luz wasn\u2019t scared about being caught and Adebayo was going to officially meet her parents."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "She stopped smiling, she was going to meet her parents for real. More than the \u201cbuenas tardes, buenas noches\u201d she said on her way to Sol-Luz\u2019s room when they were in the living room. She groaned into the pillow, copying Sol-Luz."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Covering the table was a red tablecloth with a plastic sheet over it. In white, porcelain bowls, steam hovered over a mountain of arroz blanco, piles of fritos maduro \u2014 fried flattened plantains, frijoles rojos and stewed chicken. Dishes and utensils marked four spots."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The black t-shirt and biker shorts Sol-Luz gave Adebayo smelled of fabric softener, weed and coconut oil and it took a lot of willpower for Adebayo not to bring the shirt to her nose for a long sniff."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When the food was dished out and they\u2019d been eating for some minutes, Se\u00f1ora Santiago started asking Adebayo questions. With Sol-Luz serving as a translator, Adebayo swallowed her nervousness and answered honestly. She wished she understood the words that were rolling off her mother\u2019s tongue, she barely knew what was being said until Sol-Luz spoke."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Se\u00f1ora Santiago said something in Spanish and she and her husband laughed.

That part bothered Adebayo, but before she could make sense of it, Sol-Luz brought her to a climax. Her back arched off the bed as her eyes rolled back and guttural noises came from her. It was the first time Adebayo considered that this was the real deal. She\u2019d never got this far with any other girl she messed around with in high school. What they had wasn\u2019t experimenting, it was love."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As Sol-Luz Santiago made her drench the sheets with her tongue and tricks on her soul that no guy had ever done to her, Adebayo Ogunleye allowed herself to admit that she was in love with this young woman, really and truly in love."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Adebayo stopped anything else from happening that night, both tired and overwhelmed, but that night, she realized something: being in a bed, with another girl, both of them naked was nice."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The first time Sol-Luz slept at Adebayo\u2019s house, Ms. Ogunleye was in a rush to leave the house for her night shift at the local hospital, where she worked as an OBGYN nurse.

When she took her pants off, Adebayo peeled off her leggings, her thighs jiggling. Sol-Luz sat at the edge of the bed and beckoned Adebayo to come on top of her. She moved into her lap and wrapped her legs around her back. Sol-Luz traced her fingers on her back and Adebayo shivered at the touch. Sol-Luz admired the beauty marks scattered on different parts of her body. She found them on her arms, her chest, and a few on her inner thighs. Her panties matched her plain black bra.

In a blink, Sol-Luz took it off and Adebayo cupped a breast, which was small enough to fit into her palm.

She ran her fingers over the lines, then kissed them, first one side then the other."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sol-Luz exhaled hard and flipped her, Adebayo was on her back.

She was so wet, and Adebayo was happy to know she was the cause of it. \u201cJust like that, fuck,\u201d Sol-Luz said.
