Clouds stretched out far below in a ruffled carpet of impossibly rich texture, 10,000 spires and hillocks furling and unfurling, ragged tufts transfigured by shafts of light into resplendent mythological fauna.

Over the subsequent years, his relentless execution had proven the essay right, and his investors had congratulated themselves on their prescience.

Numerous senior employees had quit in the wake of receiving some of his \u201cdirect feedback\u201d and Miranda had constantly coached him to soften his public statements.

Debris flows decimated the surrounding countryside. The high-pressure gas building up in the magma chamber shot billions of tons of molten rock straight up the center of the expanding tower of ash and ejecta. Some of that gas was sulfur dioxide, which oxidized to produce sulfate ions that combined with water vapor to create teeny tiny droplets of sulfuric acid that spread out across the planet\u2019s stratosphere in a thin mist with a combined surface area approximating that of every grain of sand in the Sahara desert.\u201d He looked up from Pinatubo to the glowing turmeric coal of the setting sun. \u201cWhen sunlight reached Earth, some of it reflected off that fine aerosol mist, backscattering off into space instead of reaching the surface of the planet.
