Nice going, Kid. Good work, Kid. Like where your head\u2019s at, Kid. It was a manly combination of the film noir gumshoe and the well-meaning misogynist. I was quickly possessed. Because when a man gives you a nickname, he somehow comes to own you."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He had blue eyes and a good smirk. He would roll his tongue around his mouth and look like that Marlon Brando GIF everyone posts on Reddit. When I got my first promotion and I moved to a cubicle closer to his, I got my first good glimpse at his face. Never mind the scar where he took a lacrosse stick to the jaw."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI prefer solitary sports now,\u201d he said to me. And he invited me to one of those obstacle course events, something like a steeplechase for human beings."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So many fitness freaks, all decked out in free white T-shirts, similarly powerful calves weaving in and out of truck tires, and yet it was easy to spot him. Those gemstone eyes underneath a mask of mud and sweat. \u201cYou came,\u201d he said, and he wrapped his sinewy arms around me. I took a deep sniff into the furry forest of his underarm."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I liked that when he invited me to lunch, none of our other colleagues joined us. So we would sit on the patio at Florence and order gluten-free crusts without judgment. We agreed that Jim Leyland was a badass and that RoboCop 3 was flawlessly written. We discussed Borges, the Patriot Act, and reality TV. We shared gelato, but made sure to never touch spoons. We always got the same waitress, Janice, and she had really big tits, and I liked that he never made a joke about them like the older, sleazier businessmen from the office above ours did. He glanced and stared at them carefully, from the polite corner of his eye."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I told him I was from Waukegan and that I knew all about hip bars with names like The Apartment and The Living Room and Work."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWhere are you?\u201d the one person you never want to call asks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWork,\u201d you reply, and the person assumes you are very ambitious."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I liked that when I told him this joke, he started telling other people his own version of the same punch line. Imitation really is as flattering as they say."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I liked that he listened to musicians I\u2019d never heard of, and when he invited me to a concert at the Aragon, I spent days researching the band. I bought two new dresses: one that fit me that day and another that would fit if I ate nothing but celery for 72 hours."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In my nervousness, I arrived at the venue a little drunk, the second dress a little snug, my feet sweating in new sandals. But it was crowded and tight with people, so I don\u2019t think he noticed. He stood behind me and kept getting closer and closer to touching my back with each song. \u201cDon\u2019t you know the words?\u201d he asked. I pretended that it was too loud to hear."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I liked that he wouldn\u2019t allow me to ride the train back home by myself, and so he rode with me. Along the way, we shared his headphones, one earbud for me and one for him, and we listened to the band we had just seen. This will be our song, I thought."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The nervous kiss on the platform was awkward, like all first kisses. He had really bad timing. No rhythm. I invited him back to my place, but he politely declined, and he disappeared on the Red Line back downtown."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I liked that we had a secret. During meetings, we deliberately sat very far from each other. But I could feel his steely blue eyes walk across the collar of my shirt. Whenever I made a remark to the boss, I just knew he could feel his influence punctuating my every word. At company happy hours and picnics, we greeted each other with the same enthusiasm we gave to Uber drivers and distant cousins."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I liked that when he ran his first marathon, he didn\u2019t want me to wait at the finish line. \u201cYou\u2019re too short and you\u2019d never see me,\u201d he joked. But afterward, we lay in bed for hours, binge-watching bad TV, lazily discovering each other."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I liked that when he went grocery shopping, he did so very conscientiously. \u201cYou could lose a few,\u201d he said. And from then on, he made sure that all our meals were calorie-appropriate and protein-rich."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I liked that when my lease was up, he made sure to remind me. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to look for new apartments,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to pay double the rent.\u201d And this was good because I was spending so much time at his place, I\u2019d almost forgotten I had my own."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When our firm finally got the go-ahead for the Wilson Project, he and I didn\u2019t throw our hats into the ring. It required three months of constant travel. Research in Berlin, Lisbon, Milan. That was just the first week of interviews. Then off to Tokyo and Taipei. I had always wanted to travel, but three months was too long. We both agreed it was too long."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I liked that when the team was assembled, he refused to recommend me when others did. \u201cNo, no,\u201d I replied. \u201cYou\u2019d be great for it,\u201d they said. My bosses agreed. I\u2019d put in the work. I was ready to moderate the discussions. I knew the translators quite well. I had prepared for this sort of assignment since graduation. I had always wanted to manage international focus groups, bring American culture to the Far East, explore Sao Paulo, swim in Mexican cenotes on my days off, wrestle with the mugginess of Manila in April, locate the paths of Hannibal and Napoleon, see the towers of Dubai, find myself in a small Spanish village where I would drink Carlsberg for breakfast and have five different kinds of wine from siesta until dawn. I would pretend to like skiing, I would see real castles for the first and maybe only time, buy gaudy jewelry in the Grand Bazaar, party on a Croatian island, and make my parents proud."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But no, I told my boss."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And I liked that our romance resumed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He didn\u2019t want to go either, he said."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cHow exhausting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd how I\u2019d miss you.\u201d"}], "topic": "fiction"}
