He always figured he would become a journalist. Pursuing this goal, he went to Glendale Community College for two years and later Arizona State University for journalism, and one day he had an epiphany. The epiphany was that he wasn\u2019t good at writing. At the time, he was working at a video rental store in the evenings, so he dropped out of school to manage the store he was working."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Those days, in the late 80s, he would have all day to watch movies in the store. That wasn\u2019t a problem since the rush hour was between 7 and 9 pm, after work hours when everyone had time to return movies and grab a fresh batch of movies and shows for the week. A job that likely gave him plenty of opportunities to recommend movies to customers. He progressively took on more and more responsibilities at the video store and, at some point, was managing eight stores in the chain. Then eventually, he became the regional sales and operations director, becoming responsible for 500 stores in the western states."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When Netflix founder Reed Hastings met Ted Sarandos in 1999, he was the guy who knew the ins and outs of the video rental business and as a bonus a deep-rooted passion and appreciation for movies and great storytelling. He joked once that he\u2019s a human movie recommendation algorithm because he\u2019s seen pretty much most films and shows and that he\u2019s quite good at recommending."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Fast forward two decades at Netflix, and he runs in powerful circles of network executives and influential politicians. For a person who has been named the Times Magazine\u2019s one of 100 most influential people, he has kept some youthfulness and sweetness as he\u2019s matured. In interviews, he\u2019s relaxed, humble, he seems to artfully deflect most compliments that come his way onto his team, sometimes luck or how they, Netflix, thought about the problem."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "His primary job today is to keep a portfolio of content on Netflix that interests a wide array of people. A typical portfolio might have 10% horror, 40% comedy, 20% action, 30% long-tail interests. Choosing movies to fulfill a portfolio sounds simple enough. But keeping 160 million people satisfied with the content curation is an enormous task. Maybe even an uphill battle, as most news these days, about Netflix, is how people are running out of things to watch on Netflix. No matter how they curate and how many shows there are, people are always going to be unsatisfied with selection. If not variety, then some yet to be found reason. We\u2019re good at that, finding a reason to be dissatisfied. It\u2019s just in our nature to be this way. Every shiny new thing wears its welcome and becomes a bore. Even so, it\u2019s Netflix\u2019s number one goal to keep its viewers as satisfied as possible."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Or maybe their goal is to keep us just satiated enough that we don\u2019t stop our monthly subscriptions, while they grow their user base to broader and broader viewing preferences and viewership. The economics of this workout so that Netflix\u2019s current memberships help fund its expansion. One could argue that if Netflix used all of its resources to serve its existing viewers better, then the existing user would get much more content at better quality. But business doesn\u2019t work like that, like all businesses Netflix needs to grow."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "99% of Netflix\u2019s revenue comes from subscriptions. Even if 10 to 20% of subscribers discontinue, it could be catastrophic to their bottom line. Starting and running a business is complicated work, and there are many metrics that businesses are told to monitor, however in startup philosophy, founders are often to told to ignore all the noise and focus on user growth as the ultimate signal. This philosophy couldn\u2019t be more true for Netflix."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As opposed to Microsoft that has extremely spread out products and services and an equal amount of sources of revenue. In stark contrast, Netflix has only one singular service that caters to 160 or so million subscribers. If you\u2019re trying to decide if this is diversified, whether you should look at it like one service, therefore risky or 160 million different customers watching wide array of movies and shows, thus less risky. There\u2019s an argument for both."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This first quarter of 2020, Netflix saw its most substantial spike in sign-ups ever of 16 million new users, on top of its 160 million subscribers. If you consider the pool of users as a bathtub of water, \u201c16 million new users\u201d is adding a bucket of water to the tub. A bucket that\u2019s estimated to be worth 5.75 billion USD. In the standard bathtub model of Netflix users, there\u2019s an input stream of new user sign ups and an output stream of subscription stoppages."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Historically, every time some show touches on a controversial topic or Netflix announces a price spike, people stop their subscriptions and encourage others to do the same on Twitter. To keep the company\u2019s share value, and the bottom line healthy, the difference between new users and user drop-offs should always be positive."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Netflix has a huge appetite for growth. Since a few years ago, the growth in the US has declined and has stayed at about 60 million, an equilibrium perhaps. Naturally this means the primary user growth needs to come from elsewhere. Netflix has six offices globally, and that gives us an idea of where the company would like to focus its growth efforts. There are offices in Japan and Korea, based on the population and the average income of the people there that makes sense. There is an office in the Netherlands, to maintain and grow its user base in Europe. And lastly, in India and Brazil, undoubtedly due to the large population size of those countries, there\u2019s great potential there as well."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Scale of Netflix"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When you google Netflix, you get 762 million results as compared to Prime Video, which has about 1980 million results, and Hulu and Disney at 106 and 1090 million results respectively. Netflix used to be the market dominator for quite some time. But with all the competing streaming services that are coming out from formidable companies, with their own set of branded content, it doesn\u2019t look like Netflix will become a monopoly."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Yet Netflix\u2019s peers have not entered colloquialism, as I have yet to hear \u201cLet\u2019s Prime Video and Chill\u201d. In fact, some people seem to use Netflix as a verb now for all streaming \u2014 every founder\u2019s dream. Of course, that could allude to the fact that Netflix has had around 2 plus decades of momentum, and a pretty catchy name to go with it. It\u2019s interesting to explore what made this company succeed and find a profitable path forward when many others have failed. As we\u2019re seeing video streaming is not a small-time play, all the successful entries into the market have been big names like Amazon, HBO, Apple and Disney. What\u2019s different about Netflix is that it wasn\u2019t a mega corporation before it went into streaming."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Part of their success is undoubtedly timing because it was able to become a video rental first and then slowly pivot into streaming, and slowly building up momentum and capital to produce originals. Whereas if a small startup wanted to start a similar business right now, it better have a 20 billion USD annual budget for several years. Companies like Apple and Disney have been dropping about that much for its initial line up of shows. Or maybe a pre-existing selection and ownership or exclusive licensing rights to widely appreciated movies and films as well as an army of engineers and business people. Still, it\u2019s worth exploring Netflix\u2019s history because it trail blazed the way for all the newcomers into the business of streaming movies and TV shows."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u2014 Someone talking about Ted Sarandos"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As of 2019, Netflix has 154 million users globally, 60 million from the US and 6 million new free trial accounts and the rest from all over the world."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1066/1*eKhkwgY4efg5t_si2IGsCA.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Even though 60 million subscribers or only 18% of the US population has a subscription.

On the higher estimation, if a person shares it with four extra people, there could be 300 million people with Netflix access in the US. Why four additional people? Because Netflix offers max five profiles for each account. Although why stop there, if your group of friends watch Netflix only occasionally, ten, twenty people could just share an account."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The actual average is probably around 2 or 3, which gives us either 120 or 180 million people with access to Netflix. That number seems reasonable."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But the US really seems to be in an equilibrium of 60 million paid subscribers.

If we assume average membership of 10 USD, monthly Netflix earns 1.48 billion USD \u2014 and annually Netflix earns roughly 17.7 billion USD. We\u2019ll find out how accurate this calculation is and how Netflix reinvests its money, in the following sections. But to give you some perspective.

So far we have mostly talked about how Netflix streams and makes money from streaming. But a significant portion of the business is the production side. It really has become a bifurcated company and the other side of the Netflix coin is just as interesting and complicated as the streaming side."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Netflix has had several important pivots and changes in strategy throughout its history of 22 years 8 months as of the date of this article. It started as a DVD sales and rental service, but the founders decided to focus solely on the rental side after a year. In 2007, Netflix announced that it would start streaming with a monthly membership inside the US. Around 2010, the streaming went international in select countries. Finally around 2012, Netflix started producing movies and series. The hugely successful first series House of Cards was available in its entirety, making it exponentially easier to binge, not just alcohol, food, sleep but TV as well."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After the initial success in the production side of the business, Netflix has invested more and more into production, every year. In 2019 alone, it has produced over 370 original series and films. In 2018, there were 240.

A lot of this credit goes to the long time head of content, Ted Sarandos."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Ted Sarandos took home a hefty 31.5 million in 2019, on par with most big studio executives. His job is very similar to those roles, except for one detail, in his own words. Tesla was able to design the car from the ground up, without the limitations of the internal combustion engine. The car\u2019s center of gravity could be moved down, the previously used front of the car could become an extra trunk. The changed center of gravity made the car safer and handle better."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Ted and his team were able to slightly reinvent the movie business from the ground up, without the extra considerations that cable networks have with ratings, scheduling and ad spots. Netflix could focus on the bare essentials and make decisions on fewer considerations. For example, one of the early moves was to purchase \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d without any pilots, which was a risky move and something networks couldn\u2019t do. The meta in cable networks has always been to review the pilot and see how that does. They proceeded if the pilot got good ratings otherwise, they would cut their losses. Since Netflix doesn\u2019t have commercials, it didn\u2019t need to do this."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1714/1*BxnRu3nrhcoVUi-N7ulbEQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The diagram above shows the management team\u2019s salaries in millions, where the red is salary and black is equity.

To be competitive as a network, you have to offer good money, creative freedom and a towering platform."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is a competitive business. The executive from HBO said in one of his interviews, this is not a zero-sum game. Maybe he meant to disarm the other executives, maybe he believes that. But the game of picking projects is absolutely a zero-sum game. That\u2019s a textbook definition of a zero-sum game. Marc Andreessen remarked in passing once that compared to tech, Hollywood is much more cut-throat. Whether that\u2019s true or not is not too important, just that the industry environment has a huge effect on the behavior of its players."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Surely all the networks wanted \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d, considering that David Fincher was heading the series \u2014 this wasn\u2019t that risky.

Ted and his content team at Netflix try to mitigate this risk by having complete access to the viewing habits of 160 million users, which they use to predict what people would want to watch."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Ted is good at recommending movies, but obviously he can\u2019t cater to everyone nor should he. The company\u2019s setup and his goal are very much to put his own taste aside as much as he can. It\u2019s clear that Netflix now has multiple heads of content. Each head of content responsible for \u201cComedy & Documentary\u201d, \u201cAction & Adventure\u201d and so on. Ted reassures people that each head of content has the power to green-light productions and he is not the final decision-maker.

Reed figured that the price of streaming movies and consumer electronics made it impossible for Netflix to make a profit in the late 90s and even the early 2000s. However, he anticipated that the rapid technologization would drive the price of streaming down, while the cost of sending out DVDs would steadily increase. And one day, these would intersect and Netflix could become a profitable streamer after point. That happened circa 2007."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In many ways, Netflix was a zero to one business, which contributed to its magnificent success. If Google invented its way from zero to one, Netflix seems to have waited for multiple external forces to align and then strike. That\u2019s not to say that Netflix wasn\u2019t innovative, it definitely was. Being one of the first entrants into the field, it had to figure out many problems for itself. There wasn\u2019t anyone to copy from."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Netflix was the first company to offer an online catalog of content in the form of a website, in 1999 no one else was doing that. As mentioned before, the company started as DVD rental and sales. But ditched the sales effort to focus solely on rental after a year. Another first that Netflix has a claim to is the mailing of DVDs."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Initially, Netflix offered almost 100'000 films, they just needed to buy the DVDs, there were no streaming rights involved. These were much simpler times. Whereas in streaming, the content level is significantly lower. Worldwide Netflix has the rights to 13'000 titles, made worse by the fact that each country has only a subset of those. While the US gets around 5'000 titles at a time, Canada gets around 3'400 titles."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Netflix was the first to start streaming. It was the first to offer its original series. The truth is, Reed did have companies to copy. Netflix was an internet TV network, although the operator word here is \u201cinternet\u201d and Netflix was the first of its kind. It still could copy the way traditional networks operate. Many networks, syndicate shows but they also always, always, always offer branded originals exclusives."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Netflix was the first company to offer a high level of personalization through data science. There was a little bit of hype around Netflix being able to predict what people want to watch. On this front, Netflix decided to forego with the traditional way movies are rated. Focusing much more on the revealed behavior of users than explicit ratings of movies. But the revealed behavior data and the regression models are not an all-knowing crystal ball that decides what Netflix produces. This was less data science and more astute observation."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "According to both Ted and Reed, Netflix operates like traditional Hollywood companies in almost every way. And data science is just one of the many tools the company utilizes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There are many innovations that Reed brought to Netflix that don\u2019t get as much clout as Netflix\u2019s recommendation algorithm. For one, Netflix\u2019s comparison with Microsoft brought us to wonder if Netflix\u2019s one service offer is a risky business setup. On his first job at Adaptive technology, in the early 90s, Reed noted that he learned from his CEO Audrey MacLean the importance of focus \u2014 specifically, the value of doing one product well rather than 2 products in a mediocre way. It seems that this Netflix focus on one service was intentional and it has worked out pretty well so far. But you can never rule out some long-tail event seriously messing up Netflix\u2019s only revenue source. We will detail this out in the upcoming risk section."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "His first venture Pure Software eventually went public, then merged with Atria and after six years at the company, he left with one important takeaway. That he needed to do better with his next company. There were issues with Pure Software that primarily came out of the company growing rapidly and Reed not having any experience managing a huge, expanding team. In many ways, there was a loss of control of the culture, the management and the company from Reed\u2019s perspective. So he spent the next 2 years thinking of ways to avoid those problems with his next company."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The culture really seemed to be one of the most important features to get right in a startup. Most of the startup founders can\u2019t stress this enough, the hiring and the culture being key for success. Brian Chesky says this, the founder of Zappos says this, the founders of YCombinator Paul Graham and Sam Altman repeat this. The companies that get culture right can avoid one of the big things that trip up companies, internal conflict. Avoiding this means everyone is focused on the goal and they find a way to resolve conflicts productively without imploding."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Chris Anderson asked Reed how come Netflix took down a controversial episode of the show Patriot Act on the Ted Stage, recently. There his reply was that Netflix is an entertainment company and it\u2019s not in a position to tell people what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, they\u2019re just about great storytelling. A great stance to take if you\u2019re trying to avoid drama and not get too political or moral."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "On a more personal side, Reed Hastings is a philanthropist, he deems education reform in the US an important issue and donates heavily into education. After his undergraduate degree, Reed taught high school math for a few years in Swaziland.

His non profit Hastings Fund started in 2016 with an initial capital of 100 million. In 2012, Reed and his wife Patty signed the Giving Pledge."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Another thing that seemed to go right for Netflix was the combination of Reed and Sarandos. It gets uttered often enough that it has become a cliche, but having 2 top people from different backgrounds is seems to be quite a potent recipe for a startup. Empirically we see this from Apple, Microsoft, Snapchat\u2026 Reed was technically more of an engineer, but someone who had honed the business side through experience, and Ted was the expert on content and in the early days, video rental business. Generally having different areas of responsibility leads to each person to trust the other\u2019s expertise. Otherwise, two salespeople or two engineers end up disagreeing on how to do things, getting the \u201ctoo many chefs\u201d phenomena."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "With this insight, you can get to two engineering founders, if they just accept their respective areas of responsibility. But a company still needs a salesperson, so unless you can recruit a third. It gets difficult. Reed seemed to be the rare person who does both well. We learned that Netflix was a bifurcated company with streaming and content, if Reed is responsible for the streaming side, then Ted is responsible for the content."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Ted mentioned in one interview that Reed had this hypothesis that eventually Netflix would stream since the early days when they were still shipping DVDs. In fact, many of the turns and maneuvers that Netflix did were anticipated years ahead by Reed Hastings.
