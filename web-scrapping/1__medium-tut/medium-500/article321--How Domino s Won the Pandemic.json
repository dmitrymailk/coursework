The courier requires a minimum wage. The ingredients can only be so cheap. There just aren\u2019t a ton of things throughout the food delivery value chain that restaurants can innovate on without significant technological advances."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That\u2019s why some ambitious entrepreneurs (like ex-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick) are getting into \u201ccloud kitchens\u201d to cut the biggest expense traditional restaurants deal with: real estate costs. If a kitchen makes its money by delivering food to those who order it over an app, there\u2019s no point in paying for premium real estate \u2014 or extra staff to take care of customers who visit."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While cloud kitchens may seem like a new trend, the concept isn\u2019t really that new. In fact, Domino\u2019s Pizza has been reaping the benefits of cloud kitchens for years."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2912/0*BYK8PBxGXFjNOJXY"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Think about the similarities between cloud kitchens and Domino\u2019s:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And while Domino\u2019s is certainly benefiting from the rise of delivery (especially during Covid-19), one of the main reasons they did so well over the past decade has been the alignment of their business and their business model."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Strategic investments"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In 2009, Domino\u2019s made a number of decisions to align their strategy to their business model."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "First, they completely overhauled their product. The food went from tasting like cardboard to tasting like, well, real pizza. And they even ran an ad campaign owning up to their previously bland product and describing how they had improved it. It also helped that the product category (pizza) was extremely well-suited to delivery because it\u2019s cheap: A single pizza can feed a family of four."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Then, they invested in technology. They were the first to both offer mobile ordering and to build a Pizza Tracker on their website, a concept that delivery startups have since copied. This not only helped them with ordering and logistics (stores and drivers utilize software as well) but also helped them build a strong digital brand in which they interact directly with consumers."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This brand advantage is especially important during quarantine, where the customer journey almost always begins online. A lot of other big takeout chains rely on aggregators like DoorDash or UberEats, and are forced to suffer the high fees that come with them. (We\u2019re even starting to see restaurants migrate off these platforms towards building their own apps, similar to what Domino\u2019s did a decade ago.)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Finally, Domino\u2019s stores are optimized for delivery and takeout, not in-store eating. In contrast, competitors have followed more traditional models: Pizza Hut has a dine-in focused model and mom and pop pizza shops don\u2019t have the technology or delivery infrastructure (although Slice is trying to change that)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While all of these decisions prepared Domino\u2019s for the cloud kitchen era, one of the biggest drivers of investor returns was their franchise business model. It can\u2019t be understated how closely their strategic decisions played into becoming one of the most successful franchises in history."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The benefits of franchising"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Franchise businesses can be incredible. Here\u2019s why."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Usually, when a business wants to grow, they need to use existing profits or raise new capital to fund that growth. However, a franchise business is the opposite. The franchisor can add new locations, but doesn\u2019t need to front the capital themselves. Instead, they can source the capital required to open new locations through their franchisees."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In return for the brand awareness, trade secrets, and operating best practices, franchisees pay monthly commissions to the franchisor. For the parent company, it becomes a cost-free royalty, a perpetual stream of cash. And if a franchisor is performing well, they can actually distribute cash back to shareholders even as they grow, instead of needing cash to fund expansion."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So if franchises are so great, why doesn\u2019t everyone run one? One reason is that not every business is built to entrust franchisees with quality control."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Consider a company like Starbucks. One big reason people went to Starbucks was to spend a few hours working in a comfortable place, or to enjoy their coffee with a friend. Additionally, many Starbucks customers decide to purchase a coffee because they walk past a store. Starbucks doesn\u2019t do much delivery either: the low price of a coffee (about $5) means that the delivery costs up to 50% of the total order value. Much too high for most people."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "These business characteristics make it harder for Starbucks to adopt a franchise model. The consumer value proposition is reliant on in-person experience: sitting in a comfortable lobby while enjoying the music, chatter, and aura of the environment. And that\u2019s much harder to scale through a network of franchisees. Starbucks would be relying on independent operators to accurately replicate that unique environment, which is hard to do."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And that is one reason why none of the Starbucks stores are franchised. One hundred percent of them are owned by the company."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Contrast this with Domino\u2019s. Pizza is a cheap and standard product that is easy to make. Dough, sauce, cheese, toppings \u2014 that\u2019s pretty much it. Simple and repeatable."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Additionally, Domino\u2019s invested in technology and built an independent, digital-first brand before anyone else. When you think, \u201cI want to order pizza online,\u201d do you picture the Domino\u2019s pizza tracker? I do. It\u2019s not as tied to a particular store as it is to the Domino\u2019s brand and online portal (which is controlled by Domino\u2019s corporate employees)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Finally, their stores are optimized for delivery instead of dining in. Their store locations are selected based on the best delivery routes, not the most foot traffic. And because people typically order more than one pizza, the delivery expense tends to be a small percentage of the average order value."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "All these decisions funnel quality control to the parent company and make it much easier to hand off a store to a franchisee. When more of the consumer experience is provided by the parent company, the only thing operators need to have is money and grit."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So while both Starbucks and Domino\u2019s needed tasty food and beverages to grow, Domino\u2019s structured its business to be much more suited for the franchise model. And it paid off."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The Domino\u2019s growth model"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "From 2012 to 2019, Domino\u2019s not only grew revenue by 12% per year, but also grew net earnings by 20% per year and returned almost $4.5 billion in cash to equity holders through dividends and repurchases. How did they do it?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Domino\u2019s opened lots of restaurants through this time period. But the most important factor is that they didn\u2019t need to provide the cash up front to build the stores. Instead, the operators did. According to their 2019 10-K, capital expenditures totaled less than 1% of revenue for the international segment (the only segment that is 100% franchised)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This allowed Domino\u2019s to grow their high-margin franchise commissions (3.5% \u2014 5.5% on every franchise) without bleeding very much cash."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Then \u2014 because of the capital efficiency of franchises, consistency of growing revenue, and a strong asset base \u2014 they were able to maintain a high debt level (four and a half to five times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). And with interest rates at all-time lows, their interest expense didn\u2019t cripple their operations in the slightest."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "They ended up issuing just under $6.5 billion in debt over that period, and while a decent chunk of it went to refinance old notes, another big chunk went to equity holders through special dividends and buybacks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The result is quite unique: a company growing earnings 20% per year while still distributing loads of cash to shareholders."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1392/0*Icaj-HM1JsLfmL7W"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The ideal cloud kitchen"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Several of the things that made Domino\u2019s a great franchise model and equity investment also made them perfectly situated in a quarantined, delivery-first world."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Domino\u2019s and Papa John\u2019s are performing a lot better than the chains that are optimized for dine-in or personalized orders. They are the pizza chains that are most optimized for delivery and large orders, which is what consumers want right now."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1530/0*gtRpzcufPC4yr9cL"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And while Domino\u2019s same-store sales only rose 1.6% in the first quarter, in the four-week period that followed (March 23 \u2014 April 19), same-store sales rose 7.1%, with reports that digital orders accounted for 80% of sales in one of those weeks. This is a much better fate than a lot of restaurants, some of which have had to shut down completely."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "All this is to say that Domino\u2019s is the platonic ideal of future cloud kitchens. The company\u2019s foresight to optimize for delivery, place stores in low-cost and route-optimized retail locations, and build a digital brand and app that really works is now paying off."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Even before the coronavirus, home delivery was a growing trend that the biggest names in startups and food delivery had been trying to crack and turn into a venture-scale business."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It just turns out that the pizza guys got there first."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A version of this piece was originally published on Divinations."}], "topic": "business"}
