To do this, we focused mostly on tech companies with a large online footprint (e.g. Booking.com, Uber, Netflix, Zoom etc.). We make use of publicly available news about these companies, their performance in the Apple app store as an indicator of audience growth, and their stock market valuation as an indicator of broader investor sentiment around the business case."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Losers (Gone with the COVID)"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1800/1*L_4_Txn5pkNDSpb7Nb1wLQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s quite clear that airlines are among the biggest losers of the Covid-19 crisis.

Many of us have also received their \u201cwe are in this together \u201d emails (as if, my Ryanair overweight luggage charge still hurts). But the pain does not end with the airlines and airplane manufacturers. Even tech-first companies which are active in the travel and/or holiday business, e.g. AirBnB and Uber, have had to cut jobs due to dramatic decrease in businesses. Similarly, companies such as Booking and Expedia have seen a dramatic drop in their current operations."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Booking.com"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Take Booking, for instance. Even though the company made a profit of almost $5bn last year, it has posted a loss of almost $700m in the first quarter of 2020 (travel bookings have plunged by almost 85%). This was reflected in the stock market valuation of the company, which started to plummet in the second half of February, and bottomed out more than 40% around March 23rd. While the stock prices for Booking.com stock have started rebounding since the beginning of April, this is disconnected from the market reality where newly booked room nights in April were down 85% YoY (as opposed to 60% in March)."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1334/1*XVA-TBkW6CMUoXLsuiAuwQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A similar picture also emerges if we take a look at the Apple App Store rank of the Booking.com app in the US (it\u2019s a good indication of change in number of downloads for their mobile app), where the app fell below the top-300 rank somewhere in mid-March.
