Businesses ask for mass support from governments. But how can we create resilient business models ourselves?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Our capitalist economies are like card houses. One by one they are collapsing now. No business is ever made for $ 0 turnover. And if you have large debts, like many of the big businesses do, you will not survive."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Yelling. Shouting. Screaming."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We need governments to save us."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And many governments do. They are too afraid of job loss. And a further collapse."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, where does this savior money come from? We need vibrant private entrepreneurship to even consider governments having enough money to invest. Otherwise, it\u2019s like a vicious circle."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Governments invest, they have to increase taxes next and who pays the bill? Or they print extra money and cause a hell of deflation. Which means higher prices for basic needs."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the end, we are the ones who pay the bill. All of us. Poverty for many people, if not all people, can be the only outcome if we try to save existing capitalist structures like this."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Time for a mind shift."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Time to do it differently. To do it better."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Time to transition toward a vibrant economy with resilient businesses."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And this is where you come in, dear entrepreneurs.

Use Everything Available to Create New Value"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You have a product or a service you concentrate on. But if you open your view just a little more, you see there is more inside your business. What if you could create value with that more?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Think about waste streams. What if you could design your waste streams in such a way that you (or someone else you collaborate with) would create new value with it? A new valuable product?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What if you are a guacamole maker? A bakery could take the avocado seeds, grind them, mix them into other flours, and bake bread. What if you\u2019re a beer brewer? Your waste stream of spent grains is very rich in proteins. A bakery could also bake bread with this rest stream."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Upcycling has the future. And why not use the proceeds of valuable waste in your model to make the business itself more resilient?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But there\u2019s more."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Think about extra value streams in your company by going backward in the chain instead of forward."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What if you want to make e.g. building materials or packaging from mycelium as explained in this article."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Look broader now. What if you would grow this mycelium on polluted soil? Someone would pay you for cleaning the soil with fungi and you\u2019ll produce an awesome product."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The fungi will take care of the pollutants and transform them so that you can create wonderful healthy buildings with them.

Identify Stranded Assets"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Okay, so now we have trained ourselves to look broader in our own supply chains."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The next step is that we look broader in our environment and identify stranded assets that can be used to strengthen our business models economically."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What are stranded assets?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In our current business jargon, it\u2019s often limited to assets (things of value) on your own balance sheets. However, we can use the term much broader when we go on a hunt for them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Stranded assets can e.g. be empty buildings or production factories."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Blue City in Rotterdam has included the stranded asset of an empty tropical swimming pool in their business model."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Novamont in Italy included the closed factory of an oil refinery in its business model to built the most healthy, world-changing biochemical factory ever."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But we can think even broader toward stranded assets.

They share the same values. And they complement each other to achieve synergy in their business models. And then they choose if they want to scale or not."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The great thing about synergy business models is that scale is not necessary to make them work. Multiplier effects are achieved by adding value upon value upon value."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Often, the collaborating businesses have the same target groups, so their branding will build upon each other and make sense."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And they use their creativity to find blue oceans together. Get away from the red oceans, as explained in the book Blue Ocean Strategy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We can also change our thoughts about cost and price thinking. If we use synergy in our business models, healthy food e.g. would not need to cost more. It could be cheap because we create so much more with one healthy product.
