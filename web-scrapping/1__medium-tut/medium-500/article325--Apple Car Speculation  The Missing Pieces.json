This time, it resurfaces in a research note by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, a \u201cTesla Bull\u201d who\u2019s known for his very sunny views of Elon Musk\u2019s company. As reported in 9to5mac.com, Jonas resorts to the frequently-(ab)used parallel between Tesla and Apple to suggest that Musk should get himself a star COO, just like Steve Jobs hired Tim Cook away from Compaq. To strengthen the reference to Apple, Jonas ropes in his Morgan Stanley colleague Katy Huberty, a respected technology analyst who frequently dissects the Cupertino company. Huberty concurs about Tesla\u2019s need for a strong head of Operations [as always, edits and emphasis mine]:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Then she offers her views on the \u201cfamed\u201d Apple Car project:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Weighty words from an authorized tech industry expert."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Indeed, were Apple to enter the auto industry, the putative vehicle would be just like an Apple Watch, only bigger: Everything engineered by Apple \u2014 minus the low rolling resistance Michelin tires. The Car would be yet another example of Apple\u2019s appetite for vertically integrating all layers of the product\u2019s \u201cstack\u201d (hardware, software, design), a behavior deeply embedded in the company\u2019s culture."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Natural as it might feel, the parallel misses an important factor: Sales and Service. Apple doesn\u2019t have the people and facilities to display, demonstrate, and maintain automobiles. Optimists will say these value chain links could easily be dealt with by buying selected auto dealers, sprucing up their premises, and re-training the employees. Or they could take the Tesla approach and send technicians to customers\u2019 homes and offices to perform service tasks such as dealing with uncooperative doors. Perhaps."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There are two much more serious obstacles to making the Apple Car dream a reality."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The first one involves The Machine That Makes The Machines, the production system, and the confusion between Industrial Design and Styling interchangeably referred to as Design."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In 1991, The Machine That Changed The World, a book that\u2019s rightly called seminal, explained how Toyota was on its way to surpassing General Motors by paying foremost attention to the design and running of the production system, to the big machine that excretes the cars, an approach that\u2019s since been adopted, in various forms, by the entire industry. The Design and Styling that we ogle at in carnography magazines is secondary, a subset of the grand design. This is counterintuitive, but, with all due respect to the fine people in Japan\u2019s Toyota City, the company didn\u2019t fly to the top of the industry on the wings of its car stylists."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Given the production system\u2019s preeminence, where are the rumors describing Apple\u2019s plans to build a car factory in Marysville, OH, or elsewhere?

After a long struggle, Tesla\u2019s operating margin reached 2.3% last quarter. For conventional automakers such as Ford, GM, and VW, 2019 operating profit hovers around 4%. Toyota does much better with 10%\u2026but Apple\u2019s 2019 operating profit was 29.3%."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Why would the Cupertino company enter such a low margin business? It\u2019s nice to believe that Apple could make a car like a Tesla Model 3, only better. Better software, better fit and finish, distinctive style, the best BEV on the planet. But how would such a dream vehicle cost significantly less to make than a Model 3 while selling for more? With its Nevada Gigafactory, Tesla is the undisputed leader when it comes to battery cost \u2014 and now it\u2019s shooting for the $100/kWh holy grail. It\u2019s unimaginable that Apple could undercut Tesla\u2019s bill of materials."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "How would Apple raise perceived value and lower costs to achieve a workable financial proposition? One answer frequently offered by speculators is that Apple could come up with a self-driving secret weapon. But a real self-driving car \u2014 a.k.a. Level 5 Automation \u2014 is at best five years away. Elon Musk no longer touts a fleet of 1 million Tesla robotaxis by the end of 2020. Alphabet/Google is no longer gung-ho about the future of self-driving technology: Its Waymo subsidiary is raising $2.25B from outside sources and CEO John Krafcik admits that a spin-off is \u201ccertainly a possibility\u201d. (This isn\u2019t to say that investors in the new round, such as Magna International mentioned above, don\u2019t see Waymo as a path to better driver assistance in future cars.)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If Apple has a secret weapon, we again must ask: Where are the rumors?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The magical Apple Car is an attractive fantasy: Imagine if Apple did for cars what it did for smartphones that existed before the iPhone? What if it could take on an entrenched industry the way it did with the Apple Watch?
