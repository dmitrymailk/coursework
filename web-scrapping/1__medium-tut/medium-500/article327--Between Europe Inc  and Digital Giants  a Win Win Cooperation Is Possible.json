However, the current dynamic needs to change, and soon, if the digital giants aren\u2019t to eventually end up losing, too. Our studies show that the digital giants can, and must, proactively act to create a win-win for the EU and themselves. That will be necessary to benefit not just European consumers, companies, and governments, but also, to optimize the digital giants\u2019 AI strategies."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Digital Giants Are Winning at Europe\u2019s Expense"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At present, the world\u2019s digital giants \u2014 such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Alibaba \u2014 dominate the European AI landscape. In the absence of homegrown competition, they\u2019re able to operate without making major investments locally, creating jobs on the continent, or often without paying as much taxes as they should. For instance, in July 2019, when France tried to take on the digital giants by levying a 3% tax, it almost resulted in a trade war, with the US ordering an investigation that could lead to retaliatory tariffs and other trade restrictions on France. As a result, the digital giants offer few, if any, economic benefits for European countries and companies."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Meanwhile, the EU\u2019s industry players are losing out because they\u2019re unable to capitalize on the digital giants\u2019 presence. There\u2019s relatively little demand for AI applications from them, so Europe\u2019s AI readiness remains low. In addition, European digital companies find it difficult to expand geographically; the EU\u2019s regulations restrict the use of key technologies, such as facial recognition, because of privacy concerns. With the scale of AI\u2019s usage crucial for competitiveness, as we argued in a recent article, the current situation is unsustainable (See, for instance, Europe Can Catch Up in AI, But Must Act \u2014 Today)."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Europe\u2019s Attitude is Changing"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Until now, the EU has demanded little from the digital giants apart from basic compliance with data protection laws, platform business rules, and other related regulations. However, the EU is increasingly waking up to the fact that it is one of the world\u2019s biggest digital markets, enjoys significant negotiating power, and should use it for its long-term benefit."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While multilateral negotiations will continue, the EU seems likely to take measures unilaterally to ensure a level playing field. For instance, the EU\u2019s policy environment has changed a great deal in recent years, with the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) as well as rulings against digital giants such as Facebook and Google. Several other reforms are in the pipeline such as the recently-unveiled data strategy. The EU\u2019s attitude towards is increasingly becoming more protectionist, with policy-makers calling for \u201cEU digital sovereignty\u201d and \u201crespect for EU values for AI.\u201d"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Digital Giants Must Make Two Commitments"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The digital giants must act quickly if they wish to avoid a stalemate that will ensure that everyone loses. Promising to work according to the EU\u2019s regulatory frameworks and helping to build a competitive AI ecosystem in the region will be two fundamental steps in the right direction, with long-term sustainable benefits greatly worth the effort (see Exhibit 1)."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2308/1*ZJHe-hHtf1lXzS4b2CA7dw.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "First, the digital giants should proactively commit themselves to working within the framework of the EU\u2019s AI-related regulations. That will require AI applications to respect individual privacy, and avoid bias of any kind. Rather than sticking to the letter of the law, the digital giants should accept the spirit of the EU\u2019s regulations, and, once they gain credibility in Europe, help refine them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Committing to the EU\u2019s AI regulations means that digital companies must be willing to accept the responsibility for damages once the regulations are enacted. Doing so will prevent messy rulings, lawsuits, and public disputes between the EU and the digital giants. An environment in which EU policy-makers and digital businesses work together is better than a distrustful regulation-compliance relationship, as EU Commissioner Thierry Breton and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg agreed during a recent debate."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Second, the digital giants should commit to the development of a European AI ecosystem. That will entail developing and upskilling AI talent in Europe by, for instance, cultivating partnerships with leading universities there. Still, for more impact, digital giants should also support the scale-up of AI start-ups in Europe, just like venture capital firms would, while committing to retain those operations in the EU even if they acquire them. Finally, and even more crucial, the digital giants should partner with European industry leaders and share most advanced technologies with them, thus accompanying their AI transformation."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Creating an ecosystem will require the digital giants to enter into technology transfer partnerships with European players. They should go beyond localizing data centers in order to comply with local regulations and strike strategic partnerships, which will ensure the transfer of cutting-edge technology and capabilities to local players. Another way to facilitate the creation of an ecosystem would be to invest in Europe\u2019s AI infrastructure, for example, through the European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking, whose mission is to develop a world-class supercomputing and data infrastructure to support a competitive and innovative ecosystem on the continent."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When they do so, the digital giants\u2019 operating costs in Europe may rise in the short run. Greater compliance and collaboration efforts will require resources while supporting talent and ecosystem development is expensive. However, working with the EU to develop an AI industry in Europe is the only viable solution if the digital giants are to flourish. Given the size of the European market, no digital firm that aspires to be a global leader can afford to walk away from the world\u2019s largest economy, largest trading block, and the largest investor in terms of attracting and making global investments."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Cooperation is the only path towards success"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The digital giants need to recognize the strategic opportunity that the EU represents. It\u2019s not just about size or purchasing power; the EU is one of the most sophisticated and differentiated markets for AI, especially for industrial applications. The EU provides opportunities to develop and train algorithms for several industries, and it will be impossible for any digital giant to claim that it has a global offering if it doesn\u2019t have access to European markets, data, and Europe-trained AI applications. In addition, by nurturing the EU\u2019s large talent pools, the digital giants can supercharge their AI teams."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The EU also provides learning opportunities because it offers a sophisticated point of view along dimensions that will determine the nature of competition tomorrow. For instance, privacy and ethics are high on the EU\u2019s agenda, so operating there ensures that the digital giants are at the cutting edge of those issues. As the chairperson of the EU\u2019s expert group on AI, Pekka Ala-Pietila, recently said:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The EU is ripe with possibility, but to successfully seize the opportunity and thrive in Europe, the digital giants must:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Build partnerships with Europe\u2019s industry players. Europe is the home of world-leading companies in several industries such as aerospace, automobiles, chemicals, consumer goods, energy, food, maritime, and retailing. As the second wave of AI (in B2B) gains ground, European companies represent an opportunity for the digital giants to develop and refine AI applications in those industries. As mentioned earlier, such partnerships would also benefit European companies, which can use the new technologies to reinforce their global competitiveness."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Regard permanent establishment as an opportunity. The digital giants should look beyond regulation and tax-optimization, and treat setting up shop in the EU as a strategic decision. Those digital giants that move quickly to seize opportunities to strike partnerships with public and private players will gain an advantage. As a first step, the digital giants should identify, and set up bases in, Europe\u2019s budding ecosystems of AI excellence."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Treat the EU as a future-critical market. As the current Covid-19 pandemic demonstrates, the digital giants, like all transnational companies, must build greater resilience to withstand \u201cblack swan\u201d events. One way of doing that is to operate globally while limiting the interdependencies between regions. Companies that treat Europe as central to their operations, and not just as an export market, will be able to boost their resilience. The digital giants would do well to shift from a one size fits all strategy to a multi-local one."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Use regulation as a cornerstone, and proactively engage with policymakers. AI regulations will play an important role in shaping the EU\u2019s business environment tomorrow. Merely complying with regulations won\u2019t set up the digital giants for success; they must seek to understand Europe\u2019s subtleties and shape future regulations. That will serve as a source of competitive advantage. Moreover, many multinational companies have already applied the EU\u2019s GDPR regulation to their worldwide operations. That only reinforces the need for the digital giants to earn a seat at the table in Brussels, where future policies will be fashioned."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Review the AI applications portfolio to ensure it is EU-ready. Privacy issues, ethical concerns, and bias in AI applications anywhere in the world will immediately have a fallout on the digital giants\u2019 operations in Europe. Evaluating the firm\u2019s AI applications portfolio from a European point of view will be essential to gauge what modifications will be required in the future. For instance, if the EU decides against the use of face-recognition AI applications, the digital giants may have to reconsider their development. Otherwise, they will run the risk being shut out of the European market altogether."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Eventually, European governments, European companies, and the world\u2019s digital giants will have to figure out ways of coming together to develop a range of AI solutions for the world. Treating the EU as a mere market, rather than as an equal partner, is unlikely to make that happen. Indeed, if they think twice about it, the digital giants will realize that they will probably be the biggest losers from persisting with a short-sighted approach to AI in Europe."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "About the authors"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Fran\u00e7ois Candelon is a Managing Director and Senior Partner at BCG Paris, and the Global Director of the BCG Henderson Institute.
