{"title": "Why Joe Rogan Is Leaving YouTube for a $100 Million Deal With Spotify", "data": [{"type": "subtitle", "content": "Is it censorship problems or monetary gains?"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/3376/1*UFrb-qLD0VOzH3NHs6vTCA.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "On 20th May 2020, Joe Rogan posted a 54-second video on YouTube that was by far his shortest and the most astonishing one \u2014 even more extraordinary than Elon Musk smoking marijuana on his show."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Even though he seemed calm throughout the video, he certainly seems to have a massive resentment and anger towards YouTube."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The fans seem to have a mixed reaction. The video got 38K likes and 28K dislikes. Such a huge number of dislikes isn\u2019t very common on Joe Rogan\u2019s channel. So it\u2019s clear that some people are very annoyed by this decision."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But it\u2019s a very human reaction. People resist change and want to stick to established methods of living. It\u2019s likely that fans will get used to the new platform and get acclimated to receiving Joe\u2019s wisdom through Spotify instead of YouTube."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "What\u2019s Going to Happen?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "First of all, there\u2019ll be a massive transfer of data from Joe Rogan\u2019s channel JRE Clips to Spotify. We\u2019re talking about terabytes of videos here \u2014 it\u2019s huge."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "By the end of the year, around 4.5 million followers of this renowned YouTube podcast channel will have to move to Spotify to listen to his bold, motivational, and sometimes controversial as well as politically incorrect thoughts."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2912/1*r7hMSD-IwYxk__7yUZ2wlw.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Just in a couple of days after Joe dropped the bomb on YouTube, Spotify\u2019s stock price went from 160 to 190."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As Joe said, the video version of his podcast will be available on Spotify, so fans who are used to watching him face-to-face while he drops wisdom won\u2019t be disappointed after all. It\u2019s apparent that Spotify wants to compete with YouTube by enabling its platform to share videos."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But what does this mean for YouTube? Well, Spotify\u2019s stock value ascension is just the beginning. Joe is taking his podcast and millions of listeners along with him to Spotify."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now, let\u2019s talk about money. It\u2019s said that Joe Rogan is receiving a whopping $100 million to sign an exclusive deal with the music streaming service Spotify. But let\u2019s not forget the ad revenue JRE podcast is going to earn right from the get-go \u2014 it\u2019s estimated to be a few million dollars per month as well."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Not to mention the ad revenue that Spotify will earn when millions of new listeners are exposed to ads on their platform. In short, everyone makes money \u2014 a lot of it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, the most important aspect to note here is this \u2014 Joe Rogan is NOT an employee of Spotify. He\u2019s an independent content creator and Spotify will let him do whatever he wants to."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So keep in mind that he\u2019s not a sell-out. He\u2019s just switching platforms and will continue to be an autonomous podcaster with no one telling him what to post and what not to. Anyone with common sense who regularly listens to JRE Clips will know that someone like Joe Rogan would never compromise his integrity for money. However, the massive number of dislikes shows that some people might have misinterpreted Joe\u2019s decision."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Why Is Joe Rogan Leaving Youtube?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is the question that probably only Joe can answer the best \u2014 and he will at some point in the future."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, it\u2019s said YouTube\u2019s censorship issues have been a big pain for Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast. It\u2019s not just about refraining from speaking swear words, it\u2019s way deeper than that."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Joe\u2019s straightforward and fearless attitude might have offended a few people. Maybe he\u2019s received a lot of censorship notices from YouTube. For any creative person, freedom of expression is worth more than anything."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Content creators want to create and express themselves. It\u2019s understandable that an outspoken martial artist like Joe wouldn\u2019t want to live in the fear of receiving content strikes from YouTube."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He must have felt this frustration for a long time and it\u2019s possible that the planning of this massive online exodus took a few months."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There\u2019s another possibility, however. Maybe Spotify\u2019s offer was too financially lucrative for Joe to decline. Of course, YouTube\u2019s censorship issues certainly seem to be a problem here. But to snatch away one of YouTube\u2019s top podcaster is no small potatoes and definitely takes a lot of money."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There\u2019s something that\u2019s going on behind the scenes that no one knows, but this news surely shows us the value of good content creator these days \u2014 they\u2019re worth in the millions."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Also, one thing is clear \u2014 if you have millions of loyal fans, no platform in this world can stop you from taking up space and expressing yourself. If one platform censors a creator, there are always a dozen competitors out there who\u2019d value them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Why do you think Joe\u2019s leaving YouTube?
