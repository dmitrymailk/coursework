The moment seemed surreal, sitting in my home viewing a public webinar in the middle of a pandemic, as a group of scientists, entrepreneurs, and bloggers sat around in a virtual room probing the giant model of the viral protein. I thought about how different this was from a pensive Charles Darwin sitting on a Gal\u00e1pagos beach, notebook in hand as he observed wildlife and thought about species changing over generations. I wondered what Darwin would think about the pace and approach of the current field."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The emphasis on big data is growing in the biology field. To help put this in perspective, researchers compared the predicted growth of data in YouTube to the growth of data in genomics. The researchers estimated that in 2025 YouTubers will upload 1,000\u20131,700 hours of content every minute for a total of 1\u20132 Exabytes per year (1 Exabyte is equal to 1 billion Gigabytes). For the same year the researchers estimated genomic sequencing data alone will produce 2\u201320 Exabytes (that is up to 20 times the amount as YouTube)! This growth has put a focus on building computational tools and software to make managing and extracting insights from this ever-growing data possible. A 2016 survey of 704 National Science Foundation biologists indicated that 90% of participants are currently or will soon be analyzing large data sets. It\u2019s not uncommon for a biology publication to have a web app or open-source software package published with it. The bedrock hypothesis-based approach to science is often getting replaced by a discovery-based approach to science. Instead of starting with a hypothesis and designing an experiment to test the hypothesis, discovery-based science first emphasizes collecting as much data as possible, analyzing the data, and then using this analysis to generate hypotheses for further testing."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This revolution in the biology field has largely been driven by the sheer complexity of biology. To stay alive, each of the 10\u201340 trillion cells in your body contains a dynamic balance of millions of molecular machines called proteins that carry out a myriad of tasks. The six billion letters of genetic information can make over twenty thousand unique types of proteins. Furthermore these proteins can combine together to carry out stunningly complex tasks such as transporting materials around the cell (Fig 2)."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*OPmgkENvWXgnMYI7ZYcb3w.gif"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The Synthetic biology subfield was born early on in our understanding of this complexity. In 1961 scientists postulated the existence of regulatory gene circuits that allowed cells to react to their environments after carrying out mutation experiments in bacteria. With this theory, engineers and scientists began to imagine a reality where the principles of rational design and standardized modularization would allow humanity to reliably create living cells that carry out a myriad of useful tasks in industry and health. This dream set in motion the battle of human ingenuity against biology complexity."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Over the ensuing decades, a myriad of technological improvements in data collection would help humans probe this complexity at an unprecedented rate. The cost of sequencing a whole human genome would drop from over a hundred million dollars with the completion of the human genome to 2003 to around a thousand dollars by 2015. Additionally, reagent kits and instruments in the RNA transcriptome space allow not only for the static data of a genome but views into the protein expression content of cells. DNA synthesis has also dropped and now gene blocks, several hundred to several thousand base pairs of DNA can get ordered for hundreds of dollars. These technologies allowed undergrads and even high-schoolers to perform genetic engineering projects in the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) contests. To give an example, the 2018 Highschool winning team created a bacterial strain that produced the active ingredient in catnip."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Problems remain, however, most gene circuits created never leave the lab they were created in, and when other labs do try to replicate the experiment, they often have problems reproducing the same result. A survey by Nature of 706 biology researchers found that they thought on average that only 59% of published research in their field was reproducible. To combat this, lab automation has taken off. The global automated liquid handling market was valued at $585 million in 2016 and is projected to double in growth by 2023. This workflow automation has been especially leveraged in genome engineering. CRISPR Cas9 is a protein that can specifically edit any location in the genome with the synthesis of a targeting RNA. This gene-editing system allows high throughput genetic screens in cells that can perturb thousands of mutations with unprecedented ease. At the forefront of the lab automation field is microfluidics, which aims to miniaturize golf-cart sized liquid handling robots to devices that fit in the palm of your hand."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For some, this fervent pace in the field is still not enough. Even all the automation in the world can\u2019t stop the fact that cells take time to grow and chemicals take time to react. The top gene-editing companies with experts and machinery still take several months to deliver genetically engineered cells. Furthermore, the amount of data one can experimentally extract from a cell is just a small snapshot of the total information. Even some of the most data-intensive experiments such as whole transcriptome sequencing only give an idea of the protein populations inside the cell, not their spatial arrangement or functional movements. Other experiments such as F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) can zoom in to provide more detailed information on specific protein conformational changes and interactions, but are difficult to set up (impossible for some situations) and not scalable to peer into all protein interactions at once. Additionally, every experiment consumes precious samples and most experimental measurements require breaking open the cell, for these experiments doing time-lapse studies in a single cell is not possible."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To combat this, some scientists began imagining a world where you could probe biology inside a computer. This is not a new idea, the first molecular dynamic simulation of a protein was done during the late 1970\u2019s. But is it possible to simulate an entire cell inside a computer? A 2012 paper titled A Whole-Cell Computational Model Predicts Phenotype from Genotype would make it seem this has been achieved. This work was a huge breakthrough and allowed scientists to gain valuable insights into cellular activity and predict the impact of gene disruption on growth rate. However, their predictions on gene disruption and growth rate were only accurate in two-thirds of the cases. Furthermore, predicting the effect of smaller changes to protein sequences is not possible with their model unless researchers perform experiments or other methods to determine how the specific mutation affects the protein\u2019s kinetic rate. Having to perform experiments to figure out the effect on the model limits much of the intended usefulness of computational models saving experimental time. These limitations are due to the fact that their model ties together many top level subprocess models that are based on parameters determined by experiments (Fig 3). This model was also based on the Mycoplasma genitalium bacterial organism, which is much smaller than a human cell (500 some genes instead of 20,000\u201325,000 in a human)"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*lEokDUUNS1IvUAf_ren5NQ.gif"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The gold standard is to model an entire cell at the atomic level. In this scenario, the functional and kinetic consequences of protein perturbations could be determined computationally instead of experimentally. This is because protein dynamics emerge from the well-understood minimization of energy fields between atoms. One of the most popular computational frameworks for calculating molecular dynamics is called Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD) and had its first version released by the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in 1995. The increase in computational power and access has accelerated the growth of the field (Fig 4)."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2720/1*_Eya1r7D5fmY3MFZ-aTchw.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So how close are we to having the capability to scale this technology to an entire human cell? A more recent research endeavor in 2016 also modeled the mycoplasma genitalium bacterial cell but used molecular dynamic software to achieve atomic detail (Fig 5). Their simulation modeled ~100 million atoms for 20 nanoseconds and ~10 million atoms for 140 nanoseconds. To put this in perspective, a typical human cell is estimated to have 100 trillion atoms, which is one million times more than the researcher\u2019s simulation. Additionally, it takes an average protein a few milliseconds to fold, which is about 50 thousand times longer than the group's longest simulation. Breakthroughs in computational power could make larger simulations possible, but figuring out the initial arrangement molecules in a human cell is also a difficult task that will require mountains of lab experimental data. Furthermore, most simulation force fields do not allow the breaking of covalent bonds in order to speed up calculations. The breaking of covalent bonds which many enzymes perform requires quantum mechanical chemical simulations which are computationally more intensive."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/900/1*_cJK7CIBIA73iw0c11VBdQ.gif"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Due to these current limitations, most researchers focus on simulating the interaction of just a couple of proteins or a protein and a small molecule for a longer period of time. To get the initial confirmation of a protein, scientists perform X-Ray cystography or Cryo-Em experiments which can take months to determine a single structure. Many of these structures are publicly available at The RCSB Protein Data Bank and the number of structures has grown from less than 10 thousand to over 150 thousand over the last 20 years. At the 2019 CASP protein prediction contest, researchers from several academic labs and Google DeepMind were able to train machine learning models with these experimental structures to accurately predict the folded structure of proteins from just their amino acid sequence. This breakthrough allows computational biologists to start running simulations on proteins that don\u2019t have a determined experimental structure."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Much like the revolution of discovery-based science and big data in biology, is the field heading for another revolution where most of the hypotheses are tested in computational simulations before work is done at the bench?"}], "topic": "science"}
