Why wouldn\u2019t future trillionaire Jeff Bezos test out the pet market, especially considering he\u2019s challenged just about every single other market ever? Whether you\u2019re an Amazon Prime enthusiast or an occasional shopper, it\u2019s difficult to deny the marketing machine that is Amazon.com. Generally speaking, everyone knows the company name \u201cAmazon.\u201d However, Amazon\u2019s private dog food brand is eye-catching for a different reason\u2014 the name Wag."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Wag! is also the name of the on-demand dog walking company that was founded in 2015. Accessible in all 50 states and 4,600 cities (according to the official website), it\u2019s a place where dog walkers, dog boarders and dog sitters can all find a one-stop-shop pet profession. And it makes absolute sense that a company like this would create a dog food brand, considering their five-year brand. But nope, instead it\u2019s Amazon who is using this name \u2014 sans the exclamation point and in a different font."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Legally it may seem odd that Amazon was able to get away with it during its creation in 2018 \u2014 three years after Wag! was founded. Then again, when a company owner is willing to almost lose $100 million in a three-month time span (through Amazon Mom) just so he can one-up competitors, it may have been more trouble than it\u2019s worth for the dog-walking company to challenge the dog food brand name, Wag."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "What\u2019s on the Wag dog food menu?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When TruthAboutPetFood.com tried to find out who the actual manufacturer of the pet food was, they ran into a wall. Two years later, the explanation for the brand is still pretty vague: \u201cYes, the Wag brand is owned and distributed by Amazon.

But it\u2019s really this particular name that makes it stand out more, specifically because of the well-established dog walking company. Other private label dog foods would never be confused for another company (ex. Blue Buffalo, Dr. Harvey\u2019s, Nature\u2019s Variety, etc.)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Additionally, dog owners are not even clear where all the ingredients are from. The \u201cnumber one ingredient\u201d of beef is documented as sourced in the United States, but the rest of the dry food is from \u201ca variety of countries around the world.\u201d It\u2019s the right amount of vagueness that could make dog owners curious about the popular online merchant but not quite clear what they\u2019re feeding their dog. Meanwhile Amazon assures dog owners that, \u201cThe supplier of Wag dog food adheres to stringent food safety protocols, constantly monitoring and testing raw materials, production environment, processes and finished products.\u201d The problem with that explanation is Amazon doesn\u2019t have the best track record of making sure all their items are safe to purchase, specifically when it comes to third-party sellers."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Amazon dog food refunds: Is Wag covered?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Amazon\u2019s A-Z policy often allows for consumers to get their money back.

The results are still unclear two years later."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One of the main problems with Amazon \u2014 specifically for bulk customers \u2014 is they\u2019d rather get their larger items on the spot. Why wait for a non-essential package from an online merchant when wholesalers Sam\u2019s Club or Costco skip the pricey shipping fees? Why invest in the tip dog owners (should feel obligated to) give a delivery person for lugging that huge bag of food to the door when they can just buy it at the nearest wholesale store? Or, what about just ordering from a proven pet food membership company like Chewy? (Every auto-ship includes a 5\u201310 percent discount.)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Whether on Chewy\u2019s site or Amazon\u2019s site, dog owners can get their dog\u2019s next meal. But in addition to the shipping woes, there\u2019s an added frustration for consumers who can clearly see refund policies printed on the backs of the bags of uneaten food. Manufacturers often offer refunds for uneaten portions, with a receipt purchase. That is, if online merchants are willing to honor the manufacturer\u2019s deal at all. It\u2019s much easier to handle this kind of paperwork in brick and mortar stories \u2014 in smaller packages \u2014 to avoid shipping costs and back-and-forth messaging. But with Amazon\u2019s Wag option only available online, consumers will just have to take a chance."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Is it worth it? Bezos clearly is willing to test the idea. When Chewy went public and PetSmart bought them, it was hard to ignore that $8.7 billion price tag. If Chewy can do it, why can\u2019t Amazon? Better yet, why can\u2019t Wag? With more than 2,900 ratings for Amazon\u2019s dry foods (62 percent of which are five-star ratings, as of the publication time), time is still ticking on whether Wag dog food will be as successful as those Amazon Mom diapers were. Either way, Amazon\u2019s dog food name is certainly piquing dog owners\u2019 and dog walkers\u2019 attention."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*ptgUHesIDUrlOQz7pX66RA.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Shamontiel is a dog lover to her core: 467 completed walks with 76 dogs, eight dog-housesittings and four dog boardings at the time of this publication.
