According to CNN Business, L Brands parent company is closing 250 Victoria\u2019s Secret locations (out of 1,100 total in North America) and 50 Bath & Body Works locations (out of 1,700 stores in North America)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Although Victoria\u2019s Secret stores had been quietly closing due to lack of sales \u2014 and other competitors who have gotten a noticeable rise due to inclusiveness \u2014 Bath & Body Works closures may be the more shocking one. The smell-good chain had online sales skyrocket up to 85 percent during the last year, with its main hit being hand sanitizer. That alone sold $300 million in 2020 \u2014 up from $100 million in 2019 \u2014 and it\u2019s not even summer yet."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "From March to now, hand sanitizer, toilet tissue, paper towels and alcohol can\u2019t stay on the shelves for any retail store that commonly sells them. During the worldwide coronavirus health outbreak that has left more than 4.99 million people infected and more than 327K people dead, people are hoarding these in larger numbers than normal (or predicted). As of now, there are only two options for hand sanitizer from Bath & Body Works \u2014 3 oz. French Lavender spray and a five-pack of Beautiful Day pocketbac \u2014 but the rest of their online options are sold out or no longer listed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For cruelty-free customers, this is a double loss. While Victoria\u2019s Secret has perfumes, body sprays, lotions and lip glosses \u2014 in addition to lingerie and pajamas \u2014 they are primarily tested on animals. Bath & Body Works customers know that no matter what items they purchase in this retail chain, the items are not animal-tested cosmetics. There\u2019s no need to check the label since the whole store follows this no-testing policy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But there\u2019s still some extra hope for casual BBW shoppers and regulars returning to brick and mortar stores. As has become common for today\u2019s consumers, the retail chain requires face masks and keeping a six-foot distance in their brick and mortar stores. And when it comes to BBW\u2019s suggestion to \u201cwash hands frequently or use hand sanitizer,\u201d clearly this is the chain that\u2019ll have that covered upon entry."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*ptgUHesIDUrlOQz7pX66RA.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Would you like to receive Shamontiel\u2019s Weekly Newsletter via MailChimp?
