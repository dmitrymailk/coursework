But, there will be salary adjustments: \u201cIf you live in a place where the cost of living is dramatically lower, then salaries do tend to be somewhat lower,\u201d Zuckerberg told the Wall Street Journal."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Twitter and Square, both run by Jack Dorsey, have also said that they will allow \u201cpermanent\u201d work from home. Many employees of large technology companies have been working from home since March, due to the coronavirus pandemic, with many extending return dates to the fall or even next year; Google for example has said that, for most employees, work will continue from home until 2021."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement that he expects up to half of the company\u2019s employees to work remotely in the next decade could radically revise how tech workers and observers think about the industry, and especially its impact on the Bay Area, whose spiraling cost of living \u2014 thanks to a combination of a lack of new housing and the riches from the tech boom \u2014 have led to tension among residents. Only five years ago, Facebook offered a $10,000 cash bonus to employees to live within 10 miles of its headquarters in Menlo Park, the Information reported."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In theory, \u201clocalization\u201d \u2014 adjusting salaries for the cost of living where workers live as opposed to where the companies are based \u2014 makes sense. Many companies already localize salaries for remote workers either because they do not want to or cannot pay big city salaries. For a worker in a given location, their options are to find work at a local tech firm, or one of the national companies that are open to remote work. But if a substantial number of big tech companies like Facebook provide a remote option for their workers, the labor market everywhere has the potential to be transformed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It may seem reasonable for Facebook to set a single \u201creal wage\u201d for a given role and say that an engineer living in Grand Junction, Colorado, (where the \u201cfair market rent\u201d for a two-bedroom apartment, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is $1,035) should get less on her paycheck every two weeks than someone doing the same job in San Francisco (where HUD pegs a two-bedroom at $3,339 a month)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But once that engineer in Grand Junction can quit Facebook and move over to Twitter or Square while still mountain biking a few miles from her home, the ability to \u201clocalize\u201d her salary decreases, as Facebook still has to compete for the workers it wants to hire. Then, the engineer\u2019s buddies in the Mission might learn from Instagram that Grand Mesa is a bit more impressive than Dolores Park. So they trade in their carbon-frame road bikes for something a bit rougher and pack up the U-Haul. Now there\u2019s less pressure on the Mission housing market and prices in Grand Junction start to creep up. This actually happens \u2014 just ask anyone in, say, Missoula."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cFor some kinds of jobs, it really could become a more national and less local labor market,\u201d Jed Kolko, the chief economist at Indeed, the jobs site, told OneZero. \u201cIt\u2019s an important distinction whether one firm on its own takes a different approach to where people work and how they\u2019re compensated or whether the norm for the entire industry shifts.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And even if there\u2019s still some salary differential, the wages Facebook pays to remote workers will likely be on the high end for those areas.

We know why energy companies are in Texas and Oklahoma, but silicon is one of the most abundant natural resources on Earth."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A number of economists have developed a suite of theories to explain this. The economist Enrico Moretti argues that a software engineer in the Bay Area is more likely to find the best company for their particular set of skills, and companies are more able to find the most specialized employees if there are a lot of them in one place. Tech companies then have their choice of vendors: law firms that understand stock-based compensation, public relations firms that have experience with product launches. And there\u2019s the ineffable part, what Moretti calls \u201chuman capital spillovers:\u201d people learning from each other in unplanned ways or being motivated to work harder and try out new ideas because everyone around them is doing it, too."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cFirms aren\u2019t paying more to live in a more expensive place as a perk \u2014 if it weren\u2019t worth it to them the firm wouldn\u2019t hire them to live in more expensive places,\u201d Kolko said."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He added that \u201cfor businesses that are truly remote, and if people were equally productive regardless of where they were,\u201d firms would pay the same everywhere and not account for cost of living."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But even for technology companies that have adopted full remote work, a truly standard wage that\u2019s insensitive to the cost of living is rare. The software company GitLab has a publicly available database of \u201clocation factors\u201d that adjust salaries from its San Francisco baseline. The company is straightforward about why they do this \u2014 it started because the prevailing wage for technology workers was different in different areas.

The company was founded in Chicago but it \u201cpay[s] everyone as though they live in San Francisco and work for a software company that pays in the top 10% of that market,\u201d its founder David Heinemeier Hansson wrote. \u201cSan Francisco was our benchmark because it\u2019s the highest in the world for technology, and because we could afford it, after carefully growing a profitable software business for 15 years,\u201d Heinemeier Hansson said last year."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But Basecamp is the exception."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cThe only tech companies I\u2019ve seen offer a single rate of compensation anchored in SF or NY market rates are intentionally small and unlikely to scale beyond 500 employees, ever.

Nick Francis, the chief executive of Boston-based customer service platform Help Scout, tweeted that localizing pay \u201cisn\u2019t the right way to do it.\u201d But his company, which doesn\u2019t adjust pay based on location, also doesn\u2019t pay San Francisco salaries."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWe align with the \u2018second-tier\u2019 markets such as Boston, New York, and Seattle,\u201d Francis wrote earlier this month.
