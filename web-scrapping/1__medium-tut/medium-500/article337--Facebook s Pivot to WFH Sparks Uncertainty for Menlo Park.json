Since 2011, Facebook has played a dominant role in the small city, and its ongoing expansion there will mark the largest development Menlo Park has ever seen."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It was a surprise, then, when Zuckerberg announced on Thursday that Facebook could become a remote workforce in the coming decade, a decision spurred by the coronavirus, which has shuttered technology campuses across the nation. Fifty percent of Facebook employees may be working remotely in five to 10 years, he estimated \u2014 a massive shift from the company\u2019s previous emphasis on an on-site workplace that sees 6,000 people shuttled along 80 routes to its Bay Area campuses each day. Soon, employees will be able to apply to work remotely on a permanent basis, and new job openings will be made available to remote workers beginning this week."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI think Facebook will be the most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale, and we\u2019ve been working on a thoughtful and responsible plan to do this,\u201d the CEO wrote on Facebook.

Of Facebook\u2019s 48,000 employees worldwide, roughly 15,000 workers report to the Menlo Park campus."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In recent months, Twitter, Apple, Google, and Microsoft have told their employees to work from home, and Facebook isn\u2019t alone in embracing remote work. But as a major employer in the area, countless workers, businesses, and communities orbit Facebook\u2019s headquarters, which means changes to its footprint would likely produce shockwaves. The company itself has encouraged workers to become residents of Menlo Park, and until 2018, offered a $15,000 \u201cbalanced work-life\u201d bonus to employees willing to relocate within 10 miles of Facebook\u2019s campus."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Observers have likened Facebook\u2019s relationship to Menlo Park as one of a company town. In exchange for rapidly expanding its campus, Facebook has signed multiple development agreements with the city, allowing it to say that it \u201cpromotes connection and community\u201d there, rather than driving people out. It has dedicated millions of dollars to subsidizing teachers\u2019 rents, hiring public safety officers, and establishing a local housing fund. When Facebook committed $1 billion to its latest project, an enormous mixed-use complex called Willow Village, it also donated funds to create a police force dubbed the \u201cFacebook Unit,\u201d which patrols the area surrounding its campus to the ire of communities already overpoliced, as I reported last year."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "These agreements are meant, in part, to ameliorate the trauma of Facebook displacing local residents and accelerating gentrification in Menlo Park and neighboring East Palo Alto."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWe were the petri dish for their little experiment,\u201d said JT Faraji, an East Palo Alto resident and founder of the activist group Real Community Coalition, in response to questions about potential shifts at Facebook\u2019s Menlo Park campus. Faraji, whose art collective, Hood Squad, serves a free breakfast in East Palo Alto and Oakland to homeless residents each month, says he is curious if problems like traffic and soaring rent prices will improve. But he\u2019s also conscious that if Facebook leaves, so could funding for the various nonprofits and initiatives that the company has promoted. In April, for instance, Facebook launched a $15 million small business grant program in partnership with the mayors of San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cI wonder how much Facebook is going to pull back from investing in our community,\u201d he said."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cThis announcement gives a lot of unanswered questions that somebody from their policy team should be addressing very publicly.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Facebook\u2019s work-from-home announcement came days after the company published revised plans for its 59-acre Willow Village expansion.
