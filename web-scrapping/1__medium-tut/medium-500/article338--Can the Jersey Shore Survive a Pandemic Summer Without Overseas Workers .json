Going down the Shore can be a healing tonic, one many are extra-thirsty for following months of anxiety and uncertainty surrounding Covid-19. But visitors may find a different place waiting for them at their exit off the last 30 miles of the Garden State Parkway this summer because the novel coronavirus has imperiled the Summer Work Travel Program, the reliable source of labor that keeps the Shore\u2019s economy turning."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The SWT program started in 1961 as a division of the State Department\u2019s J-1 visa and brings tens of thousands of overseas college students into the country each year. The students fill seasonal jobs, with a period of free time at the end of the summer built in for traveling around the U.S. Many different countries participate, but as the Jersey Shore goes, students mostly travel from Balkan and former Soviet nations. The J-1s are so woven into the fabric of the Shore community that it would be more surprising to hear \u201cRainbow or chocolate jimmies?\u201d at the Kohr Bros.\u2019 soft-serve stands in an American accent instead of a Bulgarian one."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As with all J-1 programs, SWT falls under the jurisdiction of the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, but because it\u2019s funded by private-sector sponsors, it\u2019s not subject to the lockdown of the other of the federally funded ECA programs instituted on March 12. However, \u201cEAC strongly recommends that all [Exchange Visitor Programs] sponsors follow ECA COVID-19 guidance, including postponing program start dates for 60 days after March 12, 2020,\u201d according to a U.S. Department of State official. As of May 12, the stay has been extended, and \u201call ECA funded in-person programs will remain paused until further notice,\u201d according to the State Department\u2019s website."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/8064/1*H-l9XJzQGq8wvnvmJLyq0w.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Despite the president threatening to jettison the SWT program as part of the stream-of-consciousness immigration strategy that marked the infancy of his administration, the program remained relatively stable between 2016 and 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s withstood that because there is a heavy lobby for this in Washington,\u201d said Joe Bogle, owner of the Fudge Kitchen, the iconic Shore confectionary with locations in Cape May, Wildwood, Stone Harbor, and Ocean City. \u201cTrump has J-1s working for him,\u201d or at least he did at his Chicago hotel in 2016. His resorts and golf clubs also sponsor foreign workers every year through the more tightly regulated H-2B visa program."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Bogle sat on a bench in front of the flagship Fudge Kitchen on Cape May\u2019s idyllic Washington Street Mall, while his nephew, Kyle, whipped fudge in a copper kettle inside the shop. He calls the Summer Work Travel program \u201cone of the best things we\u2019ve ever done\u201d and has been sponsoring J-1 students every summer since the 1980s. \u201cAs much as I would like to see them, we need everybody to be safe and healthy. That has to be a priority.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Still, Bogle is sober about the potential financial impact. Fudge Kitchen has been operating with a skeleton crew and subsisting on online orders and curbside pick-up since Easter, \u201cbut we won\u2019t be able to survive without [the J-1s] if this ever ramps back up.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He swept an arm to encompass the desolate pedestrian boulevard stretching between Our Lady Star of the Sea and luxurious Congress Hall hotel, both of which were closed, along with all the shops in between. Under normal circumstances, \u201cThis would be packed,\u201d Bogle said. Day and weekend tourism has been nonexistent this spring, and while some second homeowners decamped to the beach early in the pandemic (to some locals\u2019 ire) others waited out the controversy, pushing their typical home reopenings (and discretionary spending) from March and April to May and beyond. Add to that the many questions \u2014 Are the beaches open? Can I book an Airbnb? \u2014 with answers that shift like a riptide, and the cumulative effect has been an unseasonable chilling of the Shore\u2019s economy just as Memorial Day weekend nears. The uncertainty surrounding the J-1s\u2019 arrivals is the kick when Shore businesses are already down."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Lori Lane, manager of Two Mile Landing, a sprawling seafood juggernaut on the causeway between Wildwood Crest and Cape May, sent out 45 J-1 sponsorships this year. \u201cOf those, four students were able to get their visas before the [American] embassies shut down in their respective countries.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Even if business at the Shore is lighter than normal this summer, restaurants like Two Mile can\u2019t staff up appropriately without the overseas workers it counts on every year. \u201cYou can interview till you\u2019re blue in the face, but you\u2019re not gonna have 40 bussers apply,\u201d Lane said. \u201cEspecially in Cape May County, we have such a small pool, it\u2019s laughable to think we can hire [entirely from the local population].\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The number of SWT participants in the 13 coastal New Jersey towns from Cape May to Atlantic City has fluctuated year over year between 2016 and 2019, but the differentials haven\u2019t represented major swings: down 5.3 percent from 2016 to 2017; down 3.2 percent from 2017 to 2018; up 13.3 percent from 2018 to 2019, according to statistics shared by the State Department.

While J-1 workers scoop an awful lot of ice cream at the Jersey Shore, that\u2019s one dessert America is capable of building all by itself."}], "topic": "business"}
