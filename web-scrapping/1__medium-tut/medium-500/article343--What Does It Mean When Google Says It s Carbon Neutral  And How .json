This is done by investing in carbon offsets."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A carbon offset is an investment in an activity that reduces carbon emission."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Understand it this way: Google is awarded a carbon credit that denotes how much they have invested in carbon offsets, which means how much carbon they\u2019ve prevented from entering into the atmosphere.

One credit equals one metric ton of carbon dioxide prevented from entering the atmosphere."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "How Can A Company Be Carbon Neutral?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To be carbon neutral, a company needs to invest in carbon offsets to balance its inevitable carbon emissions. There are two ways a company can do that."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "First, by minimizing (or if possible, eliminating) carbon footprints. A company can invest in renewable sources of power, reduce travels, and reuse recycled products."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But not always can you eliminate carbon emissions totally. So instead, you can invest in high-quality carbon offsets. This is the second way."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For example, take a hypothetical case of a Google data centre located in an area where renewable power sources are scarce. And there\u2019s no future possibility of renewable energy sources. In such a case, Google, in order to maintain its title of being carbon neutral, can invest in any other way to prevent greenhouse gas emissions. Like, say there\u2019s a large animal farm nearby. Animal wastes from that farm emit methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas that\u2019s more than 20 times as harmful as carbon dioxide. So, Google can invest in a project that allows the farm to collect the waste and process methane out of it."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*1AfrNVR7e1JJD6h197mxrg.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Since here Google prevented a greenhouse gas from emission, it earns credits that balance the emissions from the data centres and thus make it carbon neutral."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Carbon Positive Is The Word Or Carbon Negative?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Some brands proudly say their product is Carbon positive, which should mean the opposite of carbon negative.

Products have a beginning when they\u2019re made from raw resources and come to an end customer who eventually throws them to trash, making useful resources unusable. As demands of industries outgrow what Earth can provide in a year, the need to focus on changing this economy has increased."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Chris Adam, Google\u2019s Supply Chain Manager believes that a strong foundation for reusability on a product begins at the design stage.
