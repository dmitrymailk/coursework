{"title": "Does Jeff Bezos deserve a trillion dollars?", "data": [{"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/3000/1*kxXEEqSgx0x61MVQGFF9rQ.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Two years ago, while speaking at a forum hosted by the Bush Center, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told an anecdote about the early days of his company, when it was just him and 10 employees selling books out of his Seattle home. They were packing orders on a concrete floor when one of his workers had \u201cthe most brilliant idea\u201d that \u201cdoubled\u201d productivity:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is the richest man in the world \u2014 with a net worth of nearly $150 billion. The guy who had to be told that tables would be useful in a company that ships packages is now worth roughly double the GDP of Guatemala."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A story came out recently about how Amazon\u2019s windfall from the COVID-19 pandemic might make Bezos the world\u2019s first trillionaire, re-igniting the usual debates about inequality and whether or not billionaires \u2014 much less trillionaires \u2014 should exist."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Bezos\u2019 defenders invariably return to the mythology of how he started this online bookseller \u201cin his garage\u201d and built it into a globe-spanning e-commerce powerhouse. But as the aforementioned story about these humble beginnings shows, if the veil of this Great Man myth is pierced, one often finds men that aren\u2019t so great \u2014 or at the very least not worthy of the obscene wealth they\u2019ve accumulated."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Make the case that Bezos doesn\u2019t deserve his wealth, and you\u2019ll get some combination of three arguments:"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "1. He took the risk"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Jeff Bezos took a big risk and he was rewarded accordingly, or so it\u2019s said. But he didn\u2019t. Not really."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Bezos got his start-up capital from 22 different friends and family, most of whom pitched in $50,000 each in exchange for a 1 percent share. They included associates from his brief career on Wall Street as well as various siblings and other relatives. His parents invested $250,000, which would be almost half a million dollars today."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It was Bezos\u2019 initial investors who absorbed the most risk. The main risk he took was alienating his friends and relatives if he failed and lost all their money."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the end, it paid off for everyone who bought a share on the cheap. His parents are multi-billionaires while his sister and brother are each pushing a billion. But the \u201crisk\u201d obviously paid off disproportionately for Bezos himself who now owns 14 percent."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To the extent that he was risking anything, what did he stand to lose? If his book business failed, he\u2019d just go back to his cushy Wall Street job, where he\u2019d earn a steady six figures and claw his way up to the C-suite eventually. Worst-case scenario: He\u2019d only be worth tens of millions instead of a $150 billion."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Amazon workers risk so much more for so much less. They\u2019re risking their lives right now so that Bezos can be the first trillionaire. Eight Amazon workers have died since the COVID-19 crisis began and outbreaks have been reported at multiple warehouses."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "2. He worked hard"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s probably true that Jeff Bezos worked hard \u2014 but so do most people. The average worker puts in 47 hours a week and nearly a third work 50 hours or more. They\u2019re not all billionaires. In fact, almost two-thirds of Americans live a precarious existence, unable to afford even a small emergency."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Assuming you didn\u2019t have bills, food or rent, you\u2019d have to work 2.5 million years to accumulate Bezos\u2019 net worth through ordinary labor at the median annual income of $59,000."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And while Bezos probably put in a lot of hours during the first decade of his company, he\u2019s working progressively less as his net worth grows exponentially. He\u2019s part of the leisure class now, flying private jets to give talks in Davos and dividing his time between his massive multimillion-dollar vacation properties."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Back in April 2018, he got roasted on Twitter after posting his vacation pics of a dog-sledding trip to Norway. As it so happens, that was around the time that 54-year-old Candice Dixon started work in a California Amazon warehouse. Two months later she had to quit because the breakneck pace of the company\u2019s quota system caused devastating injuries to her back. Now she has chronic pain and is barely able to function."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Dixon was profiled in a piece in The Atlantic highlighting how Amazon\u2019s pursuit of speed, efficiency and profit leads to greater workplace injuries \u2014 and in some cases, deaths. It detailed how the company maintains an Orwellian internal surveillance regime to track its workers\u2019 movements at all times to micromanage every single aspect of the process."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In one fulfillment center in the United Kingdom, workers were forced to urinate into bottles because they couldn\u2019t step a way for just a moment to take a bathroom break. In another, workers were required to continue working around the body of an employee who died on the job. Jeff Bezos can be out of the office for months at a time, and the whole operation keeps on chugging."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "His fortune is built on hard work \u2014 just not his."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "3. He had the vision"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Jeff Bezos \u201chad a vision.\u201d Then he \u201ctook a risk\u201d and \u201cworked hard\u201d to make it happen. That\u2019s how the myth goes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "His vision was basically \u201cWhat if we sold stuff on the Internet?\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the mid-Nineties, this was a pretty common idea floating around in the ether \u2014 especially on Wall Street, where Bezos had previously worked. There were a lot of people who had the same idea. Some of their ventures took off, like eBay, which was founded just a year after Amazon. However, most didn\u2019t survive when the dotcom bubble burst."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Obviously, some subjective factors \u2014 strategies, management innovations, etc. \u2014 explain why Amazon succeeded where others failed. Bezos likely deserves some credit for those, but it\u2019s hard to say how much or whether his wealth is proportional to his contribution to the company\u2019s success."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Returning to the story about the packing tables \u2014 Bezos\u2019 biographers and fans would probably try to spin that by saying that sometimes geniuses lack common sense. Maybe a guy can be an architect of a vast, highly complex logistical system and still be too much of an idiot to realize \u201cHey, what if we used tables?\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What makes Amazon profitable \u2014 aside from the literal backbreaking labor of hundreds of thousands of employees \u2014 is its business model, and that didn\u2019t spring fully formed out of Bezos\u2019 bald head like Greek gods from the mind of Zeus. It\u2019s the collective work of thousands of managers, executives, engineers and systems analysts, all of whom are as \u2014 if not more \u2014 talented and capable than Bezos."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And a lot of the innovations that make a company work better come from ordinary employees. According to Bezos, the idea for Prime came from a junior software engineer. It was then workshopped and implemented by various teams within the company."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Many of the more forward-thinking companies are tapping into this, which they refer to as EDI, or employee-driven innovation. Ricardo Semler, of Semco, built a successful enterprise in Brazil around democratic, participatory management."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So if it wasn\u2019t the risk he took, his personal labor or his paradigm-shifting ideas that put all those zeroes on his net worth, then what was it?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There\u2019s also a tautological argument based on free market fundamentalism that goes like this: Bezos deserves what he has because he has it. He founded the company, so he deserves whatever the market rewarded him with, and it\u2019s not up to the government or anyone else to decide how much wealth a person should have."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So let\u2019s start with the basic premise that everyone is entitled to a fair share of the wealth that they create, including Bezos and Amazon workers. How is that decided? If the government is a poor instrument for determining what\u2019s fair, then the absurd inequality that exists worldwide is proof the market is even worse."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Putting aside questions of justice, fairness or whether it\u2019s moral for people to live in mansions while others live in slums \u2014 there\u2019s also the matter of whether it\u2019s rational and healthy for a society to distribute resources this way."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Unlike the libertarians who revere him today, Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, was deeply concerned with inequality and warned against the concentration of wealth into fewer and fewer hands. He considered the ultimate aim of capitalism to be \u201cuniversal opulence.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the Wealth of Nations, Smith wrote: \u201cNo society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the greater part of the members are poor and miserable.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Today\u2019s self-styled classical liberals \u2014 the kind of people who rush to the defense of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk \u2014 are students of Ayn Rand not Adam Smith, whose policy prescriptions were more akin to those of a modern social democrat. Defining a wealthy society as one with low profits and high wages, Smith argued for a living wage equal to twice what it costs to support a family of four."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Smith denounced landlords as parasites who \u201clove to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth.\u201d He favored both inheritance taxes and progressive taxation, writing that the rich should be taxed \u201csomething more than in proportion\u201d to their wealth."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He also recognized a fundamental asymmetry between capital and labor in terms of bargaining power, which drives down wages. Smith was likewise particularly far-sighted in his prediction of how the wealthy would corrupt democracy by pushing for laws that favored their own self-interest."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Though Amazon is regarded as a capitalist success story, it would be anathema to Adam Smith. It\u2019s a huge industrial Leviathan barreling toward monopoly. Amazon aggressively fights against any efforts of its staff to organize while sacrificing workers\u2019 well-being for the sake of profit."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Free market ideologues who regard themselves as Smith\u2019s heirs focus almost exclusively on individuals, but he was concerned with the prosperity of entire societies."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It has to be recognized that the individual can\u2019t be separated from the collective. Amazon\u2019s high profits are inversely correlated with its workers\u2019 low wages. Every dollar that it avoids paying in taxes is a dollar that can\u2019t be spent on affordable housing and other social programs."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So the question of whether he deserves to be a trillionaire or a billionaire can\u2019t be asked in isolation. The real question: Does he deserve to live luxuriously more than others deserve to live decently?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The answer is no."}], "topic": "business"}
