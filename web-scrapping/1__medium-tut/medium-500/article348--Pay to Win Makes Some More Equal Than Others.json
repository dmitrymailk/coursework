Yet there\u2019s something far more nefarious about pay-to-win than simply leveraging cash to get one up on the Rebellion \u2014 and it speaks to something far more personal, far more intimate than topping a leaderboard."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Online games can be the great equaliser \u2014 they have the unrivaled ability to suspend the standards applied to our underwhelming corporal selves, if only fleetingly. It\u2019s not difficult to see why someone might spend lots of time away from themselves \u2014 to become someone else, do something else, be somewhere else."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Companionship, entertainment, challenge \u2014 each one is escapism in different forms. That escapism doesn\u2019t just include my experience, it includes myself. Height, weight, hairline \u2014 everything is subject to change in the virtual worlds we choose to engage with. The bump on my nose, that fading top mop, and those few extra pounds are negated in online games."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We\u2019re all equalised, then. At least to a certain extent."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We aren\u2019t in other ways, though.

We can decide to engage in hobbies and groups and professions, but that doesn\u2019t save us from the judgement of others as we walk down the street, or drive that car many would consider state of the art \u2014 had you bought it fifteen years ago. If you don\u2019t feel good about yourself, then, you need only choose an online community where those feelings not need apply. It\u2019s those feelings, as dark and tragic as they can perhaps become, that are primed for exploitation in loot boxes and microtransactions."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Pay-to-win microtransactions: real-world money for in-game advantages. It\u2019s here that the \u2018equalising effect\u2019 begins to wither under the might of excessive corporate want. Now, real-world standards and limitations are introduced into our make-believe reality and identities. Those thousands of hours spent developing that sick three-sixty no-scope are suddenly undermined by that guy who spent actual cash on that big-ass bazooka. That standard you opted for \u2014 to be judged by your ability to shoot things in the face \u2014 is now replaced by your ability to pay for in-game gear."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In other words: by how much you earn."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*q7tGdBhobfAIdZS1.jpg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Microtransactions fundamentally break the barrier between fantasy and reality.

It brings this identity crashing back to reality once more \u2014 the exact opposite of what you and the developers presumably want to achieve."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And there\u2019s countless reasons why we might want to adopt a digital persona. Illnesses, both mental and physical, can limit our time with people in the real world \u2014 with nothing said of geographical location, isolation or garden-variety loneliness.
