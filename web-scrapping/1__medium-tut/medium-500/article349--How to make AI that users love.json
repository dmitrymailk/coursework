Some common tactics are: 1. Don\u2019t be wrong, 2. Let the user help, 3. Keep it simple, 4. Help the user understand, 5. Avoid encouraging detrimental behavior, and lastly 6.

My responsibilities have been primarily data science, but also include aspects of software engineering, product management, and design. At MOCAP Analytics, we created infographics for NFL and NBA fans and teams from player-tracking spatiotemporal data. At Tonal, we develop a virtual personal trainer that, among other features, counts reps, spots weight when a user struggles, tracks progress, and adjusts the weight as a user strengthens over time."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At the heart of the following guidelines is understanding the difference between the user\u2019s perception of AI and the reality of AI. To your users and the general public, AI is perceived to be some infallible all-knowing superhuman being that knows them better than they know themselves (e.g., Jared and Fiona on Silicon Valley, baseline test in Blade Runner)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Of course, the reality is AI today is usually only passably good at the one narrow task it is trained to solve, and if anything deviates, it deteriorates quickly (a few fun examples are hacking Tesla with tape on a sign, Google Assistant fails, Google Maps directing cars into mud, fooling object recognition in images). Further, the ways AI gets tripped up are not the same as the ways humans do. The truth is that AI\u2019s biggest advantage over human intelligence (with exceptions like AlphaGo) is not that it\u2019s smarter than humans, but that it\u2019s faster and cheaper. AI can classify a million images as containing a cat or a dog in an hour and for a few dollars. But ask that same AI to also classify a rabbit and you\u2019re out of luck. Meanwhile, a human, at one image per second, would take 11 sleepless days and nights and thousands of dollars to achieve the same feat, but the rabbit\u2019s no big deal."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "An AI that doesn\u2019t meet a user\u2019s expectation can cause a loss of trust (see negativity bias), disengagement, demotivation, and even unintended harmful behavior.
