No? I didn\u2019t think so. How about watched a turtle crossing the road? Probably not. Maybe spent an hour standing in line at the post office? Well that\u2019s pretty likely. But isn\u2019t it so boring?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Without movement, things lose their buzz. Motion is exciting. It often tells a story that text or static images could not do alone. That\u2019s why animated logos have taken a rise in the last few years."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Why animate a logo"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Our eyes gravitate to things that move. Large corporations like Google have invested time and money in giving their logo a life of its own. Google\u2019s Daily Doodles are displayed on their homepage. It separates the top search engine from others and only deepens their brand value to the communities it serves."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*WSpyQoSprbSuoAu5V7YmQw.gif"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The animations don\u2019t drive sales, improve traffic, or guarantee customers.

Goodhabitz by Wevoke"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Doesn\u2019t it just look amazing when a logo\u2019s proportions are all in check? Each letter extends perfectly to its cap line and falls on the baseline just as well. The structure of a design will either make or break an animation.
