And you\u2019re reading this article right now because you\u2019re interested in the narrative around a particular topic. We were told stories when we were children, before we went to bed and our interest comes from an ancient desire to gather around a fireplace and to be taken on a dramatic adventure told in words."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As any type of designer, we\u2019ve become pretty good at telling stories to our users, clients and customers but we\u2019re missing out on one important fireplace: Using storytelling as a tool when it comes to interacting with our own team, the people within the business that we interact most often and most closely with. I see this happening in the form of links to designs simply being shared, rather than being presented. This leaves the receiver with the task of having to figure it out for themselves when what we should be doing is to be crafting a narrative around our solution and telling the story of it, because every solution is a story waiting to be told."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "On a daily basis, we\u2019re working with personas, business objectives, user journeys and problems that have to solved and these elements already make up all the ingredients necessary for a good story. The problem (and its solution) is usually the part of any story where the tension reaches its peak and this just happens to be our expertise \u2014 we solve problems on a daily basis and we\u2019re usually involved in the process of getting to the solution from start to finish, so we\u2019re perfectly equipped to be telling stories around our solutions, so the next time the opportunity presents itself, don\u2019t hesitate to grab it!"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Here\u2019s how."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Stronger relationships in the business"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The main benefits of going with this approach that I\u2019ve experienced in the past have been very impactful on the relationships I\u2019ve been able to build within the business."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When telling the story in the right way, we\u2019re motivating people by getting them excited about the solution and excitement can be a very strong motivator. Your stakeholders will approach you with solutions to problems they\u2019re encountering along the way, rather than throwing the problem back at you because you got them invested in it in the first place. I\u2019ve seen this happen especially with developers \u2014 when you manage to get them invested in your solution, turning it into our solution, they will go above and beyond when implementing it, rather than just executing on something that\u2019s been imposed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Another benefit of this approach is being transparent about our processes and the act of designing which has become somewhat mystical. By breaking down the barriers around design and being transparent about how we got to a particular solution, we\u2019re opening the doors to more meaningful collaboration and increased involvement which leads to more perspectives and better feedback when working on a solution."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The last and most important benefit of using storytelling is that we\u2019re contributing to increasing the value of design within the business. This is something we still have to work on every single day, as we have to earn the trust within businesses. By tailoring the narrative for our audiences, opening up about how we got to the solution and highlighting how it fits into the big picture, we\u2019re showing that we\u2019ve really made the problem our own, emphasising the skills we applied to solve it and why it really matters. This helps us to get closer to defining the ROI (return on investment) of design, which has been difficult to assess for so long."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Opportunities are everywhere"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Just like with any other skill, storytelling has to be practised.
