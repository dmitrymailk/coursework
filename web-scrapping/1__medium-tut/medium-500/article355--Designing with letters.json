I love that we can go back and forth."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As a designer, I also think back to the time when design tools were slow-paced: letterpress, phototypesetting, letterset.

But the ad that you had mocked up also really helped me get started \u2014 the one that was a text from a director who had endless ideas about an alarm clock prop.

We were trying to find ways to relate to this audience by being more personable."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "LaDonna: Right. We didn\u2019t want to take ourselves too seriously; we wanted to have a sense of humor. So we began each chapter with a story or an exaggerated scenario like the alarm clock \u2014 something a filmmaker would relate to."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Pedro: It\u2019s interesting, because you\u2019re giving people this long-form piece, which requires a lot of attention from them.

Whenever you and I work on events, I\u2019m always trying to come up with the shortest-possible booth headline or tagline. So this was a completely different exercise, and really fun, to be able to have endless (or almost endless) pages that I could fill. But then the challenge becomes: How do you make it relevant and readable so people stick with it all the way through?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Pedro: That\u2019s such a great point. We live in a time of short and fast communication, emojis, and gifs, so I think a lot of long-form graphic design is inheriting some of this language. For example, big typography and text interruptions such as emoji, or, in our case, file types. In the book format, we applied display typography and the kind of layouts you would typically use in an ad, and then even more hybrids came from that design direction."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "LaDonna: I love the way the whole concept came together. I think that the way we worked \u2014 riffing off of each other\u2019s ideas, sending copy and layouts and edits back and forth \u2014 meant that we truly built the book together."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Like when I gave you one of my first drafts of copy and you had the idea to take words within the sentences and turn them into file types.

I thought it was great that we could make decisions that really live within copy and design simultaneously."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "File types are inherently relatable for anyone creating content digitally. In filmmaking, so many parts have to come together digitally from beginning to end. File types are also part of anyone\u2019s experience with Dropbox, so it\u2019s a very organic way of telling a story from the technology perspective."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Files are made up of words, so it was great to reimagine that relationship. It\u2019s like taking the atomic units of a film and telling the story of those hidden units. All these files lived within the paragraph, each of them functioning as a word \u2014 again, almost like an emoji would. The whole idea was a great symbiosis of design and language."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "LaDonna: And a great solution for reinforcing the whole point of the piece, which is that Dropbox works for filmmakers and can be a creative medium. I think the book was successful because we had the space to tell that story in a creative way.

What was the process for you? Because you have to dig deep into filmmaking and find these instances or moments that feel real. So what was the process for you to get to those moments?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "LaDonna: A lot of googling. A lot of research. Looking up filmmaker problems. There was one story or chapter opening that was about a meadow that got flooded. I completely made that up, but I got the idea after reading about what happens on shoots at the last minute. Especially if you\u2019re making a small, independent film \u2014 which was the audience we were going for \u2014 and you don\u2019t have a lot of time or flexibility or money to move things around. What if there\u2019s this massive rainstorm the night before you\u2019re going to shoot in an outdoor location and suddenly you can\u2019t use that location anymore?"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1440/1*OJMosAvk_Y0XuzkU7vmKJQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Pedro: Which seems like something that would completely happen, something that would be part of the craziness of making a film."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That\u2019s also why we were there, at Sundance. We\u2019re trying to give filmmakers the tools that will make their lives easier."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "LaDonna: One of the other things I love about this book is the image selection. Tone-wise, I purposefully chose to write in a way that was really conversational and tongue-in-cheek in a lot of places, and it feels like all the images go along with that tone. Because they\u2019re not perfect; they\u2019re a work in progress; they feel like they\u2019re part of something that\u2019s moving really quickly. So, to me, they are speaking the same language as the copy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Pedro: It was a very collaborative process with Gabie Matte, my fellow Dropbox designer. We had this design idea built around frames, like the frames of a film. Today, many films are shot digitally, but they used to be shot at 24 frames per second on celluloid. So you get this sequence of images in linear form, just like a language, and that became a design idea we thought would combine really well with copy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Then Gabie and I had to search for images that would reflect all these weird stories we\u2019d created, images that would serve as metaphors for all the parts of the process. Finding images \u2014 in Flickr, on eBay, and from all these strange places on the internet \u2014 was an adventure. But it was worth it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "LaDonna: Then you brought UI into your design system as well."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Pedro: Right. And giving audiences an idea of what a digital product can do is not always a straightforward process. An abstraction needs to happen to give the audience a simplified and open-ended idea of what they will be able to do. We call this \u201cabstract UI.\u201d Since we were designing for long-form, it was a great opportunity to dive deeper as well as try to direct these abstractions to filmmaking, as much as possible."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2576/1*r1WSmQSZYlSq-RliI9inmA.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "LaDonna: I think showing our UI gave the piece more credibility.

I could imagine that a filmmaker would walk away from this book thinking, \u201cDropbox really is a great tool for what I do!\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Pedro: Bringing in the UI also made me think about the difference between the stories we were telling at the beginning of a chapter, and then the more informational content within that chapter. The tone of the copy was creating these two voices. At some point it became evident that we needed two typographic treatments so as not to conflate them."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2584/1*6pvXgQzpz1HDxqZIZTEQlQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The different fonts create a sort of dialogue within the book: here\u2019s a story, and here\u2019s the response to that story.
