It\u2019s like death or taxes: it\u2019s inescapable. You might spend one second thinking about it, or you might have an entire team dedicated to onboarding, but you can\u2019t avoid it. At 4Degrees our onboarding is very labor-intensive. Someone from our team spends an hour or more walking new users through the platform and pointing out relevant features. It adds a nice personal touch to our business software, but we are quickly outgrowing this method."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019m in the process of designing our in-product onboarding flow from the ground up. My process always begins with lots and lots of research. At this point in my research, I\u2019ve gone through so many onboarding flows, my inbox is just a pile of marketing emails. You can\u2019t even imagine how many times I\u2019ve hit \u201cunsubscribe\u201d in the past week, but it was worth it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ve been through some amazing onboarding flows, some horrible flows, and everything in-between.

As I started to analyze what I consider to be the \u201cbest\u201d onboarding flows, one theme kept jumping out at me.

I call this a value action."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Lots of companies focus on getting the user to value as quickly as possible, but they miss an important part: correlating the user's effort to the value."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In his book Hooked, Nir Eyal talks about the psychological phenomenon known as \u201cthe escalation of commitment\u201d which says that the more effort a person puts into a product, the more they value it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This phenomenon can be seen in lots of different products, from Ikea furniture to Betty Crocker cakes; all types of users value products that they put effort into. It\u2019s the same with digital products.

The first step is to look at some good examples. Since every product offers different values to its users, every value action will look very different.

This is an important but manageable task for a new user to accomplish."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "During the onboarding flow, the user can visualize their work in a way that helps them prioritize tasks. For most users, this helps them to see the value of the product. The user is putting in the effort (naming boards, writing out tasks) that is adding to the value they feel. If Trello left users in an empty state or provided placeholder data, the user wouldn\u2019t experience as much value.

The best onboarding flows show a value action and teach the user how to navigate the product. These flows help the user understand where the important buttons are and where to go for help. The best onboarding flows leave their users with the knowledge of how to repeat the value action!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s not enough to get the user to value; it\u2019s not enough to get the user to understand the relationship between effort and value; the onboarding flow also has to teach the user how to repeat that value action on their own!"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Duolingo: Value + Action + Product Education"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1392/0*Z5T4kwHgjj2XUxOb"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Duolingo is one of those products that makes designing an onboarding flow look incredibly easy.

Thinking this way can uncover the hidden complexity that can creep into products."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If your product is (mostly) intuitive, the next step is to keep the onboarding flow short. No user wants to go through 45 minutes of value actions and product education."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At 4Degrees, our product has a lot of features; there are dozens of value actions that I could lead users to. It shouldn\u2019t be difficult to uncover value actions in your product, the hard part is choosing one or two value actions and leaving the rest out of the onboarding flow."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My advice is to test, test, and test some more. Let your users tell you what value actions work and which ones don\u2019t. Who knows, maybe you need different value actions for different types of users!
