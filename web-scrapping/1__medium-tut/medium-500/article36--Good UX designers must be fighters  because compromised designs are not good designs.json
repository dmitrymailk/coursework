Each UX designer is able to dream up an experiment, and is given complete autonomy to change the entire interface at their own discretion. They are paired with an engineer who helps implement the design, and then they run an experiment for a couple of minutes. Globally. They literally A/B test planet Earth. Millions of users see the experiment. And millions don\u2019t. After a few minutes, if conversion goes up by a fraction, Booking.com keeps the change. If conversion goes down, they pull it and rollback. The engineering behind this machine is amazingly efficient, incredible even. And while it\u2019s impressive, it causes a problem that I believe will ultimately be their undoing: their product is ugly, difficult to use, and inconsistent."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To convert to sale on booking.com users must re-learn the interface on a second by second basis while they attempt to traverse sections of the site that have been architected and designed by different people at different times.

(Ego depletion is a tangible and measurable cost on the brain caused by micro-decisions, subconscious and conscious. It actually affects blood sugar. Pretty scary.)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In other words, when using the product, your mistress gets confused, and she does not like that.

Booking.com is successful, in my opinion, because of their sales and marketing distribution network. They are the cheapest, globally. They guarantee this by doing deals with hotels all over the planet. We all know they are the cheapest. And Booking.com spends a fortune on ads to make sure that we know they\u2019re the cheapest. So as a customer, I have a choice: Pay more and have a lovely designed and beautifully consistent experience, or pay less, and deal with the complex design by committee website that is Booking.com.

Sure the vision is iterated, augmented and improved progressively over time with the help of your team. But as the designer, you must be the gatekeeper of any decisions related to the interface. You must decide which pieces of information inform your design to the extent that you would consider making a change to it. And you must decide which pieces of information must be discarded because they do not fit the vision. You are the only person that can do this. And you will be the only person responsible if you fail. You\u2019re the babysitter.

Hopefully they won\u2019t be too afraid to come to you with suggestions or ideas though, because you showed consideration and took the time to validate their idea.
