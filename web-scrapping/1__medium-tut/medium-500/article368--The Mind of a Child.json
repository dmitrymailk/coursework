These days, I am often a task-focused gamer. I need a narrative, or a series of goals or quests, to hold my interest in a game.

I know, for example, the approximate angle of a hill that makes it \u201cunclimbable\u201d, so I won\u2019t bother trying. I know what a skybox is, and I can tell where assets have been placed to give the illusion of a larger game world than actually exists. So when I see mountains off in the distance, I acknowledge they look nice, but I know that I can\u2019t reach them. So, I don\u2019t try. With my years of experience in playing games, I can usually spot procedurally generated content a mile off, so I\u2019m not filled with a sense of wonder when I encounter the thousandth variation on the world environment; I know that it is likely just going to be another location with a slightly different combination of assets."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Becoming an older gamer invariably coincides with becoming a more discerning and cynical gamer.

I was constantly seeking out the limits of what I could do in a game engine, and when I found those walls, I would carefully search along them for cracks that might reveal some new doorway into an unexplored corner of the game world. It was this approach that showed me all the illusions that game designers use to make their worlds seem so much larger and expansive. In Big Red Software\u2019s 1996 game, Big Red Racing, each track was situated in a seemingly endless flat plain. One day, after becoming bored with racing, I decided to set out across that plain, to see where it would take me, and I discovered that I would just reappear on the other side of the map. The maps where each track was located were essentially globes with no discernible features other than a racing track."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the case of my daughter playing Fez, she kept swimming for several minutes, and as I already suspected, she discovered nothing.

Jedi Knight released in September 1997, so I\u2019d been playing these two levels non-stop for several months. When I wasn\u2019t able to use the phone line to play modem-to-modem multiplayer with my friend down the street (\u201cMUM! GET OFF THE PHONE!\u201d), I was making multiplayer characters and exploring the levels on my own. As for the single player level, I had played through it dozens of times, and had explored every nook and cranny, using cheat codes to help me reach areas that I couldn\u2019t otherwise get to.

Besides the huge levels of the single player game (Jedi Knight really is underappreciated for its level design), I got involved in multiplayer quite heavily on The Zone, Microsoft\u2019s free online games service that was popular in the late 1990s. The modding scene for Jedi Knight was incredibly active, and one of the custom levels that eventually rose to prominence was Drazen Isle by Jeff Walters, which you can still get at the popular Jedi Knight series mod website The Massassi Temple.

This was an incredibly popular way to play, and other modders soon released their own levels with more extensive modifications to the game\u2019s code to better enable RPG mechanics (such as the Baron\u2019s Hed RPG mod).

Firstly, the games industry has changed immensely in the two decades since Jedi Knight\u2019s peak, and expectations of what constitutes an engaging gameplay loop have shifted significantly. But that is what it is. The real factor that limits me from returning to those days is imagination. I like to think I have a very active imagination, I\u2019m generally a creative person and I like to draw and write.

At the time of its release in 1985, Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar (Origin Systems) was quite revolutionary. A huge world to explore, a deep and engaging set of quests. For gamers at the time, this was the standard for representing a world. Technology has advanced so far in that time, and gamers expect more from digital representations of worlds. So, for someone to appreciate what made Ultima IV brilliant requires significantly more imagination now then it did back then, because we have a modern understanding of what is possible. What was once a noble figure of virtue heading off on a quest through a dark and mysterious forest is now a simple stick figure, holding a pixelated cross representing a sword, walking through a mass of green blobs that somewhat resemble trees. For someone who is used to the vibrancy of Velen or Skellige in The Witcher III: Wild Hunt (CD Projekt RED, 2015), this is quite the leap in imaginative adaptability. Not to mention that the actual mechanics involved in playing the game are archaic and an obstacle to learning how to play in themselves."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*hASjbmSuSgEKb-YidashVw.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I don\u2019t mean to say that graphics are more important than gameplay. I definitely don\u2019t mean to say that, because it is not true, and the retro game revival in the past decade is evidence of that.

Meanwhile, a game like Ultima Underworld (Blue Sky Productions/Looking Glass Studios, 1992), which is regarded as one of the most revolutionary achievements in game design ever \u2014 hasn\u2019t really aged as well as other games from that era."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The great thing about imagination is that it can transform the intended experience of a game into something entirely different. In the late 1990s, I spent a lot of time playing Need for Speed II: Special Edition (Electronic Arts, 1997). The races got old eventually, especially if you weren\u2019t in a competitive mood. However, the great thing about the physics engine in these old Need for Speed games was the obscene crashes you could create. Hitting a car on the right angle could send you soaring through the sky, rolling down the road long after a car that weighs a couple of tonnes should. Eventually, this became the standard way we would play the game. Split-screen multiplayer, entirely ignoring the objective of racing. Instead, we would drive around trying to cause epic pile ups; as a side note, I think this is why I so thoroughly enjoyed Crash Mode in the Burnout series."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*eegBjsdcCF9QUKxoKL6-xA.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At some point, and I don\u2019t recall how, but our crass teenage minds became obsessed with the notion of \u201cmating\u201d the large semi-trailer cabs (Mack trucks, as my friend called them).

Shortly afterward, a third Mack truck would drive past, and so we came to the conclusion that we were breeding trucks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This sounds ridiculous, and it was, but regardless, we spent hours upon hours doing this. I don\u2019t know if this actually works \u2014 I haven\u2019t tried to replicate it for empirical study. I think it is far more likely a consequence of the technical limitations of the game engine, such as only rendering three trucks at one time, combined with a healthy dose of our own childish confirmation bias. But whether it was simply our misinterpretation, or whether we had somehow discovered some sort of obscure Easter egg in the game (and to be honest, I wouldn\u2019t put it past a game developer), the main thing is that we had an enormous amount of fun with imagination-driven emergent play."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Emergent gameplay is one reason why I believe games are one of the most important developmental tools in a parent\u2019s arsenal. Game worlds provide a safe and engaging way for a child to explore the concepts of cause and effect and consequence, in addition to all the other valuable lessons they can learn, such as resource and time management. When children play games, they are constantly testing the world to see what happens when they do something. They are learning critical problem solving and analytical skills. I\u2019m reasonably certain that a two-truck pile up on the Hume Highway isn\u2019t going to result in more baby trucks driving past, but what I was learning was foundational ideas about how to analyse a situation (an in-game car crash), develop a hypothesis (two crashed trucks equals a third truck) and come to a conclusion (you can breed Mack trucks in Need for Speed).

But several hours into playing the game, the imaginative part of my brain lapsed in concentration, and the cold, rational part stepped in \u2014 \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d it said. \u201cThis game has no objective.
