We need to choose which one to pursue and which to drop. Such decisions happen daily. A problem starts once the Product Manager decides to evaluate some ideas in-depth.

A bad choice is to continue alone because the Product Manager will lack a broad enough perspective."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I love getting different perspectives from the beginning.
