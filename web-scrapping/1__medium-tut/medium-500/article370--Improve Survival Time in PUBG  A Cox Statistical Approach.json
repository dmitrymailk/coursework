It is one of the popular and the most played games right now. Players fight to death until one remains, so it is a survival game. There are pure statistical models to analyse the survival times. Using PUBG data, we will try to use one such survival models to understand how different strategies can improve the player\u2019s survival rates."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This blog is written for tech, non-tech readers and most importantly PUBG players.

It is the most commonly used regression model for survival data. The most interesting aspect of this survival modeling is it\u2019s ability to examine the relationship between survival time and predictors. For example, if we are examining the survival of patients then the predictors can be age, blood pressure, gender, smoking habits, etc. These predictors are usually termed as covariates. Note: It must not be confused with linear regression, the assumptions might be linear in both regression and survival analysis but the underlying concepts are different. Methods we employ for parameter estimations of regression model and survival model are very different from each other."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1710/1*SQRNQEr0jmZFRitbXU5X1Q.png"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "PUBG Problem Setup & Data Engineering"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s have a look at the raw data before we define the problem setup."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2278/1*EJbvmdr-cFMMVy4pLnRNDQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Feature Description: player_size: Team Size, player_dist_ride: Distance covered using vehicle by the player , player_dist_walk: Distance walked by the player, player_kills: Number of kills by the player, players_survive_time: time survived by the player"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Problem Setup"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Players in PUBG can choose different strategies to maximise the survival time.
