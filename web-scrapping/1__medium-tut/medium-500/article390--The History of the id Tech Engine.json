That\u2019s thanks to the latest iteration of id Software\u2019s game engine, id Tech 7. Since its first appearance in Doom (id Software, 1993), id Tech has been at the forefront of pushing hardware to its limits, and the id Tech legacy lives on in the many games it gave birth to \u2014 games such as Jedi Outcast, Rage, Dishonored, and Valve\u2019s GoldSrc and Source engine. While it might not enjoy the same dominance today as it once did (that title goes to Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine), id Tech is still one of the most influential engines in gaming history.

After Wolfenstein 3D\u2019s success, id Software decided to begin development of their next generation engine. With additional input from John Romero, Dave Taylor and Paul Radek, the engine debuted with Doom in 1993. What made id Tech 1 so revolutionary was its performance efficiency and rendering quality. While not a true 3D engine (the player is unable to look up and down, and rooms can\u2019t be place over one another), Doom\u2019s fantastic level design complemented the engine\u2019s limitations and gave players the impression that the levels were far more complicated than they were. The Doom engine went on to power Doom II (1994), Heretic (1994), Hexen (1995) and the cult RPG, Strife (1996)."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Quake Engine and Quake II Engine (id Tech 2)"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*IW3gEm2sudXYisOAgx0euQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "By 1996, the games industry had been swamped with \u201cDoom clones\u201d as FPS games were frequently referred to. The Doom engine was beginning to show its age, particularly against the rival Build engine from 3D Realms. Enter the Quake engine. It\u2019s hard to fathom the huge influence that the Quake engine had on the games industry, but this graphic gives a decent summary. Like Doom before it, Quake revolutionised first-person gaming. Not only did it feature excellent polygon-based graphics, Quake also set the standard for competitive multiplayer gaming with its rock-solid network code. The Quake engine received a new coat of paint and reappeared 18 months later in id Software\u2019s Quake II."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*SlxrMCIxr9wdP0shkmjJlQ.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It was the additional refinements in the Quake II engine (later renamed id Tech 2) that really drew the eye of other developers, and the Quake II engine powered many of the major FPS games (and some other genres) at the time, games such as SiN (1998), Kingpin: Life of Crime (1999), Soldier of Fortune (2000), Daikatana (2000) and Anachronox (2001).

For the first time, id Software faced some serious competition. The Unreal Engine was powerful, efficient and beautiful.

Before long, Epic had announced multiplayer shooter Unreal Tournament, while id Software announced Quake III Arena. The stage was set for the biggest showdown in FPS history \u2014 not just a showdown of games, but a showdown of the engines that powered them. While Epic merely had to give their Unreal Engine a polish, id Software threw everything they had at a new id Tech engine.

When id Tech 4 finally made its debut, there was no question that this was a powerful engine \u2014 Doom 3 was easily one of the most impressive looking games on the market. However, this power came at a cost, and anything but the best gaming rig struggled to run id Tech 4 at a decent framerate. Meanwhile, id Software faced mounting competition from Source, Unreal Engine 2 and CryEngine.
