Of course, such theories are now considered pseudoscientific and have not made it into peer-reviewed science journals."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Etymologically, the modern English word \u201cmemory\u201d comes to us from the Middle English memorie, which in turn comes from the Anglo-French memoire or memorie, and ultimately from the Latin memoria and memor, meaning \u201cmindful\u201d or \u201cremembering\u201d."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In more physiological or neurological terms, memory is, at its simplest, a set of encoded neural connections in the brain. It is the re-creation or reconstruction of past experiences by the synchronous firing of neurons that were involved in the original experience."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Because of the way in which memory is encoded, it is perhaps better thought of as a kind of collage or jigsaw puzzle, rather than in the traditional manner as a collection of recordings or pictures or video clips, stored as discrete wholes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Can\u2019t remember something?
