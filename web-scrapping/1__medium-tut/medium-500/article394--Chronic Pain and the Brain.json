Perhaps it was a sudden cramp, an ache that has lingered after a surgery, or stepping on your kid\u2019s stray Lego. Pain is powerful\u2013 it can stir up emotion, elicit some unsavory words, and sometimes bring everyday life to a standstill."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, this pain is completely internal\u2013 a monster of your own making. Pain is a sensory modality, like the more familiar five senses, that we have developed over the course of evolutionary history which likely provided survival advantages. Pain instructed our early ancestors that rest is good for a healing wound and that hot coals shouldn\u2019t be touched."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But the truth is that perceived pain, our interpretation of a stimulus, doesn\u2019t carry objective information about the actual danger of the stimulus; it is simply the firing of certain pain-transmitting neurons in your nervous system."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When you accidentally bang your funny bone, it can be momentarily excruciating and all-consuming.

In fact, if these circuits are impaired, pain can be felt with no apparent cause; if these circuits are non-functional, pain is not felt at all."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Pain is, by definition, a subjective sensory and emotional experience that is also affected by an individual\u2019s tolerance, mood, anxiety, social support, and pain catastrophizing.

Chronic pain is an umbrella term that characterizes many common conditions including chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, IBS, and chronic headaches."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Unlike pain triggered by an external stimulus, or nociceptive pain, most chronic pain is caused by neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain has no external stimulus: it is caused by dysfunction within the pain-transmitting machinery itself. It can develop after an injury, illness, or seemingly without reason, but this insidious mechanism ultimately results in constant, inappropriate pain signaling becoming the body\u2019s new normal."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Pain circuits, like all other neuronal circuits, are composed of interconnected neurons. Virtually all neurons can be boiled down as functionally excitatory or inhibitory. This means that when a neuron is stimulated, it can excite a neuron in the pathway, propagating the signal or it can inhibit a neuron in the pathway, dampening the signal."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2792/1*m-eXzdSmtoEotV8Fg3NDdA.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To simplify, think back to when you learned to multiply negative numbers. Recall that one negative factor in a string of factors makes the product negative and two negatives actually makes a positive.

If the source of pain, particularly that of the neurogenic variety, is later in the ascending circuit than where the NSAID is acting, the pain signal is still reaching the brain and being perceived."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Opioids: playing with fire"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For years, opioids were the go-to pharmacologic therapy for managing chronic pain. Dissecting the misinformation and medical practices surrounding legal opioids that caused the US epidemic is beyond the scope of this article, but it\u2019s important not to demonize the drugs themselves\u2013 given the right patient, medical indication, and responsible oversight, opioids can, in some cases, be an effective and life-saving therapy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Pharmacological and illicit opioids like morphine, oxycodone, codeine, heroin, and fentanyl act on the opioid receptors, our own inherent pain regulation systems.

This suggests that the mechanism, at least in part, involves synaptic plasticity\u2013 a physical and functional remodeling of neuronal connections."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Most theories agree that the mechanism of action relies on strengthening norepinephrine synapses in the descending pathway, which are affected by TCAs and SNRIs. One study provides strong evidence that norepinephrine action is two-pronged\u2013 an immediate, central effect that employs the opioid system and a delayed, peripheral anti-inflammatory effect."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Additionally, the classic therapeutic effects of antidepressants may alleviate the emotional and cognitive components of pain.
