Some were expected, such as the association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical, head and neck cancers, and the association between Fusobacterium species and gastrointestinal cancers. But the team also identified previously unknown microbial signatures that strongly discriminated between cancer types. For example, the presence of Faecalibacterium species distinguished colon cancer from other cancers."
