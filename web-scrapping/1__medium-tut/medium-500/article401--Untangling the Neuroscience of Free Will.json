Movements that are either self-paced, pre-set, or involve pre-planning appear to be type I RP, which are characterized by an inclined \u201cramp-like\u201d form and begin approximately 1050 ms prior to the onset of an action. Spontaneous actions are associated with the more \u201cdome-like\u201d type II RP, and these begin, on average, 575 ms prior to the action onset. The third type of RP begins about 240 ms before the action.

Furthermore, near the end of a RP, cerebral activity begins to shift toward one hemisphere. This shift is called the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). These LRP indicate that the decision to perform a specific movement, such as which hand is going to perform a key press, occurs prior to the awareness onset (Eimer & Haggard, 1998).

Participants also completed the Free Will and Determinism questionnaire (Paulhaus & Carey, 2010; Paulhaus & Margesson, 1994).

However, in order to allow the participants to remain anonymous, the data is only reported as the average of the groups. In such a design, just one or two outliers could drive any significant observations. As they could not determine if any outliers existed, this makes these data somewhat open to interpretation. It is also possible that presenting strong statements against free will can cause bias (Vohs & Schooler, 2008)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Other research sought to expand the work done by Vohs and Schooler (2008) by investigating how free will beliefs relate to helpfulness and aggression (Baumeister, Masicampo, & DeWall, 2009).

Compared to participants who read free will statements or neutral statements, people in the determinism condition were the least willing to engage in helpful behaviors. In the next experiment, rather than priming participants with anti-free will statements, a short questionnaire (Paulhaus & Carey, 2010; Paulhaus & Margesson, 1994) was completed to assess pre-existing beliefs in free will prior to a test of willingness to help a stranger (by volunteering their time). In this model, weak free will beliefs predicted a lower number of hours subjects were willing to volunteer.

This form indicated that the person has a clear and strong dislike of spicy food; therefore, aggression was quantified as the amount of a hot salsa used.
