Its underlying mechanisms of neuroinfection are robust as well.

The viral load in the cerebrospinal fluid starts to increase until the second phase. Mild or no respiratory symptoms are present."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In phase 2 CNS clearance, the virus starts to go into deeper parts of the brain, such as the brainstem \u2014 the respiratory brain center. Respiratory symptoms become more apparent. The viral load in the cerebrospinal fluid begins to decrease. Here is when the nasopharyngeal swab can detect the virus."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In phase 3 immune response, the virus has replicated substantially and alarmed the immune system. A cytokine storm may occur, leading to widespread organ damage, including the brain and lungs. The brain respiratory center is further damaged, worsening respiratory symptoms."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In this final phase, the virus may be absent in the cerebrospinal fluid, but detectable in the nasopharyngeal swab. The completed phase 2 could explain why the cerebrospinal fluid was tested negative for the virus in some Neuro-COVID cases. Depending on which areas of the brain are damaged, either one of the three clinical types of Neuro-COVID occurs."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Input From Other Research Groups: The Brainstem Involvement"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Two other papers by researchers in China support the proposed neuroinfection route the Italian researchers, which involve either olfactory nerve transport or blood-brain-barrier crossing, or both.
