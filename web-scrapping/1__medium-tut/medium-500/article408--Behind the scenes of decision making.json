A battle that is essentially between different versions of you."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One network votes for pizza. Neurons in this network may cover different areas of the brain responsible for smell, sight, memory, and emotion. They send electrical and chemical signals that activate other neurons in the same network. Another network, similar to the pizza network, represents salad. Both the networks of neurons, ones representing pizza and salad, fire at each other trying to be the dominant one. The network that succeeds, will determine the choice we make."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For instance, when you see your friends ordering pizza, neurons that stand for pizza light up, say, in memory and emotional centres of the brain, and bring up the memory of the best pizza you had. If the memory is a happy one, perhaps you were with your family or friends and had a spectacular time, the neurons intensify their firing and try to inhibit the neurons representing salad. This will be easy if your memories of the last salad you had were not particularly pleasing. However, the neurons voting for salad, especially the ones in the front part of your brain responsible for will and self-determination, will try to inhibit the neurons representing pizza. But, the signals they send will not be enough to suppress the activity of the intensely firing pizza neurons. Yet another network in your brain says you can have the pizza if you promise to exercise the next day to make up for your bad choice. And so the decision is made. Within seconds."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When your friend asks you what you want to eat, the decision now whizzes to your motor cortex, where the response is prepared and you speak up to order pizza."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "What about life-changing decisions?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s still the same, but at magnitude much higher than what\u2019s required for simple everyday decisions. Instead of a battle, a cerebral war ensues and different neural networks fire equally fiercely. Each network is trying to triumph, but not succeeding quite as easily, because what\u2019s at stake for a decision-made-wrong is huge. No network is firing intensely enough to inhibit the other network, and you don\u2019t make a decision right away."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you are too stuck to decide, your subconscious will take the matter in its hands.
