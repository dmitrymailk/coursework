When I was16 years old I just failed to break the Irish national junior record in the 200m Butterfly at a national meet, by just over a second. My coach wouldn\u2019t accept it.

There were bills to pay and food to put on the table."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My \u2018Mam\u2019 did what she always did. She was incredibly resourceful when the odds were stacked against her. Unbeknownst to me, my very proud \u2018Mam\u2019 hit the streets while I was at school, asking (begging) for sponsorship."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A week before the Sheffield World Cup kicked off my \u2018Mam\u2019 had raised enough sponsorship to fund my trip."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I didn\u2019t appreciate it as much at the time, but writing this I\u2019m in awe of her determination, her resilience.

This is a long-standing challenge for researchers."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Dementia treatment addresses the symptoms, not the cause itself. Cause and effect\u2014 the cause we got, the effect was overlooked for years."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Also, treatment doesn\u2019t have much effect on how the disease progresses. That is to manage the condition and delay the onset through early diagnosis."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The global impact could be significant \u2014 reducing healthcare costs for millions worldwide."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Dementia is a gradual affliction. A degenerative brain disease with little or no symptoms initially. So early diagnosis is a challenge. Clinicians use a range of tools like memory tests, medical history, blood samples, and as a last resort, an MRI scan."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s estimated that about 20% of cases are misdiagnosed, yet, worryingly, dementia diagnosis has increased in recent years.

To put it into context, they\u2019re about a trillion times smaller compared to a standard magnet. The good news is that SQUIDs can measure these signals emitted."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In practice, a MEG machine has a few hundred SQUID sensors mounted on a head-piece. The number of sensors enhances spatial resolution, improving better source localization in brain signals when conducted in a shielded room that dampens interference."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This means that we can visualize the brain on a deeper level, exploring sequential events for every decision or movement we make."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "From my limited research, I now understand that MEG technology is gaining traction in dementia research."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Thus far, tiny signals can indicate lower activation and response delay in regions of the brain.

Damage associated with dementia."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This will further refine traits and symptoms to identify those at risk of developing dementia during their lifetime."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "MEG will also enable early disease management. This will improve the quality of life of individuals and families living with the disease."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "MEG has been around for a while, since the late 60s. In its infancy, sensitivity was low, but technology advancements have improved efficiency to capture patient mapping."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In fact, some practitioners are even using MEG to diagnose epilepsy. The aim is to locate the epileptic regions of the brain in order to understand it better to improve treatment or better, find a cure."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Final Thoughts"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Compared to other methods, MEG doesn\u2019t use radioactive dyes or magnetic fields (X-rays). It\u2019s non-invasive. It\u2019s safer, hence the reason why it\u2019s used to study fetal cognitive development with expecting mothers."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The prospect that advanced imaging technology might allow us to better understand brain networks is amazing. That said, the world only has a limited amount of MEG scanners, about one hundred. They\u2019re expensive too, \u201cabout $2 million\u201d each and most are used for research purposes."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Famous people"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Dementia knows no age, race, or profession.
