It was coined in 1970 by Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori, as he hypothesized that the human reaction to a robot with humanlike features would go from empathy to revulsion since robots could try \u2014 but ultimately fail \u2014 to realistically resemble humans. It\u2019s a phenomenon anyone who\u2019s played games or watched particularly dodgy (or aged) CGI in a movie or television show has felt. The uncanny valley is that strange feeling that sits in the back of your brain when you see something that almost looks real, but doesn\u2019t quite hit the mark. Perhaps the eyes don\u2019t move smoothly enough, or the mouth articulations don\u2019t quite sync up to the dialogue on screen. Maybe the emotions are too exaggerated, or not zoetic enough. Either way, your brain is telling you that what you\u2019re looking at isn\u2019t quite right, and it reacts accordingly."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1260/1*CrUGUXkAepcMQsOkzH3b_Q.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Mori conceived the term \u201cuncanny valley\u201d (despite the fact that this translation is slightly incorrect) because he believed there is a certain point where familiarity fails and we fall into a \u201cvalley\u201d of unease. Ayse Saygin, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, believes this is due to the brain\u2019s expectations. Saygin explains that when an image or robot appears particularly humanlike, it sets up certain expectations for the brain. When those expectations fail, such as when we notice a jerky movement, our brain instantly realizes what we\u2019re looking at is decidedly inhuman, thus causing the unease. Mori suggested a potential reason for the uncanny valley, but it should be noted that his hypothesis was created in 1970, and was devised entirely of his own expectations of responses rather than scientific studies. According to Mori, the unease we feel at seeing computer generated images or robots that don\u2019t quite appear real is because they remind us of corpses, and thusly activate a natural human fear of death. As such, Mori placed corpses and zombies at the bottom of his graph for human likeness \u2014 seen below \u2014 as our brains almost immediately feel unease when we interact with them."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*eZSDoCz3aT6LnOHq"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1146/0*b2aDtDfi_V7pF3d1.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Another study conducted by Thalia Wheatley, a psychologist at Dartmouth College, found that the uncanny valley is a multicultural phenomenon. Her study found that students at Dartmouth were able to tell when the face presented in front of them was morphed using computer generated imaging (CGI), and the same results were shown when the test was run in a remote tribe in Cambodia. The participants claimed that a face only seemed more a living human\u2019s than a doll\u2019s if it was 65% or more human. One of the most interesting caveats to this is that the tribe was only able to acknowledge the subtle differences in the faces that were more familiar to the culture. If faces were shown of people they may not have encountered before \u2014 such as individuals from Europe \u2014 it was more difficult for the tribe to discern which ones were alive and which ones were CGI. Wheatley\u2019s studies additionally displayed the significance eyes have in detecting the likelihood of a face being real. It would seem that the musculature in and around the eyes are imperative to real world emotional communication, as we look to the eyes to help us understand the intentions of the person we are communicating with. Eyes have been described as \u201cthe window to the soul,\u201d and for good reason. As a result, most artificial eyes are seen as lifeless, soulless, or hollow, as they can\u2019t replicate the exact emotions our eyes can, regardless of how well they\u2019re animated."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1344/1*3KcC5w-o2UnOi7WiKOp2lA.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The gaming industry has been trying for years to render something as close to real life as possible, with things like motion capture and advanced animation technology making games more realistic than ever thought possible. However, it\u2019s probable that time will make these games look much more unsettling than we perceive today. A perfect example would be the picture of Aerith above from Final Fantasy VII. The image on the left is of Aerith when Final Fantasy VII released in 1997. On the right is a still from the recently-released remake. Final Fantasy VII was received incredibly well when it was released in 1997, with review aggregate Gamespot saying, \u201cNever before have technology, playability, and narrative combined as well as in Final Fantasy VII\u2026 This is the most dazzling visual experience to date on any console. Film-quality computer-generated cinematics blend seamlessly with pre-rendered background artwork to create the strikingly realistic world of Final Fantasy VII, both beautiful in its grandeur and terrifying in its detail.\u201d Twenty years ago, the graphical output of a game like Final Fantasy VII was unparalleled and created an impressive and almost unfathomably realistic immersion. By today\u2019s standards \u2014 especially when put up against its own remake \u2014 characters from Final Fantasy VII can almost be likened to dolls, while the remake is nearly lifelike. 1997\u2019s Aerith falls nearly perfectly into the uncanny valley, so it would appear that familiarity isn\u2019t the only factor in understanding this phenomenon; time and experience are key factors too."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*-94G6u4raEn1UQNw5it9Zg.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "An important detail to note is that, despite what all the studies and explanations have shown, the uncanny valley isn\u2019t even proven to exist at all."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It would seem that the evidence examined can\u2019t really confirm or deny its existence, as the findings are typically inconsistent. Basically, the extent of feelings of unease, if any exist at all, vary wildly from person to person. To take a quote from the paper The Uncanny Valley, Does it Exist?, \u201cThe existence of an uncanny reaction does not validate the valley model.\u201d This is essentially stating that just because things resembling human beings tend to elicit a natural state of unease or repulsion does not indicate that the feeling itself can be quantified into one classification. This is paramount when discussing how the uncanny valley relates to our media and our entertainment. If there truly is no uncanny valley to best, and only an uncanny phenomenon to contend with, it may eventually be possible to trick our brains into thinking the games we\u2019re playing are truly real. The end result would be a much more integrated connection, both personally and emotionally, between the human race and the artificial and synthetic lifeforms we create."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1996/1*3lf9Y6mHxoxpSSFOw6gjlw.png"}], "topic": "neuroscience"}
