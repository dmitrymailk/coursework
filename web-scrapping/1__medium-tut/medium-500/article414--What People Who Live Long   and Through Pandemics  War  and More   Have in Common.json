Along with her husband, the photographer Carl Mydans, Shelley documented WWII in both Europe and the Pacific."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Midway through the war, the Mydans were captured in the Philippines. The Japanese held them in POW camps in Manilla and Shanghai. But despite spending two years as prisoners of war, both Mydans survived and went on to live long and productive lives. Shelley lived to 86, while Carl made it all the way to 97."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Many who survived the war were not so fortunate. A U.S. serviceman named Philip was also in the Pacific Theater during WWII. Even before the war, Philip was prone to anxiety and \u201ccatastrophizing\u201d \u2014 to always predicting the worst. After he returned home, these traits intensified. Philip drank heavily and separated from his wife. Although he saw that there were positive aspects of his wartime experience, he was also frustrated and resentful about his time overseas; he felt it had hurt his marriage and disrupted his life. As the years passed, his drinking escalated. He tended not to exercise, and he was occasionally depressed. He died at age 64 of a heart attack."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Philip\u2019s story is recounted in The Longevity Project, a book that summarizes a 20-year study based on interviews and health data collected from approximately 1,500 people \u2014 each followed from youth until death. \u201cOur study wasn\u2019t designed to look specifically at people who lived through hard times, but of course many did,\u201d says Leslie Martin, PhD, a professor of psychology at California\u2019s La Sierra University. \u201cWe found that many people who lived through hard times went on to live long lives \u2014 even though their lives were not stress-free, by any means.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Unlike Philip, for whom the war seemed to push life onto a difficult and self-destructive path, Martin says that the Mydans appeared to turn their WWII experience into a source of motivation. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see their stress as meaningless \u2014 it seemed to fuel them,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd this ability to think about the hard things we go through as ultimately beneficial \u2014 whether to ourselves or to people we care about or to society at large \u2014 seems to be important.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Eat right. Exercise. Avoid stress. These vague directives are often framed as the necessary ingredients in a long and healthy life. And there\u2019s some truth to each of them. But Martin and others who have studied longevity say these are oversimplifications that tend to prioritize action over attitude. While day-to-day habits and behaviors matter a great deal, a person\u2019s approach to life \u2014 including, and maybe especially, the way they react to hardship \u2014 is arguably the more important side of the longevity coin."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the midst of Covid-19 and the many challenges it presents, a close look at the lives and shared qualities of long-living people can be instructive \u2014 and inspirational. While there are few hard-and-fast rules when it comes to living a long life, there seem to be helpful guidelines."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWhat we\u2019re going through right now\u2026 for some people, this might be the first time they\u2019ve been really tested with something difficult,\u201d Martin says. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that the way we respond to a test like this and the mental perspective we take can make a difference.\u201d"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The power of personality"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Experts who study longevity often talk about \u201cpathways\u201d and \u201ctrajectories.\u201d They do so to make the point that short-lived events or endeavors \u2014 good or bad \u2014 matter much less than durable habits or beliefs. \u201cProblems arise when you veer off a healthy pathway and cannot steer yourself back to safety,\u201d says Howard Friedman, PhD, Martin\u2019s co-author on The Longevity Project and a distinguished professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For many, times of hardship \u2014 like say, a global pandemic keeping people in their homes for months \u2014 are the obstacles in the road that lead to this kind of veering. And, when confronted by difficult times, Friedman says that a lot of people start drinking, smoking, abandoning exercise, cutting ties with friends, or making other unhealthy choices. These decisions and their consequences often far outlive the trials that spawned them; a drinking habit escalates, or lost friends are never replaced."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Ironically, good times can also act as catalysts for unhealthy behaviors. A period of professional success or an unexpected windfall can, in some cases, unmoor people from the healthy habits and personal ideals they clung to before. But certain qualities seem to safeguard people from the pitfalls created by periods of both feast and famine. And experts say one consistently tops the list. \u201cIn terms of personality characteristics, the strongest predictor of a long life was being high on conscientiousness,\u201d says Martin."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cConscientiousness\u201d refers to someone who is organized, prudent, and persistent in their pursuits. \u201cConscientious people are planful and responsible, not impulsive,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen they take on a task, they don\u2019t give up easily.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This may come as a surprise to those who assumed carefree, take-it-easy types would be best insulated against life\u2019s many injuries and injustices. \u201cWe actually found the most cheerful and optimistic people lived shorter lives,\u201d Martin says. \u201cBeing worried or anxious all the time is a problem, but a little worrying \u2014 when you\u2019re thinking ahead and working through scenarios \u2014 can help you to be better prepared.\u201d Conscientious worriers tend to put their fretting to good use: They make choices or changes in response to their concerns. Their worrying is productive, not pointless."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There are more straightforward explanations for a conscientious person\u2019s longevity: These are folks who tend to wear their seatbelts, eschew heavy drinking or drugs, and avoid other sources of undue risk. They\u2019re not totally risk-averse, Martin clarifies, but they\u2019re thoughtful and judicious about the risks they\u2019re willing to take. Conscientious people also tend to adopt and stick with healthy habits, and their awareness and diligence tend to lead them into healthy relationships and jobs. All of these tendencies promote a long and healthy life."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There\u2019s some evidence that conscientiousness is at least partly dependent on brain chemistry. Hormones and neurochemicals such as serotonin seem to play a role in impulsivity and risk-taking. But Martin says personality \u201cis not set in stone,\u201d and that\u2019s particularly true for young people."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "How can someone become more conscientious? She says that adopting healthy routines and following a daily schedule is a good start. These are things that conscientious people do automatically, but that others can teach themselves to do with effort. \u201cJust going along and letting things happen when they happen isn\u2019t particularly good for our mental health, or for helping us get things done,\u201d she says. She also recommends spending time with people who are diligent and organized, and who have other admirable qualities. \u201cAssociating with people who demonstrate these behaviors can make habit-forming easier, as their tendencies influence us a bit,\u201d she explains."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Others agree that people really do have the capacity to change their minds and behaviors. \u201cIt is certainly possible to change your personality, and it happens pretty quickly,\u201d says Gary Small, MD, director of the University of California, Los Angeles Longevity Center and author of Snap, a book about the power people have to adopt new habits of mind."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He says that a core element of conscientiousness is tenacity \u2014 or sticking with a healthy change or ambition once you\u2019ve started it. The more people push themselves to follow through on their goals \u2014 even very small and easy to achieve ones \u2014 the more they can build up their tenacity muscles. He also says that the ability to be flexible is important: When the course of life disrupts plans or schedules \u2014 as it\u2019s surely doing for most people in the midst of Covid-19 \u2014 the ability to pivot into a new but still healthful and satisfying routine is essential."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cIt\u2019s not as though the very old have been sheltered from adversity,\u201d says Peter Martin, PhD, a professor at Iowa State University who has devoted much of his career to the study of healthy aging. \u201cAnyone who has lived to 100 has faced many difficult situations.\u201d He echoes many of the above sentiments and mentions a few other characteristics that the long-lived seem to share. \u201cThey\u2019re not uptight or neurotic,\u201d he says. While not blas\u00e9 about life\u2019s challenges, people who live a long time usually don\u2019t catastrophize \u2014 that is, they don\u2019t assume the worst, which is a habit that can lead a person to make choices that get them into trouble, such as prematurely abandoning a healthy routine or promising enterprise."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Martin says those who live a long time also tend not to engage in \u201cupward comparisons.\u201d This means they don\u2019t spend a lot of time comparing themselves or their present circumstances to more-fortunate others or happier times. Instead, they think about people who have it worse, or situations they endured that were even more difficult."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Another, underappreciated element of longevity is something Martin refers to as \u201cgeotranscendence,\u201d which, roughly, is a preference for a cosmic or spiritual worldview, rather than a materialistic or strictly rational one. He says many long-lived individuals seemed to lean toward the spiritual as they age. \u201cYou see a pronounced reliance on religious beliefs \u2014 on putting faith in a higher power\u2019s hands,\u201d he says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Adopting a more spiritual attitude may allow people to better work through the aspects of life that they find inscrutable or disconcerting. \u201cWhen you\u2019re able to hand things over to a higher being, that\u2019s a way of letting go,\u201d he says. At a certain point, letting go can reduce anger, frustration, and many other emotions that push people toward unhealthy thoughts or actions."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Other factors that matter"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Valter Longo, PhD, is director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California. Last year, Longo traveled around Italy to speak with centenarians \u2014 those who had lived to or beyond the age of 100 \u2014 in an effort to uncover patterns that might explain their enviable longevity."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "He says that two themes emerged. One was a theme of genetic good fortune. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018My sister made it to 94. My brother to 98.\u2019 So genes played a big part in it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe other story was the person who did not have any long-lived siblings or parents, but they were in a concentration camp during World War II.\u201d In other words, something about living through incredible hardship seemed to bestow longevity on certain survivors. Longo has a couple theories about what that \u201csomething\u201d could be."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "His first theory is based in nutrition science. Much of his work \u2014 in mice and in people \u2014 has found that periods of fasting or caloric restriction can help clear away dead or dysfunctional cells in ways that may discourage the development of disease and also promote longevity. \u201cIf we give mice low levels of protein or calories for a while, then we feed them normally, they live longer than the mice we fed normally the whole time,\u201d he says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While malnourishment is an extreme and inhumane example of forced deprivation, Longo points out that many places in the world where people tend to live into very old age are also places where people eat a vegetable-centric and meat-restricted diet. Along with clearing away dead or diseased cells, \u201ceating this way could cause epigenetic changes that affect lifespan,\u201d he says, referring to diet-induced alterations in the way some genes are expressed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "His second theory is more of an observation. \u201cOne thing all these centenarians had in common is that they all wanted to live \u2014 they wanted to go on,\u201d he says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m ready to die\u2019 or, \u2018I don\u2019t care anymore.\u2019 They were still interested in life and paying attention to everything.\u201d While most people are passionate and engaged when they\u2019re young, a great many lose these attributes as life wears on. And this loss seems to matter."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "La Sierra\u2019s Martin says she\u2019s also noticed this characteristic. \u201cThe outlook on life that typified many of the long-living individuals was one of, \u2018I will not give up. I think that what I\u2019m doing is important.\u2019\u201d These are not people who regard life as fruitless or arbitrary. \u201cThese are people who tend to find meaning in what they do,\u201d she says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While an effort to inject meaning into life could be viewed as an attitude, it\u2019s also a product of a person\u2019s pursuits. Returning to the story of Philip, the heavy drinking WWII vet who died young of a heart attack, Martin\u2019s book says that he found his job merely \u201ctolerable,\u201d and that he was looking forward to retirement \u2014 though he didn\u2019t know how he would fill his time or whether he would enjoy himself. Even in his early sixties, he did not seem like a person who was involved in activities that gave his life passion or purpose. Unlike Philip, people who tend to live a long time are often the types who actively pursue goals that provide them a strong sense of accomplishment, Martin says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "UC-Riverside\u2019s Friedman agrees. He says that \u201cincreasing one\u2019s maturity\u201d over the years is essential to maintaining good health. \u201cThis means more involvement with meaningful work \u2014 work with a purpose \u2014 and doing good things for family, friends, and society,\u201d he says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Close relationships are important. But the quantity of friends a person has mattered less than the depth of those friendships. \u201cIf you are an introvert with a few close relationships, then that is as good as being an extrovert with many more ties; it is the quality and consistency of the ties that matter,\u201d he says."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Here again, lived hardship may play an important role. While some regard tough times as a sign that life is unfair or unpleasant, others emerge from a struggle with a greater sense of gratitude and a newfound resolve to commit their time and efforts to things that matter \u2014 to close friendships, to family bonds, or to hobbies, or work for which they feel passionate."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As Covid-19 has made plain to all, no life is without its challenges. While everyone is entitled to a period of adjustment during difficult times, those who endure will not let those difficulties knock their lives or attitudes off course for good. \u201cIf you dwell on the negative, you\u2019re not going to do well,\u201d UCLA\u2019s Small says. \u201cBut if you can see a challenge as something to rise to, it can be very gratifying to get to the other side.\u201d"}], "topic": "neuroscience"}
