Do you cry over the pieces of a broken heart, or do you make beautiful art out of them?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Are you the oak that fights the wind and breaks? Or the willow that bends and survives?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I don\u2019t know if I would describe myself as a resilient person, but I sure strive to be. The outcome of a situation is our reaction to it, not the situation itself. This is why I try to hold myself accountable for higher standards than expected from me. I don\u2019t want to have to excuse or pity myself."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And so, I went digging into brain info, like I always do when I have a question. What does it mean to be resilient, and how can you increase your resilience?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Of course, neuroscience holds the answer: Resilience is structural. Resilience is functional. Resilience has specific neurobiological underpinnings. Most importantly, a resilient brain can be trained."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s keep an open definition of resilience: the ability to recover quickly from difficulties, the adaptation to adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or stress."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The word resilience comes from the Latin resiliens, which means \u201cto rebound, recoil.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But resilience is very heterogeneous. It\u2019s not about being tougher, being stronger, being better. At its most basic core, resilience is an adaptive neurobiological and neurochemical response."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Being resilient doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t face hard times, on the contrary. To be resilient, one should have learned what it means to be in a stressful and challenging situation. One should have tasted pain and hardship and outgrown it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The brain establishes a two-way communication as part of a feedback loop between itself, the immune system, and cardiovascular systems, giving rise to the well-known \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d mechanism in response to acute stress."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But this is only the first step of the process.

Your brain is flexible and can be trained to develop resilience."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s not a trait or a gene that you either have or don\u2019t have. It\u2019s a whole set of behaviors, adaptations, thoughts, and actions.

The way we are brought up, the situations that we face, the support systems, and our earliest coping mechanisms contribute significantly to our capacity, or lack of it, to face trying times later in life."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "1.

This moderate exposure seems to be related to enhanced learning and mastery of self-control."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While moderate and intermittent exposure to stress promotes resilience, researchers discovered that chronic subjection to extreme situations is associated with increased mood swings, anxiety, depression, and addiction\u00b2. Common types of childhood trauma include abuse and neglect, violence, life-threatening accidents, extreme medical procedures, loss or separation, wars and disasters, extreme poverty."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2200/0*HibSgSg1w2SboCIP.png"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "2.

Higher plasticity in active resilience"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Resilience is an active progression of events, not a passive process.

For this system to function correctly, it requires synaptic plasticity; i.e., the formation and destruction of new synapses and connections based on experience, situations, and responses to the situations\u2077."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There is a variety of neurochemical systems involved in the fear circuitry, including BDNF, GABAergic signaling, and NMDA/AMPA.
