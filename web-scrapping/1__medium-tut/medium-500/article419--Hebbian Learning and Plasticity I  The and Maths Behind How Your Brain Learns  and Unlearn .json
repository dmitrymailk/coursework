I think that the attempt to answer this question helps us reflect on what we are, and more importantly, how special we are. Every day, there are small children out there learning how to read their first book, or teenagers learning how to skateboard. The process of learning comes very naturally for us but do you \u2018really\u2019 know what is really going on in your brain during the learning process? By the end of this article, I hope you will understand what it means to learn; from a theoretical point of view down to the computational neuroscience point of view where the process of learning is explained mathematically in terms of neural activities in your brain. Hebbian learning rule is also implemented in many machine learning algorithm today, thus, this article will serve as the building block for my next series in Spiking Neural Network and is also a part of my Hebbian Learning and Plasticity series"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Before reading this, you should be familiar with how neurons communicate.

At the core, learning could be defined as a process that results in a change in knowledge or behaviour as a result of experience. Many learning activities make use of a reward system of the brain. You know we should not play with fire because you got burnt as a little kid. You know you will be very happy if someone gives you a box of chocolate (maybe not you but definitely me). You know how to learn the Norwegian language based on your knowledge in Swedish. All of this \u201cpast experience\u201d is the result of your brain taking in information and store it into the memory where it could be, hopefully, use to apply to new knowledge, which then leads to an update of your current state of knowledge. Thus, learning and memory are strongly correlated, particularly declarative memory, which contains the memory of facts (e.g. name of the prime minister) and events (e.g. your hiking trip last summer)."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*ENRHduANOdRURqJQ"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Synaptic Plasticity and Long term Potentiation"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Recall, in short, that when an action potential of neuron A arrives at the synapse it either causes an excitatory or inhibitory behavior of receiving neuron B, where this change can be measured as an Excitatory or Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP or IPSP).

Just like plastic, your brain also goes through a series of changes throughout life, forming new connections when it needs to. According to Gerstner (2011), different forms of learning is actually the result of the dynamical changes in the strength of synapses. This goes back to the quote I wrote at the beginning of the article \u2014 Neurons that fire together wire together, which is basically the rough summarisation of the Hebbian Theory. How plasticity is differentiated is based on \u201chow long\u201d the stimulus from the pre-synaptic neurons A can increase the EPSP, or simply put, how good at neuron A at exciting neuron B."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/5380/1*dAlwXfVrtYspdCzmC8iADw.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Simply, the synaptic plasticity can be divided into:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "(1) Short-term Plasticity (STP): where the increase only lasts for one or few seconds"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "(2) Long-term Plasticity (LTP): in which the increase can last for seconds or months.

Those neurons might be working on smells, shape, texture, taste, colour, or the environment associated with that banana. Now, to learn about this banana and to be able to store it in the memory, neurons 4,5,6, and 9, have to be switched on together, and according to Hebbian learning, this co-activation will lead to a strengthening of their connections.

Those that were previously associated with this \u201cbanana\u201d concept (4,6, and 9) will also become activated and mutually fire in a cascade manner due to the strengthened past connection where the remaining irrelevant neighbor neurons remain inactive, or not as active, due to a weaker connection.
