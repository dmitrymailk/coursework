Negative words spark the fight-or-flight response as the brain senses a discrepancy between how we\u2019re feeling and how we think we should be feeling. The brain sends us feelings of pain or discomfort to motivate us to find a solution and close this gap."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Placing our attention on the positive shifts results in noteworthy positive shifts in brain function. According to the research of Dr. Andrew Newberg and Mark Robert Waldman, when we hold optimistic or uplifting words in our mind, we stimulate parts of our brain that affect our propensity to take action. The more we are exposed to positive content, the more we start to view ourselves and others differently."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Our thalamus plays a role in how we perceive reality and in the chemical sensations that are released in the body \u2014 which we call \u201cfeelings.\u201d The thalamus responds to the messages we receive from the external environment and relays messages to the rest of the brain."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "According to Newberg and Waldman, recent studies show that over time, concentrating on positive thoughts can shrink the size of the brain\u2019s fear-center, the amygdala. It can also make us smarter by increasing the thickness of the neocortex which is associated with our higher-order thinking."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Reading uplifting content helps us shift our focus to what is right instead of what is wrong. It helps us see the possibilities rather than keeping us stuck in our negative or worrisome thought patterns."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The more we expose ourselves to positive words, the more the brain registers the importance we place on feeling good. Our neural networks of \u201coptimism\u201d are strengthened. As we perceive the billions of possibilities out there in the world, the brain then slowly becomes trained to bring more of the positive to our consciousness."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The more we focus on the good, the better we feel. The better we feel, the more likely we are to express positive words to others, fueling the momentum of positivity. The feedback loop between perceptions, thoughts, and feelings is complete."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "YOUR CELLS ON POSITIVE WORDS"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Words carry a vibration that affects matter at the molecular level."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Dr. Masaru Emoto, known for his research on the effect of consciousness on the molecular structure of water, demonstrated how words shape water molecules. His experiments showed how uplifting words and intentions (such as Thank You, Love, Compassion, Truth, Peace, Love & Gratitude, Humility) resulted in the water molecules shaping themselves as beautiful crystal structures while unkind words created distorted, non-symmetrical crystal structures."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1558/1*qgcdJvZHsMZIhWdqSfvfew.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Between 50\u201360% of our bodies are made up of water. If words and intentions can affect the molecular structure of water to this degree, think of how much power they have to contribute to our own well-being. The coherent structure of such molecules may be a much more efficient way for nature to optimize the flow of nutrients through our system and to focus on maintenance and healing than asymmetrical structure resulting from negative vibrations."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "LET\u2019S KEEP USING THE POWER OF WORDS FOR GOOD!Word by word, we can heal ourselves and others.
