Thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves branch off into hundreds of peripheral nerves allowing you to pick up objects and feel their roughness, their smoothness."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For all of this, reality is like the light filtering in through a small, warped and darkened window. You are limited by form and function; deaf to the scurrying of tiny insects, blind to ultraviolet light, indifferent to the paths of magnetic fields*, and so you do not inhabit the reality of the bat, the bluebottle butterfly, or the migratory eel."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, you are far from a passive recipient of sensory information, rather you move through the world, and interact with\u00a0it.
