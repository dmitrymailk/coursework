What all of these films shared was a sense of cultural importance particularly within the British broadsheet media, tackling historical subjects with a formality and uprightness that Cumberbatch somewhat came to represent.

This was raised as an issue by gay journalists like Tim Teeman of The Daily Beast and attracted a defensive response from the director, who said \u201cI\u2019m not shying away from it. His whole relationship, how he falls in love and the importance of him being a gay man, was all about secrecy.\u201d This minor media backlash, handled well by the filmmaker, was not fatal for the film\u2019s Oscar campaign, which leaned more heavily on the specific tragedy of Alan Turing than a more general LGBT theme.

Subtlety is key here, however, and subconscious implication is almost unavoidable in communicating through PR.
