We have to be the boldest versions of ourselves to send out surveys, conduct interviews, and give presentations to end up with the best business idea possible. These conversation strategies are useful for the whole entrepreneurship process \u2014 from our initial idea to 2 years in."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But feedback in these early stages informs all kinds of crucial decisions, and some of the trickiest customer interactions are getting people interested in our product or service in the first place."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Steps to Getting Feedback"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "First, we want to pull out the value proposition and review how we expect to provide value to customers. This will help us come up with questions and explain our minimum viable product. The goal of this stage in the process is putting our MVP through validation, or initial tests before launching."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Next, we have to decide what exactly we want feedback on because we don\u2019t want to waste everyone\u2019s precious time by asking unfocused questions. Is it a physical product that people need to get their hands on? Is it a website that people need to click through? Is it software that we need to demo?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And now we have to actually get people to give us feedback! This early stage is where we have to really embody that \u201chustle\u201d we keep talking about. Steve Blank, famed entrepreneur and author of The Startup Owner\u2019s Manual, says, \u201cGet out of the building.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean run-up to the first person we see on the street and bombard them with questions\u2026 usually we like to use a more tailored approach! One easy place to start is with our networks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Friends and family are a good place to make sure your questions make sense and will get you the type of feedback you\u2019re looking for. But we need to go beyond them because we want unbiased opinions about our ideas. You probably know more people than you think, like work colleagues, friends of friends, or LinkedIn connections! Talking to them will give you a chance to practice before talking to complete strangers."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Ways to get Feedback"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Surveys"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1528/0*SQTBOBdLPSXmpAFX.jpg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Surveys are flexible ways to get lots of responses on whatever key metrics we\u2019re interested in. Some people basically have degrees in designing effective and informative surveys."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But there are 3 key sections we want to focus on:"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "1. Target Market"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Open with a few demographic and behavioral questions to get a sense of who the person is and what their life is like. This helps contextualize their answers and informs our marketing decisions."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "2. Demand"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We\u2019ve checked out the competition, but what do other people have to say? Do they already use a competing product? Are we battling fierce brand loyalty?"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "3. Willingness to pay"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We think our idea is worth a million bucks, but how much do other people think it\u2019s worth? After all, they\u2019re (hopefully) doing the buying."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Getting Surveys Filled"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s really easy to create and deploy surveys. If you\u2019re going digital, you can use templates from services like Survey Monkey, Type Form, and Survey Hero, or make one from scratch."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You can ask your network to take your survey by sending emails directly to your friends and colleagues. Branch out even more by asking them to pass your survey on to 5 people in their network \u2014 but make it as easy as possible! In that initial message, include language that they can easily copy and paste."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the age of social media, consider posting a link to your survey on Twitter, Facebook, or even Instagram. You can tag people to try gaining some traction \u2014 that personal touch can help persuade people to fill it out. And we do still live in a physical world, so you can conduct surveys IRL too!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Phones still make calls. Shocking, I know. So you can ask people questions while you take notes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s also not too cliche to pick a busy street corner and ask passersby a few questions, especially if they\u2019re within your target market. If you\u2019re nervous, try bringing some exuberant friends with you who can help break the ice. You could even ask a non-competitive business owner with a similar target market if they would let you survey their customers either in-store or by email. You can sweeten the deal by offering to include a few questions that make sense for their business."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Focus Groups and Interviews"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/0*5IYV0OM2w1DEDNSH.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If we want more depth than a survey can offer, focus groups and interviews are a good strategy. The key difference is that we can watch people use our product and ask follow-up questions to really understand their experience."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Some schools of thought recommend asking \u201cwhy?\u201d five times when solving a problem, to get to the heart of an issue. Although, for the record, you should mix it up with actual full questions, not just \u201cwhy?\u201d like a 3-year-old. Sometimes you may want to approach someone specific that you only sort of know or you haven\u2019t met before. Now, we\u2019re not encouraging stalking \u2014 use common sense, never make anyone feel unsafe, and be respectful of their time."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But say you\u2019re looking to sell a new alumni directory app to universities and scholarship programs. And maybe you\u2019re having trouble getting in contact with the alumni coordinator by phone or email. So you can try showing up to their office during business hours with a kind smile and a reasonable ask. Your basic goal is to get in the door, talk with an important potential user, describe your project snappily, and try to build a relationship. That way, maybe you can conduct a test, have a deeper conversation later, or even land them as a customer. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work, but taking these kinds of risks can be part of the \u201chustle\u201d!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Focus groups and interviews take more time and don\u2019t have the same reach as a survey.

The goal is to understand where we could make big improvements to the user experience, before officially launching."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Finding Groups"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Notice for all of these strategies, we need large groups of people willing to listen to our ideas. If you\u2019re having trouble finding them, universities and colleges, entrepreneurial advocate groups, networking groups, and Startup Weekends can help! Connections at each of these places can fundamentally change your progress, support, and feedback. Once we have a pile of information about our MVP, our work is only half done."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Filter Valuable Feedback"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Next, we have to sift through it all and sort the valuable feedback from people being grumps. Ideally, we want to use the power of math to help. Surveys especially give great data for statistical analysis, but we can use any method to get helpful quantitative and qualitative feedback."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Quantitative feedback involves numbers \u2014 things like rating our product or service on a 5-point scale (1 being the worst, 5 being the best) or asking how much someone would be willing to pay for it. Calculating the average response to these questions is often a good start."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Qualitative feedback is basically everything else \u2014 people\u2019s meandering thoughts about what they liked or didn\u2019t like. We can analyze the results by grouping answers into several categories like \u201cfun,\u201d \u201ccomplicated,\u201d or \u201cugly shade of green\u201d and noticing how often those categories show up."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In general, we want to collect information from a meaningful chunk of our customer base \u2014 a statistically viable sample. We should try to have at least 100 responses, but more responses lead to more useful results. Ultimately, we want to use every drop of information we\u2019ve collected to recognize all the opportunities to improve our MVP. But we have to take some feedback with a grain of salt. We\u2019re really looking for trends in the data."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After we\u2019ve sifted through to find the golden nuggets of feedback, we need to actually modify our MVP to increase the value we\u2019re providing to our customers. We could make minor design tweaks, or completely scrap features to focus on one aspect that people love \u2014Pivot! We want to make sure our future customers get what they\u2019re paying for."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The bottom line is: are people going to buy whatever you\u2019re selling? We hope the answer is yes, but validating our idea by testing and gathering feedback will help us make sure before we go all-in."}], "topic": "ux"}
