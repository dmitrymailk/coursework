Therefore, the term \u201cwriter\u201d always breaks down into a more exact description."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There are, however, many of those descriptions, and we usually have to look hard at any one person\u2019s profile in order to come up with it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Blogger, author, journalist, creator, reporter, essayist, freelancer, marketer, artist, copywriter, the list goes on and on.

How na\u00efve.

That\u2019s a matter of technical ability."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When it comes to making money, there are four archetypes of writers:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A freelancer relies on contractual work. They might work multiple part-time projects or join a company full-time as a journalist, staff writer, or copywriter. They rarely pick what they write about, and they enjoy the benefits of a regular job \u2014 but they also have to be their own marketing department."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "An author writes books, books, and more books still. Everything is in service of the next book, whether it\u2019s self-published or comes with a deal from Penguin Random House, whether it\u2019s fiction or non-fiction, whether it pays the bills yet or it doesn\u2019t. With blood, sweat, and tears, you can get there."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The marketer treats writing like one of many skills in her arsenal. She uses it to attract people, and she uses it to sell things. She may use it inside of freelance contracts or in her self-chosen projects. A marketer could be an affiliate for coconut water, run a small ecommerce coffee store, and work part-time for an agency all at once."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "An artist writes for the same reason Da Vinci swang his brush: to capture the essence of life. Whatever his creations, if only 1,000 true fans would become his loyal patrons, he\u2019d be set. It may be a long road, but it\u2019s a road that leads to creative freedom."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Each of these archetypes has advantages and disadvantages. You can combine them, switch from one to the other, and new ones will emerge in the future. Overall, however, they represent four broad categories of how you can earn from your writing."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "They all oscillate between shipping art to an audience, being an entrepreneur, and working a traditional job \u2014 and yet none of them are clearly marked as one or the other."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Everyone is a writer \u2014 and yet, no such thing as a \u201cwriter\u201d exists."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019d love to meet 2012-Nik in a flashback. There are two things I would do:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That guy had no idea what it took to be a professional writer \u2014 but he had the guts to imagine a form of it that didn\u2019t even exist. It\u2019s been a long time since then. A lot of things have changed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Some authors make $250,000+ per year just off self-published books. A freelancer can make six figures with just three clients. Patreon has paid out over $1 billion to creators since 2013. And some affiliate websites generate up to $100,000 in a single month."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "None of these are easy to achieve. All of these paths take years, maybe a decade. The point is they exist. There now is light where, a few short years ago, there was nothing."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A professional writer gets paid to keep writing. Period. If you don\u2019t, writing is a hobby."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There are a million reasons to write, and not everyone needs to go pro.
