You come across a collection of classics by Charles Dickens you always wanted to buy. But then you remember that you have already bought a lot of books for this current month, so it would be better to buy the Charles Dickens books next month. So you just add it to your cart and leave the site. And then when you go on Instagram and are scrolling through it in your leisure, an ad about that very Charles Dickens collection pops up in your feed. Your interest in the product (books) is taken as a lead and later shown to you as a reminder to convert it into a sale.
