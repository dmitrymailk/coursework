What Are Evergreen, Automated, On-Demand Webinars?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The term \u201cwebinar\u201d comes from the words \u201cweb seminar\u201d. Webinar marketing, in and of itself is a powerful selling tool for marketers of all kinds of products online. Webinars have the feel of a 45\u201360 minutes classroom \u2014 a video tutorial \u2014 where the marketer lays out a structured or semi-structured presentation of his topic and his product. He also invites questions that he can answer from participants."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "By the end of the webinar there is also a good discount offer on the product the marketer is selling \u2014 to sweeten the deal for those who\u2019ve invested time attending and listening to the webinar. Why webinars sell products so well is because people like the experience of an event that helps them over the edge from hesitation to confident buying."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We know what webinars are. But then what are \u201cevergreen webinars\u201d?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Evergreen webinars are webinars that you can record once, and replay again and again"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Evergreen webinars are also known as automated or on-demand webinars. How do they work?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To the solopreneur knowledge marketer, evergreen webinars offer a huge advantage. You can record webinars once, and can replay them again and again thereafter. They look and feel like live webinars. You have a speaker teaching something \u2014 or a marketer selling something. But you also have a simulated side-panel to the main teaching screen. It acts as if live discussions are taking place among attendees. The speaker can even answer some of these questions from these \u201cattendees\u201d. People would then feel even more like they are attending a live webinar."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You can also schedule certain times when the webinar will take place"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It will give registrants a further feeling of waiting to attend a live event. Making customers wait a bit before getting something they want \u2014 some crucial information or an attractive price-offer \u2014 is a well-known marketing tactic. Delays make the FOMO factor come into subliminal play. What is FOMO? Its\u2019s the \u201cFear Of Missing Out\u201d."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There\u2019s a fine difference between evergreen, automated and on-demand webinars"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It depends on the degree to which you want to be transparent. It depends on whether you\u2019d like to create a feeling that people are being asked to attend a live event. Or you can choose to be transparent. Tell people that it is a recording of an earlier-completed or pre-recorded webinar."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You could also make evergreen webinars \u201con-demand\u201d. That means people can register at any time and see it at a time convenient to them \u2014 even immediately. They don\u2019t need to wait for scheduled replays."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "b. Why Show People A Pre-Recorded Webinar When You Can Show A Video Instead?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The answer lies in the numbers. People who are watching a video stay for only 10% of the video on average. They then leave."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "People in a live webinar environment, stay for as long as 90% of the duration of the webinar."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Why is that? That\u2019s because most webinars have some big offer to make towards the end, which could be \u201cunpassable\u201d. People like waiting and watching out for that."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "No one likes to abandon any program midway that they know will have some thing of value right at the end."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Videos allow fast forwarding to the end. However during live webinars events, or even \u201con-demand webinars\u201d you cannot fast-forward the video to see the end. Everything in an evergreen webinar is similar in feel and activity to a live webinar event \u2026 except that it\u2019s not really \u201clive\u201d. It\u2019s simulated \u201clive\u201d."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Always focus on providing highest quality content within your evergreen webinar."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Remember one thing. Since you eliminate the real-time interactivity from your webinar by making it pre-recorded, you have to do something to make it up to your webinar watchers. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to provide really valuable and unique content, before you think of the selling pitch at the end of the webinar for your products."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "c. Why Do Customers And Marketers Love Webinars, Especially Evergreen Ones?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A great quote that defines why you should use evergreen webinars is this one \u2026 from Hayley Friedman:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWhen it comes to converting customers, there are few things more powerful than a webinar \u2026 and few things more passive than an evergreen webinar.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Research says that the average webinar viewer tunes in for over 22 minutes"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That\u2019s a lot of time spent on listening to marketing spiel. Why do customers seem to love webinars? It could be because webinars give them a break from whatever they are \u201cdoing\u201d. They get time off \u201cdoing\u201d to relax without guilt, and get some \u201clearning\u201d."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Some marketers say that customers may not like the idea of a pre-recorded webinar. They say customers prefer the interactivity possible with a live webinar. Attendees can ask questions and get doubts cleared \u2014 and that seems like a huge plus-point."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But on the flip side, live events may have inconvenient timings for some global time-zones. And the scheduled event timings may not suit people\u2019s work/life balance."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Customers who like evergreen offer these alternate explanations"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "They say they like registering and watching right away. Pre-recorded or on-demand webinars let them do this. There\u2019s no waiting for the scheduled times, like live webinars."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "They can also stop midway or watch in convenient parts. If they have questions unanswered in the webinar, they can always email the marketer. The questions can be even more detailed than ones you can ask during a webinar."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For marketers, webinars (especially evergreen ones) are a no-brainer"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Webinars give them a chance to give customers a \u201cone-to-one\u201d feel at scale. They are the alternative to one-off sales calls, or face-to-face meetings. You can market to tens of thousands of your customers at once, with all them feeling like they are being addressed exclusively on their personal pain-points."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Statistics reveal that people who watch webinars are 64% more likely to buy. But even that sounds like a small figure. Some marketers say they\u2019ve touched close to 300% conversion increase with webinars."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now add to all this the fact that evergreen webinars can help you achieve all this and more while you\u2019re asleep. Is there a better way to make passive income?"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "2. Sharpen Your Strategy By Knowing When It\u2019s Best To Use Evergreen Webinars"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Instead of merely valuing evergreen webinars for their convenience, see if they can form a distinct part of your marketing strategy.

When Should You Prefer Evergreen Webinars Over Live Ones?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The main difference between evergreen and live webinars is that evergreen webinars are automated and recorded once.

Only the presentation method changes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Evergreen webinars are better if you would like these advantages"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "b. How Can You Make Sure Your Webinars Stay Evergreen?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s face it. No piece of content is going to stay evergreen because things in the online world do change. What\u2019s relevant in your niche today might not be so one year later."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Also, the demands of your target audiences may change. People evolve all the time. Or your product may change and you may need to include new audiences."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Despite all this churn, it still makes sense to try and reduce your content workload as much as possible."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Create content that can stay evergreen for as long as possible"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While doing this, you have to exert your creativity. Your webinar still has to contain some excitement value for the audience. It cannot afford to become a drab event. This is where your thinking cap has to work. You have to come up with webinar content ideas with both longevity and some currency."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A few things you should avoid, though, are these:"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "c. Four Marketing Situations Best Suited To Automated, Evergreen Webinars"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Marketing products or services that need more consumer education"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Some products need a lot of consumer education before people buy them. For example, let\u2019s take a skin care cream, with a new breakthrough ingredient. It needs to help people learn about this new ingredient and see scientific proof of its results. It needs to explain and show its difference. Consumer education is likely to be a long, slow process before it gains traction."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When something is new in the market, you must build trust with your audience. To build trust, you have to proliferate your knowledge to keep reinforcing your uniqueness."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For your evergreen webinar, you can screen-share a PowerPoint presentation. You can choose to talk into the camera for a face-to-face feeling. You can be a lone tutor or collaborate with an expert or an influencer."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Most important: see that your webinar content leads to trial or sales of your product or service."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "People who watch understand that a webinar is a \u201csales pitch\u201d.

Make sure the education and the offer are worth their while."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Using tutorials to get easier buy-in for complex or specialist products"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you have to sell complex or specialist products, it may requires a step-by-step tutorial. You may need to explain certain product features or usage practices. Teaching once may not be enough. You may need to re-teach the practices to different batches of users,"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We often see tutorial-based evergreen webinars used by SaaS companies. Engineering businesses use webinars a lot to train customers in product usage. Construction companies train building residents on fire safety drills via webinars"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Tutorial webinars could be good for solopreneur businesses too \u2026 if you have complex ideas to sell. Ad agencies can use webinars to sell concepts. They can also train clients on performance metrics to measure success."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Even if you are a lone freelancer, your clients may like to know what processes you use. How do you sequentialize the handling of their assignments? How should they set expectations? What will be your deliverables? At which stages should they pay you?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Information like this needs repetitive exposure to many different client-prospects. The information content is not likely to be fast-changing either. Evergreen webinars work beautifully for situations like these."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Clear explanations, ahead of projects, can avoid relationship breakdown later. So think of tutorial evergreen webinars as more than teaching opportunities.

They are a combination of storytelling \u2014 mixed in with strategy, tactics and results."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Case studies feel like sneak peek at some \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d action that took place. Nobody can resist knowing the inner secrets and strategies that others used. Not only that, but case studies also show the final results.

You may have more than you think."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you\u2019re a freelance solopreneur, think about the past success of your client work.

Here are two examples of what bloggers did with evergreen webinars to create case studies:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Webinars like this with practical everyday case studies get hordes of new registrants all the time. Why should you be surprised? People love these simple, but personal and compelling, stories."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One caveat: If your case study involves a client, make sure you get their written permission to air it. They may not want their competitors attending your evergreen webinar. If there\u2019s any resistance, don\u2019t show names of businesses or brands.

Don\u2019t drop obvious clues."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "How you handled a situation is more important than who you handled it for.
