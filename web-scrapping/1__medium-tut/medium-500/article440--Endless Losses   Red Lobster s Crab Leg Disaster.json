We have a widespread obesity problem, and all-you-can-eat buffets do us no small favors."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And so I was surprised to learn of the strategy that Red Lobster took on \u2014 which would ultimately cost the CEO her job."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Red Lobster is a chain seafood restaurant that offers a limited all-you-can-eat buffet.

She took a high-risk, high-reward bet that could have paid off.
