I wanted all of my posts to be the most optimized possible, I was tracking every single source of insights and analytics I could, and I was making sure I was learning from my mistakes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Instagram became a major source of anxiety for me. The hardest to handle, for me, was the amount of information available online. You could read something and the radical opposite on the same blog. I spent most of my time fact-checking what I was learning and testing it to see if it was true or not."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One principle helped me get out of this Instagram obsession."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This one principle is very simple and very obvious, but trust me on this, it\u2019s very powerful, and it can be life-changing for you."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This principle is: pay attention to how you use Instagram and create content you would engage with."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I told you it was simple.

Let me explain why this principle might be better for you than most of the information you read about Instagram in the past few weeks."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "There\u2019s No Chronological Feed on Instagram"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So why bother posting at the most optimal time? Do you scroll Instagram at \u201cthe optimal time\u201d? No, when you\u2019re bored, you open the app and check out the posts that Instagram decided to show you."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It doesn\u2019t matter at what time you post. As a user, if you\u2019ve engaged a lot with an account, you\u2019ll see it on top of your feed when you open the app."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s the same thing with your content. You don\u2019t have to get nerdy with your analytics, just post during the day. Posting at 6:30 pm instead of 6:10 pm won\u2019t make any difference. Once your content is published, it will hopefully get some engagement, and from there, it will still be seen by your audience for the next 18 hours or so."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So stay away from this \u201cPost at the specific time\u201d kind of rule."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "You Follow Accounts That Bring Value to You"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Open Instagram, take a step back and try to analyze why you follow the accounts you follow.

I call this exercise the Mindful Scrolling."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Of course, there are no universal conclusions for this exercise. For example, I skip posts from brands and people that only show-off or brag about themselves or their products, and I tend to spend more time and engage with authentic life updates, and content that is trying to teach me something."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "From here, every time I post, I try to make sure that I\u2019m not showing off, that I\u2019m not bragging.

Do you even notice them anymore?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The optimal number of hashtags is the weirdest rule I keep reading about. Users don\u2019t care about how many hashtags you use. I don\u2019t think you can appear spammy by using all 30 of them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Next time you post, make sure you separate hashtags from the rest of your caption to make it more elegant, but then, use as many hashtags as you want. Use only relevant ones and don\u2019t use these very general hashtags. If you stick to relevant hashtags, you will probably use between 10 and 20, and that\u2019s fine. You can even only use one, or 30. It doesn\u2019t matter."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Users don\u2019t care about how you decide to tag your post."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "You Read Captions, so Write One"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Do you stop on posts that only have a single emoji as a caption?

That\u2019s where all the value you can bring to your audience is."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Consider Instagram as a micro-blogging platform.

At least I do, it\u2019s gratifying of the time and effort I put into my Instagram strategy. I\u2019m also curious to learn more about these people that are interested in what I do, so I regularly check out their profiles and sometimes follow them if I like what I see."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019m sure you do all that too."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Find people within your niche or topics you\u2019re interested in, and start engaging more with these people.
