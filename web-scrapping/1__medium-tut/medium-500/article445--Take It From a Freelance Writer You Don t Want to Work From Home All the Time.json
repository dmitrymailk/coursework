Working from home has its benefits\u2014not the least of which is choosing not to put on pants if that\u2019s your thing.

You\u2019ve already dealt with the challenges of setting up a home office and child care. And now you get to keep up your new routine, as the weather turns nice? Amazing! And it is amazing.

And you\u2019ll come up with plenty of fairly realistic schemes: You can rent a house in the country for a couple of months! You can drink your coffee on your front porch! You can take a 15-minute power nap between projects! You can keep on baking that sourdough bread in between calls! You can have a cheeky glass of wine at 5 pm (or 4 pm, who\u2019s checking)! Your home is your oyster!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But freedom from the office is kind of like the best dessert you can imagine: Incredible in the right quantities, sickening if you have too much.

One hint: It\u2019s not you. It\u2019s the company that sets it. Guess who suddenly gets to save a shit ton on their commercial real estate rent? Guess who doesn\u2019t have to provide snacks and coffee? Guess who will decrease your salary if you live in an area of the country with a lower cost of living? (Answer: Facebook, which they kind of buried in their WFH announcement; and other orgs will likely to follow suit.)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As for productivity, it turns out you\u2019re actually likely to be more productive working from home. That\u2019s certainly not harmful for you, it can be great! But remember that it\u2019s your company that automatically benefits from that. So if your boss tries to position this policy as something you got to do rather than something you had to do\u2014especially if the occasional WFH day had previously been treated as a benefit\u2014well\u2026 don\u2019t let them.

So I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re good at multi-tasking, too. You may be able to fit more personal-fulfillment pursuits into your day when you work from home (like the aforementioned sourdough bread). But you may also find the lack of a typical routine to be challenging. It\u2019s like the phenomenon where many people thought they would have more time to read in the pandemic, but are finding out that they\u2019re reading less than ever before. In other words, saying goodbye to your commute doesn\u2019t automatically mean you\u2019ll use the found time to learn another language; you may, in fact, find out that that time you had to yourself evert day helped your mindset, almost like a meditation. So just remember, you may have more time for personal growth, but you will have to actively make sure you use it that way."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Consider meditation or another centering activity"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Speaking of meditation, it\u2019s a practice that, at its best, can help you maintain perspective about who you are. Not who you will be, not who you were\u2014but who you are in this present moment. You\u2019re going to have to learn to accept that person and understand that they are good enough. At home, you are a roommate, a partner, a mother, a father, an individual badass, etc. But in an office, people think of you differently\u2014you exist in a completely different context and are appreciated for different skills and different daily interactions. Once you no longer have an office, it can be surprising to learn how much other people\u2019s thoughts about you contribute to your sense of self-worth. (It was for me.) Working from home, you can absolutely still have that sense of self-worth, but you\u2019re going to have work for it."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Schedule social time with your cohorts"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And not just on Zoom. Assuming stay-in-place orders will be lifted at some point, if you still live near your co-workers, make an effort to see some of them on a semi-regular basis. In-person chatting is where all the good stuff happens \u2014 from ideas to real friendships. Those of us who are fully freelance quickly come to learn that talking to other people in our industry is one of the best ways to stay sane.

You are entirely responsible for raising your value. Partly, that\u2019s because in freelancing there\u2019s typically no review schedule set in place. But keep in mind that it\u2019s also easier to keep pushing off a scheduled review when someone\u2019s face is not top of mind. It\u2019s also easier for your boss to skip it entirely if your organization does not have a review policy. Sometimes, face-to-face contact spurs guilt for the employer. You can also spur a little guilt in the form of a requested review or call about a raise; in fact, I encourage you to do so. Don\u2019t let them off easy."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Put on some damn pants"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If I sound like a nag, well, it\u2019s for your own good \u2014 so, sorry, not sorry.

Some people still think that\u2019s strange, especially in pandemic times. But if cleanliness is next to godliness, then stretchy pants are next to death."}], "topic": "freelancing"}
