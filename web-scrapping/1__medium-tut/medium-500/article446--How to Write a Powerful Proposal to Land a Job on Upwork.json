Among all the obvious criteria of being offered an interview and, potentially, a contract, your proposal rightfully plays the leading role."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In this article, I\u2019ll share some key tips on how to write winning proposals that\u2019ll lead to a contract on Upwork."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But first, how do I know that this is true?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ve been on Upwork when it was still called oDesk. Back then the rules of the game were a bit different as both oDesk and its users were still quite inexperienced."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As a means of quality assurance, oDesk offered you to pass certain tests relevant for your specialty. Your skills were mostly assessed by the results of these tests, along with client reviews of course."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At the time I used to earn a decent amount of money each month and a dozen of 5-star reviews which led to the point that clients themselves kept inviting me to apply for their job postings. And I\u2019ve been able to keep the rhythm to date."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Back then, landing jobs was somewhat easier than it is now, if we don\u2019t count the huge number of incompetent freelancers who used to offer ridiculously low rates to steal the deal."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, much has changed since oDesk and Elance joined forces in 2013 and turned into a single platform called Upwork in 2015. The platform introduced better and stronger evaluation criteria for freelancers. This helped sift away disqualified candidates and promote more competent freelancers."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Thus we, well-performing freelancers, adapted to the new approaches. But guess what? The competition has gotten even stiffer as now you have to compete with stronger and highly qualified candidates."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "During all these years on Upwork, I\u2019ve gained some solid knowledge and learned some key tactics of writing functioning proposals that win me the job the majority of times. Hence, I\u2019m happy to share with you the following key tips of writing the perfect cover letter when applying for a job on Upwork."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "1. Stop sending copy-pasted letters"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This one seems obvious, yet it is a major mistake so many freelancers make. A copy-pasted template is the most annoying thing for a client to get, which instantly destroys your chances to be even contacted."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s like a red flag indicating that you\u2019re not serious enough about the job and that you may not even have read the job posting entirely. It also implies that you are likely to treat the job as carelessly as you wrote your proposal."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Instead, write a clear, concise letter that specifically addresses the issues stated in the job post. Don\u2019t write a lengthy letter for the sake of being lengthy. Sometimes, less is more. Be specific and to the point, showing the client that you\u2019ve actually read their job post and that you\u2019ve crafted your proposal precisely for them. This will significantly increase your chances of being hired."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Example not to follow:"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2158/1*10Wt0J7G-0jfOcs0ghm4YQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Example to follow:"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1834/1*--XamGrAjCd7ralkXMR55Q.png"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "2. Use the client\u2019s name in your proposal"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you\u2019ve read the book \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People\u201d, you probably know that there are few things in the world that people love more than hearing the sound of their own name. This is human psychology."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Whenever possible, always use the client\u2019s name in your proposal. Reading their name the person subconsciously believes that the letter has been crafted specifically for them, which instantly generates a positive feeling."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Of course, using the client\u2019s name alone won\u2019t guarantee you a contract, but it\u2019s an easy way to attract their attention and stand out from the crowd."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "How do you find the client\u2019s name on Upwork?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll not think that you are a stalker. People love an individual approach and they may believe that you are going to treat their project with as much care."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/8960/1*IZbi1sp9YPCcPTfIgCZTrQ.jpeg"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "3. Reduce the use of the word \u201cI\u201d in your proposal"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Yes, it\u2019s your proposal where you should cover your experience and skills. Perhaps you\u2019ve done similar jobs before or perhaps your background is exactly what the client needs. Using words like \u201cI\u201d, \u201cme\u201d, \u201cmy\u201d are acceptable and often necessary in your cover letter, but be careful not to overuse them. Otherwise, your proposal may turn into a self-centered, one-sided story very unappealing for the client."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Remember, the client isn\u2019t interested in how cool you actually are. And they are certainly not interested in how many diplomas you have, nor even where you\u2019ve graduated from, nor at what companies you\u2019ve worked before."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "They want to know what you can do for them. In other words, they want to learn what they\u2019ll get in return if they chose to hire you."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So, when writing a cover letter to apply for a job, avoid the \u201call-about-me syndrome\u201d and focus on your client. This is an old sales secret that you can apply to literally any job application that you ever write again."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Example not to follow: I\u2019m a very experienced professional translator who has worked for 3 international translation agencies. I\u2019m dedicated to providing high-quality and affordable translation."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I am proud of my comprehensive approach to translation and my unrivaled expertise. I\u2019m passionate about my work and take great pride in my numerous happy clients."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s hard for the client to get excited and visualize what\u2019s in it for them, don\u2019t you think? Did you notice how it uses the words \u201cI\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d a lot. This is a dead giveaway and it\u2019s a mistake too many freelancers make when they\u2019re writing their cover letter."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Example to follow: I\u2019ll provide you with high quality translation that perfectly fits your expectations and budget. Expect to get completely error-free, fluent text that doesn\u2019t sound like a translation but is authentic enough to be taken as original."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A lot more interesting, isn\u2019t it?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When you try to write your next cover letter, instead of writing all about you, try re-framing it so it\u2019s using less \u201cI\u201d language and more \u201cyou\u201d language."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The key is to shift the focus so it\u2019s away from you as a freelancer and more towards what your client\u2019s goals are."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "4. Rephrase the client\u2019s problem"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Read the job posting carefully and understand what is the exact problem of the client. When writing your proposal, rephrase the client\u2019s core problem in your own words. Then tell them how you are going to solve it. This way you\u2019ll show them that you actually understand their needs and thus you are more likely to handle the task properly."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Rephrasing the problem also has a psychological connotation. This strategy is called mirroring, and involves subtly repeating the other person\u2019s words to them, leading them to unconsciously trust you more."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Example:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Client request: We\u2019re looking for a creative UI/UX designer to create a unique design for our app, so that it really represents our brand."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Potential proposal: I\u2019ll be glad to design the look and feel of your app in a way that feels 100% like you."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "5. Watch out for \u201ccontrol words\u201d in the job posting"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Many clients use special, often meaningless, \u201ccontrol\u201d words in their job posting to make sure you\u2019ve read through the entire post."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "They then ask you to start your cover letter with that particular word. Be attentive and use the control words to avoid your proposal being ignored."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1588/1*kF752alyFOoj2oR5D2lDQQ.png"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "6. Don\u2019t use vogue language"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Don\u2019t use vogue words in your cover letter. Instead of making your proposal stronger, they do the opposite and weaken its impact. Here are a few examples:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I am extremely professional / creative / super committed / well-organized and so on."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Nobody believes in it anyway, even if it\u2019s true."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Instead, to emphasis your qualifications and how good of a candidate you are, redirect the client to read reviews and testimonials that other clients have written about you. This will pose you much more credible and improve your chances of getting hired on Upwork."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "7. Tell them how you\u2019ll solve their problem"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The keyword here is \u201csolve the problem\u201d. You are expected to solve a problem. The client wants to hire you to ease their pain."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Concisely describe how you\u2019ll solve their problem, what steps or approaches you\u2019ll take, and what kind of suitable solutions you see. This is potentially the most important part of your cover letter. It can make or break the deal, so it deserves an extra effort."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Example:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Client request: We\u2019re looking to hire an experienced designer to create a coffee shop website design from scratch. You\u2019ll need to do a research and ensure good user experience so that it is easy enough for a variety of users."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Potential proposal: I\u2019ll start with wireframing first to sort out the UX, then I\u2019ll create a low-fidelity prototype so that you can see how it actually works in terms of functionality."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Once this is sorted and we are satisfied with the user experience and flow, I\u2019ll step in to build the UI and the aesthetics. What do you think?"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "8. Add a link to your portfolio"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Don\u2019t expect to be asked for your portfolio and don\u2019t assume that the client will necessarily take a look at your Upwork profile. Be sure to include a link to your entire portfolio or to a few relevant projects, but no more than 2\u20133."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Pro tip: it\u2019s not necessary to include all your projects in your portfolio \u2014 5\u20136 are quite enough, just choose the best ones. This way you\u2019ll seem more professional."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "9. Avoid typos in your cover letter"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Always read your cover letter before hitting the send button. Typos will make it look less professional and decrease your chances of getting the job. This is especially relevant if you\u2019re applying for translation, editing, copywriting or other writing jobs where improper grammar and typos are guaranteed to break the deal."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "10. Don\u2019t include irrelevant skills"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Maybe you\u2019re a programmer who also has a background of an accountant. While applying for a programming job, don\u2019t include your accounting skills: this will not help you pose smarter. And nobody cares about it anyway. Instead, this will make you seem unfocused and unaware what you\u2019re actually applying for. Say only what you believe the clients wants to hear."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Hopefully, these tips and strategies will help you on your way of landing more jobs on Upwork. I\u2019d love to hear about your experiences and if you could leverage these tactics in your proposals. Share your thoughts in the comments or ping me on Twitter."}], "topic": "freelancing"}
