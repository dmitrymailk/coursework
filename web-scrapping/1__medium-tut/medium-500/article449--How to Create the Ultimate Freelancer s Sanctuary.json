As remote workers, the world is our office space. That being said, there are many benefits to having a specified area where you can work to meet deadlines and communicate with clients."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While I sometimes prefer a coffee shop environment to complete my daily work, there\u2019s nothing quite like working from home in my freelancer\u2019s sanctuary. Although many people would look at what I call my freelancer\u2019s sanctuary as just another office space, it\u2019s special to me and it\u2019s where I get some of my best work done."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Do you have a dedicated workstation? If not, you\u2019re really missing out. If you are new to freelancing, it is possible that you simply work from wherever you can. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this and many of us started out that way. That being said, the amount of mental clarity that comes with working in a dedicated area is valuable."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Once freelancing becomes your career and you actually start to get paid for writing on a daily basis, the demands of the job can call for something a bit more stable than a seat at the kitchen table. Many of us work long hours and having a dedicated space to call our own can make all of the difference in keeping us focused, energized, and prepared for the workday ahead."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Today, I wanted to take some time to talk about how you can create your very own freelancer\u2019s sanctuary, a place you can depend on to offer you the peace of mind that is rarely found just anywhere. An adequate freelancer\u2019s sanctuary offers stability, quiet, and security."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While there is no one right way to set up your own freelancer\u2019s sanctuary, there are a few things that you should have to improve your chances of success as a freelancer.

That\u2019s actually something that can be great about being a freelancer for some people, the world is your workspace! That being said, however, there are many benefits associated with choosing a dedicated workstation that you can mold into the perfect freelancer\u2019s sanctuary."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For one, you\u2019ll have much more privacy to work when you have a dedicated office space. Rather than struggling to focus over the noise of your family members or dealing with the distraction of a blaring television, a dedicated workstation is an area where you can go, close the door, and focus."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Secondly, a dedicated workstation has been shown to increase productivity. This is likely due to the fact that when you have an area that feels like your space for working, you tend to have improved focus. After all, when you feel productive you tend to be more productive."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Another great reason to choose a dedicated workstation to call your freelancer\u2019s sanctuary is that it can even be a tax deduction! As freelancers, we have to pay taxes on every cent of the money we earn from our self-employed pursuits."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A dedicated workstation in your home is a serious perk considering that, since it\u2019s meant for work and only work, it qualifies as a tax deduction! It\u2019s important to save money everywhere you can as a freelancer so there\u2019s really no reason not to have a dedicated workstation financially!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As you can see, there are many reasons for organizing a dedicated workstation for your freelancing work. But how do you start? Luckily, it\u2019s as simple as starting with a desk and you can find small desks for relatively cheap!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I found my own office desk on Amazon for much less than it would\u2019ve costed me if I had paid a visit to a furniture store. It\u2019s an L-shaped desk that gave me exactly the amount of space I needed for two monitors, my keyboard, and room for files underneath. Best of all, it was only $175 and has held up outstandingly!"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1124/1*4ciBMH2WstCWXzXAJrOU3g.png"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Pay Attention to Ergonomics"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After you have picked out the perfect desk for your new freelancer\u2019s sanctuary, it\u2019s time to think about ergonomics. Why? Because as my freelancing career has gained traction, so too has my back pain. We live a sedentary lifestyle as freelancers and with hours upon hours spent behind a desk, it\u2019s important to get comfort where you can."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The first step to setting up a freelancer\u2019s sanctuary built with ergonomics in mind is finding a desk chair that benefits both your work and your health. Paying attention to the height of the chair is crucial when it comes to the perfect office chair. You should definitely consider your own height when choosing the right chair."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As a rule of thumb, the best office chair for your freelancer\u2019s sanctuary will set your feet flat on the floor while your lap is completely parallel to it. While this may seem odd, I\u2019ve personally found that one of the best office chairs in a sense of ergonomics is a gaming chair. I even bought one for my own freelancer\u2019s sanctuary."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This particular model, which you can find by clicking the link above, features lumbar support, and a strong metal frame designed to promote a comfortable seated position for hours upon hours of work at your desk.

Your keyboard makes a real difference in your health, especially when you\u2019re spending hours crouched over it completing your freelancing work. The best ergonomic keyboards feature a wave-like design built to reduce the stress on your hands as you type."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This particular keyboard, which you can find by clicking the link above, features an integrated palm rest designed to reduce wrist fatigue as you type. If you\u2019re a freelance writer like me, you need a keyboard designed with ergonomics in mind. I, personally, will never go back to any other kind of keyboard for my work ever again."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/850/1*-D3Ec_vkT3mbyzxAA8Mxow.jpeg"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Limit Your Distractions"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Ask any freelancer working from home what one of the biggest challenges found in the environment is and you\u2019re likely to hear one thing: the countless distractions."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As freelancers, it\u2019s up to us to limit our distractions when creating the perfect freelancer\u2019s sanctuary.

Fortunately, there are a few easy ways you can limit your distractions in your home environment to stay productive and focused!"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Pinpoint Your Distractions"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The first step in limiting distractions in order to create the perfect freelancer\u2019s sanctuary is to pinpoint what those distractions are. By identifying the things that may prove distracting, we can take the necessary steps to limit them before we ever sit down to work. Without an issue hanging over your head, you\u2019re much more likely to stay productive throughout your workday."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If noisy kids happen to be one of your main distractions, make sure that your workstation is positioned as far away from the noise as possible. You can also take steps to make sure your children, depending on their age, are kept occupied for the majority of your workday to the best of your ability."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If the thought of everything in your home that needs to be done (such as a load of laundry or a sink full of dishes), make sure to knock out these tasks before you sit down to work. Otherwise, you\u2019re likely to just have it hanging over you head the entire workday, proving distracting in itself."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Play Background Audio"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Multiple professionals suggest that playing background audio is a great way to limit distractions during your workday. Whether it is an audiobook, music, or your favorite podcast, playing audio in the background at a reasonable level may actually improve your productivity. There\u2019s even a music app, called Brain.fm, that you can use to focus during the day! The app is designed with artificial intelligence to play music intended to help you stay focused and on task."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Take Your Phone Out of the Equation"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Many remote workers will tell you that one of their biggest distractions during the workday is their own phone. The urge to check social media or answer a text can prove incredibly distracting for most freelancers working from home."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For this reason, I recommend turning your phone off during the workday if possible or at least putting it on vibrate face-down so you won\u2019t be distracted by any little notification that pops up. While this isn\u2019t possible for all of us, I know, it can go a long way in helping you to reduce one of the biggest distractions known to freelancers working from home."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Take a Break"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One of the best ways to limit distractions and maintain consistent focus throughout the workday is to actually take a break from time to time!

This gives you time to do something you enjoy before sitting down to refocus yourself on the work that needs to be done for the day.

Use plants to your advantage when creating your own freelancing sanctuary!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In a report by Wired, it was found that the presence of plants and greenery in the workplace can actually boost workplace productivity by around 15 percent.

If so much light is coming into the room that you have to squint to see your computer screen, for example, this is less than satisfactory and even distracting. Take the direction of the sun into account when deciding where to place your office desk so that you can enjoy the benefits of natural daylight without having to compromise efficiency."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Harness the Power of Feng Shui"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Speaking of where to place furniture in your freelancer\u2019s sanctuary, the ancient art of feng shui offers a slew of ways that you can outfit your office space to allow great creativity and productivity."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Position the furniture that you\u2019ll be spending the most time using (such as your desk) with a line of sight to the door (however, not directly in line with it) and you will create a vision of anything that is coming your way, both in life and work. This eliminates a sense of vulnerability while also leaving enough space to prepare for anything that walks through the door."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s also a good idea to choose a position with something called \u201cgood backing\u201d which is ideally a spot with a wall that provides a solid structure and stability behind you.

Good backing is all about stability in your freelancing sanctuary."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "**Note**: This article contains affiliate links that, if used to purchase the product, directly support me."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Want more tips on the best SEO practices, guides to boosting your freelancing career, and the tools you need to jumpstart your career as a self-employed professional?
