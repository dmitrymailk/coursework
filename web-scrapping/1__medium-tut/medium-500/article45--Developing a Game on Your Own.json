Quite the contrary; it\u2019s an incredibly difficult and daunting task. Game development typically takes teams of people, thousands of hours worth of labor, and hundreds of thousands \u2014 if not millions \u2014 of dollars."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Potential developers spend years in school, build their portfolios, and start at the bottom just to have a chance to be on these elite programming teams. Not everyone has access to these resources, however. Some individuals want to create their dream without corporate interference, some want to develop because they\u2019re passionate about the medium, some want to throw their hat in the ring to content with the big hitters, and others just want to have a hobby and enhance their skills. Several of the biggest names in the industry were developed by one person: Braid, Papers, Please, Spelunky, Stardew Valley, Undertale, and of course, Minecraft. These juggernauts were all created without being syndicated by big business, lines of code being written in the comfort of bedrooms and home offices, with free time being dedicated to these individual\u2019s craft."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I was able to sit down with an indie developer and ask a few questions pertaining to the difficulties and revelations of developing a game on your own, as well as discuss a little bit about the game he\u2019s making and what inspired him to do so.

Think Mario Party meets Dragon Quest. You and up to three other players take turns moving around a board map in which you will solve quests, fight monsters, and progress the story until either you win or lose the campaign. There\u2019s a lot more to it than that but that\u2019s the basic idea."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SUPERJUMPWhat gave you the idea to make an RPG and how long have you been thinking about making a game like this?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "ARSALAN[Mistral Hearts] was initially an idea I had for a tabletop board game. But as I expanded on the ideas in it, I realized it would be too unwieldy as an actual tabletop game and would be more interesting as a video game. That way the computer can handle all the fiddly calculations and bookkeeping. As for how long, I started working on it a few months after I started thinking about the game seriously, which was over two years now."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SUPERJUMPDo you have a coding/programming background?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "ARSALANNot professionally, no. I just learned coding through necessity. I used to make games on RPG Maker, where coding isn\u2019t really required. But eventually, as my ambitions for what I wanted to implement expanded, I had to learn Ruby, which was the programming language for RPG Maker. Learning Ruby was a slow and painful process for me, but once I had that down, I learning other languages a lot faster. I still wouldn\u2019t call myself a professional programmer by any means though."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Under the hood"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SUPERJUMPWhat is your favorite aspect of the development process?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "ARSALANI like the actual design aspect of it.

Things like textures for buildings and roads, stuff like that. Initially it\u2019s all fun and exciting but \u2014 especially if you\u2019re working on a large project \u2014 the excitement gives way to a sense of \u201cdo I really need to make like 20 more of these?\u201d haha."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SUPERJUMPWhat made you decide to make a game completely on your own?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "ARSALANIt\u2019s not that I specifically want to make games on my own, but it\u2019s just how I\u2019ve always made games, aside from small collaborations here and there. I\u2019m definitely open to working in a team for a full project in the future, but as of now I\u2019ve been content for this to be a solo endeavor."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SUPERJUMPWhat resources do you use? Unity, Unreal, etc?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "ARSALANFor this project I\u2019m using Unity as the game engine.

How did you learn how to use the software?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "ARSALANYes, and mainly through watching and following a ton of tutorials online through the years. Nowadays, you can learn pretty much anything online. Sure, it\u2019s not as comprehensive as getting a formal education on it, but you can still get by, especially since in game design you need to know quite a wide variety of things. Not only that but there are tons of free art assets available to indie developers online. Sites like CGTrader and Turbosquid have a ton of 3d models you can use and tweak to get what you need. Unity and Unreal also have a lot of good assets on their respective stores as well."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SUPERJUMPWhat got you into creating games?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "ARSALANPlaying a lot of video games and going \u201cthis is a great game but I also wish it did this other thing.

You need to be able to realize what you can and can\u2019t realistically do. I think this is a common pitfall that a lot of us indie devs fall into. You can have the greatest ideas in the world but it\u2019s not going to matter if your game never comes out."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SUPERJUMPWhat was your biggest blunder or set back while making the game, and how did you overcome it?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "ARSALANI would say implementing online functionality was the biggest hurdle I had to overcome for this project, as it\u2019s not something I had much experience in doing. Thankfully, due to the help of some knowledgeable friends, and lots of online help, I was able to get it working. It\u2019s still something I\u2019m wary of when playtesting and will definitely need some fine tuning in the future."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SUPERJUMPHow does a team of one person handle things like quality control, bug fixes, etc?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "ARSALANBy pestering anyone you can to test play your game and giving you feedback. Since you can\u2019t exactly hire a QA team as an indie dev, you just have to find other means. There are lots of communities online for game devs with members that will test play your game if you test play theirs. There\u2019s also many discord servers you can join to help with things like this."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SUPERJUMPHow do you handle deadlines? Do you keep yourself on a strict schedule, or do you sort of just go with the flow?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "ARSALANI think some sort of deadline/ scheduling is vital to gauge your progress and to make sure you aren\u2019t falling behind on what you need to be doing. That being said, I find it difficult to stick to a strict schedule because game design is such an iterative process that it\u2019s hard to map out months in advance exactly what I\u2019ll be doing."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The creative process"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SUPERJUMPYou told me you handle all of the writing for the game as well as all the coding, do you have a system for that, as in is everything already mapped out and you go from there or are you writing more as more ideas pop in your head?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "ARSALANThe broad strokes of the plot, characters, and quest design are mapped out, but I leave things kind of open until I actually sit down and write them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SUPERJUMPWhere did you learn to write cohesive stories?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "ARSALANI\u2019ve always been fond of writing stories.

You don\u2019t have to start with a 2D platformer as your first project if you\u2019re not interested in them. That being said, maintaining scope is very important. For the first few projects I recommend doing basically short game demos that show off a few mechanics or game levels.
