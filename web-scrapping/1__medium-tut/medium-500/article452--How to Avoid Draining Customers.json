The Pareto Law \u2014 by Vilfredo Pareto \u2014 says so. As a freelancer, a business, or an independent marketer, you can tell that some customers are simply difficult to handle. And most annoyingly, they bring in a significantly small proportion of your total revenue."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Other than the revenue proportion of the customer, there are several other reasons to avoid a customer that is not taking your business forward. The relationship between customers and businesses should be mutual \u2014 you solve their problems, and they help you grow. If this is not the case, then the relationship is probably not worth it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Some customers drain your enthusiasm. As a freelance writer, I have come across clients with extreme expectations. Although working with people like this should make your skills get better, it is not so when they are seldom clear on their requirements and often abusive. In most cases, we go back and forth on supposed petty projects. At the end of the project, I had invested more time and energy than I\u2019m being rewarded for."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019m not saying these clients are awful. No, not at all. All I\u2019m saying is that we weren\u2019t good fits for each other, and I should have avoided them \u2014 and you should."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "From my experience, I\u2019ll briefly share how to avoid customers that are draining you and focusing on winning better-paying ones."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Clear Communication Is Key"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For every collaboration, effective communication puts everyone on the same page. Without this, everyone would be working like a pack of lone wolves hunting at their accords. When dealing with a customer \u2014 either as a freelancer or a brand \u2014 you need to communicate honestly."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Redacted information makes it hard for your clients to create vivid expectations; thus, they could keep it unrealistically high. Make sure that you let them know what you are capable of doing and how they can help you serve them better. This way, they would know what to expect and ascertain if they are working with the right person or company."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This practice will help you avoid draining clients and acquire those that are really satiable by your services."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Transparency is Crucial"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sometimes, the demoralizing hassle you experience while dealing with clients could be your fault. A hard pill to swallow, huh?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While working on a project, it\u2019s necessary to allow the client to track your progress. You may be self-motivated and a self-starter that thinks she can fix things through and just leave the client with results. Well, it doesn\u2019t always work that way. Most clients want to be involved in the progress of the project. They want to make modifications as you go and ensure that things are going smoothly."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When working on a medium to long term project \u2014 let\u2019s say above six weeks \u2014 I provide regular weekly updates to the client. I give them a detailed report of how the week progressed, and I list my plans/schedule for the coming week. If I\u2019m ghostwriting a book, I usually ask them to skim through the completed part and suggest modifications."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You may wonder why I don\u2019t ask them to do these when I finish the book. Well, the back-and-forth movement with a bulky book is ten times more troubling than it would be on the shorter parts."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Whether they request it or not, make it a habit to keep them posted on the progress of their project. Be transparent about it. It\u2019s theirs, not yours."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Clearly Define Your Ideal Client"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "No matter the industry, there is so much money to be made, and there are so many clients to serve. You might feel the urge to close every client that comes knocking at you. Don\u2019t do it.
