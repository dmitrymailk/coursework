While generating income through writing is perfectly doable, centering revenue can have the opposite affect. I\u2019ve spent more time in front of a blank page with a flashing cursor urging me to create a masterpiece than I care to admit. Eventually, I began feeling inadequate and closed my laptop for a week or 3. It took me a while to remember you can actually just start writing anything. First, I had to forget."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Forget Business"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Once I began earning income as a freelance writer, I started moving further away from what prompted me to write in the first place \u2014 the sheer enjoyment. Conveying stories and ideas took the backseat to asking myself, what\u2019s selling right now? I\u2019ve read stories about writers surrendering themselves to the hustle to the point of losing complete interest in their craft. When I took a break from creating for others, I became inspired and ideas returned to me. Pitching was no longer my driving force."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Forget Aesthetics"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I can count on no hands how many times I\u2019ve sat down to my laptop with a perfectly organized office space decorated with rose gold embellishments. My non-existent iPad is never resting underneath a phone protected by a pink crystallized case. I\u2019ll never place a cup of coffee directly next to my thousand-dollar machine. I\u2019m never sitting on a balcony with my knees pulled up to my chest staring into the void with a full draft eagerly waiting on my screen. You won\u2019t find me in coffee shops because I don\u2019t like creating in noisy environments. I don\u2019t even have a dedicated work space aside from a small desk that I rarely use because it begins feeling like work. I can\u2019t speak of a daily routine or inspiring process that can offer a template to other writers. Sometimes I\u2019m just sitting on my couch or bed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Forget Social Media"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While I\u2019ve found topics through social media that inspired me to produce articles and have been able to network with other writers, it can be a counterproductive environment. I follow some amazing writers whose content I greatly admire and the vitriol slung at them by anonymous (and not so anonymous) trolls can be discouraging. Most of them are advocates for justice and social issues so it hits harder because I sometimes write in this space. I began wondering what type of comments I\u2019d receive if my writing was posted. This only deterred me from engaging in my own way. Stepping away from the toxic mess of comment sections that proved detrimental not just to my own mental well-being, but my creative process allowed me to focus without negativity."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Forget Lists"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The most annoying habit I picked up throughout the course of freelancing has been thinking in terms of the dreaded listicle. Structuring the content of my writing in terms of listing the most \u201cvaluable\u201d portions felt counterintuitive. By trying to extract pre-packaged headlines from my writing I felt that the rest became unimportant. Some storytelling just can\u2019t be broken up into key points designed to hold readers\u2019 attention. While I do indulge in a good listicle from time to time, I\u2019m not letting the format run all willy-nilly throughout my writing process."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Forget Trends"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For a while I fell victim to chasing news cycles and closely following trending discourse. Even though it didn\u2019t always interest me, I followed almost every trending topic and hashtag. What the hell was I doing? By committing to remaining extremely online, I wasn\u2019t using that time to focus on writing anything. My mind automatically began searching for my place in the messy discourse. While this occasionally paid off, it circled right back to centering capital to be made. Keeping a thumb on the pulse of popular culture and online discussion can be valuable for writers until it becomes expected."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The pressure to create content that pays the bills can cause serious burnout and leave writers feeling like they\u2019ve failed. This goes hand in hand with the expectation that every piece of writing put into the universe should meet an impossible standard. Writing anything means literally just that. I\u2019ve had days since exercising this groundbreaking idea where word vomit turns into something meaningful. Even if it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ve devoted my time to something that I enjoy. On my own terms. Without pressure."}], "topic": "freelancing"}
