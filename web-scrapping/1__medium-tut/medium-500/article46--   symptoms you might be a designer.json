Many people at different stages of life face similar questions and struggles. There can be many reasons for this, starting from a mess in one\u2019s own head to external factors. Once I could relate to these feelings very well. Coming from a family of technicians, engineer-oriented high school, and later university, pursuing a career in design was an absurd idea. It took some serious thinking to first ponder the possibility of doing a 180, and then a lot of hard work to make it happen. Did I mention it was scary as hell? Am I designer material? Do I have talent and skills for that? Would I ever be as good as other professionals in the field?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This article will show you some indicators that personally helped me and might help you consider a career in design, or simply entertain you with some quirks of designers."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Potential designer symptoms"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/5600/1*sYhMmd3id2lz_fNz8_GZVw.png"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Mining what\u2019s shining"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Have you ever noticed like a bright product package is calling for you?
