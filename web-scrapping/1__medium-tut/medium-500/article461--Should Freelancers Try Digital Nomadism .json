Currently, almost 5 million people describe themselves as digital nomads."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ve never thought of myself as a digital nomad, but I\u2019ve been traveling and working for almost two years now. Currently, I\u2019m settling in Tenerife, Spain, so who knows? Maybe it\u2019s my last stop, and from now on, traveling will be just for vacation."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But those years of working and traveling helped me figure out what I want in my life and career. It also showed me the lonely and chaotic side of working on the road."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Digital nomadism seems like a dream \u2014 you get to see the world while making money.

You feel torn apart between work and traveling."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s also hard to work on long term projects that require back and forth communication with a client. Your time zones might be different, and you might need to sit at your computer and wait, while the beach is out there. For me to build discipline, I need routine. But it\u2019s difficult to establish a routine and don\u2019t get distracted when you\u2019re eager to discover new things."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "You get lonely"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I started traveling for long periods when I was 21 years old. While my friends in Lithuania were bonding, going to parties, and celebrating each others\u2019 big moments, I was studying in Belgium, living in South East Asia, or moving to Tenerife.

I would get anxious to the point where I would just wish to be at home, focusing on my work. My clients were unsatisfied, and I wasn\u2019t enjoying my trips."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But all in all, I believe everyone should try digital nomadism. Even for a short time, it\u2019s a great experience that gives you much more than you can wish for.

Now, this place is Tenerife, but who knows."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you can automate most of your work and generate money while traveling.
