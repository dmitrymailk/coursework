{"title": "5 Tricks for Monetizing Your Art", "data": [{"type": "sentence", "content": "Whether you\u2019re a full-time artist or just trying to turn your creative hobby into a side hustle, you\u2019ve probably wondered how exactly you can monetize your art \u2014 and if you should do so. You hear people complain about artists who \u201csell out,\u201d or perhaps you worry that your art isn\u2019t good enough to command money."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Make no mistake: every artist deserves compensation for their time, labor, and creative value. Unless you\u2019re asking $500 for stick-figure drawings, you\u2019re probably worth more than you think."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The problem is that monetizing your art can be a cumbersome, soul-draining process. It requires a monumental effort just to figure out pricing \u2014 and then you have to market your work!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s look at some strategies for monetizing your art. We\u2019ll talk about how to set your prices, some sites to check out, and most importantly, how to get in the right mindset to sell your work."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "5. Change your mindset to a professional one"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I see way too many artists who charge low prices for their art because \u201cit doesn\u2019t take me that long\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m just doing it for fun.\u201d Both those reasons are silly."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If it doesn\u2019t take you long, you should be rewarded, not punished, for your creative productivity. People who think this way often have hourly jobs, so they figure they should charge what they make per hour. First of all, you\u2019re probably being underpaid for your hourly-wage job, so don\u2019t base it on that. Second, art isn\u2019t just the product of labor. It carries artistic value, which is arguably priceless. The value of your work is more than the measurable time you put into it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And if you\u2019re just doing it for fun and charging less because of it, you\u2019re dragging down the market rate for professional artists. You\u2019re contributing to the confidence of choosing beggars that they can get awesome art for dirt cheap \u2014 or refuse to pay the going rate for creative work. Besides, why on Earth would you want to make less money just because you\u2019re having fun? I personally love making money from my writing because I love writing. I\u2019m not going to charge less because I love it. If anything, I\u2019m going to charge more."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "4. Base your prices on what you want to earn"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A better approach is to figure out what you\u2019d like to earn from your art. You need to earn back the cost of materials, and you also need to cover your labor costs. Add those costs up for each artwork. That\u2019s your base price. Then, slap a profit margin on it \u2014 perhaps 20 or 30 percent. There\u2019s absolutely no shame in making a profit off your work. You\u2019re not a charity."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you offer a creative service, think about what you need to earn. Plenty of people will pay peanuts for copywriting or graphic design \u2014 and their expectations will be super low. If you think you suck, by all means, sell your services for pennies. But you probably don\u2019t think you suck, so don\u2019t undervalue yourself. Remember, self-employment comes with its own costs, so set your rate at a level that can cover the basic expenses of doing business. Then, tack that profit margin on so that you actually have money to spend, save, and invest."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "3. Know your market"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ve been that artist who churned out dozens of artworks that no one wanted. It\u2019s a sad-but-true fact: some of your favorite work won\u2019t sell. That doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have art worth selling. However, you should think about products you can offer that serve a market need. There\u2019s no shame in creating \u201cpop art\u201d to diversify your income streams."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Just as with any business, you need to figure out who your target customers are, then create art they will like. It may change by platform as well. For example, you might be able to sell your fine art in galleries or at art festivals, but if you want to sell it on a digital print shop such as Redbubble, you probably need to create some designs with mass appeal."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "2. Choose the right venue"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There are oodles of content publishing platforms, digital print shops, and online marketplaces. This can be overwhelming for artists who aren\u2019t sure how to sell their art. First, it\u2019s important to focus your sight on one or two platforms. While it may seem logical to set up accounts on every platform possible so that you can earn the most money, don\u2019t forget that you need to effectively market on and promote each channel. And many of these channels have a social aspect, which means you need to connect with others in order to promote your content."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Here\u2019s a quick and dirty list of ways to monetize your art online:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Clearly, there are a lot of options. Choose one to three platforms to start monetizing your content."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "1. Build up your fanbase"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I recommend choosing platforms that require a lot of social interaction so that you can leverage your existing network and start building a community around your brand. That way, once you\u2019re a bit more established, you can drive your fans directly to product listings on sites where discoverability is lower."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Very few artists instantly start making money off their art without a personal network. That\u2019s because so many customers will come to you via word-of-mouth. You can\u2019t afford to simply put your art out there and wait for customers. Don\u2019t be afraid to shamelessly self-promote. Ask your friends and family to help by sharing your online shop, social media profiles, and anywhere else you\u2019re promoting your art. This strategy may make you uncomfortable, but it\u2019s a helluva lot cheaper and more effective than setting up your Etsy and waiting for results."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Follow these steps to start monetizing your creative work. Remember, once you start doing this, you\u2019re effectively running a business, and it\u2019s important to treat yourself that way. Don\u2019t sell yourself short; DO sell yourself. Ultimately, most people like to support artists. They like to know that they\u2019re getting a piece of creativity while helping an artist pay the bills. So, set your prices appropriately, know your audience, find your venue, and start making money off your art!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Enjoyed this article?
