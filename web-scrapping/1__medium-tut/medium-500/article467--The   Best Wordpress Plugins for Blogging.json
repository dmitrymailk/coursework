Each month, 409 million people read over 70 million posts and 77 million comments."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Wordpress wouldn\u2019t the platform it is today without its wide range of plugins. They allow you to customise your website and implement any new function you can think of (e-commerce, members area, download sections, advanced forms, landing pages\u2026) As of this writing, there are 55,000 plugins available on the Wordpress plugin directory, which has received over 1 billion downloads."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You can technically build a blog on Wordpress without plugins, but you won\u2019t get far. Plugins are necessary to take your blog to the next level. They will enable you to drive more traffic with SEO, design awesome template-based content, and incorporate cool widgets outside of the limiting framework of default themes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the 5 best Wordpress plugins for blogging."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Yoast SEO"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Yoast is a Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) plugin.

It adds a section at the end of the admin page where you write your content. It asks you to input your focus keyphrase, your Google text snippet, and more. It shows you the SEO score and the readability score of your content."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s an extremely powerful tool, and it gives you a ton of advice on how to improve your score if it is not high enough. The suggestions are easy to understand.

At the end of day though, remember one thing: content is king, and if it is not kick-ass in the first place, it won\u2019t gain exposure.

It also handles responsiveness, meaning that you can design each of your pages for mobile, tablet, and computer screens.

You can choose to build a page with the main theme properties (width, font properties, spacing\u2026) but you can also start from scratch by selecting \u201cElementor Full Width\u201d as a page template.

They are blocks of content you can add to your site\u2019s sidebars, footers, and sometimes other areas. The problem is that the locations where you can add these blocks depend largely on the theme you\u2019re using. Most themes only allow for custom content in the sidebar and the footer. If you want to have a subscribe form halfway through a post content, or a popular posts section right under your header, you can only do that with code knowledge."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Widget Shortcode fixes that issue.

The subscribe form will show up right in the middle of your content."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is very powerful, and allows you to break free from the theme boundaries. Another example could be the \u201cRelated Posts\u201d section at the end of an article. Not every blogging theme offers that option, and when they do it\u2019s not always easy to configure. With widget shortcode, you can download a separate related posts plugin, set it up separately, assign it a shortcode, and copy-paste the code at the end of your articles. Super easy."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Max Mega Menu"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Another less popular plugin (300,000 active installations) but still really convenient.

It is the cleanest, most minimalist theme you can find out there. It\u2019s mostly targeted at developers to build themes for clients.

You can literally start from a blank slate, design your pages one by one in Elementor, and have all your custom content run properly.
