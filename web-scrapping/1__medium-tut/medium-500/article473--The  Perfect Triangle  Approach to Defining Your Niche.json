And it doesn\u2019t have to come first."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But, truth be told, it\u2019s not that black and white. The bad advice is bogus, but there\u2019s still great value in being seen as a niche expert\u2014 when the strategy and timing are right."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s explore the different kinds of niches you can try to own, as well as their benefits and drawbacks. When you find the right balance between these three cornerstones of business positioning, you build the perfect niche triangle \u2014 a formula for maximising your expertise without narrowing your opportunities."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "\ud83c\udf0e Niche location"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Using location to define your niche is an age-old way to target your clientele. Before international communication (or even travel) was commonplace, you had to specialise in a location whether you liked it or not! Most businesses existed to serve only their immediate surroundings."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now, of course, we have a global economy and it\u2019s easy to work with clients and colleagues all over the world. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Specialising in a location is one of the easiest ways to find new clients and build a strong reputation. In fact \u2014 although it\u2019s counter-intuitive \u2014 I often suggest going ultra-local is the best way to start freelancing and find your first clients. Resist the pull of going global, because that comes with global competition at global (third-world) prices."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The smaller your location niche, the fewer competitors you have. The more local your work, the faster you can build a strong reputation and generate word-of-mouth referrals from your network."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Have you ever played that kid\u2019s game telephone? The shorter your message has to go, the clearer it remains. Word of mouth is the same. It\u2019s got more trust and power when it comes from a local."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I could work for clients across the world, but most of my work \u2014 by choice \u2014 is right here in my home city of Auckland. I\u2019m a remote worker, but I prefer to keep it local. The future of work is local-remote, because it means better communication and deeper trust without losing the benefits of working when and where you choose."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The downside of local work, like any narrow niche, is a limitation on your potential client pool. If you live in a city of 1 million or more, you can probably work local for your entire life and never run short of clients. If you inhabit somewhere less urban, you may need to broaden your target location \u2014 perhaps your state, region, or country."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Every niche should have a location component. It\u2019s up to you to balance the pros and cons of defining your ideal clientele by a strict location or a broad area."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc Niche service"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Another common way to define your niche is by service offering. This is natural and necessary because you want to be delivering what you\u2019re good at and you enjoy doing."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you try to offer more services than you can expertly deliver, you\u2019ll dilute your effectiveness and end up harming your reputation by missing expectations and producing sub-standard work. On the flip side, if you\u2019re a very narrow specialist who offers too few services, you may struggle to find enough demand for your work. Or even worse, your speciality could go out of style or become obsolete."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Finding your service niche is about playing to (and building on) your strengths. Choose what you\u2019re most passionate about and skilled with \u2014 your core services \u2014 and build your business around those. Never stop learning and expanding your skills, but don\u2019t veer too far from your bread and butter either, unless you\u2019re planning a major pivot."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Every business needs a support network of complementary services to give it flexibility and added lateral value. You don\u2019t want to be a specialist or a generalist, the sweet spot is being both at once: T-shaped, M-shaped, Comb-shaped, specialized generalist, deep generalist, or multi-hyphenate are all ways of describing the skillset with multiple areas of expertise supported by a broad range of general skills. This brings maximum value to your clientele and attracts the best projects."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Your definition of services is usually the most important aspect of your niche because establishing expertise is key to landing your ideal clients and building a reputation in your location. Choose a package of marketable skills that allows you to build expertise in at least 1 or 2 of them, and be very competent in all the others. Strip away anything that doesn\u2019t meet those standards."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Niche industry"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A final way you can define your niche is in the types of clients you choose to work for. Most commonly, this is specialising in an industry. You may have a passion for fashion and choose to focus your attention on retail clients. Or you have a background in travel that makes you extra valuable to tourism businesses. Or maybe you just love food, so you're drawn to working in dining and hospitality."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It could be that your skillset or style naturally aligns better with the needs of some industries more than others."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One or two successful projects in a specific industry can lead to much more similar work. Years ago I designed a very admired car rental website and for years afterwards, I received enquiries about similar projects. I found myself with a niche ripe for the taking, but I declined those jobs to avoid a conflict of interest with my long-time client."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The industry is not the only \u2014 and often not the best \u2014 way to niche down on clientele. You can define a niche by client organisation type and size. For example, specialise in working for startups (funded ones, not bootstrapped!), small owner-operated business, non-profits, or corporate clients, regardless of what field they\u2019re in."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You can even get more granular and specialise in clients that share common values or desirable attitudes. Like specialising in projects for environmentally-conscious companies, or working only with clients who display exceptional communication skills."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sometimes I define my niche as simply this: I work for good clients. It doesn\u2019t matter what industry they\u2019re in or what stage of business growth they\u2019ve achieved.

If your niche is too restrictive on all three sides, you\u2019ll likely build strong expertise and reputation in that niche but your skills are too specialised to remain flexible, and your client pool is too small to sustain you. If your niche is wide on all three sides, your potential clients are nearly infinite, but you\u2019ll find it difficult to gain mastery or reputation in any specific location or service."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The ideal niche is usually a triangle with at least one side that\u2019s narrowed in on a specialised focus, while the others stay broader to keep your client pool at a healthy size."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Keep in mind that your perfect triangle is unique. What works as a niche for you may be entirely different than what works for me, or anyone else. It\u2019s based on where you live, what you\u2019re good at, who you work with best, and what you enjoy doing. There\u2019s no universal right answer. There are no two niche triangles exactly the same.

This can be extremely harmful \u2014 hampering your business growth and personal development."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It takes trial and error to confirm the right balance of your services and clientele. That often means working for some bad ones before you realise why they\u2019re the wrong fit for you. Or stretching your craft to learn new skills until you settle on what you\u2019re strongest at. Each time your triangle is prodded and poked you adapt it for the next project. It begins as a large and liquid organic form and only solidifies into a confident shape as your career matures."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Be patient and give your niche maturation the time it deserves. If you pigeonhole yourself to early, you may find it hard to pivot later. Keep your options open until it\u2019s clear they don\u2019t serve you anymore.

There\u2019s no rule against having more than one, sometimes completely unrelated niches. Create multiple niche triangles that are each perfect for you for different reasons.

Growing multiple niches is a good way to cater to diverse skills that don\u2019t fit together but remain too valuable to throw away."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You can position yourself as a specialist for each client without having to pivot your entire business to that niche.
