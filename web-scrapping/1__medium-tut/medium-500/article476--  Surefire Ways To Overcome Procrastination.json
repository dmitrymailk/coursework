Beat those projects piling up instead."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I don\u2019t pretend to know why people procrastinate. I have my reasons, and you have yours. I can guess general terms as to what makes people put off projects \u2014 both personal and professional. I suspect we feel overwhelmed at times. I suspect we all fear failure a little bit. I\u2019ve read some productivity gurus suggest we fear success, which doesn\u2019t make sense to me."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That said, while I\u2019m not an expert on the root causes of procrastination \u2014 not even my own \u2014 over the years, I have found a number of strategies you can use to succeed in overcoming whatever is blocking you from getting things done."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "1. Tidy Your Workspace"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I live in a pretty small house with my wife, a very active three-year-old, dog, and a cat. It gets a little crowded at times. My workspace tends to collect clutter throughout the day \u2014 mail, bags from the store, used coffee cups, loose crayons, etc."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That kind of chaos does not nurture positive work energy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A quick tidying of your workspace will help you approach your project. Whether you\u2019re working at a desk, a workbench, or a kitchen, try to bring some order to it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Don\u2019t spend too much time on tidying, however. That could quickly become the new excuse you\u2019re using not to get your work done."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Straighten things up and put things in order just enough to make you feel professional and productive, then see how well that helps you get the job done."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "2. Avoid Distractions"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Turn off the TV. Yes, many people work better with background noise, but the visual element of TV is going to be an ongoing distraction you don\u2019t need."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Try music instead. Or a podcast."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Or try silence. You might be surprised to find that silence works best for you."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you live or work in a noisy environment, try headphones if you can. Or talk with those around you and explain that you need to focus, and if they could hold things down to a dull roar (or, better yet, leave) for a few hours, that would be great."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/5000/0*TIjzkWkUnBLxQBVo"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "3. Schedule Tasks"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I don\u2019t mean, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll take care of that this afternoon.\u201d I mean more like, \u201cI\u2019ll sit down and start formatting these articles at 2 pm. I\u2019ll take a break at 3:30, then work on that cover design until it\u2019s finished.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Scheduling tasks makes a to-do list more concrete. Some people try to schedule every job days in advance. I find that overscheduling only leads to frustration as life rarely goes exactly according to plan."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Instead, I will sit down at noon and schedule my afternoon. Or I\u2019ll sit down after dinner and schedule my evening\u2019s work. Short-term scheduling makes managing the to-do list more real, and it allows me to chunk up a project into different pieces and take care of them one-by-one."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This leads us to the next tip."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "4. Breakdown Large Tasks With a Select To-Do List"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I live by my to-do list, but I have to be careful about it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If I have an intimating project sitting on my to-do list and I\u2019m still avoiding it for whatever reason, that\u2019s only going to raise my anxiety and guilt."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What I\u2019ll do instead is have a select to-do list devoted to that project alone with individual steps for that project listed.

Just Do It"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I hate this advice. The \u201cno excuses\u201d attitude disregards any legitimate issues people experience when it comes to procrastination. It\u2019s the motivational equivalent of \u201cIf you\u2019re depressed, you should just go for a walk in the woods!\u201d Sure, that sounds great, but for many people, it\u2019s virtually worthless advice."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That said, I include it because it is an approach popular with some people, and I can only assume it works for them. If that\u2019s the case, I couldn\u2019t be happier."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you can look at a project that\u2019s been intimidating you for whatever reason, psyche yourself up, then launch headlong into it with a \u201cJust do it!\u201d can-do attitude, I think that\u2019s great. I know people this works for, and maybe you\u2019re one of them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s worth a try.

Buddy Up"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We\u2019re social animals. Doing projects by oneself can be harder than working near someone else who also has a project they need some motivation on.

Visualize Yourself Completing Your Project"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I admit, I almost didn\u2019t include this as it seems a little too metaphysical rather than practical. Just the same, it is a method I do on occasion when trying to beat some kind of block in tackling a project."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Certainly, it\u2019s not a step to be taken by itself, but in conjunction with these other methods. By visualizing a project\u2019s completion, you\u2019re not attaching any negative emotions or feelings to the task at hand, but approaching it from a more positive, encouraging one."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It can\u2019t hurt, right?"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "8. The Great Motivator"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Of all of these tips for beating procrastination, this is the one I find most effective when it comes to freelance work projects that get put off for one reason or another.

Sure, no one in their right mind wants to edit and format 400 pages of old radio transcripts (for example). Still, it\u2019s a job that was taken on in exchange for payment, and that payment is going to help keep the lights on and the refrigerator stocked."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When all else fails, the Great Motivator comes through."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/10618/0*PtUaQEVfEg6lzpGf"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "9.

If you\u2019re a freelancer or part of the gig economy, it\u2019s hard to turn down work. Just the same, taking on too much at once leads to overwhelm.
