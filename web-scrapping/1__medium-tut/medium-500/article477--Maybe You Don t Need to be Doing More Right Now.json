At first, this felt like something of a vacation \u2014 especially for those who have recently graduated (hello), students still in school or anyone with some extra free time due to the pandemic."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At the start, this newfound freedom was fun, enjoyable, and allowed us to get to those pesky projects or tasks we never quite had the time for. But as this period of isolation has dragged on, our stimulation with these seemingly \u2018fun\u2019 tasks has begun to wear out. As a result, we\u2019re on social media more, reading more online, consuming more, and so much of our creative thinking time is being overrun by what someone else is saying to us through our screen. And as self-improvement gurus are swooping in with advice as to how we can \u2018make the most of quarantine\u2019, we begin to plant seeds of self-doubt in our own psyche telling us we are not doing enough."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Why We Feel Inadequate"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This feeling of inadequacy is not helped by conversations with friends which start with, \u201cso what have you been working on in quarantine?\u201d rooted in the underlying assumption that we should have something to show for this time. Nor is it lightened by posts online where people are going on about new projects they\u2019re working on or secret start-ups they\u2019re building, books they\u2019re writing or podcasts they\u2019re starting. While all of this progress is fantastic and should be celebrated, the steady stream of it constantly penetrating into our lives can paralyze us into inaction. The acute awareness of others\u2019 coping methods and creative projects puts our mind in a state where our perception of ourselves is warped with comparison, and we\u2019re overthinking our lives instead of just living them. Thus, in a time where we could be doing anything, we feel too lost and overwhelmed to do anything at all."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The Paradox of Doing Nothing"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Doing nothing is perfectly OK \u2014 as long as it is coming from you and not from self-doubt or anxiety imposed on you by your environment or the content you\u2019re consuming. Wanting time \u2018off\u2019 to rest and recuperate during this time is perfectly valid. Perhaps you just finished a tough, gruelling degree and want some time to do your own thing for awhile (hello again), or maybe you just like the feeling of waking up in the morning and doing as your heart pleases with no real routine in place."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After all, when else will we be able to do that? But when the sense of days going by without anything happening makes you anxious because of what you see other people doing, that\u2019s when you need to make a change. And not necessarily to what you\u2019re doing, but to how you\u2019re perceiving it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This pandemic wasn\u2019t put in our lives so that we could attack all the goals and ideas we\u2019ve been procrastinating. If you feel a sudden surge of inspiration to do just that \u2014 fantastic, follow it. Conversely, if you feel that this time is a welcome period to recuperate and take a break from whatever was leading up to it \u2014 also fantastic, follow that feeling. Some days you may wake up and feel an urge to create or do something \u2018productive\u2019, and sometimes, you\u2019re not going to feel that urge at all. And while I believe routine is healthy, I also think trusting our intuition and not forcing ourselves to do something that\u2019s meant to be enjoyable is too."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Be Authentic First"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you want to create authentically, you can\u2019t be creating just because you saw someone post their journalling session today and feel guilty you haven\u2019t done anything of the sort yet. Creativity needs to be real. Potent. Genuine. Authentic. And it cannot be any of those things if it is purely your external environment which is telling you that you need to create something."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It needs to come from you. The reason you see people crushing it and producing things which are inspiring and awesome is because that motivation and desire to create came from them. The people trying to achieve that same sense of accomplishment by forcing themselves to be productive are much less likely to produce work which will yield the same result."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The days we try to corner ourselves into getting things done are not the days we actually get things done \u2014 especially when it comes to creativity. Those aren\u2019t the days that our ideas flow onto a page and into reality.
