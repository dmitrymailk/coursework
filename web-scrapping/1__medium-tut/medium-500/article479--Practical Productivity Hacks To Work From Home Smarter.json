I first came across the term when I attended a workshop in the City of London where Daniel Pink was promoting his new book, \u201cWhen: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing\u201d. I thought to give it a \u2018\u2018shot\u2019\u2019 and it was a.m.a.z.i.n.g! Here is how it goes:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When you feel a bit drowsy (normally after lunch) drink a cup of coffee, put your alarm for 25 minutes and take a nap. When the alarm goes off is when the caffeine takes effect and helps you wake up feeling clear-headed; it \u201cresets\u201d your biological clock and improves your cognitive performance. It sounds counter-productive, right? It is not! You will really feel more alert afterward!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u2615\ufe0f You can download the full guide here!"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "\u278b: Technology to the Rescue"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There are lots of productivity apps out there\u2026 Occasionally, well-crafted applications change the way we work.

Along with Outlook, WebEx, Excel (and the list goes on) my desktop becomes too busy, too quick. To keep my workspace organised, my two favourite apps are HazeOver and Magnet. HazeOver automatically highlights the front window by fading out all the background ones. Magnet neatly aligns multiple viewable windows into tiles.

Simply put: actively resisting the urge to eat a chocolate bar is harder than not having the chocolate at all. So instead of fighting off temptations, you remove them from your surroundings altogether; no temptations, no willpower wasted. I use Timewarp, a Chrome extension which lets you set up different redirections in case you visit an unproductive website during work. You can get redirected to a more productive site, be shown a motivational quote, or be reminded of the time you have spent on it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u2014 Media Blocking: What really puts me off when I browse the internet is Ads. Aside from being intrusive and creepy, they clutter the screen, reduce network performance, and deflect my attention, big time. Ghostery does a pretty good job eliminating them.
