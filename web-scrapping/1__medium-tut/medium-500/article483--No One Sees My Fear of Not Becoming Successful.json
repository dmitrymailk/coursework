If it wasn\u2019t for my dad coaching me in three sports and getting me out of my comfort zone, I wouldn\u2019t be the creative entrepreneur I am today."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The creative journey started when I saw YouTubers thriving and making a career out of it. My confirmation bias that I was worthy of doing work in a creative space unveiled itself in my sophomore year sports marketing class. Mr. Arcurie would offer Portillo\u2019s and Buffalo Wild Wings gift cards for the best pitch of each project we had."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In a humble fashion, I won many of these competitions simply because I had a strong eye for compelling content. Ever since then, I have worked on vlogging, blogging, and podcasting very soon. My classmates never knew I was dreadful of failing. They never knew I had anxiety through the roof when it was my time to present my idea, video, or ad campaign."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The Fear of Failing is a Ginormous Obstacle"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There\u2019s beauty and struggle that comes with being an extremely competitive individual. It\u2019s a double edged sword that tells you that you are going to be an icon one day. The sharper edge of the sword is the one that pushes you to wonder\u2026 what will people think about me if I\u2019m not successful?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s terrifying to think that my creative venture will fail. I have very few other backup plans should things go a different route. Many friends I know are afraid they won\u2019t pass their Orgo class and get their nursing degree. Many people are in the same boat, but with their stress, it\u2019s evident."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "From a creator\u2019s standpoint, we rarely ever share with our audiences how insecure we feel about whether or not our audiences like us. Are our ideas worthy? We mask our insecurities by not putting them out on the table in fear of people thinking we are incompetent."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Incompetency is a fear of mine so what I do is over-prepare. Before I started using Medium\u2019s Partner Program, I studied each and every article I could get my hands on in order to perform at a high level from the jump."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Mistakes are going to happen, we know this"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My fear of not being successful isn\u2019t blown so far out of proportion that I believe I\u2019ll be mistake-free. I\u2019ve made hundreds of mistakes!"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Many of the mistakes I\u2019ve made are relatable and that\u2019s what makes the whole experience humane. We can\u2019t be perfect all the time, but we can strive for perfection."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Imagine Living in a Different Era"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If I wasn\u2019t able to live through the current era we are in, I am not sure if I would make it. Say we were in the 1920\u2019s and we were going through the Great Depression. I know many people who lose incomes would be in deeper holes than they are right now."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I fear that if I lived during that time, I would be working at a factory and feeling little to no sense of fulfillment or purpose in the world. That\u2019s scary. The odds of becoming a human being are 400 trillion to one. We are blessed to even exist and have a chance at life. I don\u2019t want to waste it. I must be successful."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Opportunities we undermine include blogging, teaching english to students in China, delivering for UberEats, driving with Lyft, or YouTubing. Unlike back then, we can have side hustles. In other words, we can make money in ways where we are our own bosses and aren\u2019t as desperate to the big companies. In the sea of opportunities, my anxiety rises because I feel like if I can\u2019t succeed in the current era, then I am a failure."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Consuming Content of Now-Successful Journeymen and Women"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There is a light at the end of the tunnel. The internet has allowed me to consume content from great influencers such as Gary Vaynerchuk, Michael Jordan, and Russell Wilson. These gentlemen allow me to push past my insecurities."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Thanks to the great lessons I\u2019ve learned from my role models I named earlier, I have made strides. I avoided being stubborn to learn from the great writers of our time such as Tom Kuegler, Tim Denning or Ayodeji Awosika. The pioneers of online blogging have taken me under their wing and given me more advice than I could have ever imagined."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Let Fear Work for You"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019m still scared that I won\u2019t make it as a successful entrepreneur in such a competitive world. No one will ever look at me and see my insecurities the way I do. We are our biggest critics. There\u2019s no doubt about it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I know that living with this constant fear of not becoming a successful entrepreneur will stick around until I make it to where I want to be. The best thing to do is acknowledge it\u2019s there and adapt to the challenges it presents. Living in constant fear is not an option unless stagnation is what I seek, which its not."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It simply isn\u2019t worth worrying and stressing over success, but that\u2019s why I consider it to be one of my biggest invisible illnesses. Staying the course and riding the waves is a part of the journey, so I\u2019m gonna stay awhile."}], "topic": "productivity"}
