You\u2019re focused on something else. You\u2019ve made a bit of money and you\u2019ve become addicted to your stats.

Ask for advice and support and take note of what is useful."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In my case, I shared my worries with the woman who was my girlfriend and two other close friends. Their support and advice contributed a lot to me figuring out what wasn\u2019t going well. One of those was that I had almost entirely stopped seeing friends and didn\u2019t rest at all. I was close to burning out."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You cannot fix your goals just once. Our lives evolve day after day. Our goals need that too. You\u2019ll have to go through this process over and over. Don\u2019t take your goals for granted but don\u2019t think your lack of motivation or results is the end of the world either. With the right mindset and some constant tweaking, you can find the drive to improve once again. The excitement will come rushing back."}], "topic": "productivity"}
