{"title": "How To Take Control Of Your Own Upskilling", "data": [{"type": "sentence", "content": "One of my biggest life lessons over the past five years is that problems do not go away, or even get smaller all on their own. While I\u2019m not ready to further dramatise my problem person, ahem, I mean event, this is an excellent mantra to flip and apply to other, more positive things, like learning and upskilling."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you\u2019re a super wise, disciplined, focused, Yoda-guru kinda person, then you probably don\u2019t need to create learning workbooks. But for me, I\u2019m a distracted soul with more than one significant conquest to undertake."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We all learn differently; some people can visualise; some can learn directly from stories or tales; some people just know things and others will probably never learn at all. Me, I need some application, an activity to complete. I need a course workbook."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I think back to my most productive year ever; it was a while ago but still in memory. It was working full time, completing two of my final university modules part-time and writing my first play. It was a wonderful time, and the key was having no time to procrastinate because I had a syllabus of essays and tasks that I had to complete on time or fail. I had a programme of learning, except for the play which was such a new skill I was riding on pure glee. I didn\u2019t have hours to waste in between essays wondering what I should do or write."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I know how obvious this sounds but hear me out because given the number of productivity articles I still see on Medium and that I\u2019m still reading, I\u2019d say we\u2019re all pretty far from our peak state."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Last month a few sources of advice converged to convince me that I needed to write a short story a week. It was a quote by a famous writer and an episode of the filmmakers\u2019 podcast talking about the process of writing a short story every week for a whole year."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So I started and what emerged in the first month was a habit of sitting down on a Sunday afternoon and bashing out a short story; anything with an end would do, I had no criteria other than producing a short story. The first one felt satisfying and even the second one, but towards the end of the month, I had just created a habit of writing a bundle of words, not quality tales."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I looked at my process. I\u2019d created a schedule and mostly stuck to that desk arrival time but come to the first session I\u2019d sit down and think about writing for half an hour. Then an email or tweet would arrive, and I\u2019d tend to that, and similar distractions would occur across the week and then shit..it\u2019s Saturday already. I\u2019d better batter out a story by tomorrow and what was coming out was a story, but not a good one."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The problem wasn\u2019t a lack of motivation; it wasn\u2019t a lack of schedule; it was invasive procrastination because I didn\u2019t know what to write. I needed more purpose and definition for my weekly short story task."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019m not short of ideas, but my 2020 brain will latch on to any excuse to move my focus onto something simple. I thought back to my incredible part-time degree and regular assignments."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That\u2019s what I needed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So I created a course of my own to drive productivity and improvement. It didn\u2019t take much effort to develop or too much time to make, and it feels like it\u2019s working. I\u2019m hitting my assignments, improving my craft and building a more organic process of actual improvement."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I recommend creating a course for any new skill you are undertaking, or for a process of improvement that isn\u2019t under the guidance of a tutor or mentor, and there\u2019s a bonus piece of advice at the end about sharing it to the world."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Here are the steps I took to create my course workbook. Again, it\u2019s all obvious stuff but allocating the time to create your own learning programme is the quickest way to start improving."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Step 1 \u2014 Define Your Why"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It is knowing or remembering your why when undertaking learning is critical, especially where self-learning. In a boisterous world, only things that feed into a robust higher objective will survive the noise. I\u2019ve got bills to pay and galaxies to explore otherwise and the \u201cnice to have\u2019s\u201d need to be core essentials."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The reasons I started my course was to improve my fiction writing so that I can write my great novel. I don\u2019t want to write a novel; i want to write an amazing novel. I\u2019ve written plays and scripts, but I want to improve my descriptive prose, and by writing short stories, I\u2019ll be able to practice and improve these skills."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Step 2 \u2014 Decide On Your Length/Frequency"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Set the length of your programme and the frequency at which you can produce your output. Basically, how quickly do you want to learn and what time do you have available."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I like twelve for a course length, three months. It\u2019s a reasonable amount of time to create a habit and see measurable progress at the end. A short story a week is achievable yet ambitious. That\u2019s the sweet spot you should look for; it needs to be the right size of a challenge for you to complete."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You can also think in terms of your endgame of output. The idea of having 12 short stories in my bank often keeps me moving forward. Maybe monthly is better for you or a year rather than 12 weeks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Just write something down; you can always change it afterwards."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Step 3 \u2014 Set Your Learning objectives"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "List your objectives for the course and allocate one per week or month, whatever frequency you can undertake. If you know them, that is."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My course is less about learning particular skills and more about just creating regular tasks so I can focus on improvement and reduce procrastination."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Step 4 \u2014 Content."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Yay \u2014 this is the fun bit. Can you map out 12 tasks that represent a challenge but something achievable? Mine came in the form of different types or themes for a short story."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Have a quick read through online courses or some of your craft books if you need ideas."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For example, in the first week, I created a task to write a story that included a force of nature, the week after was a theme etc. etc."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Step 5 \u2014 Formalise it"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Write up your course material. Maybe it\u2019s a word document or if you\u2019d like something fancier you could use a design tool such as Canva although if it is just for you don\u2019t spend too much time perfecting it. The objective is to give it a level of authority beyond scribbling own a few notes in your diary."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ve created my course on Convertkit, which is a CRM for creators. It\u2019s so easy to produce a weekly lesson on there via sequences and set yourself up for a weekly email. If you haven\u2019t used it before they run helpful tutorials and you can set up a free account for up to 2000 subscribers. You can share it, see below, or just set up the automations to be emailed to you."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Step 6 \u2014 Publish it"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Be brave if you dare and publish it, you might get a few joiners along the road and learning is more fun when it\u2019s a group activity."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ve given my course a name. It\u2019s called On The Road, and there\u2019s a link to sign up in my profile. It\u2019s a free course because I\u2019m learning myself and not in a position to teach. Making it an actual course has encouraged me to create material that is beyond a written task."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The content not only includes a task but a couple of examples and references, and it\u2019s expanding the overall learning experience through reading and research."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Honestly, it\u2019s taken me longer to write this blog than it took me to create the first few weeks of content, and I\u2019ve got three short stories already, and each one represents an improvement on the last. It\u2019s even affecting my screenwriting positively."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Do it and if you\u2019re a mischievous spirit such as me when have you ever been teacher\u2019s pet before in your life?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you enjoyed this story, sign up to my weekly newsletter to read more like it.
