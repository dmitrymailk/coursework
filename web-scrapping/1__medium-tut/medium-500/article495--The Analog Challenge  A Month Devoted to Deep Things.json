And given that I\u2019ve recently opened up my own law firm, it\u2019s a perfect time to carve out a new work routine concentrated on deep work.

Because we do other activities together like play board games and go for evening walks with our dog, the hour that we spend passively watching a light-hearted show doesn\u2019t concern me.
