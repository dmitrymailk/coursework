The more interruptions one has, the more they erode the self-regulation equipment. Feel like you have to check your e-mail even though you just checked it five minutes ago?

Instead of interrupting one another with questions, Yesware employees send messages via a HipChat.com intranet page that colleagues can review on their own time, when they have a break in the action.

If your e-mail automatically checks and feeds you messages every five minutes, that\u2019s a potential of 96 interruptions over an eight-hour day.

After a period of investigation, Perlow discovered that the engineers were being interrupted so often they didn\u2019t have time to think and couldn\u2019t get enough done during regular hours.
