{"title": "The Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs)", "data": [{"type": "sentence", "content": "A recurrent neural network (RNN) is an input node (hidden layer) that feeds sigmoid activation. The way an RNN does this is to take the output of one neuron and return it as input to another neuron or feed the input of the current time step to the output of earlier time steps. Here you feed the input from the previous times step by step into the input of the current times and vice versa."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/8000/0*3o4OHDM_jsNiKwZ-"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This can be used in a variety of ways, such as through learning gates with known variations or a combination of sigmoid activation and a number of other types of neural networks."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Some of the applications for RNNs include predicting energy demand, predicting stock prices, and predicting human behavior.
