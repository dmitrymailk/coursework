For example, does stupidity imply the lack of intelligence in a zero-sum fashion, or does stupidity occupy its own space and sit adjacent to intelligence as a parallel equal?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s do a thought experiment on this weighty matter."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Suppose we somehow had a bucket filled with intelligence. We are going to pretend that intelligence is akin to something tangible and that we can essentially pour it into and possibly out of a bucket that we happen to have handy. Upon pouring this bucket filled with intelligence onto say the floor, what do you have left?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One answer is that the bucket is now entirely empty and there is nothing left inside the bucket at all. The bucket has become vacuous and contains absolutely nothing. Another answer is that the bucket upon being emptied of intelligence has a leftover that consists of stupidity. In other words, once you\u2019ve removed so-called intelligence, the thing that you have remaining is stupidity."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I realize this is a seemingly esoteric discussion but, in a moment, you\u2019ll see that the point being made has a rather significant ramification for many important things, including and particularly for the development and rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Can intelligence exist without stupidity, or in a practical sense is there always some amount of stupidity that must exist if there is also the existence of stupidity?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Some assert that intelligence and stupidity are Zen-like yin and yang. In this perspective, you cannot grasp the nature of intelligence unless you also have a semblance of stupidity as a kind of measuring stick."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It is said that humans become increasingly intelligent over time, and thus are reducing their levels of stupidity. You might suggest that intelligence and stupidity are playing a zero-sum game, namely that as your intelligence rises you are simultaneously reducing your level of stupidity (similarly, if your stupidity rises, this implies that your intelligence lowers)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Can humans arrive at a 100% intelligence and a zero amount of stupidity, or are we fated to always have some amount of stupidity, no matter how hard we might try to become fully intelligent?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Returning to the bucket metaphor, some would claim that there will never be the case that you are completely and exclusively intelligent and have expunged stupidity. There will always be some amount of stupidity that\u2019s sitting in that bucket."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you are clever and try hard, you might be able to narrow down how much stupidity you have, though there is still some amount of stupidity in that bucket."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Does having stupidity help intelligence or is it harmful to intelligence?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You might be tempted to assume that any amount of stupidity is a bad thing and therefore we must always be striving to keep it caged or otherwise avoid its appearance. But we need to ask whether that simplistic view of tossing stupidity into the \u201cbad\u201d category and placing intelligence into the \u201cgood\u201d category is potentially missing something more complex. You could argue that by being stupid, at times, in limited ways, doing so offers a means for intelligence to get even better."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When you were a child, suppose you stupidly tripped over your own feet, and after doing so, you came to the realization that you were not carefully lifting your feet. Henceforth, you became more mindful of how to walk and thus became intelligent at the act of walking. Maybe later in life, while walking on a thin curb, you managed to save yourself from falling off the edge of the curb, partially due to the earlier in life lesson that was sparked by stupidity and became part of your intelligence."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Of course, stupidity can also get us into trouble."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Despite having learned via stupidity to be careful as you walk, one day you decide to strut on the edge of the Grand Canyon.

There is controversy underlying this, but I won\u2019t go into that herein.
