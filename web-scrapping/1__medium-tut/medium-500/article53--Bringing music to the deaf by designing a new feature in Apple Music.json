Any creative knows that more freedom equals difficulty."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And so I was frustrated scrolling through the world of the Internet for an interesting topic that I also cared about, until I watched this:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This video features Amber Galloway Gallego, an American Sign Language(ASL) interpreter, who translates all the elements of a song (lyrics, instruments, beats, and most importantly, the feel) into ASL. Each ASL music interpreter does so differently, making the music-listening experience more fun and visceral for the deaf and hard of hearing."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After the video ended, I googled right away and found out that there are 466 million people in the world with a disabling hearing loss. Instantly, I had a problem and an insight."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But I didn\u2019t know where to begin. I didn\u2019t personally know anyone who is deaf or hard of hearing nor had I ever met one in my life. All I knew was that I wanted to design something that would translate songs into visuals but had a limited time frame and resources. So I started with what I could learn online."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019d like to walk you through my story in three parts which are:"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "1. Research"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Competitor Analysis"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One of my goals for this project was to influence the daily music-listening experience of my target audience. I hoped to make the experience more fun and less discriminative so that people immerse themselves whenever they want to, wherever they are. To achieve this, it was imperative that I design for mobile; so I first checked what\u2019s currently out there."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There is an overflowing number of music apps. But for the deaf community? Only a few exist. I was disappointed in this noninclusive reality and became more assertive about the need of a solution. I believed that the apps that already exist have room for improvement in both experience and visual design."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Additionally, I learned that some apps can examine your hearing ability by playing tones that range from low to high and asking you to press the button whenever you hear the tone. By providing detailed results about both ears, they inform the users about their own hearing ability. This inspired me to incorporate a similar function into my solution."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "User Research"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To verify that visuals actually help people understand the context of music, I conducted a survey, asking people if they think they\u2019ll feel more connected to music if they visually saw it. I asked 25 people and:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, there were two big problems with my survey that made the results unreliable and unrepresentative of my target audience:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I had to find a way to talk to my actual target audience. I visited one of the ASL schools here in New York with a hope to talk to the students but I needed to go through some steps (i.e. talk to the principal, the teachers, etc.)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Although I\u2019d have loved to, the time I had for this project didn\u2019t allow me to.

It totally makes sense because it\u2019s up to you to learn a whole new language- but I was surprised at my own ignorance. That\u2019s why I added an option to \u2018Watch the Lyrics,\u2019 especially for those who aren\u2019t familiar with ASL."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Watch the case study to better understand:"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Looking Back."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The biggest challenge I faced was thinking about improvements without making it too different.
