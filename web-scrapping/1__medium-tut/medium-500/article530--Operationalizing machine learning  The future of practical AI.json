The Internet has become less of an entertainment and more of a utility, reaching 4.9 billion people, according to a study by Domo. Apps are increasingly popular. This has resulted in data \u2014 something that used to be considered more of an exhaust product than a resource \u2014 growing geometrically. Jim Short, lead scientist at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, estimates a data growth rate of 40 percent per year."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Now that most enterprise professionals consider data a resource \u2014 one that can make the difference between success and failure \u2014 they are willing to experiment with processes like MLOps in the hopes of leveraging that data for business gain."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You can use machine learning on small datasets, says Cinquegrana. \u201cBut really, you start seeing a lot of improvements when you have lots of data and you can put things in production, and so this goal has become much more attainable by enterprises.\u201d"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "MLOps lifecycle"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "An interesting element of MLOps is that its lifecycle is split between two very different user groups with two different jobs: data scientists, who create machine learning models and derive insights from their use on big data; and software engineers, whose primary concern is implementing and running the technology for the company as a whole and for whom it is more of an engineering function."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cThere are discrepancies or differences between the production environment and the development environment,\u201d notes Raza.

Some 60 percent of all ML models across the enterprise have been built but not operationalized, due to a lack of implementation tools."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So, to make MLOps more practical and more utilitarian across enterprises, several improvements need to be made. First, according to Cinquegrana, companies need good data infrastructure and, on top of that, good ML infrastructure."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As noted, the tools that allow for the creation of these infrastructures are complex and numerous. But according to Maccaux, a company\u2019s IT department cannot be the gatekeeper of these tools without also becoming the bottleneck for those who need to have free access to them. So MLOps will need a ready toolkit with maximum utility, ease of use, and security."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "On the other hand, data scientists can also be bottlenecks, notes Cinquegrana. A practical and effective MLOps solution will provide data scientists flexibility of choice when it comes to ML tools and frameworks but also ensure certain process are followed to ensure collaboration."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At its most efficient and effective, says Raza, \u201cMLOps must enable enterprises to standardize the machine learning lifecycle while providing users with the flexibility to deploy their machine learning applications across their choice of infrastructure \u2014 either on premises, in multiple clouds, or at the edge \u2014 while also maintaining enterprise-grade security and governance.\u201d"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "MLOps future"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cMachine learning and MLOps are both resident in an emerging space, and everything is changing rapidly,\u201d says Maccaux. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool space to be in.
