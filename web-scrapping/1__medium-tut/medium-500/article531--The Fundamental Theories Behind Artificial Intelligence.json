Sometime in the last decade, I\u2019m not sure when exactly the tipping point was, the tech world started to truly blur the line between science fiction and reality. Cars learned to drive themselves, robots began delivering takeout food, watches began resembling a James Bond toy, and virtual home assistants sat ready to answer any question that we could dream up."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The implications of artificial intelligence have been both rapid and massive, to say the least, but how did it get to where it is now?

In August of 1955, John McCarthy (Dartmouth), Marvin Lee Minsky (Harvard), Nathaniel Rochester (IBM), and Claude Elwood Shannon (Bell Telephone Laboratories) completed \u201cA Proposal For The Dartmouth Summer Research Project On Artificial Intelligence,\u201d officially coining this term and lighting the first spark of what we know as AI today."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The proposal outlines what these four saw as the problems standing in the way of advancements, their relevant experience thus far, and expectations of the research project. The founding four believed that all in all, they could make \u201csignificant advancements\u201d in two months, with the right ten people in the room, and a whopping $13,500. The vision for the summer was described as such:"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The Roadblocks"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In order to understand the design of the research project, we must first understand what problems it was designed to solve and accomplishments it was designed to achieve (bear with me \u2014 we need some context to understand anything further, but I will make it as painless as possible).

Others, though, feed all of that data \u2014 every mouse click, every video watched, the length of time the video was watched, where I went next after the video was over, etc. etc. \u2014 into these algorithms.

It takes incredible computing power to be able to run the machine learning algorithms needed for artificial intelligence. Some people don\u2019t realize this, but computing power is a significant source of the limits in technology. For instance, modern password guidelines and encryption are only secure because we don\u2019t have computers that are capable of brute force hacking them (yet).

The more that a machine gets, the smarter it becomes \u2014 the more refined its knowledge is and the more accurate its predictions are. Everything that we think of when we think of AI, whether it's talking to our Google Home or getting creeped out upon seeing an advertisement for that thing you were thinking about this morning, is born out of analyzing data sets that are so massive, they can guess how to successfully interact with you.

What I will say is that we have only just begun to see its effects on our world, and while the risks are insignificant if Google gets my Spotify request wrong, it\u2019s quite a different story when we start talking about medical advice, financial handlings, teaching, and more. In addition, the fight for more data privacy is full-steam ahead, and a consistent influx of data is essential for further advancements. As the algorithms and computers advance, they will be able to do more with less. But still, they need their fuel."}], "topic": "artificial-intelligence"}
