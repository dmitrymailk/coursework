{"title": "Four Mindsets Every Startup Founder Should Have", "data": [{"type": "subtitle", "content": "A journey of a thousand miles begins with the right mindset"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We talk a lot about technology, and its ability to transform and improve the world. But technology is more than just transistors and algorithms. Those are just patterns on silicon. The technology that really drives the world is the patterns in your head."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Those are the patterns that give rise to the patterns in silicon, the patterns in our society, and our whole concept of reality. Change those patterns, and you change your world. Maybe not overnight, but like steering the rudder on a great ship, a small change now makes a big difference later."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Abolish established thinking"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We think we know better. We think we know that an idea or business will work or not. This is one reason that naive, young founders are often the ones who start the most successful companies \u2014 they just don\u2019t know any better, and they\u2019re often too arrogant to listen to those who do."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I don\u2019t want to downplay the value of experience. This whole event is about sharing and learning from the experiences of others. But don\u2019t be limited by our experiences. Just because it didn\u2019t work in the past doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work in the future. Likewise, what worked before may not work again."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This is especially important for startup founders. The best opportunities live in our collective blind spots. To most, they appear to be bad ideas, or simply unimportant. If everyone could see the opportunity, someone else would have already taken it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In 1997, Larry and Sergey tried to sell Google for a million dollars. Fortunately, they were unable to find a buyer. The conventional wisdom of the time was that search was neither important, nor valuable."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Of course, the experience isn\u2019t the only danger. Dogma and ideology are even worse. They provide us with the answers, and put boundaries around our thinking. Ignoring the dogma invites ridicule or even punishment. I suspect that\u2019s why more ideological societies are less innovative. If we aren\u2019t free to wander outside the realms of conventional thinking, then we won\u2019t happen upon the opportunities that others have missed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Escaping dogma is hard. From the inside, it simply looks like truth and reality. Watch out for any belief that limits the range of your thinking and exploration. This includes logic and reason. They are useful tools, but just as often work to keep us trapped inside of exclusionary belief systems. If you believe yourself to be a rational person, then you\u2019re in the trap."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Kill all daemon processes"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For those of you who aren\u2019t familiar with operating system internals, daemons are computer programs that run in the background performing various services, often invisible to the user. Sometimes they get out of control and start consuming all of the machine\u2019s memory, processor, or other computing resources. This is one reason why your computer or phone often works better after a reboot."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I like using this as an analogy for the same kinds of loops that operate in our brains, like when a song gets stuck in your head. The more insidious loops are the voices of doubt, anger, and self-loathing that infect our minds. Often they are the internalized voices of our parents, peers, the media, or just random people on the Internet. Other times, they pose as our own voice, possibly one that has been there for as long as we can remember. Either way, these loops are often parasitic and limiting. Anytime we take a risk or move in a new direction, they are there to doubt and criticize us. Anytime we seek to escape dogma, they are there to ridicule and condemn us."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Creating an innovative new product often means spending years working on something that most people doubt the value of. It\u2019s hard to do that with a head full of noise, voices telling us that we\u2019re being foolish and should just cut our losses."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Choose an interesting path"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "There was once a startup called Justin.tv in early 2007. Their plan initially was for Justin Kan to attach a camera to his head and stream it live on the Internet 24 hours for each and every day. The idea seemed a little insane but at the same time it was interesting to find out what would happen."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The answer? There was quite a lot of hype and people were constantly trolling Justin. Next, they added the ability for anyone to stream their lives. Most of it was either boring, or possibly illegal but there was one section that really caught on; video game streaming. Eventually they changed their name to Twitch.tv and focused exclusively on video game streaming."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Interestingness is a sign of unexplored or under-explored territory. If you already know what the outcome is going to be, that\u2019s not very interesting. If it\u2019s completely random, like gambling, that\u2019s also not interesting."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Regardless of whether they succeed or fail, the founders are likely to learn something interesting."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Love what you do"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s tragic how many people are sacrificing their lives on some startup that they don\u2019t really care about, in pursuit of some external success they\u2019ll likely never achieve."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s often said that you should \u201cDo what you love\u201d, but that\u2019s mostly bad advice. It encourages people to grind away their lives in pursuit of some mostly unattainable goal, such as being a movie star or a billionaire startup founder. And even if they do make it, often the reality is nothing like they imagined it would be, so they\u2019re still unhappy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Do what you love is in the future. Love what you do is right now. As with the other mindsets, it\u2019s meant to guide the small decisions that we make every moment of every day. It\u2019s less about changing what you do, and more about changing how you do it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Real work always seems to involve a certain amount of unpleasantness, and startups often have a lot of it. It\u2019s like having a baby. It\u2019s 5% cute, adorable moments, and 95% dirty diapers and vomit. The key to loving these more unpleasant moments is meaning. If we genuinely care about and believe in our mission, then those difficult times begin to take on a more heroic quality."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Although it\u2019s critical for a startup to have very immediate and actionable plans, such as writing code and talking to users, I believe it\u2019s also important to maintain a meaningful and inspiring vision."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Last words"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We often talk about how brilliant or visionary Steve Jobs was, but there are probably millions of people just as brilliant as he was. The difference is that they likely didn\u2019t grow up with great parents, amazing teachers, and an environment where innovation was the norm. Also they didn\u2019t live down the street from Steve Wozniak."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Economically, we don\u2019t need more jobs. We need more Steve Jobs. When we set everyone free, we enable outliers everywhere. The result will be an unprecedented boom in human creativity and ingenuity."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As founders, we must start small, and work with the grain of what is. The path is never obvious, and innovation happens in the most unexpected ways. The personal computer was originally dismissed as a toy. If you think Instagram is just a collection of photo filters, you\u2019re missing the big picture. Maybe photo sharing won\u2019t lead directly to world peace, but helping people to see the world through the eyes of others looks like a step in the right direction to me. And they grew to over 200 million users in less than four years. That\u2019s larger than most countries. That\u2019s the power of a startup."}], "topic": "startups"}
