While there are a lot of articles out there that name the different types of bias, I\u2019ve noticed that few of them give practice advice on how to prevent bias from influencing survey results, so that\u2019s what this article is intended to do."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Survey bias is the tendency for survey participants to respond inaccurately or not-exactly-truthfully to questions, often (but not always) unintentionally. There are lots of ways that bias can creep into surveys, some of which can be controlled by following best practices and some of which cannot. You can control the degree of bias in your survey by making considered choices about who you survey, how you survey them, and how you design your survey questions. Since this article is part of a series about writing surveys (see the first article here), I\u2019ll focus on the types of bias that can be controlled through well-designed survey questions."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Rule #1: Be Switzerland"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One of the most straightforward ways of preventing survey bias is to keep your question wording neutral. Be Switzerland."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Often, in an attempt to inject excitement into surveys, we accidentally nudge participants in a particular direction. While it is important for survey questions to feel human and friendly, this should not be done at the expense of high quality results. Try to keep question wording neutral and only provide the information participants will need to answer them."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Here are some examples of questions that could create bias, and how to fix them:"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*ldo4z2UIL7JrechA"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Rule #2: Mind Your Answer Scales"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If the first way to prevent bias in surveys is by keeping your questions neutral, the second way is by keeping your answer scales neutral (or, at least, balanced). You want to make sure that your scales give as much weight to the positive side as the negative side, so that your participants will have an option available to them, regardless of their experience."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Here\u2019s an example of what *not* to do that we at UserLeap recently came across on a very popular video streaming platform:"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/4000/0*e3xM5Qz_q53Agwyg.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Setting aside the strangeness of the question (has *anyone* ever had an \u2018absolutely outstanding\u2019 experience with an advertisement?), the answer scale is extremely unbalanced, with 4 answer choices framed in the positive, and only 1 framed negatively. If you\u2019re looking to put your thumb on the scale for your report back to leadership, then this might be a way to do it (haha, but really: don\u2019t). However, if you want to accurately gauge the user experience, this is a terrible method of doing so."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In this case, a more traditional scale would look one of two ways:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To take a more typical example, if you were creating a scale for users to respond to a question about how satisfied they are with your product or service, your scale options would look like this"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2896/0*4ldBPBr5e0srCu00.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Both bi-polar and unipolar scales are acceptable, so it\u2019s really up to you to choose which version to use. The one key to this is to use the same type of scale consistently throughout your survey (as much as possible)."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Rule #3: Keep Your Cards Close to Your Vest"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Another way we can unintentionally bias survey questions is by being a little *too* straightforward about what we want to learn. It\u2019s important to provide users with enough context to answer your questions, but beyond that, the less they know about your intentions, the better. This is true for any survey question, but it\u2019s especially relevant in two cases:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "(a) for screener questions (questions you ask at the beginning of a survey to determine what questions to show later on, or whether someone qualifies for the full survey), and"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "(b) for surveys where you are offering participants an incentive for responding (which could encourage them to try to game the system to make sure they qualify)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A simple example of how bias can creep in by providing information is a basic awareness question. Maybe you want to know whether users are aware of a particular feature your product offers, so you ask them a simple yes/no question: \u201cAre you aware that UserLeap automatically analyzes open-text responses for you?\u201d On the surface, there\u2019s nothing obviously wrong with this question, but if this is the first question in your survey, you\u2019ve probably biased the responses."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Why? Since you\u2019ve called out this one specific feature, you\u2019re likely to end up with a sample that over-represents people who are either familiar with the feature or interested in it. Others are more likely to assume the survey isn\u2019t relevant to them and move on without answering. The consequence is that you\u2019ll probably end up with inflated awareness numbers, and a more positive picture of user sentiment about this feature than a more representative sample would provide (i.e., you\u2019re not just biasing the results to this one question, but likely skewing the overall participant pool and biasing the rest of your results as well)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The solution to this problem is called \u2018blinding,\u2019 and simply requires you to ask about participants\u2019 awareness of several features without giving away which one(s) you are really interested in until later in the survey. In this case, you might ask, \u201cWhich of these UserLeap features are you aware of? Select all that apply.\u201d (Automated open text analysis, In-product surveys, Survey template gallery, Event-based survey targeting, None of these). By asking the question this way, you\u2019ll probably get lower (and likely more realistic) awareness numbers, and your responses to other questions will be more in line with your overall user base than if you had moved ahead without blinding your question."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2896/0*DPWzokIpBOIuoOK8.png"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Rule #4: Be mindful of question order"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The order you ask your questions can have an effect on the responses to your survey, either by giving participants information they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had or prompting them to shift their mindset."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For example, let\u2019s say you want to know how people rate your product and what can be improved about it. If you ask them what you can do to improve before you ask for their ratings, you are likely to get lower ratings, because you\u2019ve just prompted users to think about all the things they don\u2019t like about your product. The same would be true in the opposite scenario: if you ask customers what they like best about your product before asking them to rate it, you\u2019re going to get better ratings."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To prevent bias from question order, use a funnel approach, in which you ask any general/overall questions first before digging into the details with more specific questions. It\u2019s also helpful to do a full review once you\u2019ve completed your survey and consider whether questions at the beginning could bias questions later on."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2528/0*QnJ815QdNfZwwwT-.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sometimes you\u2019ll find that whatever order you choose, you\u2019re risking biasing some questions with other questions. In that situation, prioritize your most critical questions first in survey order, and move lower priority questions to later in your survey.

For this reason, a key step when drafting surveys is trying to figure out whether you\u2019ve injected your own bias into your survey, and if so, removing it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "How do you do this? It can be difficult to simply stop what you\u2019re doing and identify your biases, but it gets a little easier once you\u2019ve got something down on paper. Take a look at each question you\u2019ve written and ask yourself whether it\u2019s making any assumptions or taking anything for granted."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For example, maybe you have a few potential new product features in mind and you want to know which to build first. You write the question, \u201cWhich of the following features would be most valuable to you? (a \u2018Favorites\u2019 option to keep track of items you love, a \u2018Save for Later\u2019 option in your shopping cart, a \u2018Share\u2019 option that lets you share items with others)\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Notice any assumptions? Unless you have data from another source (which is entirely possible), you\u2019ve assumed that at least some of these features would be valuable to users. But what if none of them are?
