{"title": "The Complete Guide to Nailing Customer Feedback", "data": [{"type": "sentence", "content": "By far, the top reason startups fail is lack of market need (42% of the cases). Many startups are founded based on unique technologies, or on problems that are interesting to solve, but don\u2019t necessarily answer a real market need. Understanding what market you are serving, and the problem you are addressing is key. The basis for that is early, continuous feedback from the right people who fit the early adopter profile."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Collecting customer feedback when you already have customers is a struggle on its own; however getting the first critical and actionable feedback needed to shape an MVP is significantly more complex.

That something needs feedback in order to be built."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*5yIGzJYHmmBQnzgntGaUoA.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In this post I am going to tackle few questions critical to succeed in getting meaningful product feedback:"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "How do you know whether you have a feedback problem?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Too frequently, companies only realize they have this problem when it is very late in the game- they have invested a lot of engineering work into a product that no one wants to buy."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Recently, I worked with a startup who had just launched their product. Engineering had an endless list of features that were all urgent and had to be implemented in order to close specific deals. However, every time one of these features was released, this didn\u2019t result in a sale, and they kept getting surprised. While these prospects liked the idea behind the product, it didn\u2019t actually address a real problem for them. This resulted in tactical, usability features that the prospect asked for (for example role based access control), but did not magically transform the product into one that actually answered the prospect\u2019s (or any other company\u2019s) business need."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Luckily, there is a common cause to all of these problems and a treatment for it."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "What is the most common cause?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The common problem underlying all of these symptoms is that you are NOT talking to your \u201cearly adopters\u201d- a small group of early, visionary customers, who represent your initial target market, and will guide your learnings and product features until you find a profitable business model.
