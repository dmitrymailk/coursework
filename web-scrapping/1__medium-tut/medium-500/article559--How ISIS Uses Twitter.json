Since then, the monitoring and prevention of ISIS influence have been a key goal of the United States and others."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Over the years ISIS has been using social networks to spread its message and recruit advocates for its cause. From pro-ISIS content to graphic materials such as executions, the use of the internet has been a prime tool of the terrorist group.

The graph will visualize connections between accounts through mentions. Twitter mentions are embedded in the text of a tweet using the @ symbol followed by a user\u2019s username. In order to generate the node and edge lists a Python script was used to extract mentions from a tweet and create edges between the user who tweeted and the mentioned user. Both the node and edge list were then fed into the network graphing program Gephi for analysis."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Analysis"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The node and edges lists were fed into Gephi to generate a graph.
