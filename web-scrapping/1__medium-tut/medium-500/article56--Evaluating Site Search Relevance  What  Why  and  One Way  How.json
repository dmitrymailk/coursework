(It\u2019s a mouthful to say. I\u2019ll grant you that.) But the practice doesn\u2019t have to be a headache."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you\u2019re willing to take a granular, term-by-term, hands-on approach, this evaluation method offers a low-budget, generally low-tech way to identify high-impact problems. The process has also given me more insight into users\u2019 experiences and increased my familiarity with my clients\u2019 products and web offerings."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "(Note: This method is oriented towards the obstacles and goals of e-commerce websites. That\u2019s the primary context in which I\u2019ve used it. But it is applicable to other types of websites as well.)"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "What do I mean by site search relevance evaluation?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A site search relevance evaluation is the process of assessing whether your site\u2019s search engine is showing users the items that they expect, want, and need to see."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Think of the search functionality on your website or websites you use. Picture that little search box, maybe in the upper corner, often with a magnifying glass button by it. A site search relevance evaluation focuses on what happens when users \u2014 perhaps optimistically \u2014 interact with that little box."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s take the example of an online home goods store. If someone searches for \u201cpink shower curtain,\u201d does the results page show all the pink shower curtains that the store offers? If so, the results are very relevant. Now let\u2019s imagine that the search results page displays a variety of curtains \u2014 pink window curtains along with pink shower curtains. In other words, the results are much less relevant on average, possibly causing annoyance among users."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Why do this kind of site search relevance evaluation?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You might be thinking, \u201cCouldn\u2019t I just look at the metrics? Or buy a smarter search add-on to show more relevant results automatically?\u201d Well, of course you could! Those options aren\u2019t mutually exclusive with evaluating site search relevance."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Here are a few reasons to do a site search evaluation term by term:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A quick caveat: this kind of evaluation is not a substitute for moderated UX testing. If you can run sessions and watch prospective customers search for items on your website \u2014 or hire a consultant to do that \u2014 I definitely recommend it. You will learn things that you couldn\u2019t anticipate by doing this relevance analysis alone. It\u2019s a \u201cbetter together\u201d situation. A site search relevance evaluation and UX testing can complement each other beautifully."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "How to do this kind of evaluation?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It depends on the website, but I generally break the process down into 4 main steps."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "What if the problem isn\u2019t exactly relevance?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As you evaluate the relevance of search results, some overlapping issues may arise. (Trust me, this isn\u2019t a totally bad thing. After all, if you\u2019ve got a cavity in your tooth, you want a dentist to catch it before you need a root canal.) Here are a few patterns and problems related to relevance that point to a more complex situation."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Are you seeing a lot of oddly broad search terms? If you have an online clothing store and tens of thousands of users a month search for something as broad as \u201cwomen\u2019s clothes\u201d or even \u201cdress,\u201d that\u2019s worth investigating. Your navigation may not be as intuitive as you need it to be. Even if the search results for \u201cdress\u201d are fairly relevant, those results won\u2019t solve a potential problem."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Next step: Look into possible navigation issues. Watch session replays through a service like HotJar or Fullstory. Consider conducting moderated UX testing with a focus on navigation and search."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Are users searching for content that isn\u2019t included in the site search? Many e-commerce websites\u2019 internal search engines only include products. But are your users searching for something other than products? Jared Spool gives the example of a woman who couldn\u2019t find a company\u2019s return policy to illustrate the point that a narrow view of \u201ccontent\u201d can get you in trouble when it comes to in-site search."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Next step: Tag or index those items, pages, or resources that users are searching for so that they will show up in the site search."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Are people looking for something that you don\u2019t currently offer? You might get hundreds of searches a week for a product you don\u2019t have or a resource you haven\u2019t yet developed. In other words, doing site relevance evaluation could help you identify opportunities for growth."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Next step: Consider filling the gap in what you offer. Or, if that\u2019s not applicable, recommend similar products or resources. \u201cWe don\u2019t currently offer {product X}. But we think {product Y} might help.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As these issues suggest, evaluating site search relevance is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to the overall picture of site search usability. I recommend reading Baymard Institute\u2019s search-related reports and the Nielsen Norman Group\u2019s report on site search (or this highlights article), which have helped me in the past."}], "topic": "ux"}
