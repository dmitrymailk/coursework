I love to see people enjoy the process of learning and share whatever they got along the way. But in the most recent time, I can literally feel that the academic atmosphere has been more impetuous than ever. People prefer to take short term courses, get some plausible certifications, and have fancy titles on their resumes rather than spend years to really get a degree, do in-depth research, and gain some meaningful experience. And it BOTHERS me."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Knowledge is cheap, but the experience is not"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*mHcwZcatUxYqO1Dq"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the past few years, the hottest college major has switched to Business Analytics from Computer Science.

I can see the ads with the title of \u201clearning data science within \u2026\u201d at least three times a day. To draw more users, those institutes tend to give a considerable discount.
