Drug development requires high investments that come with high uncertainty because we need to logically prove the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates before being freely administered in humans. Thus, pharmaceutical companies need to find a way through society\u2019s health needs, international legal frameworks, and business motivations to succeed."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is the official regulator that directs drug development and decides whether to authorize marketing a new drug in Europe or not. In their webpage, they store information on every approved medicine and its corresponding marketing authorization holder (MAH) company."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "To better understand the strategies implemented by successful European biotech companies and the EMA to keep developing new useful pharmaceuticals, I performed an exploratory analysis using information that I had previously scraped from EMA\u2019s webpage on their 1222 drugs."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "EMA\u2019s effective advocacy of orphan drug development"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/3600/1*wOVlCD80N9Sz_YDxSI7bXQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "According to the EMA, a drug acquires the \u201corphan designation\u201d status when it is \u201cintended for use against a rare condition\u201d. Unfortunately, due to the small number of people that suffer from these diseases, they are likely to be disregarded as they represent a small market. In 2000, the EMA established a series of incentives (see regulations) for those companies who endeavour to develop orphan drugs giving an economic interest to those therapeutic areas with a high risk of being neglected. Basically, they offer a special treatment that speeds up the bureaucratic part of the process and cuts down its overall cost. Indeed, we immediately see the effectiveness of this policy as the number of approved orphan drugs has steadily increased since then. Obviously, we cannot see how many equivalent-to-orphan drugs had been approved before their definition but the trend seems clear."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Complex and prevalent diseases retain pharma\u2019s interest"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "From the 414 different therapeutic areas for which the EMA has granted marketing authorizations, almost 20% of the approved drugs try to tackle only the 9 diseases listed in the figure below."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/3600/1*yeMJwjUyTHeajdiTdm-QPg.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What do all these diseases have in common? Their biological complexity; they are caused by multiple factors that can be very diverse across the population. Thus, the lack of a complete understanding of how they work makes it extremely hard to discover and develop drugs that fit for many patients. On the other hand, do pharmaceutical companies chose which disease to tackle only by their complexity? Probably, as mentioned above, they also take into account the number of people suffering from these conditions, which represents both the social impact of the disease itself and the market size for the drug. For example, the fact that, in 2018, 34.2 million US-citizens had diabetes, from which at least 90% of the cases correspond to type 2 diabetes may explain why most approved drugs are indicated for treating it. Especially for complex diseases, we expect to see these constant attempts to develop new and better drugs to enter a large market and be able to increase market share. It seems to be a win-win situation."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Out of curiosity, I further investigated what caused the peak in myocardial infarction drugs between 2005 and 2010.

Conversely, Accord, the second pharma with the highest approval rate, approved 16 drugs in only 7 years. But, most of them (15 out of 16) were generic, which implies fewer studies and requirements than developing a completely new medicine. These were two examples of two very different strategies: Novartis has fully opted for innovation while Accord has opted for manufacturing many generics while developing fewer new drugs."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Diversify or die, really?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "One common practice of venture capitalists is to diversify investments in order to spread the risk.

On the one side, finding new indications for approved drugs -also known as \u201cdrug repurposing\u201d- maximizes and recycles the resources spent to go from bench to bedside and allows to increase the pool of available treatments for many diseases, which can help to cope with disease co-morbidities and secondary effects. On the other side, in the case that a drug cannot be repurposed, most biotech companies may have to start over developing new drugs that tackle different diseases in order to stay in business. Consequently, instead of leveraging their expertise, they may \u201crepurpose\u201d their trained teams to focus on a new, different aim and lose part of the experience acquired in the previous therapeutic area."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Diversification might slow down the overall advances in drug development to fulfill the business requirements.
