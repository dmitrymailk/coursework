As statistics and data science \u2014 encompassing everything from machine learning and AI to the figures politicians state matter-of-factly to prove their point \u2014 expand rapidly, a 250-year-old divide on the fundamental nature of statistics is widening just as quickly."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The Bayesians and the Frequentists reflect different perspectives on the process of doing science. Because the dispute is so fundamental and split at the root of statistics and data science, controversy between the two school of thought break out in many places, from the world of A/B testing to social research to general figures (what\u2019s the average height in the US? You can\u2019t measure everyone). Broadly speaking, the 19th century was dominated by Bayesian statistics, whereas the 20th century was Frequentist. Where the 21st century lands on the Bayesian-Frequentist scale, with its exponentially rising demand for massive quantities of data to be sifted and processed, will see that view of statistics and data science amplified on a magnitude never imagined before."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Bayesian statistics is better-suited to using all information at its disposal to make rapid progress \u2014 in pursuing scientific progress, Bayesians tend to be more aggressive and optimistic in their modelling assumptions, sacrificing rigor in confirming the underlying premises of a model in order to give it more perspective (pulling in data from other sources). Frequentist data scientists, on the other hand, are more cautious and defensive, aiming for universally acceptable conclusions that will stand up to harsh adversarial scrutiny. The Frequentist model of science will sacrifice some gain that might be able to improve the model if it risks the academic and statistical integrity."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Often, the most clean-cut difference used to differentiate the two groups is the openness with which they accept new and external data, which may make the model more aware but also may flaunt or even violate the underlying assumptions of the model. Frequentists feel most comfortable using only data and the parameters of the current experiment, because it can be compared apples-to-apples, even if it does not give the model much perspective. Bayesians will attempt to include data from, say, different external experiments, which they argue will improve the model such that it doesn\u2019t matter if the data cannot be put on a strict apples-to-apples correspondence. A Bayesian method of thinking will constantly update a model or calculation with new information and data, whereas a Frequentist will settle for constant parameters."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This controversial comic pokes fun at the Frequentist\u2019s conservatism with the introducing of external data in the current experiment:"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/936/0*VNR3WcvyHLP9AkC9.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The current parameters of the experiment dictate that:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Given the parameters of the experiment, the Frequentist finds the p-value, a measure of how likely the experiment yielded false results (think 5 out of 100 patients in a clinical trial not supporting the hypothesis, the p-value is 0.05), to be less than 0.05. This p < 0.05 standard is so set in stone in the academic world that entire fields of p-hacking \u2014 distorting your results such that the p-value standard can be met and the study can be published in an academic journal \u2014 have grown tremendous popularity. Because the chance that the study\u2019s finding is a fluke is less than 0.05 and the neutrino detector declares that the sun has exploded, the Frequentist proclaims that the sun has indeed exploded! to which the Bayesian quips, \u201cBet you $50 it hasn\u2019t.\u201d (In reference to Bayesian scholar Bruno de Finetti, who extensively used bets in his thought experiments.)"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Of course, this is silly. The Frequentist doesn\u2019t factor in the fact that the probability of the sun exploding in the first place is extremely small \u2014 much, much smaller than 1/36 \u2014 meaning that, even when factoring in the 1/36 chance of lying, the sun still has a very small chance of exploding. In fact, the Bayesian equation, used to calculate the probability of an event occurring given another event is true, can be used in this scenario:"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/3134/1*B1TWceGesNpW_npqCyhHOQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the Bayesian equation and in Bayesian statistics, external information is fed in the form of a prior.

Every time you visit a website from a reasonably large company \u2014 Google and Microsoft, for example \u2014 you are probably engaged in dozens of A/B tests.
