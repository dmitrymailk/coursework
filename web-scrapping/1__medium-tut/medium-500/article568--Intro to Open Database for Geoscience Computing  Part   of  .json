They are so useful that people working in the energy industries (oil and gas, and geothermal) and in academia utilize these datasets to do benchmarking on their methodology, and also as reproducible teaching material for higher university students. At the same time, not all institutions have access to a wide range of industrial commercial software or applications for the computation and processing of these datasets. The purpose of this article is to introduce a tutorial on how to make the most of the available open databases."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I have compiled at least three massive open geoscience databases on the internet, which I believe everyone now could access them \u201cunder the same roof\u201d! Here are the three open geoscience databases."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Public geoscience Data is an open database available as a Google Drive, created by Peter Amstrand. This database contains a wide range of reproducible datasets, such as the seismic 3D data of Netherlands F3 and Canning projects, well-log files of North Sea projects compiled by GEOLINK, variety of geoscience images used for training and testing datasets in machine learning researches, and many more."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "SEG Wiki Open Data is a catalog of available open geophysical data owned by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG). This catalog contains more than 30 geophysical datasets, such as offshore and onshore seismic data and well-log files, the New Zealand 3D projects, geophysical synthetic benchmark models such as BP Benchmark Models, Marmousi Model, and KFUPM-KAUST Red Sea model, gravity-magnetic data, and topographic-bathymetric data."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Geothermal Data Repository or GDR OpenEI is an open geothermal energy data portal provided by the United States Department of Energy (DoE) and developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). As it is apparent for the name, this data portal mainly focuses on geothermal and hydrothermal exploration data, for instance, the FORGE Project data near Milford in Utah."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "What is Google Colab and Why to Use?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The use of Python as an open-source programming language enables people to develop a variety of powerful programs, as its utilization in geoscientific purposes is also inevitably very well recognized. Python programming language is also now becoming a \u201ccommunication language\u201d among developers. With no doubt, people with limited access to commercial software could develop their own programs using Python."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In addition, running in a cloud service is a seamless opportunity to increase efficiency in computing. One does not require to take up large space for memory in the local computer. Google Colaboratory (or Colab) is a research initiative of Google to make computing in Python possible in the cloud. The type of Python shell we are working in Google Colab is an IPython notebook."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This article consists of 3 tutorials, started from how to access the Public geoscience Data Google Drive, then how to unzip and open simple files, and finally how to access the SEG Wiki and GDR OpenEI directly from the website to Google Colab."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Tutorial 1: How to Access Public geoscience Data Google Drive"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Open the Google Drive Public geoscience Data link. Once you clicked the link, you will have a copy of that database stored in your Shared with Me directory. Your next move is to transfer Public geoscience Data from your Shared with Me directory to your My Drive. You may not know how to perform this action in Google Drive.

For instance, the report for images folder contains geoscience documents (in PDF and image format) published by the University of Stavanger and the University of Oslo. These documents should be very valuable for research references, but not for computations (seismic processing, well log analysis, et cetera). If you are curious about the content, here is the list that I made."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/2346/1*jx6AGPiHxVCaD5bF1tz-3Q.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In the above list, you find some folders contain ZIP folders and some simple files such as images in format PNG and JPG. In Tutorial 2 of this article, you will learn how to unzip files and open these images in Google Colab. However, the tutorial on how to access big files (which are the geoscience datasets) such as the seismic data SEGY or SGY and well-log data LAS files, won\u2019t be covered here since we require a very long discussion. But, don\u2019t worry, we will cover this up in the next Part 2 of this tutorial series. Later in Part 2, we will cover more exposure on Python codes."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After sorting out, hence, I have screened 6 folders that contain datasets, as follows:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Next, if you checked the detail of just one of the 6 folders, for instance in Canning 3D TDQ, you will find a seismic data file named canning3d_GDA94_UTM50s.sgy that has a file size of 103 gigabytes! You aren\u2019t surprised if you are in the oil and gas industry because in fact, normally does it so as most seismic data, the file size is way very large. It won\u2019t be a wise decision to download this very large seismic data on your local PC. That\u2019s why I introduce you to an effective way to open this file in Cloud. The Cloud service that I mentioned here is Google Colab."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "So now let\u2019s go to Google Colab. Visit this link to redirect you to Google Colab.
