The public sector entities that build and operate the world\u2019s roads, highways, and other public transportation networks are ravenous to hire data scientists with the skills to make sense of their voluminous data. Functional proficiency with the five skills described in this article will equip you to answer many of the questions that transportation agencies grapple with daily. Joining a department of transportation or metropolitan planning organization is a perfect entry-point for any new data scientist looking to apply her or his skills in service of the greater good."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Interested? Here are five essential skills you\u2019ll use as a data scientist supporting a transportation agency:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This article illustrates the application of these skills through an applied investigation of the relationship between roadway lighting and traffic safety in Pennsylvania. This example uses R, which provides an excellent workbench for many transportation questions thanks to its rich ecosystem of users and analytical packages."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "The Setup"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Suppose you\u2019re an analyst for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. The agency is weighing spending more of its annual roadway safety budget on installing highway lighting versus other safety improvements like guardrails. Your charge is to help answer the question: \u201cwhat impact does street lighting have on crashes?\u201d We investigate this question below."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You can download the code and follow along yourself by cloning the repository from: https://github.com/markegge/safety-demo/"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Data Preparation: GIS + Data Transformation"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Data analysis is almost always proceeded by data preparation to transform source data into a format suitable for analysis. This includes operations like deriving new attributes, joining tables, aggregation, and reshaping tables."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "R\u2019s data.table and dplyr packages are both powerful and versatile data transformation multi-tools. In this article, I use R\u2019s data.table package, which I prefer for its speed and concise syntax."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Safety analysis typically uses five years\u2019 worth of historic crash data. Accordingly, we begin by loading in five years of crash history from the Pennsylvania Crash Information clearinghouse:"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Because transportation describes the movement of people and goods through space, transportation data is often spatial. To work with spatial data you\u2019ll need to be familiar with basic GIS operations like buffering, dissolving, and joining, as well as reprojecting spatial data between Web Mercator, StatePlane, and UTM projections."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Projections are a way of mapping spatial data from a round planet onto a flat computer screen. Web maps typically display data with distances measured in degrees of latitude and degrees of longitude, using a projection called Web Mercator (EPSG:4326). Since the length of a degree of longitude varies with latitude, measuring, buffering, and intersection operations are typically performed in StatePlane or UTM projections that measure distances in feet or meters rather than degrees."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For this analysis, we\u2019ll use a spatial representation of Pennsylvania\u2019s highway road network provided by the Federal Highway Administration. Each roadway is divided into segments. To count the number of crashes per road segment, we buffer the road segments by 50' and then spatially join the crash points to the buffered lines."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In R, the sf package provides an interface for to the powerful GDAL spatial library, allowing the use of the same spatial functions in R that you may already be familiar with from working with PostGIS or Python."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The result looks like this:"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/4276/1*vq85dQTAw0cf6JoZxyrtOA.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Next, we\u2019ll tabulate our crash counts and join these results back to our spatial data.

Linear Regression with Ordinary Least Squares is the most common type of regression (for predicting continuous outcome variables with linear predictor relationships), but regression is actually a family of models with many different types and applications. Expanding your regression repertoire to include count models has many applications in a transportation context."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Statewide crash data is frequently modeled with Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) regression, which accounts for the probability that short or low traffic segments will have zero recorded crashes.

Lighting isn\u2019t installed at random, after all.

Don\u2019t expect your first inquiry to radically upend existing norms.
