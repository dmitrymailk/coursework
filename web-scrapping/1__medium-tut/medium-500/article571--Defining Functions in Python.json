First, we showed how to define a simple function that prints a string. corresponding to a book quote. Next, we discussed how to define a function that takes input values, manipulates the input, and return a value. Finally, we showed how to define a function that returns multiple values. I hope you found this post useful/interesting. The code in this post is available on GitHub. Thank you for reading!"}], "topic": "data-science"}
