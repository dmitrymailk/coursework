The endless possibilities to be comprehended before going down any road, all the mental calculations it performs regarding the rewards and the penalties that must be considered for achieving the best possible route to a decision. Yes, our brain, truly is a masterpiece and we\u2019ll discuss how we can teach our computer the art of decision making."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Decision Trees are a predictive tool in supervised learning for both classification and regression tasks. They are nowadays called as CART which stands for \u2018Classification And Regression Trees\u2019. The decision tree approach splits the dataset based on certain conditions at every step following an algorithm which is to traverse a tree-like graph from root to leaf. At every stage, the nodes of the tree represent the possible test cases for the problem and following along any edge of a node represents a possible solution."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/14826/0*BqSUHeLQVLDpH8kA"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Decision Trees"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Let\u2019s see what a decision tree looks like."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1752/1*nLKcNuEEN8vFto9paF2Acw.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The diagram illustrates a simple scenario of decision making wherein a person has to decide if he/she is eligible to cast a vote.

A person whose \u2018Employed?\u2019 column has a value of less than 0.5 but has a value greater than 0.5 in the \u2018Interned\u2019 column is hired.
