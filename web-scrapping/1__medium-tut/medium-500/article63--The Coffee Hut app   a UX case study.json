The UI also needs to be simple and clean with a straightforward user journey. Commuters often have lots of distractions around them.

The second design is what the user will see upon completing payment. This is a confirmation with an order number, the time of collection and the address. There is also a convenient map that the user can click on. I\u2019ve decided to put this within a box with a lighter blue background to make it stand out to the user.
