As University semesters come to a close, so will student tenancies; many within the next few weeks.

Minimal data on estranged and care experienced students is collected, but the challenges they face are well documented. At the end of a usual final year the transition from student to graduate can be fraught. These students are lacking the countless forms of support a family provides, on top of the monumental and chronic stress of potential homelessness mixed in with classic exam worries."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Alongside estranged and care experienced graduates will be others for whom coronavirus has thrown up a wall between them and the family home; those from other countries, or those with an at-risk parent, for example.

They called for a specific support package for students including a hardship fund totaling \u00a360m, and in addition, \u201can economic package for those who complete their qualifications during the current pandemic, providing access to a grant which can be used for training, reskilling or development.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As yet there has been no direct response to this call by the government. They did outline support to be provided to universities and students on May 4, and all but one of the ten measures outlined provided assistance to keep HE institutions afloat and running as usual. The single measure which directly addressed the financial needs of students themselves was permission given to universities to move money from elsewhere into existing hardship funds."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "However, the money released is from other essential services such as \u2018student premium funding\u2019, ringfenced for expanding access for disadvantaged students\u2019 entry into HE in the first place.

But this only seems to clarify that while there is minimal and questionable provision being made for students, there will be none for recent graduates. As May draws to a close and some of those at-risk young people cease to be students, where does the responsibility for supporting them lie?

The number of new claims increased by six times between mid-March and early May, seeing 2m new claimants. If graduates choose to apply, they will have to wait until the semester officially ends and they are no longer a registered student, at which point they\u2019ll quickly discover that built into the system is a five-week wait for the first payment."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The government has amended the amounts awarded with a slight annual increase, which works out at around an extra \u00a320 a week. They\u2019ve also abolished the need to physically attend the jobcentre for check-in appointments. But for single claimants under 25, the standard allowance remains at less than \u00a3350 per month, and the housing element does not cover average single room rent in most cities. This lack of provision is designed to encourage people to work alongside receiving benefits, of course."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 that many non-vocational course leavers, especially those who studied an arts subject, will go into the service industry while building a portfolio and contacts.
