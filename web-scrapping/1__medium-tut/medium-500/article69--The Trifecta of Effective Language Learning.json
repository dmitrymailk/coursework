Brown, a researcher of second language acquisition."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "By learning about the language learning process, paying attention to our own experience as language learners, and by constantly taking risks on our language learning journey that might reveal insights into our own language learning practice, we can begin developing our \u2018intuition\u2019 about how best to begin, and persist on one of the most awesome, enriching and rewarding journeys there is if I might say so myself."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The process of language learning is complex, as complex as the individual quirks of people who embark upon the journey of learning a new language, and as complex as the multitude of languages and language learning situations that people find themselves in around the world."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cEach language lesson is in some ways a unique drama\u201d one researcher writes, and understanding these \u2018unique dramas\u2019 that populate our lives as language learners is what, I think, makes both researching SLA and learning another language so fascinating, and inevitably a challenging but rewarding process of self-discovery."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Not just a technical feat but an expansion of perspective"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Learning another language isn\u2019t just about the acquisition of a new skill.

I thought it had vanished when I deleted my old blog, but lo and behold I recently discovered I had sneakily saved some of my writing from back then. My interest and research focus has shifted over the years from Second Language Acquisition to Environmental Communication. So, reading these essays again was like coming across a time capsule addressed to my future self, thanks pre-COVID-19/Trump-era-me! I hope those of you interested in the interface between language learning practice and theory find it interesting, although a tad bit dated. For clarity, I\u2019ve lightly edited this piece for typos, broken links, and formatting."}], "topic": "education"}
