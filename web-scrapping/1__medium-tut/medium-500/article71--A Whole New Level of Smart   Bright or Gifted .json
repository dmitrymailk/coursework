{"title": "A Whole New Level of Smart \u2014 Bright or Gifted?", "data": [{"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/3830/1*D5qzFF5mcUMJ21RZm8t_1A.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019ve been drifting towards the gifted subject for a while now. Mailny because the topic is something I come across in my filed of work a lot. I\u2019m very interested in the development of gifted and special children. I even chose this subject (developing children with special needs) as my field of study when getting my master\u2019s degree. While children with special needs get a lot of attention and support in the educational system, gifted kids are often overlooked."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "My other reason for this interest is more personal. As every normal parent I want to see talents in my kids. And while no one ability stands out my kids seem to be super smart by nature. I\u2019m not saying they are gifted but there\u2019s definitely potential. They always seem to be thinking outside the box. So that got me to thinking \u2013 where do you draw the line between a bright child and a gifted learner?"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Both bright and gifted kids are smart above average"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The main distinction between them is how they get their knowledge. According to Psychology Today a bright child knows the answers, but a gifted child asks more questions. And it\u2019s not because gifted children don\u2019t know the answers, it\u2019s because they need to know more. They have this internal need to go deeper with every subject that interests them. For instance, when we go out for a walk or read a book with my three-year-old she has hundreds of different questions. But when I ask her a question for a change, she thinks about it and usually says \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d with more follow-up questions. She does know the answer, but she wants to know if there could be more than one answer to every question. That\u2019s how she learns \u2014 she needs to go deep and thorough with every new subject."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Psychology Today says that bright kids are usually determined as great learners but they have to work hard to achieve this level. Gifted learners, much like their title, are gifted with intellectuality. They are smart by nature. Bright students need their teacher\u2019s support in order to learn and achieve a certain level of knowledge. They are often led by praise and good grades. In fact, they enjoy school and interacting with their peers. Gifted students are driven by inner motivation \u2014 they just want to know more and everything form every aspect. They are mentally absorbed in interesting subjects and are mostly self-eductaing. They make their own connections of how our world works. They still need adult guidance, in fact they prefer adults or older kids to their peers."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Some qualities of a gifted learner"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While every child is unique and every experience with a bright or a gifted learner is different, there are some traits that seem to stand out with a gifted one. Keep in mind that gifted learners are born with their gift so they will probably start standing out and advancing at a very young age. A gifted child could have several to many of these traits, and some that are not listed here."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Read more about these traits: We Have Kids or National Association for Gifted Children"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Supporting a gifted learner"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Being gifted is in the genes. It can\u2019t be learned or developed try as you might. If it\u2019s not in a person since birth one can\u2019t become gifted. But once you discover or reassure yourself that your child is indeed gifted, you have to give your best to develop this amazing trait. A child\u2019s extraordinary abilities need to be recognised and developed further. Developing in this case doesn\u2019t mean pushing towards academic success or learning dry facts. It\u2019s about broadening the child\u2019s mind and offering a variety of activities so they can grasp more information and experience things on their own. Simply put, let them think and explore outside the box."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "When gifted learners ask questions, they don\u2019t expect easy answers. Much like my toddler, a gifted learner needs explanations. And if your answer is not enough be ready for a lot of follow-up questions until the topic is completely researched. Some of these questions could be not age-appropriate but I\u2019ve decided to answer these questions as honestly and understandably as I can, keeping her age in mind, of course."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Sometimes gifted learners get bored. There could be several reasons, for instance the subject is too easy or the concept is already known to them. In this case they need extra stimulation or new ideas to think about. It is very crucial not to ignore a gifted child. Because a mind that great will probably come up with some sort of new activity that stimulates it. It doesn\u2019t matter if the activity is good or frowned upon as long as it\u2019s interesting to them. That\u2019s why some gifted kids are mistakenly called badly behaving. They misbehave because they are bored or not stimulated enough. Please keep in mind that not all gifted kids misbehave, and not all misbehaving kids are gifted."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Giftedness is something people are born with. Some kids are very smart but they have to work hard in order to learn new things and shine with knowledge. Gifted kids are born with their natural intelligence. They don\u2019t need to learn facts or follow academic curriculum. All they need to do is explore freely and experience the world around them and somehow they grasp every new thing very quickly. But they also need support, explanations and guidance. They need teachers and parents to be patient with them as they achieve new heights in knowledge. Having a gifted child is a blessing and a challenge all in one."}], "topic": "education"}
