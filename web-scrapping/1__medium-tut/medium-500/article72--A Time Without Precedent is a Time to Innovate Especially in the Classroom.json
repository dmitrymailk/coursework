Unreliable access to tech for students. Unstable schedules. Trying to adapt classroom lessons to a digital landscape. In many cases, teachers have been thrust into the situation without adequate warning or preparation. But like teachers do, they square their shoulders, plant their feet, and take to the task at hand."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "What many teachers are doing has never been done before. Digital learning in so many districts has previously been utilized as a band-aid to cover a small gap in learning due to a weather emergency without having to add days to the calendar. Lessons typically review previous material or offer skill drills. Perhaps there\u2019s a flipped-classroom model here and there (but those depend heavily on the in-class time with the teacher to complement the lecture vods)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Educators have been thrust into uncharted territory.

Everyone isn\u2019t using the same software or hardware, but the spirit of the work can translate to just about any platform. Consider how you can share your ideas organically with other educators outside your normal sphere of influence. Reddit threads? Blogs? Video diaries?

Years ago, when I was working to make writing more authentic in my classes, I changed the way my freshmen students wrote their film analysis essays. The format was boring and dry and showed that they weren\u2019t taking the work seriously, just going through the motions. So I had them examine film reviews from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, and students made Google Sites pages to share their writing, designed to look more like a film review than an analysis essay. They had to develop a rating system, mention (and link) actors to roles, credit source material for photos used."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And because the writing was posted online for their classmates (and the world!) to see, they wanted to make it look good. Students shared their tricks with each other for creative formatting and writing that would engage their peers. Those who finished earlier would act as mentors for the ones who still struggled.
