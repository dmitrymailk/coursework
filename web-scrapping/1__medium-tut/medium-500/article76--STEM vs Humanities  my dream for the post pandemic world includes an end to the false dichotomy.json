{"title": "STEM vs Humanities: my dream for the post-pandemic world includes an end to the false dichotomy", "data": [{"type": "sentence", "content": "Successful pandemic response strategies show we need both to survive in an ever-changing world.

I found a copy of that letter while moving house \u2014 clearly not my best piece of literary non-fiction, but not bad for an angsty teenager."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I told a professor of philosophy that, many years later, and he laughed \u2014 \u201cthat sounds like something we\u2019d ask at our philosophy exam\u201d."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I \u201cgrew up\u201d and married a writer. I found myself failing at making small talk at some of my husband\u2019s parties. Before I got married, good friends used to invite me to parties just so I could help make guests who didn\u2019t know anyone else feel at ease. So maybe I got boring after marriage (I wouldn\u2019t be the first person accused of that). But I have another, unproven theory \u2014 my sixth sense tells me that many of my husband\u2019s \u201cartist\u201d friends found a physician too boring to speak to, since I make a living out of writing prescriptions, not poetry."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Back to the issue of the false dichotomy of STEM vs the humanities: if we are to indulge ourselves in conspiracy theories, somewhere along the journey of knowledge, someone decided to \u201cdivide and rule\u201d. That someone must have realized, the surest way to dumb down thinkers, was to have them believe they had to choose between the \u201csciences\u201d and the \u201chumanities\u201d, and then forever spend the rest of their lives trying to prove to the other that their choice was the superior one of the two."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The Greeks defined the liberal arts as including aspects of both the humanities and STEM \u2014 the three arts of the trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and the quadrivium (geometry, arithmetic, astronomy and music).

Yet, when Charlotte Bronte worked as a governess and wrote the role into her novels (Jane Eyre, 1847), we don\u2019t hear of a family hiring two governesses, one for \u201cSTEM\u201d and the other for \u201chumanities\u201d. Knowledge was knowledge."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A quick look at another civilization, the Chinese for example, suggests that the divide, arbitrary though it may still have been, was between the \u201cthinkers\u201d and the \u201cathlete/fighters\u201d. Those who are able in both were lauded for being so. Nowhere was it ever assumed, that a thinker could not be a fighter, or vice versa (generals in war were applauded for strategy as much as their ability to shoot straight)."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Reading the biography of Santiago Ramon y Cajal (Nobel Prize 1906), the antagonism between the \u201csciences\u201d and the \u201chumanities\u201d might have already begun, at least in the \u201cWestern\u201d world. Cajal, the father of neuroscience, was an artist before attending medical school. His father, an anatomy teacher, did not approve of his son\u2019s passion for art."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "And yet, it was the ability to draw that enabled Cajal to convey to other scientists what he saw under the microscope (no screenshot technology at the time). He showed how one cell signaled another, and how these, in turn, became complex networks, eventually forming the brain and nervous system, connected throughout the human body. Just as knowledge \u2014 be it the humanities, science, technology, mathematics \u2014 are intertwined and interconnected."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The acronym \u201cSTEM\u201d appeared earlier this century, when educationists were worried that students were doing poorly in these subjects. Now, we see the pushback from other parts of the education community, aware that science cannot live alone. Beyond the choruses of \u201cWhy STEM is not enough\u201d and the recognition of the need to be \u201cinclusive\u201d of the humanities, perhaps we should go one step further \u2014 to recognize and appreciate that all knowledge, of all colors and kinds, go together, often in ways that do not have well-defined boundaries. Instead of falling into the trap of pigeon-holing our minds and our thinkers \u2014 we should revel in the grey zones between the domains of knowledge, such that they (and we) are not competing for attention, but co-existing, cross-pollinating, and symbiotic."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/3588/1*bUqpP6igoi0pDtqTRx-Exg.jpeg"}], "topic": "education"}
