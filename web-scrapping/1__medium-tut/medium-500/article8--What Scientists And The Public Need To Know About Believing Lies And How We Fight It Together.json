That\u2019s a word you could use to describe how many scientists are feeling under the current plague of conspiracy theories and snake oil cures."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The belief that the problem comes from a lack of science literacy hurts both scientists and society.

With little evidence, many believed/believe (I was once among them) that not understanding science drives people to do or support things for which we have no evidence. It should be clear to us, from this example alone, that intellect and education offer little protection against mistaking personal impressions for a fact."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The premise also meant assuming those who knew less would trust scientists less, but studies haven\u2019t found that. Though it may not feel like it, public trust in scientists is high, especially compared to politicians who they report distrusting most. We\u2019ve got that going for us."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1460/1*5NYv-X0nnDawEP9VVkRjpw.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "That all makes sense until you realize that our actions show that our views roughly follow the respective political parties.

Opinion, and what changes it, reveals clues about what besides reality affects how we feel and respond. The 2008 market crash provoked a universally negative view of the economy. That seems fair."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The negative view persisted for Republicans even after the economy had improved. Then, their positive outlook shot skyward when a Republican took office. This suggests that their favorable views are responding to something other than the market."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1692/1*uNCKwX6sEaWPMDBJNXvWBQ.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Democrats' positive outlook fell when their opposing party took office.

Opinions mirrored one another in the past, with a gap between attributable to personal bias. The responses said that both parties were reacting to the same situation, either magnified or diminished depending on the view. The deepening split and opposing responses of today say we are no longer responding to the same reality."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "At least that seems more likely than that we quickly embraced diametrically opposing values. The opinion shifts appear in response to the leadership change. Economy and wages have not changed so strikingly as to warrant the large swings in opinion and the timing is wrong for it to be in response to the actual economy."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*u_w6lU_WzPMufUGYKEHkng.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "While the GDP has risen, the average hourly wage dipped before returning to just below the place where it started. It\u2019s possible more money was coming into the US economy, but the average person was making less per hour.

Can people know themselves that poorly?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT OPINIONS AND BELIEFSWe want to believe whatever falls in-line with those around us, a harmonious existence. Motivated reasoning results. Instead of starting with evidence and drawing a conclusion, we do it backward."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We take something we want or that we think may be true and support it with things we think are evidence \u2014 but often, the \u201cevidence\u201d is less proof and more imagination.

Donald Trump about climate science."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "If you voted for someone who commits a crime or betrays your trust, there is little motivation to see the truth.

You\u2019re sitting at Thanksgiving dinner and a distant uncle espouses extreme political ideas and you just shove more potatoes in your mouth. It\u2019s not worth it.

Oh, how I wish that were real."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Often in a debate, I ask why someone arrived at their belief. If they know something I don\u2019t, I should want to know \u2014 that is, if I\u2019m concerned with the truth. Asking why must be exceptionally rare because it catches people off-guard.
