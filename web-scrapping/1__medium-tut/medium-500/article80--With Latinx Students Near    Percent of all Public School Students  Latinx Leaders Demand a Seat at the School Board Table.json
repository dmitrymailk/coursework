Districts should also create more options that fit the needs of Latinx students, such as specialized schools for recent immigrants, dual-language immersion schools, and career-tech high schools.

We\u2019ve got to trust that educators can make those decisions, and at the same time, we have to hold them accountable."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWe need to trust principals to hire their team. We need to trust that principals can be instructional leaders, who should have the autonomy to help others move out if they are not meeting the goals and vision of the school. In addition to hiring and firing their staff, we need to make sure principals are able to determine what resources are used where, with a very clear delineation that the kids who most need those resources get those resources. So we need to make sure that the money is being budgeted with an equity lens, that more of the money is going to kids who are furthest from opportunity. And we need to make sure that there is transparency and accountability about that money.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Martinez emphasized that schools should be made accountable to parents. \u201cWe\u2018re big on accountability,\u201d Martinez explained, also in a follow-up interview. \u201cAccountability means that the customers and the customer service are based on facts and decisions are based on facts and figures. The customers are the kids and their parents, and the customer service is the teachers and principals. The customer service in so many of these schools is horrible; parents are treated like dirt.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Marquez noted that accountability to parents can be made real by giving them the right to move their children to a better public school if they are not satisfied. \u201cThey deserve the same opportunity to choose a school for their children that upper income people have,\u201d she said."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "She added that parents should have the option of choosing public charter schools if they prefer them. \u201cLatino families like the autonomy\u201d charters have, she noted. \u201cLatino families like the respect they get as customers\u201d who can choose what\u2019s best for their children."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But none of this will simply be given to Latinx families, Marquez and the others noted. Cinto Ramos, who described himself as \u201cthat pissed off parent who ran for the school board,\u201d said Latinx leaders have not yet figured out how to mobilize their community to embrace its power.

And love without power is sentimental and anemic.\u201d"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "\u201cWe must lift our people into positions of power to fight for our children,\u201d Marquez added. \u201cOften those in power don\u2019t want to hear from black and brown moms \u2014 and surely don\u2019t want to give them any power. So we are raising our voices to them. We\u2019re going to continue to push you, to embarrass you, to love on you, whatever it takes to make sure our kids get what they need.
