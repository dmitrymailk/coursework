There is a constant push in our society for assimilation into the dominant culture. The current educational system doesn\u2019t offer a place for kids that do not fit into that culture, especially those that are repressed because of socioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender identity, learning styles, or because they choose not to conform. Often these young people are pushed out of the school system \u2014 negatively impacting their identities and their long-term quality of life."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A democratic classroom offers a different framework for approaching education, one which fosters community and embraces inclusion. Working towards eliminating the educational and societal disparities is a highly politicized undertaking; initially, I did not center my work in the context of democracy. However, I was deeply perturbed by the re-segregation of schools in the US, over-identification of youths of color for Special Education, and they\u2019re under-identified for Talented and Gifted programs. I am also concerned by the cutbacks (and elimination) of arts programs since we know they have a positive impact on academic, social, and emotional development."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/1*RpiL5b4Z9ONZ9WosE5uY4g.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Almost a decade ago, while researching alternative education, I was encouraged to take a graduate course on the philosophy behind a democratic classroom.

I was often met with fear and reluctance because it means a radical paradigm shift in the way we think about learning.

They have a say in the rules, what is studied, and how learning takes place. Students have a stake in their classes \u2014 and this often translates to them being more engaged in their communities. All students have an equitable opportunity for participation. The multiple perspectives shared between students and teachers become the glue that holds the learning environment together.
