Although I went to school and grew up in Germany, I speak Chinese like a native without any accents. Growing up, I was friends with some children whose parents were both Chinese. Today, most of them and other bilinguals I know, who grew up mainly in Germany like I did, aren\u2019t nearly as sufficient in Chinese as I am. From personal experience, here is what my parents did differently. They have saved me years of actively learning my language of origin."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Our goal is to make the child identify with both cultures and languages, which is why many cultural aspects are included here as well (This is a must, or you might fail!)."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "One Parent \u2014 One Language"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As my dad is a German native, he always spoke German to me, although he can understand and speak Mandarin himself. My mother, the Chinese blood, stuck to only speaking Chinese with me, although she was sufficient in German. Here comes the difficult part that I need to stress for you to understand."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Whenever my mother spoke Chinese to me, I would answer in German. She could say anything, and I would not speak Chinese to her. I cannot even remember why, but it turns out that this is quite common. She was the only person in my environment to speak that language, and I knew that she could speak German, so I didn\u2019t bother answering in Chinese. So, she had to do all the work."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Cooking, doing the household, changing diapers, she would always repetitively teach us Chinese vocabulary.

This is important, because the sufficiency of a language does not suffice if you want your child to also be able to live in the other country sooner or later. For cultures which are vastly different, like China and Germany, this is particularly important also because you need to normalize the language and its practises. Asian children will often face racism and stigmata. For them to not feel ashamed, you need to normalize what feels foreign to the social environment. When Asians smack, most people are disgusted by it. If your child isn\u2019t, you know you have done a damn good job raising it bilingually. For this cultural part, language can be a prerequisite, but plays a small role. Rather, it is about the excitement when Chinese New Year comes up, the understanding of why wearing white is mostly socially inacceptable."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Only by living your culture, your child will identify with it. Otherwise, it will only ever have a foreign language in mind \u2014 and connect it to all the bad experiences that will come with the bilingual being, which brings us to the next point."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/11536/0*xcruohESAoi5BFof"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Avoid Black and White Thinking"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We want our child to belong 100% to both of its cultures. For cultures with high cultural distance, this is nearly impossible. For example, for me, the Chinese policies and moral often meets disapproval in Germany \u2014 which puts me into awkward situations where I feel pushed to justify my homeland. Wherever you go, with different cultures, your child will always have to live between them, where there is no land to stand on."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You need to compensate the cultural differences and clashes for your child not to feel lonely, isolated, foreign, or to even turn against their own origin for the sake of belonging somewhere. I saw a girl, 9, hate her Chinese mom who has done everything for her. Today, she just turned 14, and she is still ignoring her Chinese origin. Although Germany has become a mixture of many cultures recently, cultural distance and clashes are hard to overcome. Avoid generalizing that holidays, like Chirstmas, are bad or useless because that takes away the sparkle. Let your child choose a birthday cake although your culture has other traditions \u2014 let your child experience both and don\u2019t judge which practise is better."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Bilingual people live in no man\u2019s land. They are sliding between two cultures. Don\u2019t make them turn their back to one of them.

Your child will be confronted with all the differences soon enough."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "They know about the views and values of each culture and they will realize how different they are soon enough."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Please be open minded in a way that you don\u2019t force your child to think in a certain way.

If there are two very different languages with characters of likewise, you have to teach your child to read and write parallel when they to go elementary school. For example, Chinese people can distinguish characters written from a native and a language learner at first sight. For them to be good writers, they have to grow up writing characters. Here, I allow you to force your child, I allow you to sit down to them to practise \u2014 at least once a week, best would be every day \u2014 just to let them watch you write characters."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Give them an idea of how the other language is written \u2014 they need to feel the language on paper.

For example, if a mother wants her son to make a doctors degree, the son might argue against her wishes without attempting to understand her mothers\u2019 wish. Ultimately, teenagers and adults who are bilingual have to make their own decisions \u2014 but if the cultural understanding lacks, missing soft skills will make conversations feel like a dangerous fight between fire and water, in which one of them will die \u2014 making the other one feel no less miserable in the long term."}], "topic": "education"}
