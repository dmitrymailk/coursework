I got as far as putting all of my information in but stopped at the point where I input my credit card information. Part of me already regrets the decision, but the other part of me knows that it was the right move for me right now."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This particular online course is only available once a year, which of course makes the FOMO very strong \u2014 a shrewd marketing choice on their part. It\u2019s also written and sold by some huge names in the copy & marketing industries. They make some big money-making claims that I completely buy into."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "But I\u2019ve already taken two other online writing classes, one in building a copywriting business and one in the basics of food writing. Is another online course really what I need right now? In the end, this is why I decided not to buy the course, and what I plan to do instead."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Why I didn\u2019t buy it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The first reason I didn\u2019t buy it has absolutely nothing to do with writing. It\u2019s that this year I was given the incredible gift of being completely consumer debt-free. I still have student loans that I can live with, but the credit card debt and loans were ruining my life and destroying my future. I don\u2019t want anything to do with that kind of spending again, ever. Even the offer of a payment plan, $150 per month for 10 months on my debit card, is treading into deep water for me. Breaking the spending mindset has been a years-long struggle for me that I finally feel like I\u2019m on the up-side of. If I can\u2019t afford to pay for it straight-out, I can\u2019t afford it."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Like 38 million other people in the US right now, I\u2019ve also lost my job due to the Coronavirus pandemic. All things considered, I\u2019m very lucky. I was able to get unemployment early. I have a small padding in my savings account. My family is supportive both emotionally and financially. But even with all of those factors, now really isn\u2019t the time for me to drop two months\u2019 worth of rent on an online course. The future is so uncertain, and I may need to pay rent with that cash here soon."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Even with the financial factors, I may have been convinced to buy the course had it not been for one HUGE fact. Facing this fact head-on wasn\u2019t easy, but the hard truth of it helped put everything in perspective."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The fact is, if I want my copy and food writing to get better, I need to be doing more writing. I need to commit to sitting down every day to write. I need to read more writers who are doing what I want to be doing. I have to put in the work. Buying another writing course would help in some ways, but learning is not the same as doing. Now is the time to write. I can go back and refine my work after I\u2019ve gotten some words on the page."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I\u2019m looking forward to making a full-time career out of my writing. As I grappled with the choice to sign up for the course, I weighed the options. Sitting down to write today is free. It also gets me a step closer to making a living from writing. Buying a course will immediately cost me money, and there\u2019s no guarantee that I\u2019ll make any money from what I\u2019ve learned (although I have confidence that the instructors of this particular course are incredibly knowledgeable.)"}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/11520/0*7nGjFtUp5eHqorD3"}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "This is what I\u2019m going to do instead."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After closing the very attractive landing page and emotionally walking away, I decided that just because I didn\u2019t buy the class didn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t find other ways to grow as a writer. Given the budget of $150 a month, how many books could I buy? How many magazines could I subscribe to? How many meals could I afford to have and write about? How many ingredients for recipes could I buy?"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "After all, I\u2019m a pastry chef who wasn\u2019t trained in a traditional cooking school.

But there\u2019s such a variety of experts out there, so I can choose the resources that inspire me.

A few months ago I signed up for a subscription to Bon Appetite magazine for about $15, which included a cute canvas grocery tote. Some independent publications cost more, about $15 an issue, but that\u2019s still a reasonable addition to my budget. The same idea applies to online newspaper subscriptions.

But it\u2019ll happen again one day. In the meantime, I can continue to order satisfying and diverse foods right from my couch. It\u2019s the incredible blessing of living in Queens that I\u2019m surrounded by a world of food. Not to mention the economic contribution of supporting local restaurants during our nationwide economic collapse.

I don\u2019t have much pantry space (or counter space for that matter), so I only keep staples on hand.
