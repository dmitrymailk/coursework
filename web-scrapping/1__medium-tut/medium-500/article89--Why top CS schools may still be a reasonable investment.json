The online programs I have seen give you a single track path of education. The most valuable pieces of higher education are the people you meet and the ability to work in teams. I call this the CS network effect \u2014 there are no positions where building alone is the optimal path."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Software engineering positions are all about sharing code snippets, building together, and profiting from the marginal scaling of digital work.

The schools have the means to accommodate students and evolve their programs. The investments (of the endowments) will continue to make money. None of Berkeley, MIT, Stanford, CMU, etc. are at risk of not existing, and they\u2019ll be moving slowly and deliberately to improve their education systems. They will continue to attempt to deliver value to their students. I expect the fall to continue to innovate. This section is mostly conjecture, but virtual education over a sustained period of time is an existential threat to universities, and that drives change."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "For example, I watched the course staff for Intro to AI at UC Berkeley make an online test tool with randomization and multiple anti-cheating measures.

After paying $30k a semester, going to a big university will give you a lot of overhead in little deliverables, planning years and fulfilling varied degree requirements, dealing with outdated practices, and more.

Paying to do logistics seems backward."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The people.
