They are more inclined to use social media to get information. Besides, social media firms have all taken action to ensure reliable sources of information on COVID-19 are promoted high on their sites and atop searches and user feeds. The platforms have also been used for campaigns such as #IamNOTAVIRUS which have sought to counter racist narratives as well as empower those who have faced abuse.

Many students\u2019 parents complained about lacking enough literacy resources and methods to support their children\u2019s literacy and identity development at home.

The purpose of our book club is to support Columbia local Asian American immigrant children to develop their balanced bicultural identities through reading, sharing, and discussing culturally relevant children\u2019s literature in a local Book Club. Working as the Chinese language volunteer teacher in the Chinese Heritage School for over two years, I deeply realized the importance of being immersed in two cultures \u2014 American local culture and their heritage culture. Besides learning Mandarin Chinese or any native languages, the Asian American children also need to be exposed positively to their home culture. With the desire to provide immigrant children another space and appropriate children\u2019s literature to help them renegotiate with their bicultural identity, my husband and I decided to set up the \u201cAsian American Book Club\u201d in the UofSC Chinese Heritage School at the beginning of 2019 and have regular book club meetings every Sunday afternoon. As the leading facilitator, I scaffold Asian American children through reading Asian American historical narratives which empower children in keeping with the operation and function of their own culture \u2014 that of the children and ethnicity \u2014 within American history. Through sharing Asian American historical narratives with them weekly, we provide Asian American immigrant children another space to negotiate their bicultural identities."}, {"type": "subtitle", "content": "Literacy resources to help Asian American children deal with the pandemic."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1680/1*ZojhwfYOV4_UpAlE7_J9IA.png"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "A new story book that aims to help children understand and come to terms with COVID-19 has been produced by a collaboration of more than 50 organizations working in the humanitarian sector, including the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and Save the Children."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "With the help of a fantasy creature, \u201cMy Hero is You, How kids can fight COVID-19!\u201d explains how children can protect themselves, their families and friends from coronavirus and how to manage difficult emotions when confronted with a new and rapidly changing reality."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Related: My Hero is You, How kids can fight COVID-19! is written in Chinese, English and more than 30 other languages in order to reach as many children as possible."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Related: Read-aloud by well-known artist, Howard Donald"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "2.
