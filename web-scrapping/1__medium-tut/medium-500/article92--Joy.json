We might argue that a \u2018traditional\u2019 school, even for the students who say they love and do well in it, is a process of limiting learning and an interference in the learning of life skills. And, joy is often very hard to find. It also limits curiosity, and curiosity is not just the essential ingredient in childhood and adolescence, but a huge component of joy as well. Trying something and getting it for the first time is always joyful \u2014 and it is always the cognitive reward for being curious."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/3628/1*HX2TkOVsjiLN8JeZ6BbFtw.jpeg"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I think about scenes of joy."}, {"type": "image", "content": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1864/0*rz2w5i148xBg1Rr3"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "We\u2019re not alone.
