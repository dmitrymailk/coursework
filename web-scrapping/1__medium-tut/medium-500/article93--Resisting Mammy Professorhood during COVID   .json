Like many academics managing the latter part of this past semester, I found myself dealing with the perfect concoction of uncharted territory, fear, anxiety, chaos, and extreme stress levels that are a part of the mess that the COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly brought to college campuses nationwide."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "In a motivating attempt, administrators at my university have encouraged faculty to lead with agility and grace. Although I agree with this well-intentioned recommendation, it does not take into consideration how the expectation of leading with grace and compassion shows up differently depending on racial and gender variables."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I, along with countless other women of color academics, bear the most severe emotional cost of this rallying cry."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Rather than demonstrating reciprocal grace, COVID-19 amplified some of my students\u2019 and colleagues\u2019 need to \u201cmammy\u201d me."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "Like the house slave figure romanticized in the White imagination, as a Black woman, I am expected to be unconditionally nurturing, understanding, hardworking, and mothering without an ounce of regard for my humanity or my emotional and mental health boundaries. This historical archetype constantly shows up when Black women insert themselves in predominantly White spaces."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the mammification that already existed in my role as a Black woman in academia.

As much as academics claim they don\u2019t take comments of this nature personally, I did."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "These less-than-positive experiences became so common that it took a grave emotional toll on me.

Yet, there is no just excuse for abuse."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "This \u201cadvice\u201d felt like sand slipping through my hands. They wanted me to build something with this advice but I couldn\u2019t grasp it, I couldn\u2019t do anything with it, and its fleeting nature was beyond disappointing. Moreover, the advice made me feel how I do when I receive general advice adorned with toxic positivity, which I have a particular aversion toward."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "I felt like a parental figure contained in this box of how I was supposed to respond to students a.k.a. my academic children and even some of my colleagues.

Because of this intimate interaction, women of color academics may have a more complete understanding of the student experience than their counterparts."}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "As Dr. Whitaker goes on to explain in her article, \u201ccompared to our White counterparts, women of color are held to different standards.
