I\u2019m a broken record in my classroom when I say it, but it\u2019s true, we gotta laugh to keep from cryin\u2019. Iyanla Vanzant says to hug each other, because if we don\u2019t hug each other, we\u2019ll get ugly. That\u2019s true, too. Yet, we are fighting the ugly and creating new ways to virtually hug up on each other because we miss each other. We miss touch. We miss connecting through eyes. Still and all, the emotions are there, yet we figured out a Band-Aid for the meantime, in between time, that ensures our connection endures.

And after you\u2019ve sat with it, you\u2019re either casting it away or using it as your amulet.

You\u2019ve been launched into a spinning spiral it may seem, yet you are still closer to your dreams. This is not a dream deferred; it is just different than you imagined. Your Senior Week looks differently, you\u2019ve danced to DJ D-Nice, Doja Cat, and Dua Lipa in your makeshift living room proms, and the day of pomp and circumstance with boisterously proud family members shouting your name with blasting horns from the rafters, no matter the annoyed gazes, is not your exact story, but perhaps\u2026"}, {"type": "sentence", "content": "You\u2019ve got something else \u2014 a story to tell, a mythology, a tale of endurance, a hero\u2019s journey, your golden goblet and fleece, and a piece of history \u2014 that will last you a lifetime.
